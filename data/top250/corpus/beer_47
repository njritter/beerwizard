L: Pitch black all around. Small light tan head with no lacing, but does leave a thin ring.
S: When you can smell the barrel from four feet away, you know its powerful. Lots of dark dried fruits and roasted malts as well. A very very small amount of alcohol does waft in. 
T: Bourbon barrel, but more restrained than you would get from nose. Lots of dark fruit and sweetness, like molasses. Malt, flaked oats, and bourbon heat on back end. Heat pretty well managed.
F: More medium than full-bodied, which surprised me. Might do well with more aging. Not much in the way of carbonation. Construction is fantastic, balance very strong..
O: Fantastic RIS. 710 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jun 19, 2017

Pours a deep brown, light mocha head. Smells of huge bourbon, roasted coffee, deep bakers chocolate and roasted malts. Tastes follows with the same bourbon heat on the back end, preceded by dark roast coffee, chocolate; deep dark fruit flavors; licorice. A seriously delicious beer, glad I had a bottle, even at $12 an ounce it's worth a grab if available. Wish I would have grabbed more bottles. 433 charactersBrewsOverHoes, Jun 15, 2017

Taste like the candy bar Caramello. It is very sweet. Firestone knows how to barrel age thats for sure.

The smoothness and roastiness of an excellently crafted imperial stout with the flavor complexity as a result of being mellowed in a blend of barrels formely holding world class bourbon. Oak, toffee, toasted coconut, earthy spice combines with bitter chocolate, coffee (from the roasted malt), charred grains with a little molasses on the backend. Bitter, sweet, roasty, oaky all at once - this is one to behold. Silky smooth with a creamy mouthfeel throughout. Warmth not heat from the ABV. World class. 627 charactersManapuaMan, May 28, 2017

A: This legendary barrel-aged imperial stout is one half of the duo that built one of the most highly-regarded barrel-aging programs in the country (Sucaba being the other half). Interestingly, Parabola pours a very dark brown like black coffee rather than the pitch black one associates with BA stouts. A khaki head of about a finger forms on a hard pour, but it does not hang around long. Lacing is spotty but alcohol legs are evident. Viscosity appears rather low for the style. This is not the picture one would find in the style guide next to "barrel-aged imperial stout." 3.25/5
A: The nose does not show much nuance, at least when cold. Bourbon dominates with sweetness, cherries, caramel, toasted coconut, and a fair bit of alcohol heat. Milk chocolate flecked with vanilla is the only real hint of the base beer initially. As it warms, the balance somehow becomes slightly worse, with the bourbon nearly edging the beer completely out of the picture. Spicy whiskey, oak, and again toasted coconut are prevalent. It is nice but shows little deftness or subtlety. 3.5/5
T: The taste does come close to saving this now-legendary beer, but it still does not totally deliver on the hype. There is more chocolate here along with a dark breadiness that is rare in stouts, but overall this is still a barrel showcase. There is a bit of brownie batter and elements of cocoa, as well as some smokiness that creeps in late. It is all well and good that spicy-sweet bourbon steals the show, highlighted by vanilla, toasted coconut, and surprising amounts of cherry, but at the expense of the base beer it is hardly laudable. Umami plays a tertiary role, which adds a bit of depth. The amount of fruity character is novel, pointing more towards Russian Imperial Stout than its American counterpart. BA RISs are surprisingly not all that common, so this is welcome in that respect, but the balance between barrel and beer is still a fair bit off the mark. 4.25/5
M: Here is perhaps the greatest misstep in the form of a rather thin body combined with very obvious heat. There is an oily slickness present as well, which does nothing to improve the situation. It is not thick enough to really impress, but it is not dry enough or low enough in alcohol to match the thinness. It is serviceable but not optimal in any sense. 3/5
O: While this was once a beer I held in high esteem, it seems that Parabola is no longer what I thought it was. Certainly it is a solid, even good beer, perhaps even very good, but it is a far cry from greatness. Little to nothing about this beer has not been eclipsed at this point, and though there is something to be said about the pillar of style that this beer is perceived as, it seems to be resting on its laurels. I do really enjoy the RIS aspects, but they are pushed so far to one side by the barrel that it is almost negligible. Bourbon County is still superior in every way to almost any BA stout, so Parabola should be given little leeway despite its historical significance and name recognition. It is enjoyable, certainly, but it does not deserve to be held up as a paragon of the style, and the mouthfeel is really a huge letdown. Pair with Dream Theater's "Octavarium," an album that many will cite as important, yet it broke next to no new ground and is easily eclipsed by contemporaries as well as those that came after. 3.5/5 3,404 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, May 16, 2017

Aroma of roasted malt, coffee, whiskey, vanilla, dark fruit, almonds, chocolate. Roasty and nutty overall.
Tastes of roasted malt, light coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, whiskey, oak, almond, toffee, caramel, cola. Light sweetness, lingering char bitterness.
Feel is a bit thin for my liking and carbonation is a little low, warming alcohol, between sweet and dry.
Overall it's a tasty BA RIS, and smells great, but it's just too thin for its huge character, doesn't need to be sweet or syrupy just fuller. And it could use a boost in appearance as well. 713 charactersHoppy_Time, May 11, 2017

I knew right away after pouring this beer that it wasn't going to live up to the hype. It's dark, sure, but it lacks that motor-oil appearance I look for in a really good russian imperial stout. Light escaped around the edges and gave it a cola appearance in those places. 
Smell was mostly bourbon and dark malts. A little chocolate and coffee, with burnt nuts at the end of the nose. 
Taste was bourbon and roasted malts. I didn't get much depth. 
Feel is where it went South for me. This is way too thin, in my opinion, to be a world class RIS. Maybe it's because this batch was brewed off site?
Overall I don't get the hype. It's a good RIS, but I don't feel like it warrants the accolades it has collected. Maybe I'm missing something, or maybe it's just not in my taste range. Glad I got to try it though. 875 charactersbmrattay, May 01, 2017

Appearance is dark - hard to say more - it was dark out except for the campfire!  Smell is beautiful with dark fruits, chocolate, dark brown sugar and bourbon.  Taste is just delicious, with flavors of chocolate and bourbon perfectly blended and just the right amount of soft bitterness on the finish.  The mouth feel is perfect....medium-full, not overly viscous, adequately carbed, sweet but not even close to cloying.  Overall, a truly wonderful stout. 498 charactersFFreak, Apr 24, 2017

Aromas are tons of sweet bourbon and chocolate with deep roasted malt.
Flavor is perfection. Tons of bourbon, tons of chocolate with some coffee bitterness in the finish.

4.62/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52017 Vintage.  Been wanting this for a long time.  14.5% for this year's version.  Brewed, barrel aged, and bottled in collar. With Boulevard in KC, MO.
Color is lighter than I expected during the pour.  Light cola colored, light tan one finger head dissipates quickly.  Nearly opaque in the glass.
Deep roast malts and prominent charred wood initial smell.  Vanilla and chocolate as well, faint coffee.  Little in way of fruits but I'd rather my stouts carry what I'm picking up now than the fruit.
Taste carries with deep charred wood and hefty on the vanilla flavors.  Some chocolate but I think the barrel wood and vanilla dominate, but the subtle whisky booze carries nicely thru.  More booziness as it warms some along with roasted coffee bitterness.  Fairly complex flavor profile.
Feel is a full medium body, but wouldn't say it's "thick" and lower side of medium carbonation.  Was thinking it be a bit more slick and viscous and less carbonated.  A touch of alcohol burn but Doesn't detract from anything.
Glad to finally give this one a try.  It's a bit lighter than I expected for such a big beer but array of flavors more than make up for that. Got 3 more and looking forward to trying a few with some time on them. 1,232 charactershopflyer, Apr 23, 2017

Looks like dark fudge in a glass and sticks to the glass with some serious alcohol legs. Smell is dark fruit, chocolate and barrel character. Taste follows nose with addition of vanilla and bourbon from the barrels and the flavor really evolves as it warms. Mouthfeel is thick and sludgy. Great beer that I'm glad I finally got to try. I managed to get a second bottle which I'm going to cellar for a year or two. Can't wait to see how it changes. 501 charactersjcoleMA66, Apr 22, 2017

The beer pours a nice creamy tan head that dissipates fairly quickly while leaving a nice ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself  is a nice dark chocolate black with a nice, shiny, and slick looking surface. It definitely looks like it drinks smoothly.
The smell is pretty good. The taste is better than the smell but it isn't without its charm. The smell seems to have a stronger coffee note mixed in the bourbon along with a decent char note and some nice fire from the alcohol.
The taste is fantastic. It has a nice blend of barrel aged beers whose notes mix fantastically with the beer notes. The stronger notes tend to come from the barrel notes but only barely. The beer notes tend to fall more towards the sweet dark chocolate notes and a very light roasted malt note and hop bitterness in the finish. The barrel notes are sweet with a good bourbon in the finish. The charred oak is definitely there but it's hard to identify it. There is also a good vanilla note that makes itself known by peeking through the chocolate.
The feel is pretty good. It's a heavy bodied beer that is extremely drinkable and dangerously so. The feel is extremely smooth with a slight thinness from the barrel aging to it. The carbonation is extremely light and tingly enough to give it a good texture to remind you that it's a beer. There is a slight alcohol burn to it in the finish and the smell.
Overall, this a pretty good beer and it seems to have aged extremely well. The aroma and taste are absolutely fantastic and create a great experience. If you manage to run across this, grab since it seems to have aged fairly well but seems like it could use an extra year or two. 1,727 charactersHattedClassic, Apr 17, 2017

4.1/5  rDev -9.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured from 12 oz bottle into a wine glass, 2017 vintage. Paired with 70% dark chocolate (Chocolove Strong Dark), which I recommend doing!
Pours an extremely dark opaque brown, not quite black, with a thin but even brown head without a lot of bubbles rising from the bottom. I highly recommend drinking this after it has warmed and breathed a bit.
Smell is of milk chocolate, roasted coffee, toasted caramelizad malts, bourbon. Taste follows the nose with the addition of some bitterness and unfortunately is dominated by ethanol as well, a bit strong for me... but again, wait and let it warm and breathe and it doesn't diminish, but seems to make more sense. Mouthfeel is slick and mouth coating, somewhat resinous, and aftertaste is a bit bitter with some burnt character as well as some alcohol burn. Overall very well done but not necessarily up to the hype. 863 charactersPlinyMeNow, Apr 16, 2017

Also, not too hot for 14.5%, and a bit browner than I remember in the appearance. Getting phantom stickee monkee notes too. good stuff 363 charactersdream, Apr 15, 2017

Finally get to try this classic which if I recall correctly was once in the BA top ten but I was never able to find before.  At $11/12oz., even more expensive than BCBS.  The premium bourbon barrels it is aged in and the length of aging are perhaps part of the reason for that.
Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a Samuel Smith English tulip.
a: Opaque black with a hint of clear ruby at the very bottom.  Two inch thick tan head receded slowly to  dense lacing over even surface foam.
s: Dark roasty malt, chocolate and whiskey
t; Follows the nose with more emphasis on the chocolate and whiskey, which leaves a burning throat from the very high ABV.  Sweetish finish. Later, barleywine fruitiness takes over from the initial chocolate notes.
m; Full, great body and moderate carbonation tingle.
o; Outstanding as expected, smoother overall than BCBS, if perhaps a bit lighter.  Will still be buying Backwoods Bastard, Central Waters BBA Scotch Ale, Weyerbacher Insanity and New Holland Dragon's Milk for barrel aged darkness, but this may very well top the list, albeit the least accessible and affordable among them and also tasting at times less like an RIS and more like a barleywine. 1,237 charactersscotorum, Apr 15, 2017

L:  Barely any head when poured. Dark brown in color, reminds me of coca-cola in color and consistency (with less carbonation). 
S:  Initial smell is booze followed by char and sweet cherry. 
T:  Boozy, Roasty, Cherry, and Char. 
F:  Thinner than I would like, little to no fizz creates a smoothness, light to medium bodied. 
O:  Good, but not as good as I remember last year.  Is it because it was brewed in Kansas City by Boulevard Brewing this year?  I'm hoping time will mellow it out. 501 charactersNicholasL, Apr 12, 2017

4.9/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Picked up from Total Wine, Woodland Hills CA. Poured into a snifter. 2017 vintage: 69.0 IBU, 14.5% ABV, 12oz bottle.
Look: Pours jet black, small dark tan head of foam, quickly dissipating. Very little, quickly dissolving lace.
Smell: Strong coffee notes initially greet your nose, followed by a pleasant bitter booziness. Balanced by a deep cherry and plum fruitiness and an very apparent charred oak profile that I initially missed. Amazing finish.
Taste: Chocolate, bourbon, and coffee all perfectly balance in an incredible symphony of dark, roasty and subtley sweet flavors. Again that subtle fruitiness like dried cherries or raisins, with a lingering hop bitterness. 
Feel: Incredibly smooth for its 14.5% ABV. Sticky, very low carbonation that gives a nice sting to the tip of your tongue as you gather the flavors on your palate. Heavy bodied but I've never had a stout that balanced it so well with a such a level of seltzery carbonation that you barely notice. Amazing.
Shit, there's no way around this one. Imperial stouts like Speedway and Old Rasputin deserve their place, but there is a reason that this beer is considered one of the best in the world. Having just recently hit shelves with this 2017 vintage, do not miss your chance to get a hold of this incredible imperial stout. $9.99 a bottle. 1,315 charactersWickedBeer, Apr 08, 2017

Look- A dark brown almost black color. A thin tan head with little lacing sticking around the glass. It looked rather thin for a stout but...
Smell- Fantastic dark chocolate, vanilla, dried fruit and light alcohol. The smell seemed to be more sweet chocolate around the halfway point of the glass. Such a unique blend 
Taste- The chocolate and dried fruits mixed with an alcohol kicker. The thin look was very deceptive. A thick sweet chocolate taste with more oak than the smell led me to believe. Never would have guessed a 14%+ ABV stout could be so sweet. 
Mouthfeel- Sticky and thick sweetness from the first drink to the last. Reminds me of chocolate covered raisins. A little dryness toward the end. 
Overall- A phenomenal high ABV stout with little alcohol taste. If you like a sweet fruity stout this is probably the best. I would love to a bottle to age for a year or so. 932 charactersKdouble, Apr 07, 2017

L - (4) dark murky brown coming out of the bottle. Dark cola black in the glass. The head is a light khaki and creamy looking. Only rated 4 on look because it looks terribly thin for a 14.5%. I prefer my big stouts syrupy thick. Lacing is extremely sticky from the high alcohol.
S - (4.75) nice. Dark fruits.  Plums, grapes, and alcohol soaked raisens. Loads of vanilla. Excellent bourbon presence on the nose. Oak, leather, vanilla ice cream, molasses are all triggered in my nose. Love this.
T/M - (4.75)/(4.74) wow was I wrong. This is thick and chewy as can be. Decadently creamy and reminiscent of bcbs on the feel. It tastes of the nose with a little extra char of smoldering oak. Heavy on the fruit flavors. Very, very sweet. Spicy alcohol burn. 
O - (4.75) this is stellar. I literally just made a thread on the forums looking for dark fruit forward big stouts and this is exactly what I was after. This is every bit worth its high regarded rating. I would LOVE to do a side by side with bcbs. 1,038 charactersrypkr, Apr 02, 2017

Smell is rich, as in money! Maple, vanilla, coconut, fine bourbon, oak, Tootsie Roll, nougat, and amaretto. Some heat tickles the nostrils.
Taste changes it up, starting with raisin, molasses, charred oak, and bourbon. After a short while, it starts developing into warm Kahlua, or even a hot toddy. Further along, I then get cocoa, and hints of raspberry, amaretto, and spicy cologne.
Medium body with a thin froth, finishing a little sticky and semi-dry. Definitely warm, at least. 525 charactersSabtos, Apr 01, 2017

Appearance: Deep cola brown with clear mahogany edges and a brief but lush head of tan foam.
Smell: Full aroma of burnt caramel, charred barrels, vanilla beans, Bounty chocolate bars and bourbon.
Taste: Massive layers of roasted malt, cocoa powder, warmly sweet and boozy bourbon, and some oak barrel tannins. Just enough roasted coffee bitterness for balance.
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body, oily smooth and rich, with moderate but soft carbonation.
Overall: A huge, boozy beer - deeply flavorful and complex with plenty of bourbon barrel influence, but somehow perfectly integrated and balanced. 691 charactersHipCzech, Feb 18, 2017

22oz "bomber" into libbey tulip
L- dark black in glass with tints of brown, small brown head, fizzling quickly
S- rich chocolaty fudge, vanilla, black cherry,of course the bourbon as well
T- roasted chocolate malt, laced with bourbon, vanilla, cherry, with velvety finish with notes of cocoa and a revisit from the bourbon
F- rich velvety feel, smooth, slight alcoholic bite, but at 14% can't expect otherwise, light carbonation as well
Overall this is one heck of a beer, reminiscent of Barrel-Aged Cherry Vanilla Cola, and sweet Bourbon infused Brownie.

The look is a beautiful dark almost black but the head is surprisingly thin and white. 
The smell is also beautiful and delicate but is honestly surprisingly light and simple. Chocolatey with a subtle note of roasted nuts.  Very milder smell than I expected, especially at cellar, not refrigerator, temperature.
The taste strikes an elegant balance for a bourbon aged stout. I'm also drinking it almost 2 years after it was barreled. The front is a deliciously bitter-sweet flavor that exemplifies stout in my mind, and is reminiscent of good dark chocolate.  The bourbon makes itself known quietly on the tail end, after the liquid has passed. Very nice
The mouth feel is a great balance of full and light. Creamy and complete as it passes your palette, it fizzes off nicely leaving a delicious taste without a residue. 834 charactersstevepat, Jan 30, 2017

Bottle Pour Vintage 2017
A: Pours a pitch black color with a fingers worth of head that fades down to a thin ring of lace around the glass
S: Lots of bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malt, and caramel up front along with some coconut and dark chocolate. Some underlying coffee notes come out as well
T: Follows the nose. Starts off with a mix of roasted malt, bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark fruit, coffee, dark chocolate, and caramel. Goes into more notes of the barrel, including coconut and leather. Alcohol is quite present but doesn't overwhelm anything and works quite well with all of the other flavors. Finishes with warming alcohol, plenty of barrel character, and roast
M: Full bodied with low-moderate carbonation. Very smooth
O: Easily in the top-tier of BBA stouts. Great for sipping, as it really unfolds as it warms from fridge or cellar temp to room temp. Do not pass this one by 950 charactersBEERMILER12, Jan 15, 2017

A:  Poured into a Barrelworks Glass to a deep black topped by a finger of dense dark tan head that fades quickly to a collar around the edge of the glass with some lacing  
S:  Smells of oak, vanilla, caramel, chocolate, roasted malts, espresso, and some smoke
T:  Taste is roasted malts and dark chocolate covered espresso beans with some oak, caramel and vanilla.  Slight smoke and charred wood as well.  The swallow brings more charred wood and smoke with lingering roasted malts, dark chocolate and coffee with some lingering caramel and vanilla
M:  This beer is big and silky smooth on the palate with soft but adequate carbonation.  The beer has a dry finish but that is to be expected.
O:  Overall this beer is worthy of its reputation.  It's big and beautiful with an amazing amount of flavor and complexity without overpowering the palate.  Balanced yet still a heavy hitter.  This is a beer that I always want to have on hand. 950 charactersSHODriver, Jan 15, 2017

Warm, luscious bourbon notes on the nose - sticky caramel, vanilla - with some medium chocolate malt which adds to the decadence. Flavor profile is traditional, but everything is balanced for the most part. Lots of smooth oak caramel tones upfront, the vanilla after that...the bourbon flavors are more assertive than the base elements - I would have liked to see that roasted malt / chocolate flavor present for sure - but isn't hot or boozey. Ends with some toffee sweetness from the bourbon. A little thin on the mouthfeel for how I like my bigger stouts. 611 charactersajm5108, Jan 08, 2017

A:  Dark brown/black with mainly foam for a head that quickly dissipated.  Spotty lacing.
S:  My favorite part of the experience.   Rich, bourbon-y, chocolate, molasses, caramel and more bourbon.  I could sniff this one all night.
T:  An explosion of rich tastes.  Chocolate, bourbon, molasses, oak, coffee, and some dark fruits.  Sip and be awed.  As it warmed, the flavors only increased.

This is a 2016 vintage (cellared for 6 months); 650 ml bottle into pint glass.  Pours a very dark brown, with almost zero light leakage at the glass.  Thin tan head.  Initial impression is...oh, my.  Creamy-smooth, sweet chocolate, molasses, caramel, oak, booze, coffee, and a little dark fruit combine in an absolutely exquisite BA Stout.  Mouthfeel is thick and oily; carbonation is light and doesn't dare interfere with the taste.  Finish is very smooth. (Due to the cellaring?  I wish I could have bought two bottles and tried one fresh, but no such luck.)  Slight bitterness lingers in the back of the throat, inviting another sip.
This is just excellent. 721 charactersdbl_delta, Dec 24, 2016

4.45/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52016 aged at 33 degrees shortly after bottling.  Pours dark as a starless night.  One finger of head that quickly dissipates leaving no lacing.  At 13.1% ABV, head characteristics are difficult to produce so an allowance shall be made and an outstanding score awarded.
World class complex nose of dark fruit (plum, raisin), bourbon, caramel, vanilla, molasses  and subtle chocolate over a background of tobacco and oak.  The nose is a rich mixture than blends exceptionally well then fades into the bold tobacco and charred oak background.  
Light full body that is substantial and almost achieves creamy.  The high alcohol content produces a rich velvety smoothness that coats and flows across the tongue.  Carbonation is light due to barrel aging, yet produces a noticeable effervescence in the middle and a slightly prickly finish.  All things considered, the palate characteristics are quite outstanding.
The flavor profile is world class and quite worthy of this beer's reputation.  At first chocolate is light but gains in prominence through the experience.  It never achieves dominance but lets its presence always be known - especially from about three quarters through.  
Bourbon is similar except that it peaks during the first quarter.  In the middle lies the true richness of this beer.  Dark fruits explode and then succumb to caramel and molasses bringing with it a solid sweetness as a contrast to the bold elements of this beer.  These, in turn, fall to the bold tobacco and charred oak notes which are preceded slightly by a vanilla burst.  The finish is a slow fade of blended flavor with tobacco, oak and vanilla lingering.  Alcohol remains covered until a nice burn at the finish. 1,704 characterstillmac62, Dec 23, 2016

The appearance is pitch black with no head retention. Big alcohol legs too.
The aroma is a wonderful mix of bourbon, oak, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruits and a hint of booze sweetness.
The taste follows the nose with a big bourbon kick up front with a complex mix of flavors. Really decadent yet not overtly sweet.
The palate is full with a lingering bourbon spice that warms the throat going down. 
Overall this is an awesome beer and yet another great barrel aged beer from FW. Definitely lives up to the hype. 647 charactersBartleby91, Dec 16, 2016

Only the faintest ring of bubbles around the rim of the glass to qualify as a 'head'.  Leaves some nice legs on the glass as you swirl/drink it.  Aroma is chocolate, vanilla, oak and dark fruit and you can truly smell the booze on this.  Yum.  Taste follows the nose with chocolate up front followed by vanilla sweetness, bourbon and dark fruit into a slightly bitter finish.  For a 14% ABV beer the alcohol is well hidden in the taste, probably masked by everything else going on.  Taste is big, balanced and complex.  Mouthfeel is thick and velvety, just like a great stout should be.
Suggested food pairing: Medium rare prime rib
If you like this beer then you should also try: Black Note Stout
Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely have it again)  This beer crushes it.  Awesome.  With deep, complex and balanced flavors, its reputation is well deserved and it belongs right up there with the other elite stouts (e.g., KBS, BCBS, Black Note).

Pour is less dense than expected, dark brown hue with an off white colored head that sticks around for a minute. Big booziness in the nose with subtle hints of caramel and charred oak. Following the nose well, the booze and oaky finish doesn't go nowhere. Noticeable amount of dark fruit. Subtle vanilla, caramel and lacto sweetness. Mouthfeel is relatively thin, with a nice bourbon bite. Excellent beer, but a little overrated in my opinion. If this had a BCBS similar mouthfeel, it would be on the same level if not better. 532 charactersMateo2699, Dec 02, 2016

They served me this in a tulip and the beer was black and only a small amount of tannish head.  Then I smelled this wonderful creation and wow.  The bourbon was there in the background but the dark chocolate and raisiny smell from a RIS was there.  The taste was even better.  Soft vanilla notes throughout to blend the edges of the chocolate, plum, and caramel notes.  Then the bourbon and wood from the barrels came through on the finish. 526 charactersBobMagruder, Nov 24, 2016

I'm not sure what conditions others have aged this beer in, but it was pretty incredible to me.  Not quite on the level of, say, aged 2014 BCBS, but a truly phenomenal BBA stout with notes of chocolate fudge, vanilla, toffee, creme brule, dark fruits and of course sweet oaky bourbon.
I will continue to seek this one out. 493 charactersBlakeAM, Nov 22, 2016

2016 bottle to tulip glass.  Tasting with DC, Dark Lord vs. Parabola vs. Abyss.
LOOK:  dark black pour, off white head, lasts long.  Touch of cola like transparency on the edges.
AROMA: smokey, oaky, scotch-like.  
TASTE:  charred oak, toasted barley, touch of earth and mineral,
FEEL:  Perfect.  Just thick enough to be chewy, thin enough to support excellent carbonation and silky feel.

Bottle to snifter, sipping through Seahawks @ Falcons playoff game.
In addition to all of the above....
Dark fruit in the aroma.  
Bourbon in the taste, not sure how I missed that initially, probably b/c of scenario my taste buds were a little overwhelmed.

This creation can be very boozy, but not bourbon flavored, and ripped with vanilla overdose. However another bottle or keg can be nectar of the stout gods as well. Different batches drank at different times makes a difference. Was that grammatically correct? To clarify, I might be willing to state, that in my experience, that age in a bottle does not treat this one well, it brings out too much of the sharper alcohol notes, vanilla comes into play more and the subtle oak and chocolates gets lost. IMHO, kegs just get better! 
Anyway, the best have been awesome, chocolate, vanilla, wood and the snap and burn of serious alcohol at work here makes it one of my favorites for years. In sum, if you get one in a bottle I recommend drinking it soon, (not that I am following my own advice since I still have a few left!) 895 charactersRockAZ, Oct 26, 2016

4.18/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: dark brown with a dark tan / cocoa-colored head, which fades to a lacing. The beer is bright when held directly to light and resembles Coke.
Aroma: sweet smelling, like flourless chocolate cake. The oak comes through well, contributing vanilla. 
Flavor: prominent molasses that fades to oak and vanilla in the finish. Absolutely no alcohol heat or flavor. Several layers of flavor. I see no reference to this beer being bourbon-barrel aged, but there is no bourbon flavor – just the oak components.
Mouthfeel: medium body. I wish this had a bit more body to it. A bomber is certainly a meal by itself, though.
Overall: 4.5 years in the cellar. Good, but far from great. This was rated nearly identical to Bourbon County, which I drank side by side. Bourbon County is far superior. I can’t help being somewhat disappointed. Perhaps it was the extended cellaring and I missed its peak. There are better readily-available imperial stouts. 955 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Oct 14, 2016

Pours a very nice dark brown colour with medium head and dense texture.
The smell is sweet and bourbon-like.
The taste is very complex, ranging from sweet at first with a hint of scotch, then oak, aged wine, bourbon, vanilla and chocolate and probably other aromas that remain hidden for me still. 
I don't like stout beers in particular, but this is clearly one of the best beers I've had (along with Devil's Halfacre). For me, it's better than drinking a good cognac.
Absolutely wonderful! 555 charactersqrazvan, Oct 12, 2016

I picked up this definition in college. Thinking of parabolas in real-world terms as the trajectory of a ground-launch missile or gravity's rainbow, from a dense high-brow Pynchon novel, I also picked up in college. But my favorite Parabola is this boozy 14% ABV Russian Imperial Stout with its oatmeal taste, and vanilla raisin fragrance. Firestone Walker Brewing Company has concocted a real treat and it was while in college on Spring Break, a break from my studies on Shakespeare, Eisenstein montage, Brando-bravado, D.W. Griffith's racist apologetics,  that I and a few thespian friends wandered into this brewery. They have a location in northern and southern california and surprisingly I found myself in the northern one for my first encounter. Drug dealers will tell you expanding your post to multiple areas helps with distribution, helps with profits, so it's no surprise when breweries say this as well. The biggest thing I picked up in college was my fine-tuned tongue for beer (because, and everyone knew, my gifted abilities at acting I already possessed on my first day of college (still had to pay that loan though)). Young and already drunk almost to the point of poisoned, we walked into Firestone Walker and was served the Parabola. On first taste I felt the curvature, starting point then up the y-axis, along the x-axis, seconds later down the y but still along the x. It was an experience. An experience which when I look back I can only recall portions of, like feeble lines striked through, only getting two points of contact, not the whole curve. I and my friends, we drank and drank this beer down and down and when the ambulance arrived to take our unconscious bodies to the ER, we did not cooperate, we were not appreciative. We were young and dumb and didn't understand. But also, we know these medics, fresh out of 6-months of EMT training, did not understand what we did. Which is how good of a beer this was. 2,084 charactersChristianAlexander, Sep 28, 2016

4.59/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I have had this beer multiple times and participated in a flight from 2011 to 2016.  Definitely not a beer that ages well as it seems to lose quite a bit with time and you are just left with booze as the predominant taste.  Pours a tad thin when young and only gets thinner with age.  you can almost always see light passing through around the edges.  Smell is always barrel forward and the booze is almost never hidden with strong chocolate notes.  The taste tends to follow the most with booze and chocolate.  A slight sweetness is present with hints of raisin and the beer often feels tastes fudgey.  Vanilla also comes through in the taste.  Feel is a tad light for the style, especially if it has some age on it.  Overall this is an excellent barrel aged stout that does not hold up well to aging.  give it two year max in your cellar; it starts to precipitously degrade after that. 887 charactersAmguerra305, Aug 26, 2016

4.53/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Got on tap in Waltham/Boston area at Bison County restaurant. $11 for what must have been a 8oz pour, which was steep but I don't see this around so I ordered it.
Dark with slight ring of a head. Smell is dark fruit, hops, coffee and chocolate and some booze. 
Taste is coffee and bourbon-y (there is that bourbon barrel), toffee, some slight baker's chocolate, sweet fruit (chocolate covered cherries), and also some coffee bite. All the flavors you expect, quite perfectly mat he'd, and not a lot of char or ash which makes it quite pleasant. The heat of the 13% is there but not at all off-putting. (Bottled is apparently 14%?) Sweet esters and warmth, relatively thin mouthful makes this very easy to drink. If it wasn't $11 I'd have had 2. 
Very well balanced Russian Stout, the barrel aspect works perfectly here. Firestones tend to be one-note for me, this shows much more nuance and a great drink, better than Old Rasputin in my book. 945 charactersRogerlb, Aug 24, 2016

N: Strong coffee, roasted malts, caramel, toffee, molasses, biscuits, yeast, chocolate, vanilla, wood, citrus, and some floral.
T: Strong roasted malts notes, coffee, caramel, toffee, molasses, a burnt character, yeast, vanilla, wood, citrus, chocolate, and some floral, 
M: smooth, creamy, sticky, warming, chewy, and full body. 
O: A huge beer the alcohol is fairly hidden with wisp of warming. The beer is seriously balanced well. When I want a thick dark chewy beer this fits the bill so very well. There is nothing short of Amazing. I need to get a couple bottle of this stuff. 781 characterscolts9016, Aug 14, 2016

Poured pitch black, no head, a little thin looking. Smell is very similar to aged BCBS -- bourbon, booze, dark fruit, bit of dry dog food. Good not great.
Taste is strong roasted grain, bourbon, still some alcohol warmth, cocoa powder. Lingering taste of espresso coffee grounds, sticky noble hop bitterness.
Mouthfeel is rather light, spritzy, drinkable but thin.
Overall, liked it. Didn't like it as much as BCBS or some other BA stout standbys. Appreciated the balancing bitterness and coffee tones, but could use a bit more body if I were to nitpick. 593 charactersPDXAmbassador, Aug 02, 2016

Taste: I'm blown away! upfront you get milk chocolate a lot of the barrel notes creamy vanilla oak middle of the mouth brown sugar burnt molasses rasin coconut Slight dark chocolate a big sweet Carmel malt note some dark coffee roastiness and a cherry flavor that lingers into the finish. Finishes with a big sweetness and is quickly balanced out with a big boozy heat.
Feel: huge! Full bodied  creamy slick mouthfeel.
Overall: this is right there with BCBS as the best BBA stout I've ever had! I really don't know which one is better. This is sweet and boozy but the balance each other out beautifully! This is a huge beer. Not  for the faint of heart! 775 charactersMasonz223, Jul 21, 2016

4.63/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served on tap in a snifter.  Pours a thick, motor oil black with only the faintest traces of a brown/mocha head (a little more would be appreciated though).  The nose is pungent and earthy.  Bourbon right off the bat is followed by dark fruit (black cherry).  The palate accepts the same bourbon-to-cherry intro but these are accented with notes of oak, molasses, and the slightest trace of licorice.  I'm unfortunately writing this a day after trying it, so the full spectrum of flavor is fading from memory - this is a beautifully complex Russian Imperial Stout however.  Mouthfeel is thick - really thick.  This is an unmitigatedly incredible RImpStout. 656 charactersLAp, Jul 18, 2016

It pours black. The smell is Bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits, and dark chocolate.
The taste was amazing. It was 53 degrees out of the fridge and the flavors took off from there. Sweet vanilla, dark fruits, malty, and chocolate. As the stout warmed to room temperature, the sweet dark chocolate came out. The bourbon was very consistent  thru out. One of the best I have tasted, next to BCBS and Black Tuesday. 492 charactersUscjojo, Jun 21, 2016

A- Opens well and pours a the tiniest of heads that is gone is seconds. Super dark brown colour
S- Good bourbon 
T- Complex. Licorice, chocolate, coffee, bourbon and other spices. Some brown sugar or molasses. Good balance but would enjoy more bourbon. 
M- Creamy going down but dries right out afterwards
O- Nice brew. Not great and is a nice to try. Just does not have the depth and thickness I am looking for in a higher priced brew. Don't get me wrong it's good but just for me I know of way better
Food Pairing
As usual with bourbon barrel aged stouts this one is difficult to pair. Sorry but I have to go with the best there is on this one....... Chocolate cake with chocolate icing or brownies. Either or is great!

Bourbon, vanilla oak flavors and a medium amount of sticky caramel sweetness dominate the flavor. There is a moderately-strong hops bitterness and some alcohol as well countering the sweetness making for a beer that somewhat bitter on balance.

Amazing color, lacing, complex tastes that just blended incredibly well.  Likely my one and only but if I ever see it again I will get it in a heartbeat. 424 charactersNewbeergeek1, Jun 06, 2016

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Ive had a fresh 2015 parabola last year and it was unbelievable. This was before I was even into stouts to be honest and nonetheless this absolutely blew my mind. Parabola may be the reason I started getting stouts, in particular bourbon barrel ages stouts.
I had 2012 Parabola a few weeks ago. This thing was probably better than 2015. After 4 or so years of aging this beer lost none of the complexity of a fresh parabola possesses. There was so much going on and it remained drinkable, not hot (alcohol-wise) and absolutely exquisite. This beer is world class for my preference and palate. 593 charactersluisitoelmatador88, Jun 03, 2016

4.86/5  rDev +7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52016 Bottle: Pours pitch black color with a thick foamy 1 finger tan head that faded very slowly and left very good spotty foamy lacing.
Smells of molasses, dark chocolate, tobacco, burnt coffee grinds, caramel, peat moss, brown sugar, bourbon, red wine or a merlot, oaky notes, light piney hops, roasted malts, earthy tones and a malty sweetness that cuts through and lets the bourbon tie it back together. Very complicated and the sweetness is stronger than expected, but tamed by the smoky/earthy notes. The barrel notes are intense and I found it very hard to distinguish any real essence of each spirit barrel used for this blend, but that's what makes it so damn interesting and enjoyable.
Tastes like it smells with molasses, dark chocolate, tobacco, cocoa powder, burnt coffee grinds, caramel, peat moss, toasted coconut, vanilla, brown sugar, bourbon, red wine or a merlot, oaky notes, light piney hops, roasted malts, earthy tones, soy sauce, sherry and a real sweet, syrupy finish that gets better as it warms and only lets a little bit of the ABV through with the extreme complexity of this brew. 
Really, really tasty at this stage of the bottle's life, looking forward to trying a well aged bottle to see if it lives up to the hype. A lot smoother than it should be, it's chewy and viscous with a nice heavy body that slides down with ease - incredible ease actually. A smoky and sweet aftertaste lingers with a touch of bourbon, a dash of hoppy bite and a slight bitterness. Excellent at this point, I'm sure it can (and will) only get better. World class indeed.
4/26/2017: Opened a 2012 bottle that I've had since July 2013 and it poured beautifully and left good spotty lacing (moved "Look" score up to 4.25), the aroma releasing a lovely mix of cocoa, bourbon, vanilla, tobacco, molasses, brown sugar, dark chocolate and woody/earthy notes. Raised the "Smell" score to 5 as it was a perfect nose at this point. Tastes thankfully like it smells with a well balanced blend of rich chocolate malts, woody/barrel notes, vanilla and bourbon which masks the ABV and goes down incredibly smooth. 
Followed up the 2012 bottle with a 2016 bottle and it was much better aged when compared to the first time I tried the 2016 vintage. This 2016 bottle still had some minor heat but was velvety smooth and had a great feel, proving that age does wonders for this stout. It gave me a new appreciation for this brew so I pushed up the mouthfeel score from 4.75 to 5 as I sipped and savored this brew. Total beer geek moment, but this beer kicks ass when it's aged.
Overall score of 4.76 moved up to 4.86 since these aged versions got so much better tasting and smelling. Exceptional beer, much better aged and a full notch above my first tasting of it last year. 2,772 charactersCHickman, Jun 03, 2016

Mouthfeel is lacking, it's pretty highly carbed for an imperial stout that has been ages in barrels this long. It's solid but not spectacular and certainly doesn't live up to some of the ratings here compared to its peers. They did a great job with the barrel but the base beer lacks creaminess and or any other complimentary flavors, no chocolate or deep malt here. It's truly just a conduit for the bourbon. Good beer, not great and certainly doesn't belong with its peers in this category. 609 charactersLapalou, May 30, 2016
4.97/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5First time trying this and I have to say it might be my favorite beer I've ever had. Drank a 2016 Vintage poured into a Teku glass. Pours out a deep burnt toffee color that evolves into a black pool into the glass. Some head develops, but not much. The head slowly lowers, but a minimal amount remains for the remainder of the drink. I'm amazed at the smoothness of this 13.1% ABV beer despite virtually no age on it, and yet, a wonderful booze still floats in the background the entire glass. Aromas of Vanilla, Bourbon, smoked wood, caramel, black licorice, and dark chocolate escape from the glass. Each sip reveals layers of burnt caramel, vanilla bean, bourbon, black licorice, and fresh roasted coffee. The balance and complexity of this beer is rivaled by few beers that I have had. This was somewhat transcendental to drink. Some beers live short of their hype, other beers live up to their hype. This exceeded its hype, which should say enough. Definitely a euphoric drinking experience. I have another bottle that I plan to age for 2 years. I am ecstatic to see what happens. 1,085 charactersSteveB3014, May 30, 2016

Pours burgundy black with a creamy dark beige colored head.

Tastes very bittersweet with bourbon, toffee, caramel, mild coconut, vanilla, dark roast coffee, rich dark chocolate, fudge, some dried black cherries and fig, brown bread, some charred oak, with mild earthy grass.

Taste was near perfect, burbon, chocolate ans black malt, no bitterness or burnt flavors. I did think it was a little hot compared to other years and will sit on a few and try them with the next batches.
My biggest complaint was the mouthfeel, way to thin for a BA stout. Compared it side by side with an Alesmith BA Speedway and the Speedway won hands down on mouthfeel. Actually the concensus was BA Speedway was all round better beer this year. 518 charactersd3brewing, May 10, 2016

Appearance: poured an oily black with a thick and chewy roasted coffee colored head.

Taste: follows the nose perfectly. The barrel character really shines here and is the dominant free in the glass. Coconut, char, bourbon, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, dark fruits, marshmallow. Does not drink like a 13% beer; seems like half that. Mouthfeel is medium-heavy to heavy but with a nice creamy fudge quality.

The head slowly melts into the body of the beer with nice lacing throughout the drink.  Smells of a conglomeration of everything you want in a stout:  chocolate, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, etc.  However, I'm slightly disappointed thereafter.  It's good but not great.  Not off the charts great on draft.  I'm finding I like beers like this aged at least 6 months on a bottle lately.  You get the abv booze rush and ask the flavors above but it's just too young.  They haven't melted together as I would have thought.  However, these mixture beers are always this way to me unless they have sat on a shelf for some time.  Had a bitter subtle kick to it at the end.  MORE.watery than I could have possibly expected.  Lots of abv burn.  Need to try it properly aged at least a year and then revisit it. 902 charactersuvachief, May 06, 2016

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Superb. Maybe the most complex beer I've ever had. Definitely top 2 (along with 2014 Alewerks Bourbon Barrel Porter). Funny thing is I've had this beer 3 times before (2012 - 2013 I think?) and didn't like it at all. Amazing.
Pour is beautiful highlighted crimson black. I'll just list the aromas and flavors from this beer. The most interesting was the black cherry halfway thru the bomber, the hint of mint towards the end, and what I'm going to call black hops (yea I just made that up). Hops drenched in black alcohol goodness. Tasty.
Bourbon, whiskey, chocolate, vanilla, oak, barrel. marshmallow, coconut, coffee, black cherry, black licorice, mint, alcohol and black hops. Yea I said all that.
The only (minor) imperfection was a tiny twinge of plastic, fake feeling aftertaste 2/3 of the way thru. But I will not dock the score, this beer was every bit as good as the best barrel aged beers I've had. Only drawback is I can only get one. Question, what would aging this beer do?

Thick and chewy with strong bourbon, chocolate, coffee and cherry backbone. Complex taste with a huge variety of flavor from beginning to end. For 13% it doesn't taste boozey or hot at all. Overall a really great strong beer, very heavy in both taste and alcohol content- definitely made for sipping. Not sure how it compares to previous vintages. 412 charactersjjyom, Apr 30, 2016

A- Bourbon, espresso, vanilla, chocolate & a hint of smoked oak. T- Bourbon is definitely present but allows the coffee, burnt brown sugar, vanilla and an ever so slight hint of licorice to shine through. F- Medium carbonation and great chewy mouth feel. Alcohol is there but not hot or overpowering. O-Exceptionally balanced blend of flavours that shine through the 14% ABV. Best BBA Stout I've had so far. 505 charactersKenmac19, Apr 26, 2016

2016 Edition
A: Rich complex deep grain roast and malt. The roast is reminiscent of coffee and dark chocolate. There is a light malt sweetness, with noticeable bourbon barrel presence.  
A: Jet black color, totally opaque with a moderate tan mostly-smooth head that has adequate retention.
T: Deep grain roast; the malt flavor is coffee/dark chocolate-like with a slight sweetness. The beer has a moderately prominent bourbon barrel character with a dry finish. 
M: Full bodied with moderate carbonation. There is a bit of an alcoholic warmth that is slightly sharp from the bourbon barrel. However, the beer has a luscious texture (from the oats) and really coats the tongue. 
O: Delicious; this beer has a really complex aroma and flavor. The full bodied, deep grain roast is really complimented by the mixture of bourbon barrels used for aging. 861 charactersPhil-Fresh, Apr 18, 2016

Look - Pitch black, minimal head. Completely dissipated within a few seconds. 
Smell - Very sweet. Lots of big malts, caramel, a bit of vanilla. I didn't get much bourbon at first until it started to warm up. 
Taste - pretty much exactly like it smells. The malt character really dominates. It took a while for the additional flavors to come out. I would definitely recommend drinking this beer pretty close to room temperature. 
Feel - Great, very creamy. 
Overall- still very good, but not quite as good as last year in my opinion. As stated above, I would definitely recommend drinking this beer pretty close to room temperature. The fridge was set to 55 degrees, but it still improved immensely with some additional time on the counter. 804 charactersbentnorton, Apr 17, 2016

I don't even recognize this beer from even when having it fresh a year ago. Holy cow only one year did this good. I was on the fence about about parabola as it tasted like warm syrupy butter with excessive booze heat when I had it first. The one year old age bottle is absurdly good. My mind is boggled what more age could do, good thing I have several more from the last few years. Just have to find that sweet spot. 474 charactersShermski, Apr 09, 2016

Definitely a great balance between the base beer and the bourbon.  The brew is very similar to KBS, but quite a bit sweeter, which I like. There is absolutely no booze in the taste, but the burn is there on the swallow. 
Highly recommended if you can find a bottle.  It has jumped to #2 on my list of favorite BA stouts. 358 charactersnawpnawp, Apr 09, 2016

L-Jet black with a small brown head.

T-Follows the aroma with added notes of oak and vaniila.
M-Rich, smooth, and full-bodied.
O-Another excellent addition to the Parabola family.  As it warms, it even becomes more complex. Slightly boozy on the back end but will mellow with aging.

A great blend of taste, easily covers alcohol.  Everything in moderation, no one aspect of the beer dominates too hard.  Super chewy.  Never hot, harsh or boozy, very well balanced.  At this price and distribution level, this is an elite 1st tier bourbon barrel beer. 412 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 08, 2016

Beautiful black pour with espresso head.  Smelled great, whiskey and a sweet stout.  Picked up some subtleties but no notes so not sure what.  
First few tastes were wonderful but became a bit sweet afterwards.  Still well above average but not something to seek out.
That said, since it was the last pour of the keg I would like to try it again as the FW barrel aged beers have generally been among my favorites.  And of course it was in no way bad.  Way to easy to drink at 14% 559 charactersuser-951, Feb 24, 2016

Look - Pitch black with a solid two finger mocha head. Looks so good in the glass 
Smell - Bourbon, vanilla, coconut, chocolate, coffee
Taste - A wonderful amount of bourbon, toasted coconut, vanilla, oak, coffee, milk chocolate, hints of booze on the back end 
Feel - Not as thick as lets say BCBS, but has a lovely mouthfeel in it's own right. Mouth coating, medium plus body, oily
Overall - Not only a top notch BA stout but has moved its way into one of my top beers overall spots. Simply amazing. 542 charactersTonyjenlasc, Feb 12, 2016

4.63/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours with one of the darkest black appearances I've seen in a beer. There is quite literally no head on top. It actually resembles cola that has sat and let some of the carbonation die down. The nose is bittersweet chocolate, bitter coffee, and dark fruit layered on top of booziness. The alcohol is incredibly present in the taste. It actually cleared my sinus right up the burn was so intense. Once the burn dies down, I am left with bitter dark cherry, mild chocolate, and burnt coffee lingering on my tongue. The mouth is thick yet smooth, and as mentioned, the alcohol burn is predominant. Overall, I think previous vintages of this beer have been better due to the more hidden alcohol presence. Nevertheless, Parabola remains legendary. 743 charactersBiggtriksta, Jan 11, 2016

S - bourbon, oak, smoke, dark chocolate, espresso, vanilla, toffee, caramel, toasted coconut, big roasted malts
T - Super smooth, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, oak, smokiness, tobacco, leather, roasted malts, nice barrel flavors, caramel, coconut, burnt marshmallow
M - super thick, alc covered, aftertaste is coffee, bourbon, roasted malts, smoke, and oak barrel flavors. 
O - I've heard this is the best of all the batches so far. I can't argue with that. Probably THE best barrel aged imperial stout that I've had. Hands down amazing. Have had on tap twice and out of the bottle twice and it never dissapoints.
2017 bottle:
A - pitch black beer with a mocha head that does dissipate as expected at 14.5% abv
S - huge roasty malts, dark chocolate, bourbon, coconut, vanilla, molasses, toffee, oak, smoke/char, umami umami umami 
T - again big roasty malts, vanilla, cream, dark chocolate, molasses, toffee, oak, smoke/char, burnt marshmallow, so wholesome, the bourbon flavor in this beer is so well balanced with every other flavor
M - this beer is huge, it has a heavy mouthfeel, alcohol is covered, aftertaste is more dark chocolate, smoke/char, vanilla, toffee. It's excessively good. 
O - amazing beer, still 5/5 in every aspect 1,325 charactersHopHunter19, Jan 06, 2016

4.59/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Opened the 2014 vintage on 1/4/16. Much more impressive compared to previous tasting. Poured with a finger of short-lived head. Aroma was amazing - vanilla, caramel, bourbon, oak. Taste characteristics matched, balancing sweetness with the dark, roasty notes of a good stout. This is very smooth. Feel is medium tending toward a bit full body and a little hot at first. Feels like a sip of good, straight bourbon with warmth in the back of your throat. But as the beer warms to room temperature, the booziness evens out. Overall, an excellent BA stout and worth it's lofty status. 
Had the 2013 version from a cellared bomber; label read No. 004. Poured black with no head so I had to knock the look score a bit. Scent was kinda like a wet dog, I hate to say. Taste was better; you really got the smokey oak presence, which was nice. It was a little boozy, but not overwhelming. Mouthfeel was good;  not flat, as I feared, but moderate carbonation. Overall, it was a good strong stout that got better as it warmed up; didn't really blow me away as hype had me expecting. Looking forward to trying my 2014 to compare. 1,117 charactersLouZ, Jan 05, 2016

Pours pitch black with a nice dark head. Aromas of bourbon, chocolate and tobacco. Taste like the perfect balance of bourbon and imperial stout, just boozy enough, but not overpowering. 276 charactersWillDavis707, Jan 03, 2016

Pours black with virtually no head.  Aroma of marshmallow, chocolate & oak.  Tastes like liquid chocolate with a nice boozy burn on the backend.  Mouthfeel is just about perfect.   First time having Parabola and it's a good one.  One of the better BA stouts I've had that's for certain.  Incredibly smooth & surprisingly mellow for a 14% beer, although cumulatively the ABV will still beat you like it did me.  Maybe the one year mellowed it some.  Will have to try a bottle fresh some time. 505 charactersJaycase, Jan 02, 2016

4.8/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a snifter glass.  It pours a dark mahogany - nearly black, with a very thin khaki colored head and virtually no lacing.  The smell is of rich, dark chocolate, coffee, oak, and, of course, bourbon. The taste is absolutely amazing; one of very few "5's" I've ever given.  All the flavors are evident and they blend exquisitely:  dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee, molasses, and black cherry.  I'm not sure I can even discern all the wonderful flavors.  You really taste the bourbon at the end but considering the ABV is 14%, there really isn't a strong alcohol burn, which is amazing to me.  This stout is moderately thick, not nearly as chewy as some, and it is lightly carbonated.  While it is absolutely a sipper, it is an easy one.  Overall, Parabola actually exceeds its hype.  It is positively decadent.  Russian Imperial Stout is my favorite style and I simply haven't had one better than this.  I just wish I could find more of it! 947 charactersMacMalt, Dec 25, 2015

A - Pours a brown black with very little head.
S - The aroma is first dark chocolate and then booze.
T - The flavor follows the nose. And this is without a doubt the best tasting dark chocolate in beer I have ever had. The alcohol comes in at the very end and finishes perfectly.
M - Not as thick and chewy as you might expect. Low carbonation.

This beer pours a beautiful jet black with slight highlights of amber when held up directly to the light. The head is a nice fluffy light brown that eventually disappears into just a ring around the outside of the glass. There are also nice sheets of lacing. Smell is fantasic and complex. Bourbon, oak, chocolate, coffee, and a hint of vanilla are most prominent to me. Taste is the same, and although there is a good amount of bourbon flavor, it does not come across as too boozy. Feel is rich and full bodied, a bit slick. Overall this beer is outstanding, fantastic, amazing and any other synonym you can come up with. Need to trade for more ASAP. 730 charactersCNoj012, Nov 30, 2015

4.61/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours rich, velvety dark chocolate and appears black in a Tap and Mallet snifter. A half-inch, creamy chestnut head lasts five minutes, leaving spotty lace and a viscous film.
Rich, dark fruit fills the aroma of luscious malt. Specific notes of molasses, fresh pumpernickel bread, chocolate syrup, cherry, light cognac, figs, and dates. The depth and layers of character are amazing and become more pronounced with warmth.
The flavor opens with charred malt and espresso, balanced against modest bitter-sweetness. The focus is on malt and fruit, but oak and espresso are clearly present throughout. As with the aroma, warmth helps to develop the flavor characteristics. Alcohol becomes more pronounced in a modest but lingering malt-centric finish.
Parabola has a dense, chewy body with warming alcohol. Carbonation is modest and cleansing of a creamy velvet texture that leaves residual sugar on the lips.
This is a sipping beer, unquestionably well paired with reading or a cigar while seated in soft leather chairs and surrounded by books. 1,046 charactersSLeffler27, Nov 29, 2015

F: Medium body. A slight carbonation to it, not thick.

Pours a very dark and opaque brown, small head, some foamy cling.  Smell is lots of bourbon, roasted malts, oak, vanilla, some chocolate and molasses.  Smells great.  Taste pretty much follows with lots of bourbon, roasted malts- but not as heavily as many for the style, more vanilla and chocolate than the nose, oak, molasses, a little coffee, light alcohol.  Some bitterness on the back end, not much.  Smooth, full bodied, a real tongue coater, taste lingers.
Truly one of my favorites, a classic that everyone should try, if they can. Full, rich, flavor, expertly blended.  Still pretty hot after a year, as well. 666 charactersstortore, Nov 18, 2015

I had the 2012 back in 2013 and at that time, the 2013 seemed a tick better. I saved one bottle of 2012 that I opened in the summer of 2014 and it really improved. Unfortunately, I drank all my 2013 as well. I do have a couple 2014 and 2015 bottles that I won't touch until at least next spring or summer.
Parabola and Bourbon County (Goose Island) are the best that I've had and it's tough to rate one better than the other. 544 charactersbarreldawg, Nov 06, 2015

Aroma is of strong molasses, tobacco, dark chocolate, and an alcohol heat. 
Taste is very thick and rich. Beautiful molasses, dark chocolate, vanilla, and pipe tobacco marry together initiatially. This lasts for half the sip, then a slight hop bitterness plays through. It's surprisingly bitter, but it isn't unwelcomed as it prevents the beer from being too sweet. It sucks the saliva right out of the mouth. The finale is a cumulation of the bitterness, molasses, and alcohol heat.
Overall, this is a great beer. I like bcbs a little better. I think the beer has a little too much bitterness, but it is still fantastic. I reccomend drinking this beer plain, as to prevent mixing of flavors; it deserves it. It gets a 96/100. 792 charactersDaverCS, Oct 25, 2015

Appears and smells like it should: Black, bourbony, barrelly.
The taste: hot! Whoa! The bourbon is quality, though, and does that coconut to banana finish that pappy does that I just love. And there are stout flavors too, locked in carnal embrace with the bourbon. Downright pornograpic, this beer.
The body isn't super thick, but I don't mind that too much. The carb is fine enough to give it a creaminess.
Overall a very sexy beer. in fact, my favorite ba stout. Boom! 485 charactersbennyman12, Oct 24, 2015

4.88/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 2014 bottle into a tulip:
Appearance: Pours somewhere between black as hell and as black as it can get. Thin, dark-brown head that dissipates quickly into a ring around the edge of the glass. Small specks of lacing left behind.
Smell: TONS of bourbon, along with lots of roasty coffee and cocoa. Smell gets better and better as the beer warms. Incredibly decadent and pungent. 
Taste: Layer upon layer of sweet chocolate and bitter nibs, along with lots of espresso-coffee flavors. Very little heat for a BBA stout at 14%. Smooth, complex, and delicious.
Feel: heavy-bodied, with a thick, fudgy mouthfeel. Taste leaves dark chocolate lingering for a LOOOOOONG time.
Overall: It's one of the best BA stouts on the market, and is worth seeking out/trading for if you haven't had it. 799 charactersTheElectricOne, Oct 15, 2015

Pours a very dark brown with minimal head. Bourbon, coffee, and chocolate on the nose. The taste is dominated by dark chocolate with a bit of vanilla. The barrel comes through nicely on the finish. Having had this on draft and from the bottle, I found the bottle to be far superior. This is definitely a top notch BA RIS. 353 charactersSoCal_Matt, Oct 15, 2015

O.G. 32.74
IBU 82
British Ale Yeast
No. 006
Pours black. The nose is light barrel and stout. It has a thin tan head that turns into a ring. The first sip has coffee characteristics. Then I get some hint of cherry at the backend. Looking forward to the next sip. Still has lots of coffee flavors going on. Then a bit of slight bitter. This is really complex. The texture is smooth and silky. The third sip has more chocolate notes. This is so awesome. I have had the pleasure of some sours that change flavors as you work down through the bottle but never a stout like this. This is the second special beer i have had from firestone walker. Both were so amazing. This company is known for ipa's but not to me. Not anymore. 726 characters303beer, Oct 02, 2015

Pours a dark opaque nearly black color. Head is very thin almost nonexistent. Settles as a very thin caramel colored halo around the edges of the glass. 
Smell is of molasses and bourbon. 
Strong bourbon flavors over top flavors of oat, molasses and a hint of spiciness. 
Very low carbonation and very thick mouthfeel. 364 charactersAlpha309, Sep 25, 2015
4.18/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours nicely but not as thick as i thought it would be. smell is quite enjoyable. A nice oaky woodiness with slight vanilla, faint dark chocolate and coconut, and some booze. 
Taste hits with tingles of carb followed by some booziness. As soon as the booziness fades you get a nice roasty chocolatey vanilla RIS with mild barrel sweetness. The booze carries through but it's still an enjoyable beer. 
Mouthfeel is lighter than i want from a 14% abv beer but i believe it is just a tad over carbed giving it that trait.
Really glad I got to finally try this one but would say this is the first FW Reserve series that hasn't lived up to the hype for me. 654 charactersOhiovania, Sep 24, 2015

4.54/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75From 2014 bottle. Pours pitch black with a thin, tan head. The aroma is bourbon barrel, toasted coconut, coffee, dark chocolate, and dark fruits. Taste is rich and complex with bourbon barrel leading the way. I definitely feel the alcohol and it stops just short of being boozy. There's so much going on in the rest of the beer that I don't mind the slight alcohol burn. I get rich, dark chocolate and even some coffee. The sweetness from the chocolate and bourbon is balanced by roast, licorice, and slight notes of ash which give this beer its edge and really help to set it apart from other barrel aged stouts. Dark fruits like fig, raisin, and maybe some cherry linger in the background adding complexity. Mouth feel is thick without being chewy and really compliments the beer. Overall this beer is definitely worth the hype and my score seems conservative. 862 charactersdanh53, Sep 20, 2015

A: they all pour the same, dark brown. deep. clarity is very slightly improved in the older samples. all have rested vertically in the same cellar. 
S: the younger the brew, the more ethanol presence. definitely mellows out with age. as does the bourbon character diminish. dark chocolate and brown sugar across the gamut. I found a mild smoke note on the 2012 which I enjoyed. 
T: similar to the nose, the booze is definitely most present in the 2015, but regardless of how age each has an alcohol heat. each also has a distinct licorice flavor. ash, dark chocolate. each years has a decent amount of lingering bitterness in the finish as well.
M: 2015 was the most syrup-like, while the 2012 had more of an effervescent character and was a bit thinner. thinner than the 2015 that is, this is certainly not a thin brew regardless of age. 
D: overall, I think they really each brought something different to the table and it is difficult to pick a favorite. however, if you are reading this far, that is a lame conclusion. so in that case, I think the 2013 and 2012 had the best complexity while keeping some of the heat at bay. giving this some time allows for the heat to diminish and thus some of the bourbon character with it. such a complex brew, grab a few and find your personal sweet spot. 1,362 charactersJimmys, Sep 16, 2015

A: Extremely dark, some light the edges give off a more moderate brown cola type color. Minimal head, what there was is medium brown in color, dissipates really quickly. No alcohol legs, but you can see by the oily appearance that it is indeed very high alcohol.
S: Oh my. Lots of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts, figs, molasses, dark chocolate and a faint woodyness from the barrel. Very pronounced, but still very inviting and not intimidating.
T: Follows the nose well. Lots of dark chocolate upfront mixed with bourbon and molasses. Raisins, toasty malts and some dark fruit appear in the finish, especially as it warms up. Aftertaste is full of bourbon and molasses. Packed full of flavor but manages to avoid being boozy.
M: Big mouthfeel, not quite what I'd describe as "chewy", but close. Minimal carbonation doesn't come into play too much in the mouthfeel. Coats the mouth and lingers for minutes after each sip.
O: This one is right up there with BCBS and the best of them. Absolutely awesome. 1,119 characterschrisjws, Sep 12, 2015

What separates it from BCBS, for instance, is that it is less sweet and less overwhelmed, heat-wise, by the bourbon barrel.  It's softer, and easier-drinking, but richer and more complex.  FW has a world-class barrel program, but this one, every year, is the best of the lot. 347 charactersEdwardAbbey, Sep 11, 2015

4.24/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured a 2015 bottle.  Pours black and thick/syrupy.  Smell is mostly strong of booze and earthiness, with some roasted coffee aroma.  Taste of rich dark chocolate bitter stands out and first with very present bourbony booze and roasty/toasty coffee notes and malts on the back end.  This stout looks strong, smells strong and tastes strong.  Flavor really is complex and the body is thick.  I was lucky enough to try a bottle, so I don't want to miss the mark on this well-respected Imperial, but it was a little too intense for my typical liking.  I fully respect Parabola, but pull this bottle out when you're really ready for a hearty beer that you've got the time to really dissect and appreciate. 702 charactersanteatr23, Sep 08, 2015

The smell is intoxicating (literally and figuratively)-- the booze that comes off of this will put: hair on your chest, lead in your pencil, or any other borderline derogatory saying from the Baby Boomer generation you'd like to substitute. It's like one of those fairies from a Disney movie is dangling this delicious brew in front of my unconscious body in a dream-state. My ability to ignore this beer is as strong as Jordan Belfort's ability to steer clear of quaaludes and money. Alright, back to the beer. Parabola's bouquet is definitively bourbon-forward, but remains balanced with incredible tobacco and vanilla scents making themselves known. Like the Toucan from the Fruit Loops ads, the flavor follows the nose. And although the mouthfeel is heavy, it is perfect for this brew. Black as night, you want to sip on this like a fine Scotch. Preferably with a beautiful view or with some good fireside conversation. Worthy of incredibly praise. 1,066 charactersljjpowers, Aug 25, 2015

Drank in a Pipeworks Tales from the Oak 10 oz snifter. 
Appearance: If you believe the theory of The darker the stout,  The better, than this would work for you. Worked for me. 
Smell and taste: Perfectly balanced. So many different notes and flavors, yet nothing overpowered anything else. 
Feel: sublime, warming, filling. Just about hit every taste bud it could find and some I didn't know I had.
Warmed up wonderfully, and was an excellent companion to two and a half hours of late night reading of Hunter S Thompson's biography, "Gonzo". 669 charactersmschrei, Jul 22, 2015

Smell: Raisins, molasses, dark bread, bourbon.
Taste: Hits with a lot up front. Malts (roasted, but not smokey or like burnt coffee at all), brown sugar, wood. Sweet throughout; just enough bitterness to balance. Ends with a nice burst of bourbon.
Mouthfeel: Very thick with low carbonation. Left my mouth with some alcohol vapors to remember it.
Overall: Definitely deserves the Imperial label. I drank 10 ounces over the course of an hour; fortunately it tastes just as good as it nears room temperature. 588 charactersSensorySupernova, Jul 12, 2015

This was wonderful overall and rated slightly higher because it had more bitterness to balance the sweet malt and bourbon flavors.  It was a pleasure to drink this, huge kudos to Ale Arsenal for stashing a keg of this; I don't think I would have been able to try this until next year! 360 charactersChcshammonde, Jul 09, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've been waiting to crack this sucker open for a few months. Couldn't wait any longer! 2015 vintage
Average aggressive pour yeilds about half an inch of tan head. Fades pretty quickly. Looks like its highly carbonated, tons of rising bubbles can be seen if held up to the light. Very very dark black in color.
Aromas. The best way I can describe the smell is chocolate covered bourbon soaked plums. Very very slight banana yeastyness. A little coffee, and maybe a bit of vanilla. 
Taste: first sip..... The aroma misleads. I was expecting a bourbon bomb. Nice and smooth, almost "crushable", for the style, that is. Stone fruit, earthy barrel flavor, caramel dark chocolate truffles, with a bit of bourbon. As it warms in your mouth, the bourbon and barrel become more pronounced, finishing with a nice warmth/booziness. Mouthfeel is nice. Nowhere as near carbonated as it appeared. 
If I had to describe this beer in one word: Smooth. 
Overall, I haven't had too many BB stouts, but I can see why this is in the top 50 brews on this site. Super smooth, balanced, complex goodness, even for a " younger" 2015 vintage brew. Try it, 100%!!! 1,144 charactersBryanReed, Jul 02, 2015

Firestone BA program is top notch and the best example comes from its Parabola.

Appearance:  Pours a gorgeous, completely opaque, pitch-black color with a finger of caramel/chocolate-colored head that quickly dissolved away into a thin lacing of foam that completely covered the top of the beer.
Aroma:  Wow!  Very aromatic, with tons of rich, earthy, roasted malt, which imparted aromas of freshly toasted dark bread, boozy bourbon with lots of dark stone fruit, tobacco, hints of vanilla, caramel, dark chocolate, oak, and dark molasses and tons of caramel.  Smells inviting and delicious!
Taste:  Wow!  Just…wow!  Holy shit, actually!!  Absolutely delicious!  Tons of roasted malt up front, followed by lots of boozy bourbon which imparts lots of dark stone fruit, tobacco, hints of oak, vanilla and lots of brown sugar-like sweetness.  Awesome, spectacular, incredible, world class!
Mouthfeel:  Chewy an extremely smooth as there is no carbonation what-so-ever.  With an ABV of 14.0%, there is a pleasant alcohol warmth on the palate, and a very, very long finish.
Overall:  Wow, just…wow!  Holy shit, actually!!  I totally understand and see why this beer has such a world class reputation!  Next to BCS, this is one of the best beers I’ve ever had!  Absolutely world-class! 1,245 charactersJeffreysan, Jun 12, 2015

2-12-17 -  Found a Proprietor's Reserve 2013 bottle in a box in my basement. Grammy night and the wife and I just downed a 2016 Chimay Reserve. Parabola poured a super dark brown with a nice toffee colored head. The wife took one look and I knew this one was all mine. So good. Great nose/aroma with a thick, spectacular mouthfeel. Better after each sip. 82 IBU on the label, which is why this IPA guy loved this Barrel Aged Imperial Stout. Stout with high bitter? C'mon. 
5-10-15 - On tap at Isaac Newtons in Newtown, PA. Served into a tulip glass. Very like head, but great aroma and taste!  Went back for a second, but the keg was gone. Nice treat on a Wednesday evening. 683 charactersGregaroo, Jun 11, 2015

4.21/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25A: Black with ruby periphery. Wet-sand colored head, nice and thick which is appreciated for a barrel aged brew (suggesting massive hopping), but disappears entirely with no lace.
S: Oak, chocolate, vanilla.
T: Intense dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, pronounced bitterness (alpha acids as well as burnt malt), some coffee. Warm alcohol, some tang like barbecue. Fruit phenols like strawberry on retro-olfaction.
M: Thick, surprisingly non-astringent, mildly oily.
O: Balance and realness of flavors fell short of supreme, and I'm not a fan of hop notes in my stout, but still a solid brew with character to spare. 615 characters1000lbgrizzly, May 30, 2015
4.55/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Serving: 22 oz. bomber poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. No bottled on date, but this is roughly 4 months old at this point. 
A: Not super thick, pours a medium-body, pitch black with a light brown head that sticks around the edges.
S: So for the style, this one is very, very boozy and with a ton of oak, char and barrel characteristics. Underneath that first layer is more tobacco and smoke, followed by a dark chocolates and vanilla notes. 
T: Right up front you're just hit with booze and alcohol. Very hot. Middle of the mouth is your chocolate and vanilla notes, but not too strong. Finishes quite sweet with hints of coconut and dark cherry.
M: For as thin as the appearance is, it's a bit more fuller in the mouthfeel. Decent carbonation. Tons and tons of booze and heat with the burn all the way down your throat. 
O: After hearing so many rave reviews for this beer, it just doesn't live up to the hype for me. I can't get away from how hot and boozy it is, making it seem really unbalanced. It's very, very aggressive. At 4 months, I thought this was ready to go, but maybe not. Right now, BCBS is still the winner, and even Black Note and BB Plead are a touch higher for me. This beer is still great, and a nice representation of the style, but this year's vintage is just a bit too strong and unbalanced for me. 
Recommendation: Even though it's not the best of the best for BA Imperial Stouts, it's still worth fighting for to try at least once. Keep your eyes peeled for this one. 1,504 charactersSparty1224, May 30, 2015

Got lucky to purchase a bottle at bevmo this year(never put on shelves, sold right at the cash register only). Great scents of chocolate and toffee from the BA. Very sweet at first but decadent bourbon flavors ease you into a welcoming boosiness. The bitterness is masked by the incredible scent and outstanding barrel aged flavors. Had the pleasure of trying it on tap at barrelworks in buelton as well. One of my favorite beers. 464 charactersBradfordStuckey, May 26, 2015

4.61/5  rDev +1.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I opened the '15 - just couldn't wait. Hard pour yields some head. However, it's surprising how much carbonation there is. Certainly the beer doesn't have much bite in the sense of carbonation, but with any movement at all thousands of tiny bubbles rise upwards in the murky black liquid. This is a beer with the true black and tan appearance. At first, I had a difficult time depicting the smell, then my wife walked into the room and said, "is that rotten fruit?" Haha! To her defense, the dark fruit comes through far more than any other aroma. And in smell and flavor, The alcohol heat comes through far less than I anticipated, which was instead nice and balanced. Flavor wise, any newcomers to the series should know that these beers are thick and rich with flavor. Parabola is far from being a routine stout. I equivocate its richness to a very dense chocolate cake. The intensity of five or more flavors is difficult to pick apart, yet each taste reminds me that this is definitely a stout, a very dark,  dessert-like one. While there's a little sweetness and syrupyness to this beer, the roastiness aligns with all aspects of its flavoring. It's really one-of-a-kind. 1,176 characterseveryman, May 07, 2015

4.86/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5In my snifter at cellar temperature. I'm excited!
Midnight black, as the label describes it, is accurate. A fleeting sheet of rich-looking dark mocha froth.
That's quite an aroma. VERY forward with dessert-like caramel, butterscotch, and maple. It also has vanilla, oak, toasted pecans, bourbon, leather, earth, and yeasty dark bread dough. It even brings the dark fruits like raisins and plums! Add to all this the most lusciously rich, enticing of dark chocolate scents , and it makes for a superbly sniffable stout.
Oh my dear. That first sip just took me on quite a ride. EVERYTHING I just described above comes through in the flavor, if not more. And it's incredibly well-integrated and smooth. Intense bourbon, leathury oak, vanilla, dark fruits, and chocolate barrage the palate, yet nothing feels over-done. The finish leaves me feeling not cloying sweetness, but rather a dry, almost woody, earthen grainy sensation. Powerful, yet balanced.
The feel is sticky and wonderfully viscous.
Words cannot do this stout justice. 1,034 charactersKuaff, Apr 19, 2015

Many thanks to Kevin for the bottle.
Pours a black color, with a decent, bubbly head.
Aromas reveal a rich Bourbon note among chocolate, coffee and wood. The Bourbon is very well pronounced, hovering on top of sweet, toffeeish malts, bakers chocolate and molasses, well balanced between sweet, earthy and bitter aromas. Toffee and hot Bourbon blend outstandingly well into each other, with coffee playing a balancing role, bittering the nose. 
Drinks incredibly smooth, revealing the rich, decadent body of the beer, with almost no carbonation necessary to showcase its complexity. 
While the Bourbon is very prominent on the nose, it is well integrated into the beers taste, due to earthy malts, wood and creamy milk chocolate, balancing the bourbonic impact. It tastes quite hot though, with coffee blending into the oak incredibly well, exhibiting a slightly dry quality, absorbed by sweeter chocolate with lots of cream.  The bitternes turns quite prominent, due to the wooden, hot bite, inviting matured hops and coffee to the tongue. Until the very end, coffee and chocolate are on par, leading to a semi-dry, slightly burning finish.
Fantastic brew, outstandingly balanced, while providing an amazing depth. Wooden coffee and creamy milk chocolate are balancing the Bourbon artfully, both staying recognizable until the finish, while their taste gets gently transformed due to luscious, slightly dry, warming Bourbon and notes of coconut, as well as vanilla. 1,492 charactersaleigator, Apr 13, 2015

Looks a little strange actually. Doesn't pour as black as some other stouts out there, but that is how parabola has always been. The strange thing is how large the bubbles are on the foam. No head to speak of. But to be expected. 
The smell is glorious however. You get that classic firestone barrel character shining immediately. I get a big amount of brown sugar sweetness, toasted coconut. 
Wooh, this is a big boy. Boozy heat comes in the back end of the sip, starts to tingle and burn the tongue a little. But the first taste is a soft, warm wave of dark chocolate and coconut. It has quite a bit of vanilla and barrel coming through while also maintaining tons of balance. 
Mouthfeel is superb, very velvety, low carbonation. 
This vintage of parabola is coming off a little hot, which it don't quite remember any of their barrel beers being, but this is a super fresh bottle of a 14% abv beer! should be expected. 937 charactersraynmoon, Apr 09, 2015

This is one of my favorite beers.  I get heavy vanilla both in the smell and the taste.  I really like the Anniversary series, and now that I've tried Parabola I see where a lot of the appeal comes from.  If there was any way it could be more awesome, IMO it would be just to have a slightly more heavy feel.  I absolutely love this beer!!
Good thing I bought a bunch of them!! 441 characterstprinzing, Apr 04, 2015

Just a wonderful beer, and oh so glad I have more. Will be interesting to taste side by side with the 2013 and 2014 that has had some time to settle in. 377 charactersMtnSoup, Apr 03, 2015

A.  A jet black poured with a cappuccino colored 2 finger sudsy head. Splashy lacing around glass. 
S.   Bakers chocolate and booze fill the nose. Caramel, Coffee and Vanilla aftertones. Slight licorice notes.   
T.   Very nice.  Chocolate, Caramel, Coffee Bourbon oak boozy, roasted malts all nicely blended together.   Delicious.  Slight bitter aftertaste. 
M.   Creamy, luscious, silky.   A very nice feel in the mouth.   Nice and thick.  8 out of 10 on body.   Slight carbonation.   Finishes clean.   Some warming going down. Can't ask for a whole lot more mouthfeel. 
O.   An excellent beer.   Every aspect.  If there was something to nitpick at and I would have to,  to say much is wrong with this beer it would be the lacing.   It's a bit spotty.   But everything else is pretty top notch. Get this beer and enjoy it! 864 charactersIPAGeorge, Mar 30, 2015

The smell is very classy and subtle. Vanilla, molasses, dried figs, dried cherries, chocolate, the bourbon is present but not overwhelming, there is a subtle hint of alcohol but it adds a little warmth instead of distracting. The flavor is exquisite. Toffee, vanilla, chocolate, mocha. With a nice thick mouthfeel that coats the tongue. This is the most subtle yet perfect BBA Stout I've ever had. 503 charactersBenwayPHD, Mar 26, 2015

4.88/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75This one was the 2014 edition. 
Appearance: Dark frothy caramel colored head that sits there pretty long considering the abv.
Aroma: Vanilla initially is dominant on this one, it does not smell too boozy considering the abv. but the bourbon and the oak do come through on the nose. It also has some roasted malts and a mild hop presence. 
Taste: Bourbon and barrel are upfront, then vanilla and caramel come through in the mid palate. This is not a cloyingly sweet beer its very well balanced and surprisingly not boozy at all considering the 14% abv. It also has a nice velvety smooth mouthfeel. Its a very enjoyable BA stout and I am happy I have had the opportunity to try this one.
Overall: Very well worth the place it holds as one of the best stouts out there! I think this one kicks Bourbon County out of the room. Its not boozy considering the similar abv whereas Bourbon County is very alcoholic in flavor and pretty one sided. This beer is really what most bourbon barrel aged stouts should try to achieve. 1,020 charactershumuloner22, Feb 17, 2015

Smell- Dark chocolate aged in roasty bourbon barrels for her pleasure.
Taste- As if the whiskey barrel creamed in my mouth!
Feel- Creamy, smooth, refreshing and hoping for a call the next day.
Overall- The first time a met her we made love all night. I told myself not to jump straight into the sack with this and build respect for a well founded relationship. But I couldn't help myself. My animal magnetism took over and I did what felt right. I'm thankful she still answers the phone when I call. 586 charactersHeatwave33, Feb 16, 2015

4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5We unleash a bottle of 2013’s “No. 004” into our three-quarter sized tasting snifters.  It glugs out a very dark and oily espresso brown coloring, producing no real head despite a heavy-handed pour.  Small aggregates of chocolate brown bubbles cling to our glasses as you swirl the liquid, but otherwise no lacing comes forwards.  The dregs of the bottle actually helped stir up a half finger’s worth of this same foam, but this wasn’t reproducible either, thereafter.  No haze is noted, but punctate sediment sits suspended throughout.  Carbonation appears to be mildly moderate.  The aroma is breathtaking.  Notes of charred chocolate, coffee, and black malts, musky oak, heavy buttery diacetyls, fresh vanilla, cream cheese cake icing, Graham cracker crustiness and flaky croissant breadiness, black cherry and prune fruitiness, raw barley, chlorine, burnt coconut, aloe and creamy sunscreen chemicals, mild Magic Marker phenols, smoky rye whisky warmth, whole black peppercorns, and sweet molasses enliven the senses.  The flavoring is much, much sweeter than expected at first, but holds onto this harsh and heavy booziness and smokiness on the back to offer supreme balance.  Here, we experience heavily charred barley, clean and bittering chocolate and coffee grain, soured rye grainy grit, brassy metallics, acidic vinegar, hot and fusel bourbon ethanol kick, raisins and dried cherry fruitiness, clove and medicinal phenolic wash, brown sugar sweetness, fired oak, chalked ale yeastiness, campfire char, Concord grape sugars, light soapy hops, creamy vanilla pound cake, dried coconut flakiness, Elmer’s glue, bitter devil’s food cake, raw cacao nibs, and sarsaparilla fumes.  The body is sufficiently full and chewy, and carbonation is medium, but remains soft as you work it around your mouth.  Slurp and smack are as oily as ever, with the same effect subduing froth, cream, and foaminess.  The mouth is slicked, warmed, and wrinkled of tannins, with intermittent twangs of puck and suck, while the lips are left to lick themselves clean of stickiness.  The abv is appropriately large, and the beer sips well between the two of us.
Overall, this is an exceptional offering.  What a few days it has been for us!!  Yesterday we got to enjoy Firestone’s other coveted rarity, §ucaba, and less than twenty-four hours later, we have the supreme pleasure of tackling Parabola.  This pairing has really helped put the landscape of barreling into perspective for us, and have, in part, reestablished where the bar should sit.  From the moment you open the bottle the aroma is already settling into your nasal mucosa, even at a distance.  It highlights some of the most authentic and warming oaky butters we’ve experienced to date, effectively setting the stage for a decidedly serious beer.  With this in mind, the first sip takes you a bit by surprise.  There is so much cloying sweetness to it.  Thankfully, this is transient, and only serves to shock the palate before the real complexity of the flavor begins to settle in.  The final blend is intensely bittering, with primary contributions from the deeply burnt malt bill, the wood, and the booze.  It is simply succulent and wonderfully savory.  If you are going to force us to complain about one thing, it would be the feel.  It was by no means poor, but felt, at times, lacking in substance and creaminess compared to what you’d expect for the style, and for such a big beer.  As we watch the next winter storm creep towards us on the radar, we are thankfully for such a beer to keep us warm through the evening.  This beer should be on everyone’s list, if it isn’t already. 3,662 charactersTheBrewo, Feb 12, 2015

Draft, snifter
2012 Vintage
A – Jet black, opaque, fairly thick. Large light brown bubbles sit on top, with moderate-low retention.  Some lacing remains.
S – Very strong vanilla and bourbon/booze, oaky with sweet chocolate and dark malts.  Some caramel and blackstrap molasses.  Perhaps dark raisins or figs. 
T – Some roasted, bitter black malt, light chocolate, vanilla and bourbon.  Hops are low, on the herbal side.  Definitely some dark molasses.  Booze is prominent but not overwhelming. 
M – Warming from the booze, a lot of bitter malt and chocolate sweetness as the backbone.  Carbonation is moderate. The balance is definitely towards bitterness and alcohol warmth.  Moderately dry finish, with a bittersweet aftertaste. 
O – Great blend of alcohol heat, malt sweetness, and bitterness. Oak gives great character.  A fantastic beer.  Thanks to Falling Rock in Denver for having this on tap. 934 charactersinfinitebruner, Jan 22, 2015

2013 version
L-Black with 1/2 inch mocha head. that fades quickly into a cap that sits atop the beer.  Little to no lacing that slips away quickly
S-chocolate, oak, vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits
T-follows the nose, roasty chocolate, oak, vanilla, molasses, bourbon is present but well blended with other flavors........doesn't dominate, 
F-Thick, low carbonation, viscous
O-flavors and aroma just not coming through for me.  Beer seems to be well balance as no one flavor dominates........sweetness lingers a bit.........alcohol is noticeable but a bit tame for the ABV 593 charactersbeerbully, Jan 01, 2015
4.59/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52014 version poured into a snifter
A- Black, some light on the edges reveals on nice dark brown beer, small brown head.
S- Dark fruits, vanilla, chocolate, molasses, some alcohol. 
T- Lots of molasses, vanilla, sweet chocolate, dark fruits, pretty smooth, some alcohol bite left on the palate. 
M- A nice level of heavy mouthfeel, not too syrupy. Good carb level for a big stout. 
O- I find this beer to be right up there with Black Note and BCBS, very similar flavor and mouthfeel, maybe slightly sweeter than the other two. 530 charactersPaulyB83, Jan 01, 2015

A- pours a midnight black color with no light seeping through, creamy, foamy & bubbly khaki colored head retains for a while, eventually settling to a film on top, some patches of lace being left behind
S- complex aroma starts with walnut fudge brownies & a big hit of chocolate.  Beyond that, layers of caramel & toffee mesh with toasted coconut, vanilla & sherry. Slightly sweet fruit aromas of fig, prune & black cherry.  Toasted charred oak and barrel juice close it out with a hint of coffee at the end 
T- Rich chocolate brownie batter flavor up front with notes of marshmallow cream and coconut.  The fruity flavors immediately follow with notes of rum soaked raisin, black cherry, fig & dates.  Toasted walnut, charred wood, bourbon juice close it out with lingers of espresso coffee & cream
M- viscous chewy body leads to a creamy mouthfeel and a velvety-chewy finish, lingers of alcohol warmth
O- simply a world class RIS, the complexity of this beer is so impressive, and more subtleties are revealing as it warms.  Way too drinkable at 13%, one of my favorites 1,110 charactersTreyliff, Jan 01, 2015

Its still a little tight. I anyone aging this leaving in cellar another 9 months. That would be March 2015 - 2 years after release date at the minimum.
2014 Edition (14%, 82 ibu). This one is even higher abv. With the extra abv I'll cellar this one a full 3 years and I plan to take better tasting notes!
Side note - this is a bba imperial stout, not a RIS and have been categorized incorrectly on BA. 526 charactersHarvest06, Dec 26, 2014

Pours a dense black color with a dark brown head (10 FIDY color). The head is small and fades quickly as befits a high abv beer. Some lacing on the glass.
Rich and complex aroma. Bourbon and chocolate are quickly apparent. There is also some oak, vanilla, and coconut.  Taste is more of the same, big rich chocolate and bourbon flavors. The woody (oak) flavor is strong too. There is a hint of vanilla and coconut. The alcohol is still present after 3 years of aging.
Mouthfeel is incredibly rich with some warming ahcohol presence and a little alcohol burn.  This is a slow sipper, but a very enjoyable one.  Lives up to the hype.  A great beer. 718 charactersJayQue, Dec 16, 2014

4.65/5  rDev +2.4%The 2014 vintage clocks in at the highest abv yet though doesn't feel it.  Wonderful barrel notes of bakers chocolate, barrel char, notes of sweet vanilla and coconut.  A little dark fruit comes through as well.  The palate is much richer - brilliant bitter dark chocolate, char, oak, vanilla and the firestone coconut, which is not as prominent as it is in DDBA and sucaba. Very smooth but a little thin.
Don't get a lot of bourbon-whiskey on this, but I do get the great caramelized barrel flavors.  Fantastic beer as is expected from the FW barrel program 559 characterstimc100, Dec 13, 2014

Until one day I found a bottle sitting in a minifridge in the back of an Irish Pub. That was the single greatest beer purchase I have ever made. 
It poured dark with a small head, the bottle was about a year old not sure if that really makes a difference with a beer like this. It smelled slightly of bourbon and roasted malts. The taste was incredible, very well balanced and the bourbon flavor was simply amazing, it was truly an experience. 600 charactersLoldong, Nov 19, 2014

Pours very dark but not motor oil dark like I like these beers. Smell is intensely sweet bourbon and the taste follows. The beer seems like it would benefit from cellaring at least another year to mellow out. 230 charactersbarhoc11, Nov 16, 2014

Pours pitch black color with a 1-2 finger dense tan head with good retention, that reduces to a small cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings around the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toasted coconut, toffee, oak, bourbon, tobacco, light char, and roast/oak earthiness; with some light alcohol/booze. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt and oak barrel notes; with solid strength. Taste of big milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toasted coconut, toffee, bourbon, oak, tobacco, light char, and roast/oaky earthiness. Fair amount of roast/oak bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toasted coconut, toffee, bourbon, oak, tobacco, light char, and roast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt and oak barrel flavors; with a great malt/barrel balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. A very slight oak astringency was present but not detrimental. Light-medium carbonation an full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, and fairly slick mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely incredible barrel aged imperial stout. All around outstanding complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the big ABV. An insanely delicious offering as I expected. 1,627 characterssuperspak, Nov 14, 2014

Appearance - Black. Completely opaque. Small mocha colored head. 
Aroma - Amazing. Sweet Hersey like chocolate. Deep roasted malts and a faint expresso. Subtle bourbon and oak. Some vanilla too. 
Taste - Smooth, perfectly balanced bourbon. Something along the lines of figs, raisins, or cherries. Slightly charred malt. Molasses and rich chocolate. Not much coffee here. Alcohol is very well integrated. 
Feel - Silky smooth, fairly viscous. 
Overall - This is world class barrel aged stout that is worthy of it's ranking. 540 charactersWesMantooth, Nov 09, 2014

Appearance: pours a fairly light black with lots of brown to mahogany around the edges. a finger or just less of a tan head that has decent retention and leaves behind a small lacing. some brownish sludge left as it swirls. completely opaque with darkness.
Smell: bourbon and chocolate mixture. sweet caramels along with some roasted malts. some vanilla and oak qualities. alcohol.
Taste: opens with a strong bourbon with light notes of vanilla and oak. a caramelized malt character comes through along with some decadent chocolate. some slight roasted malts. alcohol is present throughout.
Mouthfeel: heavy and slick. alcohol warmth and some bitterness.
Overall: after being disappointed by Sucaba and highly disappointed by Velvet Merkin I didn't expect much from this. but this one lives up to every bit of its reputation. a big and nicely decadent ba stout. perfect for the cold winter night, or national stouts day. 959 charactersSportsandJorts, Nov 07, 2014

Very smooth, semi-rich, dark as night and lightly carbonated. Dont enjoy this too cold, the alcohol is hidden, let Parabola warm down to expense the true flavors. A great label and a great beer. Super sought after in the places it doesn't make it to and I can see why. 307 charactersfloridadrift, Nov 04, 2014

A bit less complex flavor (but not aroma) than the Black Tuesday that preceded this, with more coffee and higher bitterness. The ABV seems much lower than the actual 19.2% or 18%, respectively.  Dark chocolate and coffee linger on in the aftertaste, with plenty of dark roasted grains. Very faint burnt toast component. 377 characterschinchill, Nov 04, 2014

4.92/5  rDev +8.4%2013 Vintage. Pours black as motor oil with no head to speak of. Lots of chocolate, bourbon and and roasted malt on the nose. The first thing you notice upon the first sip is just how smooth this beer is. The next thing you notice is how amazingly balanced this beer is. Firestone Walker has a world class barrel program, keep up the great work! 345 charactersJohnG190, Nov 03, 2014

5/5  rDev +10.1%I had this beer on draft at the Green Onion Pub in Utica, NY.  First all, if any of you readers are in the Utica area, be sure to drop into "The Onion".   Their craft/import beer offerings are high quality, and often exotic as well.  It's an old english style pub, no TV's, just great beer, great wine, exceptional single malts, and other small batch whisky, and great music.    
As for the Parabola.  Wow, a flavor bomb!  It is as impressive of a beer as you will ever have.  Nuff said. 488 charactersmirp1, Oct 31, 2014

22 oz bomber poured into a snifter
I've reviewed this before but lost my notes, 2010-ish batch.  This beer is one of the best to cellar for a couple (or more) years, but I'll do a proper review of a fresh batch
A:  Black in color, completely opaque.   Any head that forms quickly collapses under its own weight.
S:  The nose is boozy and oaky but complex.   Strong notes of ripe fruit and carob, boozy sweet bread.   The oak canvasses notes clove and mint. 
T/M:  Much sweeter on the palate than the nose would lead.  The ripe fruit is replaced by cocoa and coffee, although hints of raisin are noted.    Malt-forward, but there's enough hop and oak astringency to keep the flavors aligned.  The flavor profile is supported by a rich, chewy complexion, giving the chocolate notes a buttery aspect.   Long, sweet finish.
Simply one of the best beverages in existence. 883 charactersrand, Oct 04, 2014

2014 Vintage
A: 4.75 Looks quite thick on the pour. In the glass, it’s pitch black with a half inch tan head that lasts a couple minutes. 
S: 4.75 The nose is excellent. Lots of bourbon, vanilla, and roasted malt up front, but it’s followed quickly by much more subtle aromas. There is cinnamon, berries, graham crackers, cocoa, and coffee. The roasted malt and big bourbon still dominate, but the background aromas are nicely intertwined with the bigger characteristics.
T: 4.75 Like the nose, there’s a lot of roasted malt and bourbon. At first, there’s a good amount of sweetness (though a bit less than expected). The fruitiness is a bit stronger than on the nose, but it is quickly followed by a lot’s of coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt leaving a pleasant bitterness on the aftertaste similar to eating good, dark chocolate. The alcohol presence is very minimal for 14%. 
M: 4.5 Carbonation is just right. The beer is very thick, but not quite a much as BCBS, so there’s a little room for improvement. Still, it’s rich and thick and extremely satisfying. Also, surprisingly easy drinking (but still a sipper). 
O: 4.75 This is a superb stout. You can tell that the base beer is high quality and the bourbon really adds to it rather than covering up flaws. I would like to compare this to BCBS, but in truth they are quite different. This is a bit more roasty, bitter, and less sweet with surprisingly fruity flavors that balance out all the richness. I once did a side-by-side with a 2013 of each, and the BCBS was the clear winner, but there’s something really special about this 2014, so I might have to give it another shot ☺. 1,682 charactersTele, Sep 28, 2014

Opens with a soft pop and pours dead black into the glass with a fleeting deep brown cap.  Offers a complex aroma with some light ethanol notes generally subdued by rich malts and a pleasant blend of barrel aromas.  More chocolate emerges with warming.
Taste is rich and back to basics vs. the aroma.  Lots of rich dark malts, some cherry and fig, along with a touch of wood at the end of a rather long finish.  Offers a spritzy carbonation which is more than expected given the light foam on the pour.  Rich and full in feel without being overbearing and a hint of vanilla on the finish.  Solid stuff with a couple years on it... 713 charactersHalfFull, Sep 28, 2014

2015 - All of the above + caramelize sugar, vanilla, and breadiness.  Everything is superbly balanced.  BCBS is more rich, but this has a more complex and intricate smell, taste, and feel.  This is a winner. 291 charactersmabermud, Sep 14, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +4.6%2014 vintage.
A: pours slightly translucent black with a half finger of tan head which dissipates quickly and leaves a slim ring around the glass. no lacing. to be expected for such a high alcohol brew.
S: wonderful. soft bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate, coffee, dark malt, roast. very complex. no one of these dominates.
T: follows the nose. soft bourbon notes, oaky vanilla, dark chocolates and coffee with a malty roast backbone. slightly dry finish with a very slight trace of alcohol.
M: mouth feel is good, but could maybe be a little thicker. carbonation is nice (low carbonation as is appropriate for the style) bourbon and dark chocolate lingers in the palate well after swallowing.
O: This is an incredible beer! Definitely not all hype. Well worth the price tag. 779 charactersilikebeer03, Sep 13, 2014

Location: Trade
Glassware: Snifter
Appearance: Pours pitch black and allows no light through. Large light brown head with good retention. A lace of carbonation and alcohol ring the side of the glass when swirled. The carbonation falls quickly but the alcohol ring remains. 
Aroma: Smells of bourbon, cocoa powder are the heavy hitters. Some fruity esters from alcohol, think cherries and figs. Some cereals surprised to get a light oatmeal (even if is titled oatmeal stout). 
Taste: The taste is lovely, nice hits of vanilla, cocoa powder, big boozy bourbon, cherry fruit, port, oatmeal cereal, dark malts. 
Mouthfeel: Heavy body and medium carbonation. This beer weighs like a brick on my tongue. At times it feels smooth but on the whole it has a coarseness like cocoa on the tongue. Some viscitude from the bourbon but it is surprisingly low. 
Notes: Tragically, this bottle was heat damaged from a loss of power to the fridge. There was a strong smell of soy and it was found in the flavor to a lesser extent. I did my review of the beer omitting those flavors, and graded it accordingly, but I will cellar need to rereview this at a later time. 1,165 charactersKornWallace, Sep 01, 2014

5/5  rDev +10.1%The owner of Brookland Pint, DC's newest beer bar, really pulled out all the stops for the draft list on its grand opening this week. It was packed with rarities, many from the West Coast, like 2013 Speedway Stout, FW Stickee Monkee and Parabjava, and even a keg of "G'Dale" from Oskar Blues Brewing ( a blend of Dale's Pale and G'Knight). Now, these all sounded fantastic, but when I saw they had 2013 Firestone Walker Parabola, I felt compelled by the higher forces of beer geekery to FINALLY have what many consider to be the finest barrel-aged stout in the land. 
Appearance: Pitch black, thin light tan head of less than one finger. Nothing astonishing about the appearance, other than some serious alcohol legs. 
Smell: Huge oak and bourbon, some dark fruit (figs) and vanilla. This aroma only intensifies as the beer warms, becoming more noticeably chocolatey--and alcoholic--than it was at first pour. 
Taste: Just insane. Massive vanilla, bourbon, and dark chocolate, with the bourbon essence really shining. A light espresso bean roastiness is mixed in there with a truly gorgeous amount of subtlety. Flavors keep changing as I drink. Sloshing the beer around in the sides of my mouth produces a flavor that is much more overtly chocolatey. The alcohol is present in the flavor, but it adds some spicy-sweet complexity to the flavor profile. As with the nose, so with taste; as it warms up, this beer evolves nicely, gaining a more pronounced brown sugar-molasses type sweetness. After about 45 minutes, this beer is at its true peak. So sip it slowly!
Mouthfeel: Velvet smooth, thick and full bodied (thanks to the oats, no doubt). The alcohol warmth is mild and not accompanied by any burn. 1,707 charactershagbergl, Aug 21, 2014

It's really smooth and there is still a little bit of heat on this that warms the mouth.  No real standout flavor for me.  There's some roast, oak, and vanilla but the bourbon is the spotlight.  Outstanding BA stout. 367 charactersPHBoiler, Aug 18, 2014
4.54/5  rDev 0%Thanks to eyebereej for this one! Reviewed from notes. Poured from bomber into a Peg's snifter.
A: Pours essentially black and opaque. With streams of bubbles coming up the sides of the glass, it forms a thin tan head that fades fairly quickly. 4.5/5
S: Rich bourbon, heavily roasted malts, oak tannins, some vanilla from the oak, cacao, and dark sticky fruits. Very nice aroma. 19/20
T: Sticky roasted malts, chocolate malts, bourbon up front. Some charred oak, cacao, vanilla, and rum-raisin sweetness. This is complex to the point I feel like there's trouble pulling everything out. It develops some cola character as it warms as well. It finishes sweet and sticky with some hop bitterness as well. 41/45
M: Sticky mouthfeel, but a body that is of average weight for style. This isn't one of those crazy-thick imperial stouts. The alcohol is actually pretty well-restrained, or at least integrated, for style. Average carbonation sensation. 8.5/10
O: This was a very, very good beer. Truly deserves its reputation. I didn't pull anything out of the flavors to suggest the oatmeal in the mash. But otherwise, no real complaints. Recommended, of course. 19/20

3.54/5  rDev -22%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.52012 Vintage
A: poured with vigor into a snifter glass, the beer produced a finger of tan head composed of mixed bubbles. The foam sustained for about a minute before receding and left a layer of larger sized bubbles in the center with a ring around the edge. Streaky lacing when the carbonation is kicked up and medium alcohol legs are visible. The beer is opaque black with just a hint of dark brown when the carbonation kicks up on the top.
S: When the cap was cracked there was already an oak aroma seeping from the bottle. In the glass, big dark chocolate, coffee and molasses aroma. Vanilla and oak, with caramel and toffee notes are moderate in strength. Sweet impression overall with bourbon noticeable but no ethanol or harshness. Some mild citrus hop notes are also coming through surprisingly.
T: Lots of complexity from the malts - dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses very upfront followed by caramel, vanilla, smoke, tobacco and roast. I get an interesting chocolate malt flavor as the beer warms up that reminds me of tasting pale chocolate malt in a homebrew shop – oxidation?. The barrel isn't as dominant in the flavor as the nose would lead me to believe, but there is some oak, vanilla and toffee notes mixed with light bourbon. No hop flavor and the bitterness is subdued.
M: Moderate alcohol warming, the beer drinks like its a 12%. Carbonation is mild to low with a big body like you'd expect from the style. There is some tingling on the lips/tongue from the bourbon.
O: I have to wonder if this beer isn't in the greatest shape given it's scores and reputation. Granted it has some age on it, if cellar'd decently that should have mellowed out some of the harsher qualities. However the malt/roast flavors coming through to me seem stale and or oxidized. Maybe I need to try a fresher example so I can give it a higher score but as it stands.. it didn't do so hot. CW16 is still my favorite BA Stout - I'll stick to that while I have a few left 1,979 charactersguityler83, Aug 14, 2014

You find you have a tiger by the tail...or should I say it's got you. There's so much going on in the glass it's difficult to home in on where to start. Each sip is different from the last & they are spiraling upwards until you reach a plateau of familiarity that has simplified all the complexities of aroma & flavors that make up this admirable brew & you start to feel at home & very comfortable. 
Not for the faint of heart (or anyone driving). I found myself sipping at a leisurely pace for 1) enjoyment 2) preservation of the potion, as it's a rare find & 3) self preservation. The 12.5% ABV, although present in every sip, never let's on that this is for adults only. Think of it as an encounter on a plane trip, sitting next to some extremely attractive & engaging person & your smitten. It's a short lived experience & most likely once in a lifetime. Because of that, all feelings are multiplied & enhanced, in memory, by distance from the moment. 
Do yourself a big, big flavor favor & make some time for this indulgence. If you do I guarantee your self esteem will improve based on that decision alone. 1,228 charactersseedyone, Aug 08, 2014

Very pretty beer. Black as all hell, with a surprising amount of frothy head. Great lace and an expectedly heavy dose of booze legs.
An intense variety of chocolate on the nose... brownie, milk chocolate, bitter dark chocolate, dry cocoa... all soaked in a wave of bourbon.
The taste follows suit in every sense. The bourbon/heat becomes very evident here; the high ABV is magnified by a bourbon barrel presence that dominates more than in any other beer I can think of. 
This is dessert. 506 charactersramay86, Jul 30, 2014

A: At first glance, this is pitch black with absolutely no light penetrator. On closer examination, I swear there is a bit of deep mahogany brown lurking. One finger mocha colored head that settled quickly to a thin ring leaving very little lacing.
S: A wonderful bouquet of sweet bourbon, fresh picked cherries, vanilla, and good chocolate. Maybe a little hint of coconut and espresso.
T: Lots of bourbon bursts on the tongue from the first sip. Dark chocolate, roasted malts, espresso, and vanilla. The flavors remind me quite a bit of BCBS.
M: Full body coating the tongue nicely. Just a little alcohol burn at the end but not unexpected considering the 14% ABV. 
O: Completely and utterly fantastic stout. One of my top three for sure. I really wish this was available in 12 oz bottles and distributed in my area. 879 charactersrichj1970, Jul 28, 2014

If you only pour a bit like I did you will not see too much of the mocha colored head but it does refresh even though I did not pour one. It created a ring as I swirled it and left spot of lace and alcohol legs. In the natural light the beer showed a deep chestnut brown with engaging clarity. ( In the photo you can see my face in the beer)
Deep rich, sweet chocolate and hearty roasted malt combine on the nose. Subtle blushing cherries, bold bourbon and a bit of espresso coffee. The bourbon is like a flower that opens on the nose. It is fragrant and seductive. There is a scent of toasted coconut that is light and accented by a bit of vanilla. Dark fruits dance gayly in the background. Molasses rounds out the nose and the scent of sweetened nuts.
The palate is alive at once with earthy and full roast. This malt has been brought to the edge of blackness and yet it stays mellow and tempered with sweetness that collapses inward on all it's sides. The blushing cherry, the dry date, the light and airy oak, the creamy coconut and vanilla. The malt is dry and firm but just bitter enough to come up to the brink of char and stop short. Nothing burnt here. Smooth, creamy, chewy, full mouthfeel. Exceptional smoothness. The molasses takes over the palate as this finishes with bourbon getting lighter and the dark fruits getting stronger.
A slightly boozy finish takes hold at the very last moment of the swallow not with a big taste of alcohol but with a warmth like a smile from a gracious host who is sincerely happy to have set all this before you. The alcohol leaves a bit dry and fully engages the senses one more time before it's done.
Drinking this beer is like doing something you know is wrong and loving every minute of it. 1,815 charactersutopiajane, Jul 27, 2014

Slightest of coffee, mainly toasted nuts, roasted malt, and bourbon to finish.
The coffee is still very slight in the overall flavor, but adds a nice roasted nuttiness to this monster of a beer. A lot of bourbon and dark chocolate are also prevalent.
Mouthfeel is thick, like I said before much like crude oil.
Overall, not my favorite BBA imperial stout, but nonetheless an amazing example of one. 495 characterslarryarms847, Jul 27, 2014

Pours pitch black with a nice dark brown half finger head that lingers a while, just a thin lacing later on.
The smell tells you this will be incredible. There's great rich dark chocolate, smokey roasted malts, espresso, toffee, some dark fruit, some bourbon barrel (without any booze tho), faint tobacco, and much more.
Taste started with rich milky chocolate , salted toffee and dark fruit (plum, raisin, some fig). Huge tasty vanilla, lots of oak, nice bourbon, again, with a great flavour-enhancing abv that never gets boozy. Barrel notes intensify, roasted malts and some nice coffee start appearing, but the initial tastiness is never pushed away. Great complexity.
Perfect mouthfeel.
Had just a few quick notes, so i'm sure i didn't get to write down all about this beer, and i'm sure i wouldn't be able either way. There's a huge complexity here (incredible barrel-aging), incredible flavours, setting this one as the best beer i've ever had, without any doubts. 984 charactersdcmchew, Jul 21, 2014
4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5One of the best beers I have ever had in my life. Poured with a gorgeous, thick, luxurious head which left delicate lacing on my glass. The taste of slightly roasted cocoa nibs and mocha was so smooth I thought I had died and gone to heaven. Smooth, thick, rich, round, yet still clean and refreshing on the finish. I have never had a more perfect beer. I am so glad I have another, because I cannot wait to taste this with some age, I can't even fathom how it could be improved! 479 charactersToriBug13, Jul 20, 2014

4.3/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25A unique beer.
Pours a light brown beer, almost looks like chocolate syrup with water, or watered chocolate. Forms bubbles immediately. Aroma is heady, coffee, chocolate. Taste is very strange. It is a heady beer but it is highly carbonated, and the carbonations tickles the tongue in a way that doesn't let you taste the high alcohol. Very strange feeling. The body is very light, not a heavy beer. 400 charactersJulioH, Jul 20, 2014

Pours opaque black. The 1/2 inch khaki head quickly fades to a thin ring on top and leaves faint spotty lace. 
The smell is of dark chocolate, vanilla, pipe tobacco, coffee, oak and faint bourbon. 
The taste is of brown sugar, dark chocolate, earthy almost herbal oak, vanilla and just a hint of bourbon. 
The texture is heavy bodied and slightly oily with medium carbonation. 
Amazing aromas and flavors. This is a little thinner in body and more carbonated than I expected. Goes down scary smooth considering the 13% ABV. World class. 555 charactersFurlinator, Jul 20, 2014

Drank at a bottle share alongside Black Xantas and KBS. Parabola definitely holds up next to these beers even though I think KBS edges it out slightly. I enjoyed the info on the label and was surprised how high the IBUs are for not seeming too hoppy. Definitely recommend if you like BA stouts or Imperial Stouts. 491 charactersSmokesnotes, Jul 14, 2014

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured my bottle of Firestone Walker Parabola 2014 into a snifter.
Appearance-Upon pouring Parabola into the snifter, I noticed the midnight black color. Extremely dark at first, but as it settled, a small amount of dark brown reddish foam stayed at the top of the pour.
Smell-Smelled a lot like the 2013 release with some additions. It had a boozy smell at first, with vanilla, bourbon, and the sweetness of chocolate. 
Taste-Had a small amount of smoke. The more I drank, the more chocolate I got. A lot like the chocolate oak aged yeti but more complex.
Mouthfeel-Overall it was very smooth, not chalky like I had expected. It was a nice surprise, and very easy to drink even with the high alcohol content.
Overall-One of the best beers I've ever tasted. I have 3 more bottles of this years brew, and I'm very excited to see how this years vintage ages. 861 charactersLarbear2497, Jul 09, 2014

Brownie, raisin, chocolate, maple and coconut meet the nose as this has glimpses of a barleywine.
The flavor is all barleywine with dark fruit, raisin, chocolatey sweetness, caramel malt, toffee malt, barley and wine. Vanilla begins to form on the palate as it warms.
The feel is velvety, with a slight alcohol heat and a touch of alcohol tang. It has a nice thickness to it as well.
Very good beer but I thought I was drinking Bourbon County Barleywine the entire time, which isn't a bad thing. 671 charactersKYGunner, Jul 02, 2014

A: Very deep, dark brown with a reddish tinge where the light hits toward top and bottom of the glass. The red tinge is subtle, but enough that I can't call this Black; maybe a few shades darker than cola. 3/4 finger, khaki, roasted tan head. Head diminished quickly to only a thin film atop the beer. 
S: Wow. Depends on the stage of temperature...this one changes that much. Fresh from the pour, it was not at all what I expected. Whiskey, not bourbon is what hit me in the face. Chocolate and toffee was very faintly present. First thought was: watered down whiskey/cola drink. First thought, based on this, was along the lines of, "I let the hype get me, and this is going to be a let down." NOT SO FAST!! This one morphs as it warms; quickly, at that. What I described as "whiskey" quickly evolved into sweet bourbon, vanilla, and wood. This is what I expected! The chocolate and and roastiness remained as the vanilla became more pronounced. Amazing.
T: based on my initial "nose." I did NOT expect what I tasted. Unlike the whiskey/soda nose, a wave of chocolate and roasted malt hit me. Just as quickly, it fell and finished clean with sweet vanilla and faint toffee. This one changed and presented me with something new as it warmed, and with almost every sip. The bourbon and vanilla/woody tastes became more and more apparent as it warmed. Hints of dark fruit are detectable as well; fig? Dark chocolate and roasted malt linger in the aftertaste. The faintest bit of oatmeal and toffee remain. Vanilla, bourbon, wood continue to dominate 40 minutes later. Could swear there was some caramel in there too. Exceptionally complex beer!
M: this is where the beer could have been a tad bit better, in my opinion. The mouth feel was, though silky and smooth, lighter than anticipated. While not all bad, it wasn't as full bodied as I would have preferred. Was hoping for more "oomph"...thicker and chewier. While not what I was expecting, it certainly wasn't a bad mouth feel.
Overall: this is by far the most complex beer I have had to date. The aroma, the number of favors I picked up as the beer warmed, and the way it all worked was phenomenal. So complex, yet so well made. No one aspect of this beer felt out of place or overwhelmed any other No matter how much, or how little, each piece contributed...they all worked together to create a master piece. 
If looking at style, this one tops the List of BA beers I've had to date: Black Note, KBS, Uncle Jacob's (2012), Black Crack, among others...none are this good. Wow... 2,619 charactersBullDoza, Jul 01, 2014

Pours a complete black with a head that completely vanishes in under a minute. No lacing at all. 
Smell is huge on the bourbon! Some chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and roasted malt on the nose.
Taste is the bomb. The chocolate bourbon flavor is right there at first and then some vanilla, coffee, molasses, and an oaky spice in there also.
Feel is everything you want in a BA Stout. Thick, chewy, not very carbonated. Drinks heavvvvy.
Overall this is a perfectly executed BA stout in my book. Incredibly well done and always a treat to have. 593 charactersaoampm, Jul 01, 2014

This beer is very very special for me. Some background is required (jump to TASTING if you don't care). 
First off, I discovered Parabola in spring of 2011 or 2012, as part of a flight of imperial stouts in a bar. This changed my life. Before tasting Parabola, I had no idea about the world of vintage beer, barrel aged beer, and most importantly, how an imperial stout could be good. Before that I cared more or less for stout, but now I was in shock. It's afterward that I started buying and aging beer at home. It's been my favorite beer since then, and I don't hesitate to drive for hours and spend lots of money to get some.
Anyway, forward to November 2013. I'm at Boneyard Bistro in Sherman Oaks (CA), and surprise, they have a vertical flight of Parabola: 2011-2012-2013. I'm freaking out!! The 2012 and 2013 vintage were excellent, as usual, but the 2011 vintage.... HO. LY. SH*T. It was like 10x better. Oh my god.
So much in fact, that I declared on several occasions that I would pay good money for a bottle of 2011. Well it looks like the universe heard me! Few days ago I was in Las Vegas, and oh surprise, Aces And Ales is selling the bottle for $75, which is what I was expecting. I thought screw it, it's now or never. I brought the bottle home, and opened it last night. And then...
TASTING
First off, it's an incredibly complex beer. It's hard to describe it in few lines. Furthermore, my impressions evolved during the tasting. Although I will present each sensory aspect separately, in reality I took notes on those aspects throughout the tasting: smell, taste, smell, taste, repeat for an hour and half.
Appearance
The beer pours an opaque black color, topped with a rich mocha head. Swirling the beer in the glass shows thick viscosity that sticks onto the glass wall. Promising!
Aroma
Initially, Parabola lets out smells of malt, lots of licorice, as well as molasses and dark fruit: prune and red raisin, with a touch of blackberry. Those aromas combine marvelously with an impression of brown sugar, typical of the Firestone vintage beer (I strongly suspect their British house yeast).
Once passed the first impression, I realize that the beer has definitely maderized. Very soft aromas of fortified wine and port caress my nostrils.
Then the dessert side of the beer imposes itself smoothly. First, a note of cola. Yes, sweet cola! There is a candy character that's hard to define, something like toffee, truffle, and very subtle chocolate.
It is late that the roasted malt manifests itself, via a subtle coffee aroma, accompanied by black cherry.
The barrel qualities are pratically absent from the aromatic profile. The wood and bourbon are so timid that I didn't really get them. No worries though.
Taste
Madera and a note of port wine welcome my taste buds. Another sip, and molasses and licorice show up. A solid start.
Oh hey, the wood and bourbon of the barrel finally show their nose! It was about time. The bourbon is however closer to whiskey than bourbon. A very dry quality, less sweet than bourbon.
At last, the dessert persona arrives. It's like I'm drinking sugar pie (a French Canadian specialty dish: brown sugar, butter and cream, mostly) spiced with nutmeg and cinnamon. Wow. After swallowing the ichor, caramel and toffee linger for a while. It's later, when the beer has warmed up in my glass, that dates and vanilla softly augment an experience that is already rich and fabulous.
It is very late that I detect the nuances confered by age, via subtle notes of tobacco and leather.
Overall, the flavor profile is incredibly balanced, very smooth and mellow. Sometimes, bourbon barrel aged beers are too "bourbonny" for my taste. This is not the case here. The wood and bourbon take a back seat, letting the other comedian express themselves freely. A perfect harmony.
Mouthfeel
Toward the end of my first sip, a sensation of rough texture manifests on my tongue. I would describe it as when when you eat waffle cookies, and lingers a little bit. The sensation amplifies during the finale. Surprising, but not unpleasant. However, this sensation completely goes away after few sips.
A chewiness, typical of imperial stouts, accompanies the rough texture. Contrary to that texture however, the chewiness doesn't go away. The beer is completely round. I suspect the use of oats grants it great velvety quality. The beer coats my tongue and leaves a soft viscous impression.
The heat from the alcohol warms up my throat during the finale, but is not burning. Very pleasant.
Overall
A spectacular beer, nothing less. Very mellow, very smooth, yet bold, complex and multi-faceted. No aroma or flavor is competing with another, nothing feels overwhelming or off-balance. It completely deserves it's rating, and then some. 4,828 charactersBrew_Bear, Jun 29, 2014

A: Thick oil black, viscous brew. Completely opaque, no light able to pass through this guy – Head is thin, just shy of one finger with a flecked silvery bronze hue. Body looks big and chewy – lacing appears weak along with retention and carbonation. 
S: Tangy, roasted malts, bitter, dark chocolate, smoke, some acidity of tobacco and rich wood. Coffee beans, espresso, light hints of aged liquor, whisky and bourbon. Aggressive nose that reminds me of a smoldering fire pit, lightly earthy, very roasty 
T: Sweet warm bourbon leads the charge with superb power. Espresso, chocolate liqueur, and a pungent smoky character follow the Bourbon; the smoke accompanies notes of burnt tobacco and oak. The middle mouth showcases a fantastic melding of sweet chocolate malts, chocolate syrup and the bitter elements imparted by ground coffee bean, bakers chocolate, vanilla extract, and a light nuttiness. The barrel profile instills essences of black cherry, date, and amaretto - Hop character is blended and quite indirect, robust vanilla bean chauffeurs in the finish, which is warming without being overly boozy. 
M: Big oil slicked chewy mofo, the mouth feel you seek in a big stout. Little to no carbonation. Aftertaste is sweet and aged tasting – syrupy and very reminiscent of bourbon. 
O: This is a fantastic imperial stout. Possibly the best I’ve had. Excellent BA character, big body, sweet while also piquantly bitter - There are a lot of elements here that seamlessly coalescence - exhibiting the essentials; roasty malts, sweet warming bourbon, while also presenting a aged resin with a bit of dank earth. Itsss aaaa parrrabbbboooolaaaa. Get some. 1,695 charactersZagZagg, Jun 18, 2014

For my 100th review, I'm going to put down my long-standing "favorite beer," recently dethroned by BCBCS 2013.
A: Pours a deep, opaque, syrupy black with minimal fine khaki head. Very little light through the edges of the glass reveals a dark brown color. 4.5
S: Caramel and chocolate are prominent; along with vanilla, coconut, bourbon, and oak from the barrel. A very slight smoke character has emerged in this bottle. Interestingly, in another three months most of the coconut and vanilla that I found on this bottle were nowhere to be found in either of two 2013 bottles opened. 4.75
T/M: Thick, slightly coating, and with moderate carbonation (that pretty quickly leaves as the beer warms.) Caramel, cocoa, and mild bitterness lead into swelling notes of molasses, light coffee roastiness, and finally a coconut and vanilla finish. Since then the coffee has begun to fall off slightly and some more dark fruit character has emerged. 4.75/4.75
O: After almost a year, still a phenomenal beer. I think I'm finding out that I actually prefer Parabola from fresh to just under a year in age, but even with those bottles that I've enjoyed slightly less I have had no real complaints. My favorite parts about this (and most of FW's barrel-aged beers) are the coconut and vanilla notes, so I strongly prefer enjoying this while they are still present. 1,410 charactersjdhowe, Jun 15, 2014

Aroma is roasted malt, sweet bourbon, and tobacco. Caramel and toffee add more sweetness.  Undertones of chocolate and coffee.
Taste is bourbon, cocoa, oak, tobacco, and caramel.  Hints of vanilla.  Mild espresso.  Rich malt undertones tie everything together.  Sweet without being cloying or syrupy.  
Rich, luscious mouth feel.  Full body.  Oily, thick, and creamy.  Paints the tongue with flavor.  Mild carbonation.  
This is a true standout beer.  Amazing complexities in both aroma and taste.  Everything blends and compliments well.  Great sipper.  Even with the high abv, I didn't get any alcohol notes. 784 charactersleroybrown10, Jun 15, 2014

A: fairly vicious machine pild black. Nice carbonation for a ba stout. Solid tracing.
S: admittedly a little offputting but I've noticed this during the aging process in the past. Somewhat muted bitterness from dark chocolate and coffee notes. Subtle esters. Deep fruit but not prominent. Fresh smells a lot better although some might say a bit harsher.
T: more balanced albeit the coffee is toned down and rather muted. It lingers on the finish very nice. Good bourbon character and sweetness from the hh barrels. Currants come through with some vanilla. No ester presence. Some mild prune, deep fruits, but mostly luxurious coffee. Not perfect but close. 
M: solid with no alcohol burn. The finish is very clean. Coats the mouth well. Would love a thicker mouthfeel but this is nice. More subtle with age.
Overall: a hyped up barrel aged stout that deserves the hype. Its balanced and still hasn't complete lost the coffee and it hasn't distorted the beer either. I thoroughly enjoyed the 2014 fresh. The flavors come out real well. Firestone makes ba beers that drink really well fresh which I appreciate although this is more balanced with zero alcohol presence. Fresh smells a lot better too. Overall a difficult beer to review because time changes this a lot for the better. 1,375 charactersputonyourwalkingshoes, Jun 08, 2014

4.33/5  rDev -4.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Brief re-re-review of the 2014 vintage. Now, I can safely say, Parabola finally lives up to the hype. All the best qualities of the '13 vintage (the depth, the richness, the bourbon character) was here in full force, but - despite being 14% - it wasn't that harsh. The oak was prevalent, but the fusel-y abrasiveness of the '13 was almost perfectly muted this time around. I was really shocked how well balanced this was (especially taking the last 2 vintages into account). Only thing I can really nitpick now is that it was rather sweet - hell, so is BCBS, and look at the score I still gave it! This is everything I hoped Parabola would be ever since I moronically spent $40 for a bottle at a DC bar 2 years ago.
2014: (3.5/4.25/4.5/4.5/4.25)
2013: (3.5/4/4/4/4)
2012: (2.5/3/4.5/3.5/3.5)
----
Re-review of the 2013 vintage. 22 oz bottle poured into a snifter.
A: Pours a very dark brown color; it isn't quite as pitch black as the 2012 version. There's more head than the previous vintage, though - a one finger khaki shade. It doesn't last a very long time, however a thin collar of lacing is left on the side of the glass.
S: There's a lot of dark chocolate at first, subtly augmented with a good bourbon character. Concentration will yield additional notes of brown sugar, hazelnut, currants, plums, vanilla, and coconut. I wish the aroma was more 'in-your-face', but I can't at all complain about the decent complexity and relative lack of harsh alcohol.
T: Pleasant dark chocolate and vanilla opens the palate, before it develops a currant-heavy midtaste. The back end is very heavy in charred oak, with some additional roasted malts (a welcome addition compared to last year), and piny hops. The big problem here is how obnoxiously boozy the finish is - especially taking its lack of notable alcohol aroma into consideration. However, much like Sucaba, the harshness seems to decrease the more this is imbibed. Even better, it shows good depth of flavor. At the end of the day, I enjoy it's decent bitterness and bourbon character too much to nitpick its flaws.
M: This seems to be a bit drier on the back of the palate compared to last year. It's just as sticky and viscous, though. The body itself is wonderfully creamy, with a medium texture befitting a barrel-aged RIS. Carbonation isn't terribly strong, and alcohol presence is assertive.
O: Let me start out by saying I'd be lying through my teeth if I said this wasn't a great BA RIS. It presents an excellent bourbon character and a depth others in the style lack. However, it's just too harsh to be world-class in my mind. Still, I'm really intrigued over aging my other bottle for a year to see how it develops. 2,688 charactersThisWangsChung, Jun 08, 2014

Now...I feel as though BCBS was the finest example of a bourbon barrel stout I've had up to this point. I gave BCBS an easy 5 in all categories so I can't help but measure Parabola against BCBS. 
The appearance is nice and dark, deep and brooding. It's a night in Transylvania in a glass. But the motor oil thickness I was so hoping would accompany the pour wasn't there. Not a big issue, but a mark down from BCBS. 
Smell...tremendous. I love a nose full of boozy bourbon, the alcohol burning my nostrils. It's incredible! I'm sure there's more to appreciate, but I'll toss it all aside in favor of the booze.
Taste...everything an imperial stout should be, plus that killer booziness! YES!
Mouthfeel...again, a slight demerit here. Ever so slight. And only because it doesn't quite match the syrupy quality of BCBS. It's not as thick, and I wanted it to be.
Overall...a gem. I'm sorry I even said anything negative. 1,041 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, Jun 03, 2014

That being said, I just didnt really care for this. I found it overwhelmingly sweet. My first sip I immediately get the bourbon, followed by chocolate. The oak and coffee begin to creep in after a couple of sips but sweetness is dominate. The mouth feel is a bit heavy for my preference, but not off-putting necessarily. I can appreciate the number of flavors and the balance of those flavors but this is just not for me. Kind of reminds me a little of a barley wine, maybe I'm way off on that, I dont know. I would say if you know you dont like this style but you are trying it because of the hype (like I did) then save your money and save the bottle for someone that will enjoy it. 845 charactersHoppyDazed, May 31, 2014

I'm speaking about a cold night on a porch. This isn't fair because I drank this 2014 Parabola on the edge of a wall next to a beautiful girl, feet in the bay, 7 beers deep (and then remembered I brought Parabola). Set and Setting, this was the best beer I've ever had. It is unreal. Its like this elixir, it has the same mouthfeel as homegrown mountain Dew. It is unbelievable, unbeatable, and it is firestone walker. 601 charactersD-18V, May 29, 2014

4.98/5  rDev +9.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I had the honor of experiencing this brew on tap at the New England Tap House Grill in Hooksett NH on 5/28/14. This was one of those ultra-surprising unexpected finds on their(or anyone's) rotating beer list. 
The beer was poured into a snifter glass and the first glance offered up one dark beauty of a beer. Mostly black with hints of brown on the edge when hit by the right lighting. No head to speak of just a slight mocha ring around the top and virtually no lacing as well. Smells of, well, bourbon. Some vanilla, aged oak, dark coffee, and some espresso also join in with the abundance of bourbon. Taste is great with the hints of the above mentioned with bourbon being the most pronounced flavor for me. Very well done mouthfeel that coats the palate and is very smooth. I found Parabola to be moderately sweet and extremely easy to drink, but a sipper with that high abv. I really enjoyed this aged stout tremendously and it was amazing to get a hold of this masterpiece . Highly recommended! 1,002 charactersdpgoblejr, May 29, 2014

A: pours a dark black, almost no head. Looks like a stout
S: oak, vanilla, coffee, caramel, smells very rich, a little dark fruit maybe cherry 
T: Wow this is just amazing. Rich dark coffee/ espresso, lots of oak and vanilla, cherry, chocolate all blended so perfectly. It's a little hard to pick out any one flavor, I was a little skeptical about this due to the hype but it really is very good and well made. I absolutely love the barrel oak and vanilla that comes though just spectacular.
M: big bodied imperial stout, exactly what I expect it to be

A full glass is opaque black with virtually no head. Aroma of coffee, oak, roast. Taste is tangy, slight bitterness, some sourness, sweet, booze. Finish is tremendously oaky, sweet, a little bitter, persists for a long while. Mouthfeel is medium to full, a little sugar stickiness if you let it hang around. A real barn burner of a beer: super-complex, intense, and enjoyable. Wonderful.
EDIT: Re-capped the bottle (not air-tight), put it back in the box, in the fridge and came back to it a day later. It held the carbonation well, and the taste is just as delicious on day 2. 667 charactersfoobula, May 23, 2014

Purchased from La Bota Liquor in Vista CA
Poured hard into a pint glass resulted in a 1.5 inch mocha head. Caramel scent from far away as I brought the glass closer the caramel had a milky- cocoa touch to it. The first taste oozed into my tongue with a candy bar like flavor... Snickers, three musketeers, etc... A kind of chocolate that has some other creaminess to it. Some nuttiness and the booze is ever-present. The aftertaste has a minimal alcohol burn to it, and it more warms the body than the mouth. This is the most pleasant mouthfeel I have had in a beer to day. Fully sticky and silky, filling the mouth like chocolate syrup and feeling pleasant even after swallowing.
Was fully expecting some degree of hype to the ratings, but I really do not believe there is. This is a truly world class offering, a must buy 2 if you are lucky enough to see. Drink one soon and save the other for a special day. I hope to have a BCBS and Black Note soon to compare. Cheers 987 charactersBonsall_Phil, May 22, 2014

Pours very thick and smooth. Aromas are spilling out of this snifter from a good distance; this is a beast. Very rich molasses, vanilla, bourbon, woody notes, chocolate, and toffee notes provide huge layers on your sense of smell. Throughout the layers, you pick up hints of licorice, cream, cherry, tobacco, smoke and char. This smells great. Flavors are very rich, with a blast of char, bitter and roasted coffee, bitter dark chocolate, blackstrap molasses, and heavy booze notes. This is a blast on your palate. The more you drink, more flavor profiles reveal themselves, including tobacco, peat, earthy notes, and smoke. This is heavy. The body is robust, smooth, and full, like old motor oil, which is the perfect body to support this cavalcade of flavors. Rich, thickly sweet aftertaste of coffee, chocolate, and molasses, this remains heavy from start to finish. The finish is thick, smooth, and lingering. This beer keeps you on the ropes from the moment you open the bottle, and I personally loved every second of it. 1,121 charactersGarthDanielson, May 18, 2014

A very heavy, boozy beer that is great but definitely made sure I could only have one. Thick, not sticky but this is going to leave some beer remnants on your tongue, a little heat on the finish and this beer actually benefits from a woodiness to keep it flowing smooth. As for tastes I pick up the dark fruits which is still mostly figs and raisins and again I swear a hint of plum, possible black cherry, all combining with a vanilla-like bourbon sweetness that is wonderfully balanced. 707 charactersclayrock81, May 18, 2014

Very expensive brew. $17+tax a bomber. Limit one per person at Spec's. Im sure this brew is worth a full review. Considering how many Barrel Stouts I've had, I'll probably be going over the same tastes as all Barrel Stouts. Not saying I won't enjoy it but saying $17 a bottle? Oh well. I digress...
Pours black as ever. No krausen (so to speak). Aromas of vanilla, bourbon, leather, molasses, chocolate. The taste is big. I wanna take it to the dance and bang it behind the building. So dangerous. Thick bodied but with curves in all the right places. Sticky vanilla and bourbon and coffee and just a hint of heat peeking out the side of the tiniest lace. This beauty will sneak up on you and make you forget your inhibitions. Forgive me father for I have sinned. This will be my last confession because I am changing my religion to worshipping this she-devil. No offense father. 
 I Understand why they charge so much. Well whatever they charge, the distributor upcharges, and the store upcharges. Its a great brew. Hands down. Oh and I forgot to mention, nice kiss of bitterness in the finish and and nice mellow carbo... 1,140 charactersstumac, May 17, 2014

The beer pours out brown as it is lighter than BCBS by a good amount. Black in the glass with a ring of light head.
The aroma is bright of cherries, bourbon sweetness, lots of oak, cocoa, chocolate.
The beer up offers a pop of bourbon alcohol, lots of spice and star anise throughout the palate offering bitterness. The roast is medium for the style. Plums, raisin combine with sweetness of the bourbon. Oak hits in the mid-palate, but does not linger like previous vintages. Mouthfeel is medium to medium plus, but certainly not full.
A clear loser in a blind taste test against BCBS.
(2014 Vintage)
The beer comes in a beer comes in a black color with a brown head.
The aroma has lots of raisin and dark fruit with bourbon and chocolate.
The flavor follows with chewy chocolate, sweet vanilla, and chocolate in the front. Then there's some hint of umami and meaty qualities and a big caramel sweetness. Then onto an explosion huge back palate of toasted coconut. Almost like biting into an Almond Joy or eating toasted coconut. 
The beer then ends of oak, leather and tobacco. 10-15 minutes in, the oak tannins will still linger, which actually is a bit too much. 
The mouthfeel is medium plus to full, though not as viscous as Bourbon County.
A wonderful brew, but still not as good as Bourbon County.
I had this aged 2012 in keg at Brouwerij lane.
The beer comes in a pitch black with a khaki ring.
The aroma has big toffee and caramel sweetness with dark roasted notes. With some barrel wood notes. Deep rich dark raisin.
The flavor has a nuttiness with deep roasted malt. Very creamy. Vanilla. Coconut. Burnt caramel. Bitter darkest chocolate. Espresso. Definitely that oakiness from the barrels. There's a bit of that sticking sweetness. Finish lingers a bit, but not long. The beer lacks an alcohol bite. The aging must have really mellowed it out.
KBS is still my favorite barrel aged stout. However, this is one of my favorite still. Under Bourbon County Coffee, but above the regular version. So freaking smooth, wonderful barrel age character, just an amazing and delicious. 2,115 charactersdar482, May 14, 2014

Bourbon bourbon and bourbon on the nose, with some chocolate malt and vanilla. Barley and cream in the background.
Very hot beer cold. Tons of bourbon, some chocolate. As it warms, vanilla and coffee really start to come through. Some dark fruit, roast barley, cream, and slightly sour oak. Wood and tobacco.
She's a hot beer; no hiding the ABV. Long, sticky finish. Smooth and thick, certainly for the style. Medium sting, but no foaming.
Incredibly complex BBA Stout. Not as thick and chewy as BCBS, but with deeper character and flavor. IMO a step above KBS. Can't wait to see how age mellows the bourbon heat in this beauty. 723 charactersRoguer, May 13, 2014

An amazing sipper of a beer in the same category as BCBS. Lots of vanilla flavors, great at first taste, but better on last. The smells are consistent with the taste and are nearly perfect. Full bodied and absolutely beautiful in the glass, with nice head and pitch black body. So glad I was able to score some on tap when I was least expecting it. Life is good. 463 charactersBeer-A-Lot, May 12, 2014

Odor was complex. Dark sweet such as toffee and molasses. Vanilla and chocolate also with a hint of alcohol. 
Taste is more than I could have hoped for. Lots of bourbon and chocolate. Vanilla and dark fruit as well. Alcohol is present but not overpowering. Some minor notes include coffee, maple, woody. 
Mouth feel is smooth and a little heavy. However for 14% it is not over bearing at all. It is big for sure though. 
Overall a very big, luscious, smooth, complex beer. Sipping beer in every way. Just excellent. 592 charactersdexterk1, May 11, 2014

Money well spent. 
The appearance was very near black. Poured thick. Mocha colored head that was small
The smell was like espresso beans and shaved chocolate with a hint of bourbon. 
The taste was heaven. Front notes of coffee and rich chocolate, followed by vanilla and oak, near the end there is a trace of cherry(?). For being high in abv the boo zones is hidden remarkably well. Coming out just enough to let you know you're having something children are not old enough to understand. 
Overall this is one of the best barrel aged stouts to be had, Bourbon Country doesn't do it like this.

Pours pitch black with a skim khaki head that settles into swirling wisps. Flavor features oodles of bourbon and vanilla along with dark fruit, coffee, maple syrup, and marshmallow. The vanilla-laced sweetness is almost cloyingly strong, though the complexity of the subtler elements is enjoyable. The alcohol is present, as is to be expected at 12.5% ABV, but not distressingly so. The texture is slick and smooth on the palate.
Overall, this is a rich, smooth, flavorful imperial stout with plenty of flair for the bourbon fans. With that said, it doesn't quite live up to its exceedingly lofty hype in my estimation. There are more balanced imperial stouts, barrel-aged or otherwise, that don't lean so heavily on a nearly candied sweetness. 768 charactersMaximalC, May 06, 2014

A: Absolutely pitch black body with a half finger mocha head that recedes to the thinnest of rings around the glass quickly. Perfect appearance for an RIS.
S: Bourbon soaked vanilla bean, bakers chocolate, and rich dark pitted fruits. Sweet alcohol emerges as it warms. As inviting as it comes.
T: More vanilla, but this time paired with dark cherry and raw cocoa nibs. Charred oak and dark chocolate covered espresso beans linger on the palate long after each sip. Remarkably hidden alcohol for 14%. Glorious.
M: Full bodied and velvety. Coats the mouth completely and a bit of viscous texture remains following each taste.
O: World class. In my opinion the yardstick by which each and every bourbon barrel aged stout should be measured. Remarkably potent flavors and aromas, yet maintains perfect balance throughout. Firestone + barrels = magic. 866 charactersMore_betterness, May 05, 2014

A: Rich malty chocolate notes with some sweet and boozy caramel notes. Alcohol heat and spice is evident, as are very prominent bourbon and bourbon barrel notes of vanilla and toasted oak.
T/M: A smooth bitterness is met with huge and rich chocolate and espresso notes, burnt cookie, black cherry, sugary caramel, and big bourbony vanilla notes. The mouthfeel is unbelievably lush with a moderate carbonation that allows the beer to stick to your mouth. Very rich, even for the style.
Overall, I may have found an Imperial Stout that can unseat The Abyss from my top spot. This is an amazing beer, especially if you like a big, sticky mouthfeel. The roasted malts and grains are much less sharp than in some other examples of the style, but instead very rich and really blend well with the barrel character. Absolutely amazing. 992 charactersSiriusfisherman, May 03, 2014

Appearance- WAY more head then I expected from a two year old BA Stout. WAY more carbonation too. Poured exactly like a Pepsi. Maybe about 1% light gets through when held up to a bright light. 
Smell- I get bourbon and vanilla right away. Chocolate covered cherries is the next round of delicious scents. If the taste is anything like the nose, I am gonna LOVE this beer. 
Taste- WOW! Taste like drinking bourbon infused caramel. There is also dark chocolate, vanilla and cherry. Awesome flavor! Very similar to BCBS, but maybe just a bit better. 
Mouthfeel- So thick and luxurious! This is exactly what a barrel-aged stout should feel like in your mouth. This beer could be an expensive cognac, and no one would ever know. 
Overall- This beer is world class and must be sought after at all costs. I will be ISO of Parabola. 910 charactersfrenchblood21, May 03, 2014

Tap (2014) is complex. Malt country roast goes down the throat leaving a scratch of rich dark aromas. A tad hint of exotic coffee beans.
Smells like a stinking rich dark expresso on a sunday morning. 
Had it on tap in this hole in the wall place in Las Vegas called Shakespeare's
Iv had Head Topper, Russian River & Goose Islands Bourbon Countys. This ranks amongst them
Of course Bottled is on point as well. If you get your hands on one you dont care if its bottled or not 585 charactersTony_Snow, Apr 29, 2014

4.52/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This review is of the '14. For sake of comparison I've had the '11 (4.37) and the '12 (4.64) this year. The '12 was really chocolatey and mellow, absolutely delicious. I'll be interested to try the '13.
A - Any time I get to use the phrase 'light-swallowing black' I'm a happy man. I feel that phrase is appropriate here. And now I'm happy. Pours slick, thick and dark into my snifter.
S - Booming bourbon notes lead the chorus. Agitating my snifter releases powerful wafts of booze, and to a lesser extent maple and apple brandy. Bourbon slightly edges out the subtler aromas.
T - The barrel-aging process has certainly left its mark. Bourbon flavours are massive and tempered by sweet vanilla notes. Charred oak kneads the tongue, accompanied by mellowed-out espresso and bittersweet cocoa powder. All these flavours are supported by a solid base of roasted malt. This is not a smokey or peaty stout. Vanilla, bourbon booze and maple syrup are strongest here; followed by the cocoa and coffee. Dark cherry is faint but existent as are rum-infused chocolate truffles if my senses do not deceive me. As in the nose, bourbon character is somewhat at the expense of subtler notes.
M - The flavours in this beer are not playing any games, and the mouthfeel isn't either. As the eyes intimate, this beer is thick and slick. Satisfying viscosity should be easy to achieve for a beer at 14% abv., and in this instance it is. It drinks smoothly, although it is more at the syrupy than the creamy end of the spectrum.
O - A sipper through and through, this beer was a journey, a genuine undertaking at over two hours of drinking. I normally drink pretty quickly, so this was unprecedented. I'll be aging my remaining bottles to see if time can mellow the booziness and the bourbon, allowing the subtler elements and deeply buried characteristics to shine. Nonetheless this was a highly impressive beer which is either a little rough around the ages or as yet still raw. Time will tell. 1,982 charactersabeeronthebeach, Apr 21, 2014

Firestone Walker Parabola! My only few BA stouts that i've had, so I cant make this a perfect score becuz there is so much beers and I have so much catching up to do.(Late bloomer drinker). Let's begin.
A- Stouts are usually dark, so I cant think of any beer styles that could be darker.
S- Licorice, sweet, caramel, oakiness from the barrels, faint alcohol but very faint from the well balanced aromas
T- Rich chocolate and vanilla. I'm ready to add milk and sugar to make this an outstanding beer a true dessert. Its a beer you just have to try.
Overall, its an excellent BA stout. Still looking for that perfect beer for my own taste buds, but this beer is in my top 5.. Cheers! 805 charactersFlip4beers, Apr 20, 2014

4.97/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is the one, the only, PARABOLA. I have had this 3 times before in the past 3 years. This is the biggest one yet at 14%, I am curious how it will end up.
Pours a very dark black with a brown edge to it, so its semi transparent. Not the darkest RIS I've seen, but its just fine. a small mocha head recedes fast to a ring and lacing.
Smell is perfect. Boozy bourbon and coffee, chocolate, dark fruit, you name it. anything dark like in the food chain lol, smokiness, toffee, caramel, figs, raisins, prunes, did I mention bourbon? Its all here.
Taste is similar. This huge wallop of chocolate and bourbon hits the tongue and stays there for days. All the aformentioned smells are there in the taste, plus I have to say theres a leather note as well. Vanilla too. Also, the alcohol gives a slight burn to the tongue but it's not harsh like a shot of whiskey.
Feel is nice, very slick and oily, this thing has legs on the side of the glass like motor oil. Carbonation is just right at about low to medium.
Overall I highly suggest people find this and try it, or trade for it if they can't get it back east. It's a sensation you will never forget, and I am glad that I bought 3 bottles of it. Worth every penny. 1,215 charactersBastardKing24, Apr 15, 2014

A - Black with two finger mocha head.
S - Initial blast of cocoa from the bottle. In glass, bourbon vanilla, sweet vanilla, alcohol, coconut, roasted caramel. This should be a candle scent, jesus. 
T - So I'm drinking some sort of Mocha bourbon liqueur, right? This is beer, you guys. Sweet mocha and smoke. I'm at a campfire drinking whiskey and eating s'mores. Gah, dark and sweet chocolates, vanilla, dark fruit character.
M- Very smooth upfront with lots of alcohol at the end. Spiciness because of it. Confusing at first, but surprisingly drinkable after the first 3 sips. It's not viscous or syrupy like I've experienced with other stouts in this realm. 
O - Very pleased with this beer after all the buzz from my coworkers and the price. IMHO, as much I revere high alcohol content, and Parabola does a great job at dancing with its %14, I feel the flavours could ring a little stronger around %10. 937 characterssamtrillo, Apr 15, 2014

M - 5 - super thick, alc covered, aftertaste is coffee, bourbon, roasted malts, smoke, and oak barrel flavors. 
O - 5 - I've heard this is the best of all the batches so far. I can't argue with that. Probably THE best barrel aged imperial stout that I've had. Hands down amazing. 549 charactersISmith87, Apr 14, 2014

4.55/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Very thankful to BA SammyJaxxx for sending this one along. Enjoyed out of a 22 oz brown bomber with no dating that I can see, however, the vintage, 2011, is clearly printed front and center on the label. Poured into a small old fashioned glass.
Appearance - A moderately-aggressive pour coaxes out a half-finger of cocoa powder colored foam that makes a fizzy show for a few seconds before receding back into a ringlet of bubbles around the edge of the glass and an ethereal tracing of film around the top of the liquid . Lacing is nonexistent, but that's to be expected on a 3 year old BA beer.
Smell - Interestingly, Parabola reminds me a bit in aroma of both Merkin and XVII, so it's hard not to wonder if there is some "house" flavor to FW beers. Wonderfully intoxicating, just short of cloying, notes of graham cracker, coconut, oaky vanilla tannins and a pleasant undertone of baker's chocolate, but not overpoweringly bitter--just a hint of roasted char to bring some balance to the sweeter elements.
Taste - Here the bourbon makes a bit more of an appearance than it did in the smell, with notes of spicy booze adding to the woody elements of the toasted oak. Supporting the estery characateristics are richer flavor profiles of roasted malt, burnt caramel, bittersweet chocolate and vanilla.
Mouthfeel - Just a shade lower than completely full bodied, with a pleasant viscosity that provides a hefty serving dish for the myriad flavors. Carbonation is moderate to low, I'm assuming a bit faded after three years of sitting.
Overall, just a fantastically rich and wonderful barrel aged stout. It's not as thick as I really like my RIS' to be, but I'm honestly quite impressed at the body considering the barrel aging. Firestone Walker really knows what they are doing when it comes to their barrel program. It's just too bad everyone knows that, making their brews hard to come by here in Kansas City. 1,914 charactersLambicPentameter, Apr 13, 2014

Appearance: Pitch black, no hint of red or brown when held up to the light. No head, but there some small bubbles on the top and a little bit around the edges of the beer.
Smell: Huge bourbon smell like nothing I have ever smelled in a beer. The bourbon is overwhelming, this was my second bourbon barrel aged beer, and seem to distract from what I consider a stout to be. 
Taste: Huge bourbon taste up front, the alcohol is heavy on the back end, I did not get any of the roasted malts or coffee flavor, all bourbon taste. I am not sure what to think of the bourbon flavor but the beer is incredibly smooth, incredibly.
Mouthfeel: Thick, no carbonation, oily feeling, the low carbonation is strange, I am used to a little carbonation.
Overall: I struggled with the bourbon aroma and flavor, the low carbonation but when this beer is consumed it's world class. It's an awesome sipper, I sipped mine for about 120 minutes. It's a must try. I am hoping to pick another bottle to cellar and see what it likes in a year or two. 1,099 charactersBrolo75, Apr 13, 2014

A: Dark brown cola. Foamy head that settles in &lt;10 seconds. Brown film coats the glass.
S: Huge barrel character; raisins and cherries; vanilla; chocolate; roasted coffee beans. Quite boozy.
T: Like drinking a booze- and vanilla-soaked bar of dark chocolate; dry red fruit; roasted malt; faint tobacco; oak everywhere. Super boozy, but the kind of booze that complements rather than overwhelms everything. Great dryness and mild bitter dark chocolate on the aftertaste.
M: Perfect: creamy, sticky, substantial, and chewy; dry cocoa powder all over the tongue.
O: OK I guess. 617 charactersblankenhoney, Apr 13, 2014

A: Black as used motor oil. Pours a small tan head that leaves excellent lacing. 
S: First smell I detect is oak and bourbon. Coffee and chocolate are there too, along with a little bit of vanilla. Very sweet smelling, with a slight touch of toasted malt.
T: Incredible. Bourbon and oak start off like in the nose, and then a cascade of chocolate, coffee, vanilla, caramel, dark fruits, and malt. The balance of these flavors is what makes this beer so good. There's a little bit of bitterness in there from the roasted malt, and it pairs extremely well with the sweetness of the beer. The finish is also very sweet, with a chocolate and bourbon aftertaste that covers up a slight amount of booziness.
M: Thick and full-bodied. Not syrupy like some big stouts, but drinks like silk. Warms your throat up as well, which is to be expected from a 14% brew... 
O: My favorite barrel-aged stout out there. This is my favorite yearly release from FW, and this year's release was excellent. When I'm drinking this, I savor every last drop. Every sweet, roasty, complex drop. 1,121 charactersBedrocker, Apr 11, 2014

A: Just a little tan head. Fades quickly. Pours a rich brown. Pitch black in the glass, with a root beer meniscus. More rich brown in the dimple, with a bright caramel edge. Some very fine lacing. Thin ring of head stays the course.
S: Bourbon apparent as soon as the bottle is cracked! Very nice blend of bourbon and chocolate. Burnt caramel, toffee, dry cocoa/dark chocolate. Not as complex as I was expecting, but a very nice overall aroma!
T/MF: Feels very thick! Creamy. Very deep, dark flavor profile. Very strong, sweet Bourbon flavor up front. Even deeper burnt caramel, bordering on tar or tobacco. Sweet dark chocolate towards the back. Some sweet char, with almost graphite-like notes. Faintest hint of licorice.
I still like the Velvet Merlin better, but certainly a strong beer! Biggest Bourbon presence I've had yet, I think. This seems like a beer that demands rich food accompaniment! ...Speaking of which, I have some salted caramel gelato in the freezer, and it is about dessert time!
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass.
2016:
Firestone's Parabola 2016, Bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. 13.1% ABV.
A: About a finger of chocolate milk colored head. Black in the glass. Dark honey/light root beer in the dimple. Decent lacing, but it slides right off. Slight sheeting.
S: Dark cocoa and toffee up front. Light char just behind. Oak and vanilla. I'm not noticing any coffee or heat.
T/MF: Rich, bittersweet chocolate dominates. Finishes out with a very light coffee edge. Very dark toffee with just a touch of char. A hint of oak and just a smidge of graphite, edging on licorice. A touch of vanilla and some kind of baking spice at the very end. Very rich and flavorful, with plenty of nice complexity. If I get the chance, I'll have to grab another for aging.
Poured from a 22 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass.
Upped score to reflect current opinion.
2017:
Firestone Parabola, Bourbon barrel aged Imperial stout. 14.5% ABV.
A: Two fingers of tan head; a bit light for a stout... Still black in the glass, but in the dimple, it's honey brown. Solid, clear sheeting. Thinner, yet very sticky lacing.
S: Dark, oaky toffee, bordering on char. Semisweet chocolate, approaching that rich chocolate cake, but not quite. Browned caramel.
T/MF: Okay, that is way too boozy right now. I don't get a burn, but it tastes like I have to wade through the alcohol before the flavors hit. Dark, rich char follows, with a touch of toffee. A bit of bittersweet chocolate, but I really should be getting more out of this... Wow, this is a real big let down. It does seem like it will be good after enough time, but I don't know if I want to buy another bottle just to sit on to see, though.

4.91/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into Fremont and Reuben's Brew small snifters. A long awaited mini vertical of the original bottling (2010) and the fresh 2014 vintage. The older bottle was properly cellar aged. Both were similar in appearance: a very dark mahogany brown, appearing nearly opaque in the glass with a thin, patchy light brown head, slightly more foam on the newer bottle. 
2010: Aroma dominated by bourbon and oak, with vanilla, dark malt, dark dried fruit. Flavor is sweet dark toasted malt with a hint of char, chocolate, vanilla, dark dried fruit; finishes with the most amazing cocoa aftertaste similar to finishing a spiked glass of hot chocolate, bourbon. Remarkable and warming. Medium creamy bodied. The initial flavor is beautifully balanced between the chocolate flavors, malt and bourbon, but the bourbon and chocolate eventually dominate the finish. Delicious. 
2014: Aroma of toffee, vanilla, bourbon soaked dried dark fruit, faint dark malt. Flavor follows, dominated by toffee, vanilla and bourbon, supported by dark toasted malt and dark dried fruit flavors, finishing boozy with caramel bourbon. Medium bodied with creaminess. Quite a different flavor profile from the aged one, the older version really emphasizing chocolate and whiskey (not quite as identifiable and bourbon) and the newer one brighter with toffee, vanilla and lighter fruit as well as the dark dried fruit. The newer one is slightly less sweet. 
The aged Parabola has virtually no signs of oxidation at all, which in my experience is unusual with stouts, and one of the reasons I'm aging fewer stouts in favor of barley wines these days. Except for the wonderful balance and integration of flavors, it is not possible for me to tell this is 4 years old, it has aged wonderfully. I deeply regret not aging more of these now and with this very tough to find on the market now, it appears to be unlikely that it will be easy to find additional bottles for the cellar any more. 
This is a stout that completely lives up to its hype. Excellent and very different fresh. Apparently with many, many years left for aging. A masterpiece. 2,108 charactersLiquidAmber, Apr 10, 2014

Russian Imperial Stout
14% ABV
APPEARANCE: Pours a deep shadow black from a bright sunny day. Slight dark chocolate rim variation. With a pillowy, creamy mocha head. 
AROMA: Ginger bread pudding topped with coconut ice cream drizzled with a bourbon caramel sauce. Hints of raisins, and heat from the high ABV. 
TASTE: Sexy and seducing layers that evolve in your mouth. Chocolate, leather, tobacco amazingly balanced with raisins molasses and bright oaky flavors. So delicious, just letting it roll back and forth getting more and more flavors each second. 
MOUTHFEEL: medium body with vivacious and enthusiastic carbonation that dances in your mouth. Some heat from the 14% ABV, that ends with a nice long finish that leaves the mouth coated in a oily sweetness. 
OVERALL: Very easy drinking and amazing flavor profile. Up until now the bcs has been the top of my stout list, this may have just knocked it off!

4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Poured from bottle into a snifter 
Appearance – The beer pours an almost pitch black color with a one finger of cream colored head. The head has a good level of retention, slowly fading to leave a moderate level of lace on the sides of the glass. The thickness of the brew can be seen right after pouring and when swirling in the snifter with thick fingers of liquid clinging the sides of the glass before slowly fading to the base of the beer at the bottom of the snifter.
Smell – The aroma of the beer has tons of chocolate and coffee in the nose. Along with these smells are some wonderful oaky and bourbon aromas mixed with a good dose of caramel and vanilla sweetness. Some other lighter aromas of a more dark fruit nature are thee as well with smells of cherry, raisin and plum all there. Overall the aroma is big roasty and sweet producing a nice warming aroma overall.. 
Taste – The taste begins with a massive level of roasty malt and sweet chocolate with a huge sweet caramel and vanilla flavor. Even from the start some bourbon and oaky flavors are detected on the tongue. While very sweet upfront, the beer incredibly gets even sweeter as the caramel ramps up and is joined by some brown sugar and a toffee sweetness with other flavors of “lighter” dark fruits of fig and raisin (light in comparison to sugar flavors; although by no means light). The roastedness and chocolate flavors fade a tad at the increase of the sweet. Some coffee comes to the tongue however and just like the sweeter flavors, the booziness and bourbon flavors get quite a bit stronger in nature as well. These transitions, with the massive increases in the sweetness and the booziness, all in the end, leave a big, massively sweet and moderately boozy warming taste to linger on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. Both were fantastic for the darker flavors of the brew as well as for the huge sweet and alcohol flavors of the brew with the lower carbonation only accentuating these. With its boozy and oaky flavors in conjunction with the sweet and dark flavors of the brew the overall thick body and lower carbonation really make this one a nice warming brew and a nice slow drinker. 
Overall – Big, robust, massively sweet, and warming. This is a nice imperial stout. A little sweeter then I would want on any real occasion, but this one makes a dessert all in itself, being quite nice for a capper to an evening after dinner on a cooler winter night. 2,558 charactersDarkmagus82, Apr 08, 2014

S: Roasted coffee, molasses, vanilla, mild coconut, bourbon and booze.
T: Robust, bitter roast with a sweet backbone. Bourbon and booze come in on the finish. The bitterness and char linger.
M: The flavor is thick. The mouthfeel itself is full without being too viscous or syrupy. There's a lot of heat in the throat as it goes down.
O: Absolutely a world class, barrel aged stout. Strong, bold, and not too sweet. 459 characters01001111, Apr 06, 2014

A: Very dark brown/black. Almost no head, very light ring around the edges of the glass. No lacing. 
S: Boozy and oaky. The booze is very dominate. Sweet and charred sugars. 
T: caramel, bourban, toffee, earthy/oak. Great balance, nothing overwhelms. I feel like 2014 is not as alcohol hot as 2013, but I'm not comparing them side to side. Abv is up to 14% this year, but I can't taste it.
M: smooth, velvety, and syrupy. It's great, has great feel, but doesn't linger.... Keeps you coming back for more.
O: probably my favorite beer, definitely my favorite stout/barrel aged stout. I look forward to parabolas release every year and this year doesn't disappoint. 722 charactersSumdeus, Apr 05, 2014

Out of the seven BA guys we had at the tasting, Parabola got the highest marks for look, smell, taste, mouthfeel and overall. We had a pretty even split of tasters who liked IPA's to those who liked belgians and porters, and those who liked stouts. So to come out on top was pretty impressive for this stout. 415 charactersricknelson, Mar 26, 2014

A- midnight, head fizzled quick leaving a thin light cream colored ring on edge of glass. 
S- like figs and raison soaked in coffee. You can smell vanilla. 
T- follows smell raisons, figs, roasted java, slight bitter cocao with toasted coconut at the end and some hops hanging around. No burn, so smooth.
M- silky not light but not too heavy. Leaves my lips sticky. Leaves you dry, maybe time to drink some h2o.
O- overall lucky I was able to snag this. Parabola is efin sweet. I cant believe it was still available. Still some left. 593 characterssippinsudz74, Mar 25, 2014

4.84/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A This beer is very, very deep black, but there is a slight variance around the edges. The head is very tiny with minimal retention, so there is almost no lacing around the glass. There is a deep ruby hue in the center when the light catches the glass.
S The whisky barrel is very strong on the nose. There seems to be more booze on the nose the further into the bottle you get, but that doesn't take away from the overall effect on the nose. There's a slight malt and a slightly sugary note on the nose, but for the most part it is a little subdued.
T There is a distinct stratification of layers in this beer, and it's amazing. First, I get smoke and char and whisky barrel on the palate. Then, there is a distinct malty, caramel, and vanilla undercurrent that washes away the front end of the taste. At the end, there is almost a chocolate covered dark cherry and plum taste on the back end. The high alcohol cleans the palate just enough to leave you wanting more. This is an amazing experience; I can't wait to have more. Every sip is different. Every sip is fucking sublime. 
M This is almost perfectly carbonated--a little too bubbly. I would prefer it on nitro (like that's gonna happen) but aside from that it doesn't get better than this.
O This is a nearly perfect beer. Jesus Herbert Walker Christ. 1,310 charactersBingCrosby7, Mar 22, 2014

Firestone Walker's answer to BCBS is similar in a lot of ways, but sweeter, with less bourbon taste, and a slightly thinner mouthfeel. There are things about this that I prefer, but also places where BCBS is king. 
I don't get proponents of either side claiming "dominance" over the other; these are two of the greatest BBA stouts you'll ever run into, and both deserve equal representation in your collection. 472 charactersSeanBond, Mar 16, 2014

This is right on par with Proprietor's and has almost as much coconut flavor and aroma though I'm not sure how that is possible since Parabola has no coconut added.
Vintage 2014, picked up today from Whole Foods Chicago
Appearance: Black as night with a tan head that dissipates quickly after pouring. Some moderate lacing on the glass.
Smell: Oh boy, this stuff smells so good. It is hard to describe all the different aromas but I am picking up bourbon, caramel, coconut, and a little vanilla.
Taste: Here is where Parabola asserts itself as a beer for the ages. Starts off boozy and sweet and then finishes with coconut and a bitter cocoa like 90% dark chocolate. There is a slight hop presence on the long finish that lingers and keeps you coming back for more.
Mouthfeel: A little thin for the style but it lends itself to being a very drinkable BA stout. Very light carbonation and slightly sticky.
Parabola goes from bourbon and brown sugar to coconut, cocoa, and then hops if you wait for it. This is complex and incredible. Gives any BA stout a run for its money. 1,199 charactersMrPlayboy, Mar 15, 2014

taste is deeeep chocolate...dried fruit...bourbon....figgy...oxidated...really fing awesome.
Its smooth, rich, complex, dry, sweet...balanced. for 12.5% this is seriously chugable. at the price and availability its less than sippable...I don't want it to end. A privilege to have. A superb and world class brew. 641 charactersDrinkSlurm, Mar 15, 2014

Notes transcribed on 02/22/14
A: Dark chocolate brown and completely opaque in the glass. Looks a little thin on the pour but collects fairly dark. Thin brim of light brown sugar on top with only some minimal stay. Settles out to a swirl rather quickly and not much stick other than a few alcohol legs. A little as to be expected with a high ABV barrel aged brew. 
S: Coconut and chocolate crème meets with brown sugars and maple soaked oak timbers. Vanilla emerges in waves along with a distinct earthy hop presence. There is a bit of a boozy sting on the nostrils however it does not detract from all the dessert aromatics. Smells quite incredible with tons of coconut. 
T: Milk chocolate and lightly charred wood with vanilla crème and toasted coconut are all seamlessly layered over a dark charred roast malt base. Comes together like a crème brulee really. So good. Not incredibly strong on the spirits but man dat coconut is so prominent. There is an upper level of bitter hoppiness to the beer that brings in an earthy mineral likeness as well. The alcohol is a bit sharp still however I find it very manageable overall. 
M: The beer is full bodied however it has a much thinner feel than expected. Stays very light and frothy on the palate with a nice prickly bitterness and bit of drying at the finish. Some warming alcohol is evident and there is a light oily coat left over. 
D: Firestone Walker Parabola is a sure thing. A magnificent blend of in depth stout flavors and barrel character. World class and always recommended. You can’t go wrong here with the lovely dessert flavors and sipping nature of this brew.

Bottle tulip.
A. Poured black, with some dark amber tint around the edges, with a 2 finger slightly amber head. fine bubbles. Head retreats to a film and rim. Low viscosity.
S. Moderate fragrance. Starts off with major notes of bourbon and dark roasted malts. Minor notes of vanilla, toffee, oak, dust, and marshmallow. 
T. Starts off very similar to the nose with dark roasted malts, bourbon-soaked oak, some hops, and caramel. Minor notes of marshmallow, toffee, nuts, and a moderate booze that builds as it opens.
M. Kind of thin - not necessarily a bad thing.
O. This beer lives up to the reputation and is certainly worth the hype and rating. One can defiantly tell this has aged 12 months. This is not my favorite BA stout, but is certainly up there. 796 charactersmacher0, Mar 01, 2014

Poured in a tulip- a dark chocolate opaque color. Beautiful with a 1/2F head.
The aroma is layered chocolate- a candy milk chocolate.
The mouth feel: not very carbonated.
The taste is very layered and subtle- one of the advantages of a beer that cellars well.
There is no harshness- only layers of flavor. Exceptionally rich chocolate, semi sweet.
Finish: mildly alcoholic, but not overdone. Balanced,smooth, yet with an alcoholic presence.
World class beer richer with cellaring. 491 charactersbrureview, Feb 25, 2014

The complexity is out of this world. 
Chill it. Pour it cold, try it cold and sip it as it warms a bit and enjoy the taste as it warms and changes. Oh boy are you in for a treat!...all the way to the last drop...you'll be licking the bottle.
I love dark beers - this is dark - and even if you like blonde beers you will love this.
This and Barrel Aged Speedway Stout (Ale Smith) are the best beers in the world. All other beers are not even close. You can take that to the bank.
I do not want to describe the pour, the aroma, the mouth feel, the taste, aftertaste, etc...as this one needs to be experienced without giving you any indication of anything about it so you get the ultimate experience of WOW, Holy Christ, thank you God, that you will experience. 999 charactersBelchmaster, Feb 23, 2014

Glass contained a dark, jet-black brew, letting no light pass through.... Head was tan and thin, a rim-clinger, with minimal lace.... Nose had some choco and dark fruit, and bourbon notes were quite evident.... Body was full, heavy and chewy, with the bier being very smooth and creamy.... 
Had some sweetish notes, with woody bourbon right up front... warming alcohol was quite evident, and dark fruit notes made themselves clear.... dates and raisins were found amongst the bourbon action... Quite tasty!!! 
Prosit!!

There are enough reviews out there, this is for my recall:
Poured black with a little less head than I'd like, but there was foam at the edges. The smell was classic roasted notes, chocolate in nature blended nicely with the barrel scents.
The taste was nothing special, but also pretty much spot on for what I want in the style. Same chocolate notes from the nose, as well as the bourbon barrel flavors that are pervasive. Very solid.
While I liked this beer quite a bit, the cost is such that I need to consider the occasion for buying it. 584 characterscjgiant, Feb 23, 2014

Tastes like a dense, charry double stout. Big nodes of peat, medium hops, and a very pronounced burn of alcohol blotting out some of the more complex nodes at the back. Intense and tasty, but not as interesting or variegated as I had hoped. The flavors also die off rather quickly in the back end, as the beer's thin body leaves much to be desired. 
RISes are getting harder and harder to judge. What was once a world-changing, palette-crushing masterpiece can now seem limp and tame. Certainly, no one is going to mistake Parabola for Guinness, but I really don't see what separates it from, say, Stone Imperial, or Ten Fidy 834 charactersmynie, Feb 19, 2014

Appearance - Dark brown, no head or lacing.
Smell - Strong bourbon, chocolate, coffee
Mouth Feel - Perfect
Taste - Bourbon and more bourbon but not as layered, balanced or developed as a 2-3 year old bottle, which I prefer to this draft

Opaque, black color with a tan head. Aroma was roasty (borderline burnt smell), picked up on the alcohol and bourbon. Flavor was really potent and bitter. It was thin and didn't leave any lace. Very strong bourbon aftertaste. This was part of a 4 beer sampler (all barrel aged) and I would say it came in 3rd. Definitely not bad and worth a try. 442 charactersBVukelich, Feb 08, 2014

4.97/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I broke out a 2013 Parabola for the kickoff of Super Bowl XLVIII. The Parabola poured a dark brown/black with a thin off-white head. The smell was simply tremendous. I picked up lots of dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, and bourbon on the nose. It was one of those beers that I just couldn't stop smelling it between sips. The flavor of the beer lived up to and perhaps even exceeded its incredible scent. The taste made me think of a slightly undercooked dark chocolate fudge caramel brownie a la mode with vanilla bean bourbon ice cream. There were also some notes of roasted coffee beans. Its rich and decadent flavors were a perfect match for its smooth, velvety, creamy mouthfeel. I thought that the 13% ABV was rather well-disguised for the style. An absolute pleasure to drink in every way possible. Insanely delicious. 2013 Parabola is definitely an all-timer for me. Firestone Walker has blown me away yet again with their barrel-aged releases. 952 characterslmperialChad, Feb 04, 2014

Firestone is the reason I started to get involved with the whole beer advocacy. This beer was so smooth with the hints of coffee and the barrel aged. It was beautifully crafted almost being able to take the strands of oak that caressed the individual molecules it touched. Ok maybe that's taking it a little far, but it made me fall in love with beer all over again. 461 charactersKuhuh, Feb 01, 2014

12 oz pour
Black with minimal lacing and head. you know the deal
Slight carbonation
smell is out of this world. Sweet, chocolate, oak, bourbon, malty, and probably 20 other smells that combine into something great.
mouthfeel is thick buy not to the BCBS level thickness. They got it just right.
taste/overall - this takes the cake for me. there are many others right behind. But the year and a half of aging on this keg did wonders. Cannot reccomend an aged Parabola enough. so many flavors going on that all work in harmony with a perfect touch of barrel aging. you can taste the alcohol, but it is not hot at all. molasses, burnt sugar, malt, chocolate, dark figs. I have had most of the Firestone offerings and knew it would be good, but this aged version I could have drank for hours. bravo. 887 charactersderftron, Jan 30, 2014

Appears - light-absorbing darkness; traces of tan, creamy head
Smells - lush; more than traces of licorice and cacao
Tastes - impeccably balanced sweetness and dark chocolate bitterness; amazingly complicated array of layers to dissect: licorice, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, coffee, oak cask wood and earth; lingering bourbon barrel finish with alcohol ephemera
Mouthfeels - silky, satiny smooth; coating but not heavy; approaching syrupy but with the ideal amount of carbonation to lighten
Overalls - adding my voice to the general consensus of this beer's epic awesomeness; a bomber is almost too much to enjoy alone, but I'll make the sacrifice; a beer that welcomes reflection after each sip; well worth the price even if you're outside the distribution zone 860 charactersGerasimos, Jan 25, 2014

Virtually zero head, but nice even lacing with infinite bubbles. I almost trembled as I brought the glass to my nose, but the reward was remarkable. Licorice and chocolate dominate both the nose and the palate, but the taste is literally intoxicating. Upon the palate, the bourbon chocolate is phenomenally drawing and absorbing, warm and inviting, and consistently sensual. Mere words cannot possibly describe just how innocently lustful this brew envelops the senses. Both the nose and the mouthfeel expression are intoxicating. Pure rapture in a bottle. I so stunned that I cannot possibly do justice to the experience, except to say that when you get here you will understand what I mean. Pure nirvana... 781 charactersJohnParadee, Jan 25, 2014

From a 22oz bottle into a Bruery tulip. 
Appearance: All barrel aged imperial stouts (BA-IS) look the same: pitch black with a big, mocha head that rapidly dissolves into a solid, tan ring. 
NOSE: I wanted to say bourbon, but as it warms it's reminding me more of Armagnac - I think due to hints of cherries. Chocolate, lots of chocolate, with whip cream that makes me think of ice cream sundaes! I'll still go ahead and say bourbon. Vanilla. Oak.
TASTE: The common BA-IS traits are here: bourbon, vanilla, oak, dark chocolate and sweet roasted malts are supported by the barrel's contributions of bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Another sip adds a few more notes - whip cream with chocolate syrup...those mental images of chocolate sundaes are coming back! Traces of nuttiness and alcohol.
MOUTHFEEL: Big, creamy body (obviously) that coats the mouth like a sweet dark blanket. There's nice carbonation; a little more than I anticipated. 
FINISH: There's a strong alcohol presence. It seems more to me than 13%. The finish leaves my mouth coated in thick sweet chocolaty goodness.
OVERALL: I went into this expecting a standard BA-IS, and that's exactly what I got, which is just fine for me tonight. This is a perfect example of the style; the only real weakness might be the alcohol burn, but truth be told I kinda like it. 
For the price/availability for me (in Southern California), I'd recommend this over just about any BA-IS I've come across. Truth be told, I downright like it more than a lot of them I've had recently, including the holier than thou BCBS.

Pours black with well-retained head and lacing. Head is slightly tanned and a bit fizzy, which correctly suggests the body is not "thick" as such.
Nose is a banana split- banana, chocolate, vanilla. Thick and decadent chocolate ice cream. Cocoa powder. Still very bourbon-forward with an earthy chocolate behind that. But a very nice, smooth and integrated aroma. Perhaps a hint of rye/soy.
Taste is coffee grounds, banana. Bourbon. Some gunpowder as the beer warms.
Mouthfeel is about medium. Sour and a little astringent.
Not an endlessly complex beer but an extremely solid one.
Tried a little in a black and tan with Evil Twin Molotov Cocktail. Not recommended. 692 charactersdanieelol, Jan 17, 2014

4.72/5  rDev +4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52011 bottling poured into a Stone IRS snifter. The pour is pitch black, opaque, and very sinister-looking. A rough pour produces a thin, dark brown head that quickly dies down to a thin edge lacing. Mild nose (perhaps it's a bit cold) with muddled bourbon, oak, fudge, and dark fruit notes.
The beer is very full-bodied with a rich, complex flavor and velvety feel. The flavor is amazing and the super creamy feel of this beer pushes it completely off-the-chart. Extraordinary depth and complexity here. I don't think I've ever detected this many flavors in a beer since I first tried The Abyss. Sweet malt, toffee, and milk chocolate up front, followed by bourbon, licorice, and vanilla at mid-palate. Finally, I get fudge, coffee, and molasses in the back of the palate. There is just a whiff of alcohol warmth as the bourbon and toffee return and linger briefly on the finish with the coffee, then it all turns to rich, fruity port.
I am a huge fan of Russian Imperial Stouts and this is a masterpiece of a beer that approaches RIS flavor perfection. I'd love to try this a little fresher so I can get the total effect. My thanks to ThaFATkid for giving me the opportunity to try this. I owe you one, buddy! 1,212 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Jan 16, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer is damn near perfect, and the only drawback I could see would be the booziness. However, at 13% abv that is somewhat expected, and for me it didn't detract too much away from the enjoy-ability of the beer. At the front there is a dark chocolate bitterness with some coffee and booze, and on the back end it gets a lot smoother and creamier. Definitely can get the bourbon notes from the beer as well which comes across with nice molasses flavor and slight vanilla. Overall, if you don't mind booze in a beer( which lightens as it warms up) then this beer is a great choice. Great balance of sweetness and bitterness, and its definitely a must try. 657 charactersCTbrew32, Jan 04, 2014

Look- Pours a rather thin looking dark brown leaving a couple centimeters of light tan foam behind. It quickly diminishes to a ring around the glass. There is a oily residue clinging as well. 
Smell- Bourbon, heavy wet oak, molasses, tobacco and faint vanilla. 
Taste- Wet earthy oak, bourbon, tobacco, cardboard and vanilla in the finish. 
Feel- It definitely feels thicker and creamier than it looked pouring. There's a bit of alcohol burn in the back. 
Overall- It looked slightly lighter in color and thinner than past batches, but it definitely delivered the goods overall. There is a very heavy oak presence complementing the bourbon which I found very appealing. The smaller format is nice when drinking a 14.5% abv. beer alone, I just wish I could have found more than two bottles in my travels. A top notch experience as always! 963 charactersPrager62, Jan 01, 2014
4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought a 650ml bottle from Beers of the World, Spring 2013. Poured into a chalice, served at cellar temp.
Appearance: Onyx black with no light permitted to pass. 2 finger cappuchino head, decent lacing.
Aroma: Bourbon is well masked behind coffee, chocolate and vanilla.
Mouthfeel: soft as silk
Taste: lots of coffee and chocolate with Bourbon in the background.
Notes: superbly crafted, tasty, flawless. This stout is not as much of a 'character' as BCBS or KBS but it is just unbelievably good beer. I like those two beers more but this is a beer to admire greatly. 572 charactersfx20736, Jan 01, 2014

Appearance- Black with no transparency. Thin head laces nicely with movement.
Smell- Tons of vanilla right off the bat. Dark Chocolate, with a bit of sweetness. The booze is very present in the nose with a long draw. Bourbon. Smelling this thing is amazing. Its hard not to taste it right away, but like all things anticipation makes the experience more memorable. This is my third spin with this beer in consecutive years. I look forward to it each year.
Taste - Vanilla again very present in the front as it was with inital nose time. If you keep it on top of the tounge down the throat, you get the sweetness of chocolate, and vanilla with the bourbon and oak. The finish is smooth with a bit of bitterness from the choclate and coffee. Booze is warming and not overpowering. If you taste letting it spill all over your tounge to the sides and beneath, it just explodes. Fruit comes out with some cinnamon. our friends Bourbon and Oak in the middle of it all. The flavors are just insane, and change along the way. 
Mouthfeel - Light dispite its big flavors and dense color. Carbonation is perfect as you get a little tounge buzz from it. Not too boozy, but it makes it clear your drinking a big one. Finish is clean with sweet glazed bitter finish. 
Overall- This is tops in this style for me. I'm a hop head who enjoys a strong stout in the winter. This one is as stong as you want, with all the warmth the season commands. The flavor palate is just a perfect celebration of the season. Its your favorite black morning coffee, your decadent after dinner desert, and your evening bourbon all in one. If you see it get it, and share it with those who aren't afraid.

Poured into my Urthel glass.
Appeared a midnight-black color with a one finger cappuccino head that left some nice lacing.
Smell was amazing. Espresso, vanilla and bitter chocolate. A bit of a port-wine character to it. Nice bourbon burn in the nose.
Taste was delicious and complex. First you are hit with some malty sweetness and vanilla. This gives way to the more bitter chocolate/coffee notes. The bourbon finish is nice - perfectly balanced with the flavors.
Beautiful mouth-feel - silky and smooth, thick but not syrupy. The alcohol played a nice part in warming your throat as you drank.
Overall this is ranking as my favorite beer to date. I am a huge BCBS fan but find this slightly better and more balanced. I love the barrel-aging on this, I think FW hit it perfect. Wow...love it. 832 charactersTWStandley, Dec 27, 2013

Appearance- opaque black. No light gets through at all and it leaves a nice quarter inch head that lingers for a while. 
Smell- caramel and vanilla with sweet notes like candied fruit. A hint of chocolate and coffee. Toffee seems to be present a little but the biggest smell is definitely candied fruits with vanilla. A nice surprise. 
Taste - taste the sugaryness of the candy fruit. Caramel and vanilla on the back end that linger until you take another sip. can't taste much coffee which i like. Dark chocolate notes on the front end that releases a sweetness while going down. 
Mouthfeel - lighter than i expected with not a lot of carbonation. The carbonation that is present is mild and doesn't 'fizz' in the mouth as much as others. Goes down smooth. Alcohol content is hidden very well. No burn
Overall- very well done beer. All the flavors mix perfectlu together without any particular flavor dominating the palate. I wish there was less of the candied fruits and sweetness in the smell but other than that it is a phenomenal brew that i recommend everyone try! 1,116 charactersmlhyatt, Dec 26, 2013

A - Dark like the winter night sky with a 1 finger brown head. Fades into oblivion with some lacing that also vanishes. 
S - Sweet caramel, bourbon, and vanilla start it off. Some bitterness of hops and dark chocolate come in after. Hints of brown sugar and cocoa are also subdued as it warms. 
T - This is fantastic. All the sweetness from the stout and barrel are balanced by the bitterness from the hops. Vanilla, dark chocolate, roasted coffee, caramel, brown sugar, and cocoa. 
M - Medium to full bodied with a smooth and rich mouthfeel. Carbonation is good for the style. 
O - An amazing stout that allows the barrel aging to help sweeten the bitter stout. 708 charactersRi0, Dec 25, 2013

22oz bottle served in a Duvel tulip
Vintage 2013
A - Pours black with a thin mocha cap. The head settles down and vanishes while leaving thick legs down the glass.
S - Massive roasted malt aroma, rich bready malts, Amish chocolate bread, caramel/chocolate, big nutty yeast, toasted coconut, vanilla, toasted graham crackers, cherries and other dark fruits come out as it warms.
T - Roasted barley, sweetened espresso, bittersweet chocolate, molasses, nutty brown bread, strong coffee flavored with coconut syrup. The bourbon is light but rustic with a scorched butterscotch character. Dark fruit emerges as it warms. The alcohol 
M - Medium full body when cold but once warm turns to light side of medium body, thin but silky feel, the consistency becomes more syrupy as it warms. Warming finish with some bite.
A big and bold flavored beer that is far from boring. The yeast was very strong and nutty creating a very bready flavor, which was a nice change for a RIS. I liked this one colder rather than warm. Once this warms up it becomes a thin syrupy alcohol bomb. The bourbon was there but delicate and didn't overpower the hefty malt bill. Nice fruit components but it's hard to distinguish the type of fruits. Glad I got to try this one. 
Drink this big boy cold. 1,308 charactersStaveHooks, Dec 19, 2013

A: Pours very dark with a thin layer of khaki head that reduces quickly and leaves no lacing. 
S: The aroma on this surprises me - it is more subtle than I expected. There are all the aspects I expected - bourbon, coffee, roasty, oatmeal, chocolate. 
T: Far exceeds the power of the aroma. Flavor is full of bourbon chocolatey goodness. Compliments of coffee, roast, smokey I'm the background. 
M: Carbed well, very easy to drink at 13%. Leaves just the slightest dry aftertaste that leaves me craving the next sip. 
O: A must try for any beer advocate. I see this guy traded left and right, I just hope it is enjoyed by everyone who can get their hands on it, and shared by everyone who has the chance. 738 charactersroger617, Dec 14, 2013

A: Poured near black with a dark brown tinge with a finger of beige head.
S: Bourbon, dark fruit, roasty malts, brown sugar, chocolate. Slight hops. As it warms the caramel smell really comes out.
T: Vanilla, roasted malts, chocolate, tobacco, coffee, caramel. Some hop bitterness. The sweet caramel/fudge brownie flavors also come out as it warms. Very nice balance of sweet and bitter.
M: Medium to full bodied. Very easily drinkable, I barely detect the alcohol. Somewhat thick feel to it. A very nice balance of sweet and bitter.
Overall a crazy good beer. The balance of flavors is amazing. Easily one of the best stouts I have had. 679 charactersJoshpu, Nov 29, 2013

A: Absolute black, as in the absence of light. Little to no head, but this is not unusual for such a large barrel aged beer. Lacing is small and spotty. 
S: Sticky dark fudge sauce. Thick, chewy dark caramel. Brown sugar. Hints of espresso and coffee beans. Warming vanilla. Bourbon has a firm but gentle grip on the nose, oak as well. Touch of char and acrid smoke. Bruised prune, fig, and baked apple. Highly complex, wave upon wave of bold new aromas. Excellent. 
T: Bakers chocolate, black cocoa. Waves of chewy dark caramel and fudge sauce bring a lot of sweetness. Rolos candy. Double chocolate cake generously topped with a thick chocolate frosting. Mocha and chocolate biscotti. Hints of brown sugar. Bourbon is apparent and assertive, bringing a stiff whiskey punch. It never gets too hot though, as the beer is so big that it can handle it. Subtle fruity undertones of fig and baked apple. Woody vanilla and underpinnings of oak. Hollow hop bitterness, but the counterpoints provided by the oak and bourbon also help to keep the massive malt sweetness from running amok. Infinitely long finish of caramel and fudge with receding bourbon and a kiss of smokey roasted malts.
M: Massively thick and chewy. Very full and round in the mouth with a lot of substance. For all its size and heft, it still does not seem overly weighty. It glides easily over the tongue with a refined and effortless velvety smooth texture. Little in the way of carbonation, but it isn't really needed. Plenty of warming alcohol.
O: Wow. An absolutely enormous beer, but such a pleasure to sip. Hugely complex, but surprisingly lithe on the palate for its size. It's one of the rare beers that not only lives up to the hype, but surpasses it. Firestone Walker's barrel aging and blending programs simply cannot be touched.
Note: Made for an amazing pairing with Sartori Espresso rubbed BellaVitano. 1,942 charactersryan1788a5, Nov 29, 2013

4.46/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Been waiting on this one for a special occasion to crack this one. Today was nothing super special however I could count it as spill over from MSU making it to the big ten title game, along with finishing a small project at work. But most importantly it is my 300 reviewed beer, not rated, reviewed!
Bought from Little's Wine and Liquor store over the summer (maybe around July). The specs on this are all posted reserve series 003 from march of 2012. I believe it was aged 12 months in barrels and it was cellaring for around a year and a half. 
Shared with some friends and poured into a snifter. 
A&S: Lots of dark fruits and sweetness up front. Surprisingly there is a decent amount of oakyness left over even after a year plus of aging. Not as much chocolate or alcohol as expected. Jet black colored beer. Creamy tan head that hangs around in a very thin layer. 
T&M: Upfront a pretty powerful amount of bourbon, although bourbon isn't described in the beer label's description. Decent amount of vanilla present upfront and midway through the taste. A present but not overwhelming smokiness in the finish. Other favors include licorice and some sour tones. Dark & milk chocolate along with some alcohol present in the finish. For the most part the alcohol is well hidden. More mild in the taste then I expected. Very creamy feel, medium to high body and lower carbonation (but not completely dead). 
Overall: As with all of firestone walker's beers really solid. I had pretty high expectation for this beer, and it lived up to most of them. I would be interested in trying this beer "fresher". I would say it was a little overrated being in the top 10. 1,663 charactersminterro, Nov 27, 2013

I have tried it multiple years and it just doesn't do it for me. I can understand how people can like it. It just isn't my thing. The smell is really good, and the appearance is amazing almost like motor oil. It is just a lot of booze flavor and to big of a beer to sit and drink. 356 charactersvinny21bal, Nov 17, 2013
4.24/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.2522-oz bomber to tulip, shared. 2011 vintage, courtesy of daniloknezic.
Thick, slow pour, dark as night, very slight red tinge at the edge. Minimal, 1/2-finger tan head fades to a very minimal collar.
Whiskey dominates the nose. Oak, tobacco, coconut. Vanilla with warmth, perhaps toffee.
Oaky bourbon, dark cocoa, stone fruit. Vanilla at the back end.
Agree with many of the observations of Stevedore here. It is not particularly thick, moderately carbonated. Owing perhaps to the predominance of the bourbon on the palate, it is lacking the alegasmic "fudginess" of Baudoinia (or even the 2012 BCBS I sampled on tap last weekend). It is not as creamy or smooth as Black Note. Way too much bourbon, even at 2+ years. 720 charactersStoutItOutLoud, Nov 17, 2013

Nose is of caramel and bourbon.
Tobacco, raisin and molasses, then, of course, bourbon barrel. Prominent sweet, sharp chocolate and light tinges of cinnamon go very well with the high ABV, mixes instead of hiding it. Great roasted malt character, though can't pick out coffee specifically. A year old really is the way to go, I had a 3 year vertical. That gives it a mellow, cloudy base.
Dense, syrupy, delicious. 446 characterspants678, Nov 09, 2013

Not as pure black as some Imperial Stouts, but beautiful. Scents of oak, coconut, bourbon, faint coffee hints of alcohol and a bit of sweetness. Very nice, definitely an oak aged RIS, rich and boozy. I love it. Flavor starts with roast malt, black coffee, oak, bourbon and sweet malt, with very faint hints of alcohol. The finish brings forth bittersweet cocoa, sweet chocolate and alcohol that carry into the aftertaste. Very good. Deep and strong in flavor, with all the notes of barrel aging and a good RIS as well. Mouthfeel is thick and heavy bodied with moderate carbonation, a smooth feeling and a slight hint of alcohol burn. Very easy to drink, hiding the 13% ABV quite well. Overall this is an excellent RIS. It's got the nice barrel aged quality and the core strengths of the style to carry it and it is just plain wonderful to drink. 949 charactersAuraan, Nov 09, 2013

review #550
A- Pours pitch black in the glass. A rather large frothy brown head. Pretty impressive alcohol legs as well.
S- Strong bourbon nose. A hint of alcohol. A lot of bitter dark chocolate. Burnt sugar. Leather and a hint of oak. 
T- A big dark chocolate flavor at first. A nice burnt sugar and caramel. Sticky molasses. A big bourbon character, lots of sour mash. A burnt oak flavor. Lots of wood flavor. Some alcohol, I did have this beer a few months ago and the alcohol has receded quite a bit.
M- Big and full bodied, some alcohol burn. 
O- One of the best out there. 629 charactersTwelveOunces, Nov 04, 2013

This beer would be a great candidate to age. I had the 2013 Vintage and although it was very good, it had a little too much of the roastiness that I don't love in fresh imperial stouts. With some time though, my guess is this taste would mellow out allowing some of the other flavors to come through. Overall though, this beer was fantastic as it has a great bourbon smell and taste to help compliment the imperial stout characteristics that are there behind the bourbon. 574 charactersmjpolzin, Nov 03, 2013

A - Amazing Dark as night with small head. Minimal Carbonation.
S - Amazing cocoa chocolate, vanilla, coffee with minimal booze smell
T - One of my all time favorite beers. Taste as it smells. Alcohol is perfectly hidden in this monster. Chocolate, oatmeal, marshmallows, vanilla, coffee. Amazing flavors all come out of this beer as it warms to 55
M - Nice and creamy, smooth with full body. 
O - One of my favorite stouts to date. Still have Dark Lord, Darkness, Berserker, Speedway and a couple others in the cellar to try. Comparable to the Abyss which is at the top of my stout list right now. It makes its way to the top due to the low level or carb, creamy full bodied mouth feel, and the aging has made this beer nearly flawless 816 charactersdrmcleod10, Oct 29, 2013

Thanks to afallon86 for the trade!!!
A: Midnight black in color and pouring to 2 fingers of thick, creamy mocha head slowly settling to a thin creamy collar and leaving loads of lacing.
S: Sweet malt, impressive roasted character, a bit of espresso and a big boozy bourbon nose, but in balance with the rest of the beer.
T: Sweet and rich! Massive dark roasted malt character, raisins, figs, molasses, dark brown sugar; dark chocolate and a bit of coffee and lots of boozy bourbon. As the beer warms, the boozy bourbon becomes stronger and the alcohol becomes known.
M: Big body and medium low carbonation; rich, silky, smooth.

4.51/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Finally found an opportunity to open up a bottle of Parabola I have on me. I've been very impressed overall with FW's barrel aging program, and this lived up to my expectations. 2013 vintage (in Four Roses barrels!!). I actually had the chance to take a sip of this vintage a few months prior to this review, and although the bottle in question had been opened 3 weeks before I tried it, it was STILL impressive in spite of its flat and old feel. Poured out of a 22oz bottle into a tulip wine glass. Split with others for obvious reasons anticipating inebriation.
Pours an extremely darkened (yet not totally opaque) black color, complete with a lovely head that's mocha-brown tinged that rises about 2-3 fingers high in the glass. Other than relatively large tears, this leaves behind scattered patches of lacing, although not as much as I'd expect as this doesn't seem to be bottle conditioned. It DOES however maintain excellent head retention when considering the ABV at hand, and the color never seems to let go in the same vein of an excellently brewed espresso. Quite eye candy from the very start - leaves you excited to try it.
The aroma is even more exciting - big yet boldly refined notes of bourbon sweetness and roasted stout characteristics that are both rich and refined. At first, the bourbon immediately comes through, displaying notes of vanilla and coconut shavings, as well as caramel and light leather and tobacco. Soon, however, it dispels slightly to reveal wonderful notes of dark fruit, ranging from raisins to dark ripe cherries, all topped with molasses, cinnamon (the largest spice, actually), brown sugar, and light anise. The roasted notes are a little buried under the sugar and spices, but it's most definitely there - roasted oats, light coffee, cocoa nibs, and light dust and earth. Extremely complex, but the bourbon is rather strong at times. Still, ranks up there as one of the most memorable aromas I've come across on a bourbon barrel blended stout.
At first, you're immediately washed with notes of sweet bourbon, with vanilla, coconut, caramel, and light butterscotch, but very soon it fades away and the roasted, oat forward malty notes, as well as barrel spices, start to come in to create something truly beautiful. The best way I can describe drinking this is the equivalent of chewing on bourbon toasted chocolate caramel covered espresso beans. Roasted notes of coffee and chocolate cut the sweetness dramatically, and hide the ABV in order to create a more refined drinking experience. Tobacco, cherries, leather, and floral textures follow, as well as the wonderful caramelized cinnamon and maple syrup flavors that complete the journey. Silky and velvety, with excellent carbonation and thickness that makes this comfortable and delightful to sip. A true pleasure overall.
Without any doubt, this vintage may be the best one FW has developed in their line of barrel aged beers, and the drinkable qualities of this are absurdly superior. Sadly, I don't think this would age very well, as I feel the roasted, fresh herbal notes are what make this unique, and it would most definitely lose them over time. I'm going to experiment with aging this for a year and see how it holds up. No matter what, however, this is a true treasure. Lives up to the hype, and is totally worth tracking down. I haven't had the opportunity to try or to crack open any other significant amount of widely considered world class bourbon aged stouts so far, but I'm wondering if most people should bother even MAKING any when we have FW's barrel program. This is amazing stuff - completely exceeded my expectations with its complexity.
UPDATE (1/6/2014): Damn the hype! This is amazing stuff, no doubt, but after pitting it in a bourbon barrel stout blind tasting some time ago, this didn't even make the top. Very sweet compared to other offerings of its kind, but perhaps the best one that's easy to get. Gets a lot of those bourbon sweet oak notes that I find a little difficult to wade through. This is best fresh - once it loses that roasted character, it gets a little too putrid, herbal, and sweet. Still, phenomenal stuff, but let's not forget to be objective even about our favorite beers. 4,236 charactersmagictacosinus, Oct 21, 2013

Pours a deep black with a small tan head. Smell is dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, marshmallows and some dark fruits. Taste is bourbon and coffee with some dark chocolate and a little vanilla and toffee. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with light carbonation. Overall a great beer. 315 charactersJas45678, Oct 07, 2013

A vigorous pour into my Lost Abbey Teku glass produces a dense, darkly browned, fat-two-finger thick head. The beer is an inky black color that shows perhaps a hint of color around the edges when held up to the light, but remains ominously opaque. The aroma smells of hot alcohol, and Bourbon soaked fruit as I pour this, a closer inspection yields lots of barrel and bourbon influences and, at first blush, only a touch of toasted malt character. The barrel / bourbon character is fairly smooth, considering the 13% abv, with lots of burnt sweetened coconut, ample vanillin, touches of spicy oak, and lots of toasted character that supports the toasted malt. The malt character is here, especially as my nose gets used to the barrel influence that was so dominant at first; aromas of sweetened, concentrated black malts, touches of char, cold espresso, and lots of roasted nutty notes. Interestingly enough, the barrel character is dominant at first, but once your really start to dig in for an extended time, the malt aromatics come to dominate and almost completely consume the Bourbon notes; in the end this ends up well balanced between the barrel character and the dark malt character & is quite a bit more enjoyable than my first impression left me with. As the beer warms up it can be a touch hot smelling, which certainly detracts a bit, but isn’t a deal killer for my enjoyment of the aroma.
Thick, rich, and viscous, this beer is most definitely a sipping beer; it isn’t as dense, or cloying as something like Darklord, but certainly is a meal in a glass. The beer isn’t as sweet as it could be, and much of the sweetness that is here is a complex, concentrated, roasted caramelization, rather than simplistic, cloying sweetness; this definitely escapes being cloying. Big, bitter, burnt, roast notes linger on the palate in the long finish; after some time the finish sees my first flavor influence from the barrel with some softer Bourbon-fruit notes (alcoholic melon more than anything), as well as some spicy oak notes and an astringency and alcohol warmth accentuating barrel character. Now that I have noticed the Bourbon character it is quite a bit more noticeable throughout the flavor profile. A rich nutty note, that is definitely on the roasted side of things, flavors the middle and finish of each sip. Vanillin flavors as well as notes of toasted coconut (in that order of noticeability) accentuate the sweetness in the middle of each sip. There is a sweet, somewhat concentrated, coffee syrup like note here that is a product of the ample residual malt and the roasted grains. The beer can be a touch hot and in my second pour the carbonation really seems to accentuated the spicy / hot Bourbon notes over the base, Imperial Stout; this is definitely much more enjoyable with a lighter carbonation. Once I swirl out a bunch of the carbonation a roasted cocoa and dark chocolate note start to come out. 
I like that this isn’t overly Bourbon influenced, it is a bit hot & boozy in the end, but what can you expect from a 13% beer. Still, this does achieve a fair amount of balance in the end and is a nice way to cap off a long day; though I certainly wouldn’t want to try and finish off a whole 22oz bottle. 3,284 charactersGueuzedude, Sep 30, 2013

A - Pours a midnight black with no light. The head is one fingered and reduces to a film.
S - Aromas of Bourbon, toasted poppy seeds raisins and current with a little booze.
T - Plenty of vanilla, oak and raisins up front, fruit cake comes through on the mid palate with dark fruit and raisins on the back palate, before the balanced bourbon vapors kick in for a lingering finish. Excellent
M - Full body with medium carbonation, a very creamy feel and everything is in harmony.
O - This is a very well constructed brew. The bourbon aspect is introduced with balance and there are still a lot of other flavours on offer. The creaminess is truly impressive. I could drink this beer as a night cap constantly. 787 characterseric5bellies, Sep 14, 2013

A- Pours pitch black and thick with about a one finger, tan colored head. Head retains as the body of the beer is dark and ominous. Lacing is very good for the smaller sized head left on the top.
S- A mild intermingling of charred barrel notes, semisweet vanilla, bourbon spiciness, and rich dark malts. Really a complex, but consistent, scent throughout the entire duration of the smell. Chocolate is a little more prominent and noticeable at the very end.
T- Starts with a smooth dark malt flavor. Mild coffee mixes with semisweet chocolate before giving way to the barrel flavor profile. The middle of the drink is barrel dominant, yet mild. Vanilla and a hint of bourbon meld together to provide a smooth, gentle barrel flavor. Towards the end of the drink, more traditional RIS flavors come out in the form of mildly bitter dark malts. Just a hint of a dark fruit flavor from the dark malts. Ends with just a small bit of lingering barrel spiciness.
M- Tick and smooth, but just a little high in the carbonation department. Barrel is subdued enough that this isn't a sipper, but the alcohol will catch you if you don't respect it. Overall, this one just feels smooth.
Overall, this beer lives up to its billing. As far as barrel aged stouts go, this is right there with BCBS and KBS. I think the oatmeal gives this beer an edge in smooth feel over some others. 1,383 charactersboilermakerbrew, Sep 06, 2013

Pours a dark caramel brown colour, certainly not black but not far from it either. Its got a nice fluffy, bubbly light tan head that dissipates quickly into a bubbly collar, not much in way of film on the surface. Not much lacing to speak of which is fairly typical for a stout like this. 
Its got a coconut and chocolate smell coming right out of the snifter. There's a kind of a sticky bourbon sweetness that reminds me of marshmallows, though that's not particularly strong here compared to say, BVDL or Rare. There's some deep flavours murking around here- maybe some toffee, a little bit of oak- but its kind of a mess right now where I can't really pick out one thing. There is a little bit of fusel here as well, unfortunately, which I am not a fan of.
Sipping this beer gives me a nice sweet twang straight up. It's that sweet bourbon. Its heavy on it. Then there's a bit of coconut, vanilla overlying it along with a bit of chocolate. But there really doesn't seem to be as much contribution from the base beer if that makes sense. I don't get the nice sugary chocolatey sweetness of Bourbon County or Black Note, nor is there that roast maltiness or the vanilla-ey creaminess of Assassin or Rare. It tastes like mellowed-out sweet bourbon with a splash of chocolate and tobacco, to be honest. Its not as complex as people make it out to be, in my opinion.
Disappointingly thinner body, on the medium body side. It doesn't have that creamy mouthfeel that you get with Bourbon County for example, but it is rather smooth. Carbonation is just right for the style and the aftertaste is of that sweet bourbon. A decent bit of booziness here, but not enough to deter me here. Its absolutely a sipper here.. not meant for pounding.
Overall, a very good barrel-aged imperial stout that's relatively readily available on the shelf at a solid price point. It showcases the bourbon, but not as well as a beer like Central Waters' Fifteen does.. but then again this is a shelf beer! I guess that "showcasing bourbon" thing is not enough to impress me these days.. plenty of BA stouts do a good job of that already. I just would like the base beer to stand out more in these types of beers. Otherwise, you might as well splash some bourbon in a non-BA stout. That being said, it's a good example of a bourbon barrel-aged imperial stout so don't let my opinion prevent you from trying this beer. It's certainly worth drinking anytime. 2,630 charactersStevedore, Aug 23, 2013

The only beer that arguably surpasses it that I know of in this category is Goose Island's Bourbon County (which I think has the edge in terms of a viscous "motor-oil" quality). Clearly, Firestone is at the top of their game here, and this version is probably even better than the prior two years.... I think this version has a little extra sweetness that takes some edge off the bourbon. 505 charactersUpToMeBeer, Aug 21, 2013

I poured this into my firestone tulip after letting this brew warm up a bit.
The color is deepest brown with very sutle hints of ruby. The head was deepest mocha and lingered long after the pour as a thick foamy ring. Spotty lacing was left on the glass.
The aroma has a depth but is dominated by a huge alcohol presence. It seems to take over the smell. That aside one can smell dark fruits, coffee or espresso, vinilla roasted malts and bourbon barrels.
Drinks thick and velvetty on the palate but with touchs of tannins that make it semi dry.
A bold roasted malt flavor greets you first perhaps with even some char and burnt malts.
Considerable alcohol notes intermingle and weave through the flavor. The alcohol presence is really too much for me, it's very dominate in the taste like in the nose.
Like the nose the flavor depth is quite deep I can taste coffee, vinilla, licorise, fruits, char and oak to name a few.
A wonderfull beer very complex and flavorfull. The alcohol and bourbon were through the roof for me. I cut the rest of the bottle with some DBA. The mix made an excellent bourbon barrel black IPA. 1,182 charactersmicromaniac129, Aug 09, 2013
5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Amazingly balanced hefty stout, at a great price.
The first time I had this one, 2011, I walked into a BevMo to buy two beers for myself to drink during a house party...and got 2 bottles of this, thinking "meh, cheap burly Stout, that'll do great for the night" not knowing at all what I had.
Half way through the night, I'm completely trashed off both bottles wondering what this was and why it tasted so amazing, and when did Firestone get so good when I only remember the DBA being boring before!? This really turned me onto them, and I keep an eye out for any in the Reserve Series (Abacus/Sucaba is great, too).
Anyway. Now I always buy the max, and I have at least 2-3 of each vintage since then in my cellar.
Dark, rich, not much carbonation, chocolate and bourbon notes, lots of roasted malts...just about everything I want in a stout.
Can't wait for the 2014 release, so I can keep the cycle going. 912 characterssteenkampa, Aug 08, 2013

M - Extra creamy, smooth as silk. Full body, low carbonation. Warming alcohol.
O - This is an incredible stout. Lots of complexity. Extremely enjoyable and surprisingly easy to drink - the alcohol is masked well, but this is one to sip and savour. A perfect barrel aged stout. 626 charactersmooseo, Aug 08, 2013

A: Black with a medium dark tan head, good looking carb
S: Delicious oak and bourbon swirled with roasty malt
T: Very similar to the aroma. The first thing I noticed, as I do with many big barrel aged FW beers, is that at 12.5% this is incredibly mellow. There is roasty bitter malt, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak. All the usual suspects. Its as if the identity of the flavor is fantastic but its all dialed down a bit too much
M: Smooth and thick, right amount of carb
O: Really delicious stuff, don't get me wrong. However, I don't think its worthy of its spot so high on the top 250 and I wish the flavors were a bit more intensified. 682 charactersanteater, Aug 04, 2013

The pour is a deep dark brown with an opaque black veil dropping down from top to near the bottom. The brown is around the edges and there is a short-lived tan head.
Imperial Stout aroma galore including dark malts, sugar sweetness, licorice, chocolate, fig, wood, and the slightest sniff of smoke. Hops are downplayed on the nose.
The body is full and delicately smooth.
The taste is upfront with sweet malts, a little chocolate, maybe some butterscotch, and bourbon with this moderate hop bitterness that powers its way forward at the very finish lingering briefly. A topnotch Imperial Stout. 668 characterspuboflyons, Jul 31, 2013

A - Black as night. A vigorous pour which yielded a 2 finger tan head that dissipated quickly, as is to be expected.
S - Roasty, toasty malts which gave up dark and milk chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon, and espresso.
T - Wow! The rich coffee and espresso notes really shine in this vintage. The oaky vanilla/bourbon doesn't smack you in the face, it's released ever so sweetly and delicately from the front to the back of your mouth. There is even some slight dark fruit in the middle. The age has done this beer wonders and you just don't taste the 13% ABV. Definitely a sweetness, but one that is pleasant and rich, not cloying.
M - Ever so silky across the palate. 
O - Hands down, this is my personal favorite beer of all time. So well balanced and should be the example for brewer's everywhere what a barrel aged Imperial Stout should be. It ages perfectly, but is oh so fantastic as a young beer (I had the 2013 on release weekend at the brewery on tap). I just have to say over and over how good this beer is! 1,247 charactersbnelson997, Jul 30, 2013

Bottle purchased at DeCicco's. 
2013 vintage. 
It pours an opaque midnight black and is light brown on its edges with a half finger of light brown head. 
Sweet roasted malt, chocolate and vanilla first hit the nose. This is quickly followed by a volley of oaky vanilla, and bourbon spirit that rounds out the early sweetness. Booze is perceptible but only barely, impressive for 13%; however as it opens this booze becomes much more pronounced. There's a touch of soy sauce but this is light. 
This beer presents an immense, boisterous complexity that is nothing short of artful. Upfront dark chocolate and coffee rally back and forth in a tantalizing and inviting fore-palate. This leads into a chocolatey, roasty and deliciously sweet mid palate - this soon proves to be the fulcrum of this beer. The finish is a beautiful example of perfect barrel aging. Oaky vanilla and bourbon spirit explode in the finish and provide an excellent foil to the sweeter flavors that are present upfront. The finish also packs a boozy, but fitting, punch. Despite this binary balance in flavors there is a consistent undercurrent. The characteristics of the barrel lie subtly underneath the fore and mid palate and then overtake these flavors in the back providing balance. 
The mouthfeel of this beer is near perfect. The beer is viscous and seemingly lacks carbonation until the back where it lifts the beer and nearly negates any heady booze. 
This is a gorgeous beer that is in my mind one of the best barrel aged stouts that I have ever had the plesure of consuming. It is a sipper for sure but it leaves the mind continually processing its complexity. It is absolutely incredible and perfectly balanced with every element working in perfect union with the others. 1,778 charactersTallSaint, Jul 30, 2013

A - A deep, dark black with a moderate tan head that dissipates quickly. I thought it would hang around a little longer.
S - Wonderful depth with bourbon, wood, chocolate, molasses, coffee and licorice.
T - Powerful without being harsh or unbalanced. Well, the bourbon is the clear leader. Fantastic notes of chocolate and molasses join in. This is an intense beer. The alcohol doesn't distract from the various flavors but it makes damn sure you know it's there.
M - Silky and creamy with a nice low carbonation that lets the flavor run wild.

4.83/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.752013: One of my top beers I look forward to each year, and fortunately for me, the Firestone brewery is just 5 minutes up the road. Quite simply put, this is one of the best imperial stouts I have ever had, second only to the World Wide available occasionally from Dogfish Head. This beer is spot on in every way. Pours an absolute pitch black, no hints of light what-so-ever sneak through. The smell features lots of vanilla, honey, milk chocolate and hints of whiskey and oak. The taste is truly superb; rich and complex. Strong aged bourbon up front followed by tons of chocolate and roasted coffee. Take a little sip and just let it roll around your mouth... every taste bud on your tongue just melts with heavenly flavor. Palate is smooth and rich, little to no carbonation. 
Overall, an extraordinary beer, a treat for your senses. I bought a bunch of bottles of this and am going to save a few; I have heard that these age well.
2014: Nothing really new to add other than the bourbon is now slightly more pronounced which is further reflected in some added warmth and the slightly higher ABV now at 14%. This is still an amazing stout, and there is absolutely nothing bad I can say about it. Absolutely wonderful.
2015: Still amazing, bourbon is still very upfront and a significant majority of the aroma now. Rich arabica coffee is off the chart. Mouthfeel is slightly thinner than previous years and carbonation is a touch more pronounced. 1,451 charactersSamuel906, Jul 17, 2013

Smell is bourbon vanilla, chocolate, cherry, bit of tobacco, ash. Very strong and distinct smell. 
Taste is rich and velvety, espresso, bit of booze, dark fruits. 
Very strong and potent, super rich, yet easy on the palate. 
It’s a good beer for sure. 302 charactersSmurf2055, Jul 15, 2013
4.45/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Firestone makes a winning brew in the name of Parabola. The beer has a pitch black appealing appearance with a roasted malt, dark fruit and bourbon aroma. The mouthfeel was excellent making this beer very enjoyable. The only major issue I have with this beer is that it is way hot! the 13% ABV is in your face and overpowers the beer a bit. After having BCBCS the night before I realize how good it is by the way Goose Island hides the ABV. I have a few more of these beers and I want to age them to see if the heat calms down.
Overall its a quality beer but the ABV is hot and the bourbon could be more pronounced.
Bottom Line: Very good brew!
After letting the beer breath for a while the ABV burn relaxed a bit. 717 charactersthemind, Jul 15, 2013

Smell was hard to pick up but was poured into a pilsner glass, sadly. The bourbon barrel aging is smooth and not too harsh. Great flavors throughout, with roasty malts, vanilla, toffee, but balanced by some bitterness. This was served way too cold by really opened up as it warmed. 341 charactersMCain04, Jul 11, 2013

Poured into a standard tulip glass
Appearance: (4.75)
Pours an intimidating midnight black with a finger and a half of a tight tan head. It a takes a bit slower to recede to a half finger head than I was expecting, considering the 13% alcohol and the fact this aged for a year in 2nd use bourbon barrels. As it does recede it leaves zero lacing behind. Really impressive looking stout!
Aroma: (4.75)
Absolutely huge waves of toasted coconut, vanilla and molasses. Wow, I've never smelled a beer so coconut heavy! Dark, bitter notes of bakers chocolate and burnt coffee grounds; big roasted malt presence intermingling with the barrel character quite nicely. There is a earthy, herbal hop presence that plays as a perfect counterpart to the malt. Sweet, black cherries become apparent as the beer warms. Little to no alcohol is detectable. 
Taste: (5)
Notes of sweet chocolate covered cherries hit your palate first with strong impressions of vanilla and coconut soon to follow. More cascading notes of deep, woodsy, dark chocolate are soon to follow and just the right amount of toasty, roasted malt to balance out this massive stout. Finishes very dry and with an assertive hop bitterness and gigantic lingering notes of charred oak, coconut, vanilla, cherries and chocolate malt. Perfectly rounded and balanced for it's size. 
Mouthfeel: (5)
Robust, full bodied with moderate to high carbonation. The carbonation level is dialed in perfectly; its high enough so that it lifts the thick malt of the body off of your tongue, but is soft enough to let the subtle nuances of the beer to come out.
Overall: (5)
Wow, I knew this beer was going to be incredible, but I had no idea how amazing it would be! This enormous stout is balanced perfectly and is extremely easy to drink for it's ABV(13%). The barrel character is in your face, but doesn't steal though show at all, the malt and hops have just as much to say. Matt Brynildson is a magician. Much better than my previous favorite barrel aged stout, Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Stout. 
If you see this beer, BUY IT. 2,092 charactersflayedandskinned, Jul 02, 2013

2011 Parabola. Served in snifter glasses. So excited to finally try this aged beast/beauty.
Pours oily black with a rich, yet fluffy, mocha head. Retention is seriously outdoing itself. Looks thick. Opaque. Great look.
Semi-sweet malty nose with chocolate liquor, black roast, delicate bourbon whiskey, vanilla, butterscotch, licorice, stout aging musk, and a hint of leather. Divine, yet soft. I was expecting huge, and I get smooth and ripe.
Great tone to the bourbon. Adds a buttery richness and light caramel to an otherwise decadently dark, yet creamy, semi-sweet imperial stout. More dark chocolate syrup, vanilla, licorice, sweet alcohol, espresso roast, age-rounded malts, molasses, medicinal notes, and hints of dark sugars. Faint maple and corn-iness of the whiskey. Fantastic barrel-aged goodness.
Rich and full-bodied with a bushy-tailed finish, thanks to some good existing carbonation. I feel that this is 12.5% in my head, but my mouth is being seriously seduced. Well done. Great feel.
I'm glad I saved this sucker. I mean, I just never had the reason to dig it out of the closet... then, I forgot I had it. When I saw it again recently, after hunting for some good beers, I decided I was saving it for my 1,000th review. It paid off. Not as loud and obvious as KBS, not as rich as BBPt5, falls short of BCBS, but still an elite RIS. An excellent Sunday night stout of dreams to cap off a hell of a great day. 1,447 charactersthecheapies, Jul 01, 2013

4.59/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to the numerous BA's who sent me some bottles of this; I've put it off for way too long. It pours an extremely dark brown color that might as well be called jet-black as it sits, motionless in the glass. A light-mocha colored head plumes up and shows excellent retention; it lasts for days and leaves nice lace spots behind as it slowly recedes down the glass.
The aroma is magnificent; lots and lots of bourbon that's mellowed out by a deep onset of wood and oak. Plentiful amounts of chocolate graze the top of the booze; sweet, creamy and delicate, like a molten mocha cake. Mild hints of vanilla ride over the top of everything, most likely an induction of the barrel itself.
A nice, underlying blanket of roasted malts gives a solid base upon which everything else seems to stand, although the bourbon is strong enough that it may not even need a "base". Parabola has a very large aroma; its potency outright is surely something to behold, and if nothing else, it tells you that this is gonna be one hell of a beer.
Wow. One sip in, and color me impressed. Incredibly smooth, silky, and soft on the palate with just a light tingle of carbonation as the bourbon-heavy brew slips across my palate. The "first and foremost" flavor would be the monumental heaps of chocolate that assault my palate. Deep, dense, dark, bittersweet, and creamy fudge-y chocolate cascades over my senses, clashing with smaller pips of vanilla to create an almost dessert-like delicacy with each sip.
Make no mistake about it, though, the bourbon and oak are as heavy as can be. Soft, warming bourbon entrances every sip just as well, showing the huge robustness of the brew and sending a permanent warmth from the back of your tongue to your belly. Not "hot", but pretty warm, while still remaining smooth thanks to the blunting efforts of the creamy chocolate and the oatmeal.
The aftertaste also contains a bit of bourbon and lots of oak; almost enough oak to call the finish "dry", but falling just shy of this mark. The malts open up a bit more with time, adding more complex notes of burnt caramel and maybe even a touch of sweet maple syrup in the finish. The dominant chocolate and bourbon notes still reign supreme, making this beer like an "adults only" dessert that would be fit for a king.
Well, it's taken me long enough to finally try Parabola, and now that I have, I'll be sure to nab up as much as possible each year that it comes out. Being from Southeast Michigan, some might say we're spoiled with "big" stouts; BCBS, KBS, Black Note, etc... But I'd put Parabola RIGHT up with those brews, and possibly even ahead of a few. So what the hell are you complaining about West Coasters?? This stuff is amazing. 2,717 characterstectactoe, Jul 01, 2013
4.83/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Typical opaque motor oil appearance for a RIS, 1/2 finger ecru head.
Aroma is rich with notes of cocoa bean, licorice, oak & bourbon.
Taste is incredibly rich, meant for sipping and sharing. Flavors of chocolate,smoky oak & bourbon shine through, a bit of licorice and fennel seed: very complex with notes of booziness interwoven.
Mouthfeel is heavy, it really coats your palate, and sits heavy. Like drinking beef wellington in a bottle, it is rather filling and has a rich aftertaste.
Overall a huge RIS from FW that should be tried by anyone that is a fan of the style.2011 Reserve sampled. 597 charactersHendry, Jul 01, 2013

Liquid comes out a nice dark black; the bottle describes it as "midnight black," I'm not sure what that means. It's black with dark brown highlights and edges. There's a dark brown cap that erupts pretty nicely when I gave it a hard pour. The head doesn't stick around quite as long as I'd like, but there's still some very nice lacing to it. Nice coating along the edges when you sip the it, not quite the dymatap effect, but still some nice syrupy looks to it. 
Smell i s quite good, up there with many of the top of the line barrel aged imperial stouts. Huge amounts of vanilla, oak, chocolate (almost fudge but not quite), raisons, with some other light aromas of dehydrated fruits and maybe some slight booze. Kinda surprised, I expected a little tickle in the nose, but I didn't, not necessarily a bad thing though. 
Taste is as equally as excellent as the smell. Lots of big flavors, huge hints of vanilla and oak in the beginning. After that there's hints of chocolate, black licorice, raisons/dates and some other dehydrated fruits. Its really got a lot going on and incredibly well balanced even though it's extremely full of flavor. 
Mouthfeel is as perfect as one can get for the style. It's full bodied but on the lighter end if that makes sense. Really good carbonation level and silky smooth with a nice sweet finish. Not really a burn from the alcohol but a slight warmth. The drinkability is insane. I can't believe how drinkable it is, it's like a regular year round beer. I really had to take time with this beer to savor it, one I want to have more and more. 
I know it has a little bit of hype, but I still think this is an underrated beer, for something that is so well distributed, I can't believe how good it is. Firestone-Walker is really proving to be in the upper echelon of breweries by producing yet another elite beer for it's style. Really enjoyed this one. 1,985 charactersAndyAvalanche, Jun 30, 2013

A - Pours a jet completely opaque fluid. Created a minimal amount of dark tan head that faded quickly. Very nice legs observed. Minimal, if any carbonation. 
S - Beautiful dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon and vanilla and light amount of dark fruits, burnt tones and malt. I'm not picking up much hops at all. I really just want to sit an smell it. Nicely balanced and complex. 
T - More of the same. Just wonderful. Rich and complex, slight bitterness. Some bready and toasty, with caramel and vanilla highlights. 
M - Delicious velvety and smooth. Full bodied. Considering the high ABV, easy to drink and sneaks up on you very quickly. 
O - Fantastic beer. Lives up to its reputation and exceeds expectations. A must try for anyone who is a fan of the style. One of my favorite beers. 812 charactersdrrone, Jun 22, 2013

A: Poured from 22 oz into a snifter. Thin to no head. Pours with a medium bodied thickness. Dark black with very little carbonation. Perfect example of a BA RIS, so far.
S: Strong bourbon, but not as much as say bcbs. Along with the bourbon I smell caramel, vanilla, and chocolate and oak. 
T: Very smooth and sweeter than I thought it would be. The bourbon is balanced perfectly imho. Not over the top, but def. there. 
M: Just as I thought it would be. Medium bodied thickness.

4.61/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75On-tap 6/18/2013 at Track 84 in Warwick, RI, served in a US tumbler pint glass.
A: The beer is a deep black color, with a short beige head that fades slowly and leaves a very thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is very robust containing roasted malts, chocolate, dark fruit and bourbon.
T: The taste starts out with sweet flavors of chocolate, bourbon and some dark fruit. Then a very hearty roasted malt character comes in. The hops presence is very mild but complementary but brings a very good balance. The after-taste is full of dark chocolate bitter-sweetness.
M: Crisp and very smooth, heavy body, light-to-medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, deceptively strong kick, excellent representation of style, this is a very good big stout to drink for as long as you can handle it. 860 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jun 19, 2013

Aroma, chocolates, vanilla, barrel. Roast malt, a faint anise. Nicely potent. 
Taste, Big and tasty. Roast malt, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar. A myriad of chocolates. Some peaty whisky barrel. Some faint hop resin still endures along with the anise.
Coats very well, but carbonation is just a tad prickly to me. Could be a little thicker. Keeps it drinking pretty well though. A very under control warming. Certainly on par with KBS, Event Horizon and Bourbon County are still my favorites for various reasons, though this comes close.
Decided to crack this in honor of laying my first pet to rest. RIP my little friend. 770 charactersBung, Jun 16, 2013

A - Pours a little lighter than I was expecting. Mostly opaque, but a dark brown color rather than a viscousy black 
S - Good amount of bourbon in the nose, vanilla sweetness, licorice, grapes, and a hint of chocolate.
T - Great complexity here. Taste starts with bitter coffee, nice and roasted. Comes into a good amount of bourbon, provides a kick of vanilla. Works into dark fruits before finishing again with some bitter baker's chocolate and a tinge of hop.

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This review should just say "Perfect" and that's it. But since the site has to have a certain number of characters I guess I'll keep writing.
The pour is jet black and unlike others in the class the head appears strong white and fades quick rather than having a thin to almost no head like others.
The smell is a simply sweet chocolate smell. Nothing too big but I like it cause it actually hides what is about to happen.
Ok, the taste is as perfect as they come. There is nothing better in the beer world hands down. And this comes from the biggest KBS fan and Founders fan there is. The taste is the definition of balanced. The bourbon is such great balance where is blends with the chocolate taste with literally no aftertaste. Smooth as smooth gets. It's a heavy feel but perfect for the style. 
Overall, it's the perfect beer. It has everything you look for in a beer. Look, smell and taste are all superior to everything out there. The big complaint is this beer is extremely hard to get. I now have to wait another year to have this again. 1,050 characterssjones5045, Jun 14, 2013

A - Black with an ivory colored head that quickly dissipates with some intermittent lacing as you drink. Honestly a bit thin. 
S - Bourbon and alcohol. strong fig and roasted oat. 
T - Fiery charred bourbon with enough malt to stand up to it. Packs a wallop, definitely a sipper. This beer makes you want to take the time to understand it's depth and it is an old sophisticated man beer. Cranberry-Dark Chocolate musk. Nails the style of Imperial Russian, but the real energy required to properly taste it is the whiskey character.
M - wonderful stickiness. leaves a burnt dry feeling in your mouth that I love. 
O - can't get it often, nails the style, tastes like Kentucky. 745 charactersJordanPhraczek, Jun 12, 2013

A: Poured black with little to no head that didn't stick around at all but left bubbles lingering along the sides of the glass.
S: Roasted malt, dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, a hint of toasted coconut, coffee, dark fruits and the bourbon barrel goodness. I could smell this forever.
T: Amazing. The first sip made me smile and start giggling. Huge burst of sweetness, espresso bitterness and dark chocolate right at the front of the tongue. The taste more or less matches the smell. Very sweet, but balanced nicely and all the flavors blend together. Love the way the vanilla and toasted coconut come through and blend together with the chocolate and roast. The bourbon is there but it doesn't overpower. 
M: Slick. Coats the entire mouth. Perfect carbonation. Hot but not in an offensive way, just enough to give that warming sensation as it goes down. 
O: This has to be one of the best BA stouts I've had to date. The sweetness is dead on, and every component of this beer works in harmony with the others to form something amazing. I want more. 1,070 charactersjustin_nj, Jun 08, 2013

I was lucky to share a bottle of this with the owner of a bar in Jersey City, Iron Monkey, also a great pub with a huge selection. We opened the bottle and let it settle for about 5 minutes before we enjoyed. The stout just hits you with so much flavor all at once...I got hints of vanilla, maple syrup, coffee and a bit of heaven. Definitely give this beer a 5 minute cool down, I think if you drink it too cold you could miss some of the flavor. This beer definitely escalated the awesomeness of stout to the next level. I give this beer a lampshade-hat rating of 9.25. Cheers to Firestone Walker for a great beer! 636 charactersRob_pbr81, Jun 06, 2013

A: Pitch black, very small 1/8th in khaki colored head which quickly dissipates leaving a ring of bubbles, minimal lacing. 
S: Bourbon right up front. There's some vanilla, coffee, and cocoa here too, but bourbon dominates here. If you close your eyes, smell, and someone told you it was whiskey, you wouldn't immediately think they were wrong. 
T: Very strong bitter dark chocolate and dried dark fruit right up front, tastes very reminiscent of a chocolate covered dried fig or raisin, very pleasing. Also, as it warms (I let the bottle sit at room temp as I drank.) The bourbon flavor really gets more pronounced. By the end of the bottle I am tasting straight up bourbon (But without the burn!) fantastic. 
M: Nice and silky. Good carbonation rolls around the sides of your mouth. Slight tingle from the alcohol. 
O: I can see what all the hype is about. This is really an experience every beer enthusiast needs to have. FW never disappoints but they took this to a whole different level. I'm not the biggest fan of stouts, but this is one of the best beers I have ever experienced. 1,135 charactersHopinista, Jun 05, 2013

Poured from Firestone Walker's attractively labelled 22oz bottle into a tulip glass. Appearance is pitch black; absolutely no light passes through. A semi hard pour provides a beautiful cascade.
The scent at serving temperature is dominated by sweet chocolate. As it warms to room temperature the bourbon really pulls through.
The taste, to myself at least, was quite deceiving. For such a sweet nose this brew is moderately bitter up front, but what follows is simply sublime. Once the hops subside they give way to delicious roasted malt, dark fruit, and a very prominent oak finish.
Mouthfeel is creamy, chewy, and viscous. Coats the tongue enough to savor each sip for a few minutes. The 13% leaves a nice tingle in the back of your throat.
This is possibly the best beer I've had to date. Granted it's the only barrel aged stout I've ever had, but it has set the standard for me when reviewing RIS/AIS. 972 charactersTravisR, Jun 04, 2013

4.38/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Very thin head. Pours with a medium bodied thickness. Jet black with no carbonation. Everything that a BA RIS should look like. 
Smell: The bourbon character jumps out right away. Really heavy on the front, but mixing pretty well is caramel, vanilla, and some bitter dark chocolate. Some brighter hops then I expected and a sharp, spicy aroma from the strong bourbon accents. Smoked, oaked character plays around nicely on the background of the aroma. A lot of depth and accedes on many areas on BA RIS should, but no doubt the bourbon character is the strongest and boarders on overbearing. 
Taste: Slight hoppy tingle once it hits the palette. The front is a very smooth vanilla and cherry sweetness which really hooks you right away. The body has more of the traditional charred oatmeal and dark malt character one would expect. The aftertaste is potent bourbon and has a medium to above average dryness which punishes the palette. Really impressive how separate and distinct the levels of this brew are. A journey no doubt. My only gripe would be is the finish is a little more harsh compared to other aspects, but that is really nitpicking. 
Mouthfeel: The journey this beer takes you on ends in a strong bitter bourbon flavor. A little drier then one would hope. The medium bodied thickness covers the palette decently well. 
Overall: I was excited to drink this and it was certainly delicious. This bottle was the 2013 vintage and I think needs 6 to 12 months to even out a little more. No doubt one of the better beers I've had in a while and I cannot wait to pop my next one in the appropriate time frame. 1,630 charactersKFBR392, Jun 03, 2013

T- oh man, huge punch of sweet chocolate, vanilla, creamy coffee. Not sure if I am stuffed up today but the palate on this is so much Bigger than the nose alludes to. The oak comes through.
M- very nice slightly syrupy and chewy not too big on mouthfeel. Nice balance slight dry finish.

Poured into a snifter.
A: Pitch-black, syrupy, with one finger head. Nice lacing and retention around the glass.
S: Bourbon, vanilla, coffee, cacao nibs, all coming together at the same time to overwhelm my nose. Very nice.
T: Vanilla and plum at the beginning, the subtle flavor of bourbon starts to hit midway, could taste some chocolate and raisins at the end.
M: Medium to full-bodied, nice carbonation, silky and velvety mouth-feel. 
O: This was my first Parabola and I'm impressed by this bottle. I can see what the raves are all about. It reminds me of BCBS with a strong bourbon presence but it was very subtle in this bottle. I'm really looking forward to open my second bottle in a year to see if it will improves with age. 
Thanks again, Jason! 821 characterscw577enfield, May 26, 2013

S: bitter dark chocolate, minor notes of espresso, dark fruit and oak with a slight alcohol finish.
T: wow, lots dark chocolate and vanilla upfront that fades into the rich charred malt that is highlighted by the oak and hints of dark fruit. Bourbon is subtle, not over powering and very well balanced. Alcohol is there but well hidden.
M: thick in the best way possible, coats the mouth entirely and great small bubble carbonation, has the velvety feel of a nitro, really nice.
O: best beer I have had in a long time. Perfectly balanced and very complex. I can't wait to re-review the one I'm putting away for next year. 749 charactersFcolle2, May 25, 2013

4.99/5  rDev +9.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Been anticipating trying this beer for so long. Batch 004 poured into a snifter.
A: Pours a pitch, murky black. There was a small dark khaki colored head that eventual gave way to nothing.
S: Upon first smell, I get huge notes of coconut and vanilla with some wood character. Some oats and deep chocolate also fill my nostrils with glee. What a fantastic smell. Some dark fruits also come through, though muted.
T: Holy god! This is fantastic. Huge vanilla and coconut flavors start this out and chocolate comes through as well. The bourbon character is tremendous. It's not overpowering at all. Roasted coffee comes in for the finish, and what a finish it is. 
M: An incredibly smooth brew this is. Medium mouthfeel
Overall: This is a treat for me to even have this considering how long I've been waiting to try this. The chocolate and coffee flavors mesh so well with the coconut and vanilla that come from the barrel aging. The 13% is virtually non existent so far. This is a well constructed beer and I'm definitely glad I got to enjoy this. This is one of the best beers I've ever had and Firestone Walker may have the best barrel aging programs in the world and this is a clear indication of it. 1,206 charactersRichD, May 25, 2013

Very dark, "never-ending abyss"-black. Opaque as hell. Lace sticks to the glass like crazy all the way down.
Smells like cookie dough, bourbon, and chocolate.
Tastes like cocoa powder, cookie dough, toasty coconut, subtle but incredible bourbon sweetness. Very roasty bitterness plays off the sweetness provided by the barrel aging. Some oak there as well.
As full bodied as they come. Very low but still present carbonation.
One of the best. The guys at Firestone Walker are straight ballers. 563 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 23, 2013

A- pours a deep brown opaque body with a 2 finger mocha colored head that reduces to a brown ring.
S- soft yet pungent whiskey, dark fruits, french vanilla, chocolate, butterscotch, sugar cookie. 
T- Sweet vanilla and caramel, whiskey upfront. Semisweet chocolate and roasted coffee is next, dark fruits an almost grassy citrus follow through. Nice toasty, burnt malt aftertaste.
M- smooth and silky, medium heavy body.
I really enjoyed this one - lives up to the hype and really impresses. Super complex and balanced, just the right amount of bourbon and a nice roasted flavor. Awesome 655 charactersgcamparone, May 22, 2013

smells and tastes more like a bourbon than it does a beer. over-roasted coffee flavor and aroma, vanilla; yes, the fudge i get too. very sweet, very bitter.the alcohol is there, but is part of the overall taste and blends in with the flavors. the wood from the barrels is very strong. i appreciate what they've done but i dont much allow myself to be influenced by a brew which picks up a lot of its flavor from the storage vessel. there is a myriad of flavors but i feel they are over-shadowed by strong oak barrel presence.
2nd pour yields some alcohol presence. lots of oak. the malty quality of the brew seems to pick up more of the barrel residue.
it's still a 13% brew, so i suppose i ought to review it from that perspective. maybe i really wasnt looking for a sipper tonight. still a great brew. lots of effort here.... 1,014 characterspkalix, May 19, 2013

S: Very very nice aroma consisting of vanilla, chocolate, coffee and a good bit of oak.
T: Most of the aroma carriers through to the taste, just wonderful. Very rich chocolate flavors and the bourbon really enters the scene mid-palate. Leaves your with a nice sweet flavor on the tongue after.
M: Nice and creamy, full body.
O: Very well balanced and complex beer. I would love to give this some time to sit and see how well it ages. 481 charactersklythjohan, May 19, 2013

Smell: So much going on here! I get whiffs of chocolate at first, followed by roasted barley and sweet malts. Definitely smell hints of bourbon at the end and maybe even some slight fruity undertones. 
Taste: Absolutely lovely, chocolate and roasted barley with a definite alcohol hint coming at you as you sip. You can get some other sweetness in there as well, I can pick out some vanilla and molasses. The alcohol is definitely present, but this is still a great sipper.
Mouthfeel: Very strong bodied without a ton of carbonation. Very smooth at 13% which is masked well but can be tasted for sure.
Overall: This is one of the best beers I have ever had and I would love to have it again and again. The best Imperial Stout that I have tried, as I would place it slightly above Stone and BCBS which were two of my favorites. This is one of the most perfect beers I have tried, and worth seeking out. 1,066 charactersMikecap, May 18, 2013

A: Beautiful, thin black color. I poured it with minimal head, but about a half inch of thin head lingers throughout the entire enjoyment of this beer. Leaves a wall of bubbles
S: Sweet, dark chocolate; bourbon is also strong; coffee, vanilla and subtle cherry.
T: The bourbon is so strong in the taste, but not too strong if that makes any sense. Like, it's definitely there, but not over powering. The chocolate is also strong and sweet, dancing with the bourbon to make this a ridiculously tasty stout. A very rich beer. I get the vanilla and coffee lingering in the aftertaste as well.
M: Incredibly smooth, like liquid silk. It also lingers beautifully, leaving the entire mouth coated with all it's different flavors. 
Overall: Seriously, this is one of the best effing beers I have ever had and may just be the best RIS I've ever enjoyed. I paid $15 for this and would easily drop $20 it's so freakin' good. Sipped it slow and made it last like a fine bourbon. 1,034 charactersRoose13, May 18, 2013

TOOL
"Parabola"
We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment, We are choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside This holy reality, this holy experience. Choosing to be here in
This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that I am not alone in This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal All this pain is an illusion.
Alive, I
In this holy reality, in this holy experience. Choosing to be here in
This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that I am not alone in This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal All this pain is an illusion.
Twirling round with this familiar parable. Spinning, weaving round each new experience. Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and breathing.
This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality. Embrace this moment. Remember. we are eternal. all this pain is an illusion. 1,179 charactersStoutish, May 17, 2013

Appearance: Pours black with 2 fingers of a tan, mocha colored head. Body is opaque.
Smell: Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, butterscotch, sweet toffee, and fudge. 
Taste: Roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla, roasted coffee, and wood. Lots of sweet malts upfront are balanced in the finish with a roasty bitterness and some booze.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Medium carbonation. Medium/high alcohol warmth.
Overall: Yet another example of why Firestone Walker has one of the best, if not THE best, barrel programs in the world. This is drinking a little hot right now, but it's still a fairly fresh bottle. Definitely worth picking up a bottle for now and another to age. 735 charactersJonada, May 17, 2013

4.41/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Pours a deep, dark, near black cordovan brown with a cocoa colored finger width head. Fair retention, resulting in a broken layer of microbubbles across the surface. 
Smell - The bourbon aroma is there but subdued, mayhap even overshadowed by a deep fudge-like chocolate aroma. Light oak. Touches of coffee and vanilla.
Taste - Big, bold character in bourbon upfront and throughout, though strong layers of chocolate and roasted malt help to keep the heat in check. Prominent notes of vanilla and oak. Touches of tobacco and deep, dirty fudge on the finish.
Mouthfeel - Medium to full body with low carbonation. Considering all the factors, it shouldn't be this smooth and velvety, but it is, before it quickly thins out and dries in the finish.
Overall - I don't know if it's the mood I'm in, or if that strong stout factor has tipped the scales, but I like this considerably more than the Sucaba. While there's plenty of boozy character, it's not nearly that of Sucaba, or perhaps there's enough bold stout flavor to counteract the barrel-aged influence. Either way, this is pretty good. I've purchased a 2nd bottle for aging. If it's phenomenal 18-24 months from now, you better believe I'll be on here giving it praise!
Update 02/28/16: 2nd bottle cracked. Delicious. Most of the heat has been smoothed out. Notes of chocolate, coffee, nuttiness, oak and some coconut. Roasty finish. Smooth as hell. Well worth the wait. 1,442 charactersTheSixthRing, May 16, 2013

Poured into a Tulip glass from a bottle, 2013 Vintage, on 5/14/2013.
A quick note: I had this bottle over two ‘rounds’. The first round was fresh out of the fridge after having spent a little over half a day chilling. The second ‘round’ was a few hours after that, after the bottle had come to room temperature. Each round accounted for roughly half the bottle.
Round 1, chilled.
Pour: Pitch-black, with a head that’s very thin, tan, almost non-existent. Faded quick to a thin ring, no lacing. Pour speed was a ‘glug-glug’ rhythm; thick, but not exactly absurdly viscous. Really thick, though. Beer is pitch-black in a tulip glass, as well.
Aroma: First smell that hits is sweet fruits, like plum or raisin. A more intense sweet, like a caramel or toffee, isn’t far behind. The two blend together after a little bit to create a sort of caramel-dipped plum/raisin effect. Also some faint coconut notes on the edges of the smell.
Taste/Mouth-feel: Thick, thick, and rich. Also thick. Immediate rush of the fruit from the nose, drenched in sweetness. But the sweetness is balanced out by the sharpness from the bourbon barrels, so it’s never cloying. Beautifully blended. Just a faint hint of booziness on the finish, but unbelievably smooth. No noticeable heat from the alcohol, which is mind-blowing for a 13% beer. Coats the mouth completely, but in a pleasant way. Never feels overwhelming. Whiskey and bourbon notes start to become more noticeable once the beer sinks into your taste-buds for the long haul. Overall the taste is just pleasant and mellow, with a chewy mouth-feel in the best of ways. The lack of heat persists throughout multiple sips, constant smoothness. Roasted, bourbon-y, toffee and plum flavors dominate consistently, but no one flavor ever hogs the spotlight for too long. Masterfully blended. Slight, slight faint hints of sweet almond begin to creep through on the edges of the taste as the beer begins to warm. Preposterously smooth for 13%. Puts KBS fresh to shame on that front.
Round 2, room temperature.
Pour: Second pour yielded a finger to a finger-and-a-half of nice tan head, which was a surprising change from the chilled pour. Not unexpected, though. 
Aroma: Nose of plum/raisin/caramel hangs around even with the warming. 
Taste: The tingle of booze on the end of sips is slightly more pronounced after the warmth, but it’s still completely unobtrusive overall. I know I sound like a broken record at this point, but how this is 13% and Palo Santo from DFH is 12%, I’ll never know. FSW are blending wizards. Slight hint of butterscotch on the end following on the coattails of vanilla in the finish, which are both far more pronounced after warming than they were chilled. As for mouth-feel, the warmth doesn’t mess with the consistency at all. Still incredibly, lusciously thick and dense.
Final grade: 5/5. Parabola is incredible, and has permanently raised the bar by which I judge all other beers that set foot in the Stout category. 3,026 charactersJazzpha, May 15, 2013
4.69/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Pours black with dark mahogany hues and a light sienna head that quickly develops into a lasting ring. Generous but not clinging lacing. Bourbon, campfire, oak, dark cherry, vanilla, chocolate, toffee, alcohol, and the slightest whisper of maple present in the nose. Smell translates to taste perfectly. This is a big, thick, and heavy albeit silky smooth beer. A 13% monster that lives up to the hype. This one checks all the boxes. 433 charactersGetTheYayo, May 15, 2013

2012 aged very nicely, had more body and flavor complexities. Caramel, roast, bourbon Would love to taste how 2013 ages as it was a little lacking, but the the potential is totally there. A solid stout, either year. Thanks, Firestone. 271 characters4amepiphany, May 14, 2013

Pours black, light brown head fades quickly into a ring. Small amount of fine, slow carbonation. Opaque. Smell is smoke, bourbon, alcohol, vanilla, coffee, chocolate.
Taste is vanilla and chocolate, then smoke and bourbon and alcohol. Some cherries and leather, and a hint of maple.
Mouthfeel is silky. Slightly sticky. Overall, this is quite a nice beer.

Excellently crafted beer. The smell is purely bourbon but not overly powerful. Parabola is a top notch imperial stout reminding me of black note. This beer drinks easy and the high alcohol content is masked beautifully. Only gripe is the strong oak aftertaste but I can overlook that. 
Try this beer! Cheers! 356 charactersJFresh21, May 11, 2013

A - poured a deep black with a tinge of amber. Light lacing to what very little head it poured. 
S - immediately got the bourbon, but not overpowering. Also hints of baker's chocolate, vanilla, coffee, and some black licorice. Anticipation was at it's peak!
T - Again, not as heavy on the whisky as I was expecting, (to my liking). Great complexity! Choc, oaky wood, malty, coffee, a spice or two (i kept saying cinnamon), a little booze, licorice. 
M - Just WOW was the first word after my initial taste. So well balanced. Had a buttery velvet-like finish. 
O - This was well worth the wait! I liked that it was not as heavy on the "bourbon barrel" taste as others in this style. Overall, one of the best beers I've tasted. EVER! 768 charactersJamesStreet, May 09, 2013

A: Pours a jet black, with a thin head that dissipates almost immediately. Holding up to the light, a faint ruby light emanates from the beer. 
S: Chocolate, coffee, dark sticky fruit and quite a bit of booze.
T: Like a chocolate covered coffee candy. The booze present in the nose is not present in the taste.
M: A wonderful thick body, just thin enough to make it easily drinkable.
O: An amazing vintage, a perfect marriage of flavors and barrel aging. Ignore the comments on that it's too hot, it's perfect. 542 characterssirtomtom, May 07, 2013
3.83/5  rDev -15.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.75I had it with a bottle share with the Art and Craft Brews club. I knew what to expect from a bourbon barrel aged oatmeal stout. I was a bit disappointed at how unfriendly this beer drank. Everyone I spoke to about it says that it gets better with time. Shouldn't it be outstanding now and extraordinary later?
It poured dark like oil with very minimal head and very sexually. I wish these guys could figure out a natural additive that would make the head hang out a bit longer in these high ABV barrel aged stouts. The aromas were intense which is always a good thing but along with the rich bourbon, chocolate, slight vanilla, smoked caramel, berry medley and oak was the very apparent scent of alcohol. A renowned beer is great because the alcohol is invisible and you can really get into it. This one it is dead center and you enter with a state of mind that speaks moderation which is not good. The flavor was an alcoholic punch to the mouth that left a very nutty aftertaste that coated my mouth for a long time afterwards which was very good. Awesome in fact. I wish the dynamic of flavor profiles was a smooth transition. All the greatness is there but it should be a bit friendlier. The chocolate, vanilla, roasty, dark fruit notes are very distinguishable and enjoyable once you jump the alcohol hurdle. 1,312 characterstastyville, May 07, 2013

Appearance: Pours a deep black with just a hint of brown on the edges when the glass is tilted.
Smell: Everything good about a barrel aged stout is present. Chocolate, vanilla, whiskey, some dark fruits. Excellent balance of aromas.
Taste: The taste follows the smell. It is a bit hot at the moment but I believe that will go away with time. Vanilla, chocolate, and a little smoky. I don't really pick up any of the roasted malt notes, except maybe on a little on the finish.
Mouthfeel: Excellent mouthfeel, this is one area where this barrel aged stout shines! Many I have had lately are undercarbonated and become unpleasant after a while. This beer however has a superb mouthfeel with great, fine carbonation.
Overall: This is drinking excellent for how young it is. I believe that with 6 months to a year the alcohol will be smoothed out and it will be the best vintage of Parabola yet. Excellent release! 980 charactersrboinski, May 07, 2013

22 oz. bottle poured into DFH Signature glass. 2012 Vintage. Sent to me in a trade a while back, but can't recall who sent it. Thanks to whoever it was. 
A - Pours midnight black with a finger of slow receding foam. The beige head leaves behind a pretty, tiered lacing. 
S - Smells of baker's chocolate, cocoa, and ripe plum. Considerable oak, and just a touch of whiskey. Roasty, sweet, and bitter. Great aroma.
T - Vanilla and charred wood on the start. Milk chocolate and oats follow midpalate. The barrel is big on the finish with drying oak and a nice whiskey twang. Sweetness of chocolate, vanilla, and fleshy fruit accompanies the other flavors throughout. Tremendous balance and complexity. 
M - While everything about this beer is impressive, the mouthfeel may be the best facet. Thick body with micro-carbonation that offers a silky smooth slickness.
O - I have been stowing away two of these for about a year now, but this is my first time trying it. I am glad I waited because this is drinking nearly perfectly with one year on it (although no basis for comparison). Very complex flavor full of chocolate, roast, whiskey, and oak. Impressively drinkable for a 12.5% monster. I will definitely seek out this year's batch and look forward to seeing how this one tastes fresh as well as with a few (or more) years on it. This is what barrel aged stouts should taste like. 1,401 charactersNoLeafClover44, May 05, 2013

A - Pours a pitch black, charcoal color, with a lingering 1-finger head that hangs around 
For quite a bit. Carbonation is impossible to judge just by looking at this beer...
I haz an excite!
S - whiskey barrel, vanilla, Muntons chocolate malt, and nips of licorice and cacao nibs.
Alcohol is subtle, and warms the sinuses so nicely, that you wouldn't mind just SMELLING this %13 monster. WOW. I need a 5-gallon whiskey barrel for my home brewing projects, stat!!!
T - vanilla jumps forward, followed by more chocolate, black malt, and light boozy notes. Once again, this beer hides its' ABV well, showing no "heat", just warmth, reminiscent of single malt scotch. There are some light, underlying mineral notes in the background, as well as a smooth smokiness that is in no way offensive, or cloying.
I could go on forever about the depth of this beer....
M - PURE VELVET. So silky, the fact that there IS carbonation never crosses your mind!
If all beer was this strong, AND this easy to drink , and enjoy, there would be no war.
(Seriously. We'd all be too hammered to care.) Parabola possesses the palate, and lingers just long enough to remind you that the crappy beer your friends drink should never be good enough for you.
O - All I can say is "wow". This beer is so perfect, I really can't find anything negative to say about it. I will age a few, in drooling anticipation of greater things to come.
Do whatever you have to to snag one... It's worth it! Cheers!!! 1,562 charactersStuporJew, May 01, 2013

A - Pours very dark brown, almost totally black, with a small khaki head.
S - Lots of oak right away, with a little bourbon and some chocolate
T - Lots of oaky barrel flavors up front, followed by a smooth chocolate flavor and a hot alcohol finish.
M - Full bodied, but somewhat thinner than I expected out of a huge oatmeal stout.
O - This was my first Parabola and I had been waiting about a year to drink it, so I had some high expectations, but I was kind of let down. I was hoping for more bourbon and a thicker, sweeter body, but it was actually kind of dry with a lot of alcohol burn and not a ton of bourbon flavor. Maybe I would like it better fresh? Most people rave about this beer, so I would definitely give it a try - but I'd rather have a regular BCS which I can easily obtain every year and I have to hunt this out. 939 characterscnbrown313, Apr 30, 2013

A: Obsidian black, it pours with barely a wisp of head in my snifter. Light carbonation on top and zero lacing. 
S: With more coconut and cream on the forward end than I remember a year ago, the brew doesn't have nearly the bourbon character as before until it warms up some. After nearly an hour, the bourbon comes back with trumpets. 
T: On first sip, the alcohol is more pronounced than before; it blends in nicely with roasted malt character, oak, sweet cream, and some whiskey notes. Then, rich, medicinal--yet sweet--bourbon notes come to the fore. As my wife said, "Licorice all the way."
M: Although it isn't as thick as some imperial stouts, it has a clean, even slightly dry, finish with chocolate flair falling behind. Rich malt gives a satisfyingly chalky finish. 
O: There's a reason this is my favorite beer of all time. Just about nothing comes close. Perfection, thy name is Parabola. 940 charactersRanz, Apr 21, 2013

A:dark as night black that pours thick like motor oil. It is completely opaque with no head what so ever and thin tan lacing around the top of the glass. 
S:the bourbon flavor is strong and very present up front there are even some hints of alcohol but they are not powerful. There are hints of vanilla and fruit but bourbon is definitely the dominant smell though not overpowering. 
T: similar to the nose there is a heavy bourbon flavor upfront there is plenty of chocolate and vanilla flavors. Those are the dominant flavor but they are impressively not overpowering. 
M:the feel is smooth, it is not thick in terms of it being heavy but it is very syrupy like bourbon chocolate syrup. There is basically no carbonation but that is as to be desired from a BA stout.
O: this is a really solid BA bourbon stout not really mind blowing up just as good as the big players would like to see it age. It is smooth with a great mouthfeel and solid taste without being overpowering. The look is good but the smell is meh. Worth a try for sure as I highly reccomend this 1,095 charactersPinknuggets, Apr 16, 2013

I would just say, this year's vintage is hands down so much better than last years. Last year's had too much coconuts, but this year's had the perfect amount. I really don't know what else to say as this is hands down the best RIS I have ever had. Not sure if huna, KBS, dark lord is going to be better.
Appearance: Hella dark but nice. Hella alcohol lacing. Hella everything(good thing) Nice head too.
Smell: This is the best part of the beer. Hella chocolate. Perfect amounts of coconut. Hella good bourbon smell. Hella great smelling beer
Taste: Heaven. All I can say
Moutfeel: Syrupy, but not too much. Had good amount of carbonation but not too much.
Overall: Holy crap this beer was effing delicious..
tl;dr - Hella good.
I had a sample snifter of this during a tour. 797 charactersRainier, Apr 14, 2013

A - viscous but liquidy pour with a subtle tan head that leaves quickly; the carbonation is active and the lacing non existent
S - bourbon, toffee, dark chocolate, cherries, mocha, booze...this beer also captures some sweet oak/wood 
T - caramel and chocolate; fudge; roasted oats; tobacco; dark cherry pipe smoke; boozy; wood; a hint of toffee
M - surprisingly, this beer isn't sweetly cloying; it's smooth, nuanced, balanced, a little under carbonated; tasty up front with a little burn going down
O - just an awesome barrel aged imperial stout; the chocolate cherry oak sweetness is a bit smoky and a lot tasty and packs a punch without any palate destroying astringency; knock out beer 705 charactersSkeeterBoganski, Apr 04, 2013

A: Black as the heart of the devil with a sparse mocha foam for a head. Good legs, and this has a solid inky outlook. 
N: Lots of licorice, chocolate, tobacco, and dark chocolate candies. Fudge and there's noticeable oak. Vanilla and caramel act as a backdrop. There's a touch of raisin and prune as well as coffee. 
T: Roasted coffee, fudge, dark chocolate, coffee, lots of smoke and tobacco over the top of the sweet base. However, it adds bitterness rather than ashtray. I enjoy how it has two distinguishable tiers. There's a light licorice flavor, and the oak also adds a lot of chippiness to the proceedings. Leans towards astringency by the end.
M: Oily and slick. Very full texture. Alcohol is expertly hidden.
O: This vintage is doing very well, though there's definitely a lot of oak so be prepared for the grain. However, for being such a behemoth, it never loses its presence by hiding behind a cloying underattentuation. Props to this one. I'll have another. 1,009 charactersSarlacc83, Mar 23, 2013

A- Dark as night with a very thin mocha head, tiny bubbles on the head.
S- Strong vanilla, oak, toffee, chocolate and alcohol. Not much coffee, maybe a hint. 
T- Big vanilla, bourbon, toffee chocolate and surprisingly a lot of coffee-like bitterness. Bitter, dry finish.
M- Thick, oily mouthfeel. Very heavy bodied.
O- Right up there with all of the best BBA Stouts. Really nice flavors and light enough in ABV to finish a bomber. Seek this out and buy a few if you can. Also interested to see how this holds up with a year of age on it. 637 characterscquinn17, Mar 20, 2013

Pours black with small brown head...leaves a tiny bit of lace with time.
Aroma of dark roasted malts, vanilla, sweet malts.
Modest carbonation and powerful mouthfeel.
Flavors of burnt roasted malts, dark and bitter chocolate...there's a mouth puckering bitterness...let me give it 5 minutes...
OK...with a few minutes the head is nearly gone, aroma is big of barrel bourbon, dark malts...flavors are big with bourbon barrel, raisins, dark chocolate, bitter hops (82 IBU), vanilla. This is a big boy with complexity and strength...might have been wise to age it another 6 - 12 months, possibly more, but I couldn't resist. I've had this on many occasions over the years, probably most often on draft in Southern California. Damn fine and tasty treat. 805 charactersDenverLogan, Mar 15, 2013

4.63/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75From a 650 ml bottle (2012 batch, March 14, 2012 printed on the bottle) into a snifter.
A-The brew is nearly black with only a small glimmer of brown letting light through at the edges of the glass. The dark brown head drops from about a finger to a patchy cap of foam almost immediately, which is not surprising given the ABV. Some ultra-fine carbonation is visible against the glass.
S-This is a great smelling stout (if you like bourbon). I smell a lot of oak, vanilla, and boozy heat., with a touch of caramel in there, too. But the smell is also full of dark, sweet fruit (mostly raisins), herbal black licorice, and lightly bitter malts that give off a baker's chocolate smell. It is very complex and intense, but also quite balanced for being a big booze bomb.
T-The taste mostly follows the smell. This is a high-octane blend of vanilla and oaky bourbon flavors mixing with licorice, booze-soaked dark fruit, and dark chocolate malts. There is a little touch of oats in there that really seems to balance out the heat and character of the bourbon flavors.
M-The feel is medium to light for the style. I think the high ABV actually comes through here and gives it a somewhat thin feeling on the palate. The finish is warm to hot.
O-This beer mostly lived up to its reputation. I sipped it slowly over the course of the evening and enjoyed every drop. The complexity of flavors and mixture between the oaky bourbon and the more traditional RIS flavors like chocolatey malts are really fantastic. This is not a beer for the timid with its 12.5% ABV and prominent booze feel and taste, but for those who like that sort of thing, drink up. 1,647 charactersspoony, Mar 10, 2013

4.89/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.752012 bottle, batch #003 into a snifter. Bottled on 3/13/12
Pours pitch black with no transparency on any side of the glass. A finger of dark mocha tinged foam sports some good retention as well as lacing. No real carbonation present, though I can see a few bubbles amassing on the side. Near perfect look, really want to give it a 5 but need to see some better retention. 
Was able to smell the beer as soon as I cracked the cap, solid sign that good things are coming my way. Lots going on here- coffee, hops, chocolate, oak, toffee, vanilla, butterscotch, whiskey, alcohol, and a sweet malt. One of the more complex smelling beers I've had in a while 
Taste is spot on with the nose- coffee, toffee, bourbon, chocolate, cherry, vanilla, oak, oatmeal, and a touch of alcohol. Flavor is just as complex as the aroma. Quite a lot going on, everything comes together flawlessly 
Feel is consistent also, bitter, sticky, and dry. Most all the alcohol is concealed (still a touch of heat), yet this stuff still quite rich has to be sipped to be enjoyed. 
Overall this is one of the best beers I've had in quite a while. FW really hits this one out of the park, much of the hype surrounding this beer is justified by how many dimensions it has. Well worth $15 a bottle, I can't wait to age some of these 1,303 characterslordofstarside, Mar 09, 2013

Smells solventy, belying a strong, sweet malt base, with touches of roast underneath that. Peanut, marzipan and a touch of cranberry. Intriguing.
Taste is dark fruit; sweeter & complex with raisins, lots of vanilla and oak, currants, figs and dates with dry spicing - nutmeg, cumin and pepper as well as liquorice. Dark, roasty but with a lot of complex sugars, glaze and spice esters. Very, very nice indeed.
Thick and boozey on the mouthfeel, as you'd expect. Yeah, it definitely feels like 12.5%.
Lots to explore here; I really like that in a beer. When I started out on this particular journey of discovery, I felt disappointed and a bit nonplussed. I wish they'd given me more of a precursor on the look or the smell, because the anticipation and excitement is half of the fun. This doesn't look or smell nearly as good as it is. 964 characterslaituegonflable, Mar 07, 2013

A - 4.0 - Pours root beer brown. Black in the glass except at the edges. Finger of surprisingly fizzy tan head that dissipates in 30 seconds. Come back, head. Come back. Be creamy and enduring, why don't you.
S - 4.0 - Bready chocolate pastry. Somewhat worryingly, something approaching a hint of metal but not quite getting there. As it warms, more alcohol comes forward, in a good way.
T - 4.25 - Malty chocolate of moderate sweetness. Notes of chocolate covered cherry and that liquor/syrup you get in those. More complex than some, less complex than expected/desired. Round, not sharp, and seemingly a bit weak in terms of flavor intensity. Somewhat dry finish with a fairly sweet, slightly bitter chocolate syrup aftertaste. Very pleasantly warm booze fumes wafting up the throat after swallowing.
M - 4.25 - Not as thick as expected. Pleasantly heavy and creamy yet not somehow not dense, I suppose thanks to the carbonation. Manages to be velvety without being necessarily viscous. A little sticky after a while.
O - 4.25 - Very good, if overhyped. Whatever this overall flavor is, it's really very nice. There's more than one thing happening, but not much more. That's good but more would be better. A bit thicker, a bit richer, maybe some more black malt char to stiffen it. A bit of coffee or something else. Never had it fresh so not sure how it compares. I really like the alcohol level. Nice and warm. It's almost liqueur-like in sweetness and strength. I would definitely buy it again if I had local access but would not trade for it again. At the end of the bottle I'll say this is a beer that made me work and made me think and improved over the course of the bottle, which is saying something. 1,824 charactersBrownNut, Feb 26, 2013

Aroma of black chocolate with some light vanilla notes and some light dry roasted malt. Taste is dominated by loads of black chocolate notes with some light dry roasted malt and some vanilla and light bourbon notes. Taste is definitely quite complex and not as dry as expected with quite a bit of residual sugar coming through. Body is full with a really nice creamy texture and some good carbonation with no apparent alcohol. I can’t find many fault in this beer except that that bourbon could bit a bit more pronounced. 641 charactersPhyl21ca, Feb 21, 2013

A- pitch black in color with a tan head that quickly disappears. 
S- it smells of oak, coffee, chocolate, hints of vanilla, and bourbon. Definitely not as strong of a bourbon smell as some of the other big stouts.
T- strong flavor, mild bourbon aftertaste. Very good beer and very drinkable for a big stout. 
M- lightly carbonated, and smooth. Very smooth. Firestone Walker did an incredible job with this one. 
O- overall it's just an incredible beer. I wish it were easier to locate on the east coast but it definitely makes the few times I have it much more memorable. 616 charactersRumHam, Feb 19, 2013

The aroma is oaky and sweet. Vanilla, oak, dark fruit (cherry), chocolate, and alcohol.
Each sip of this full bodied brew is smooth and slightly oily with mild carbonation. The flavor is rich, malty and sweet. It begins with oak, bourbon, and vanilla. In the middle notes of dark fruit (cherry, raisin) blend with chocolate and a touch of roast malt. It finishes with an earthy nuttiness, alcohol and some grassy bitterness. Once gone the oak, chocolate and dark fruit lingers on the palate.
This beer was cellar aged for a year and it's still great. It could go another year to smooth out some of the alcohol. Lots of flavor that comes out as it warms. My only negative is the flat appearance, but that's not a priority for me. 872 charactersWanderingFool, Feb 09, 2013

Appearance: Black with a feint hint of deep brown around the rim. Poured half a finger of a beautiful mocha brown head. Big bubbles. Big sticky alcohol legs. Thick lacing. Shows deep glints of red as it gets lower in the glass. 
Smell: Dark fruit, maybe cherry, rich bourbon, sweet malt, brown sugar, no booze at all, vanilla sweetness, rich sweet dark chocolate. 
Taste: Tip of the tongue is bourbon, oak and vanilla. Middle of the mouth is espresso mocha cream. After taste is roasted malts and sweetness. As it warms up the rich vanilla becomes more prominent, balanced against the roast and oak, all against the consistent backdrop of bourbon. Bourbon is followed by a tannic quality (that must come from the oak or wine) that squeezes the taste buds and moves the sweetness along. As it nears room temperature it picks up a sweet red wine or vinous character mixed with bourbon. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied. Sticks to the palate even after it's gone without ever being cloying. 
Overall: I could've used more complexity on the nose. However, this beer displays a layered complexity that allows you to appreciate all of its various qualities without them becoming muddled. Super smooth and delicious, this is a must try world class stout. 1,278 charactersBrandywine, Feb 03, 2013

A: Dark hersey chocolate pour is a pitch black in the vessel accompanied by golden micro-beads of carbonation slowly rising to build up the creamy, dark khaki head that sits stubbonly about with no where to go. Decent lace coverage. 
S: Nice wiff of whiskey upon first uncapping gives you a good indication for what follows on the nose. Whiskey laced smooth chocolate malts appear with a slight smoky and charred nature of woodiness. Burnt licorice and burbon soaked dark fruit are always welcomed with roasted barley and a scorched toffee sweetness that balances just right. 
T: The flavor is even more endearing. Whiskey heavy with bitter dark chocolate and licorice first pops out. Flashes of sweet scorched toffee offers balance and sweetness with a soothing campfire minerality of burnt grains and currant. Burbon touch of dark fruitiness comes about while the alcohol still is shy, feeling much lower then its advertised 12.5%abv which is just fine with me, it just shows how well and clean as smooth this beer really is on the next level. Smooth earthy and silty bitterness follows the swallow along with some freshly brewed french roast. 
M: Luscious mouthful, silky thick and creamy from the oats with a warming of whisky and vanilla coffee bean ease. Amazing bite of earthy dark bitterness covers the tongue.
O: Overall this beer is certainly on a level above most others and a 1% by style. For such a dark and high abv beer this comes off amazingly smooth, refined, balanced and is so deliciously inviting i feel i can continue much longer then the bomber should allow me to. Was literally awestruck from the first sip to the last, kept my attention and excitment thoughout with vocal explanations thrown around as to its heavenly nature. I dont hand out 5's to often but really couldnt find much else i would rather see here that could make this any more enjoyable except for another bottle in hand. Highly recommended. 1,982 charactersbeerthulhu, Jan 31, 2013

A- Pours a dense black color with a 1/2 inch dark tan head that retains a bit before falling down to a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a half sheet of surface foam. Jagged ring of semi-resilient lacing.
S- Heavy molasses and brown sugar aroma with heavily roasted malt. Some oak and a nice kick of alcohol. Also notes of dark chocolate, caramel and vanilla.
T- Strong but smooth rush of dark roasted malt with chocolate, vanilla, oak, smoke and molasses all firing off at once in a firm but harmonious cavalcade of flavor. Alcohol is definitely pleasant but fits in with all the other pieces of this complex puzzle. Dangerously drinkable. The oak from barrel-aging comes through more and more as it warms.
M- Chewy, creamy and sticky with medium-low carbonation and a good amount of sharpness from the booze. Thick, full body.
O- Hallelujah. This deceivingly potent concoction just muscled its way into my top 5 RIS's of all time. A must-try. 1,021 charactersImmortale25, Jan 27, 2013

A - Dark, almost black, brown with a tan colored head that poured one finger tall. Settles down to a light layer of almost bog like foam sitting on top.
S - Nice, complex stout nose with chocolate, roasted malts, sweet caramel, slight bitter coffee, and oak. The chocolate and caramel are the dominant parts of the nose while the other bits are more subtle. It has good strong flavors that make themselves known while still allowing everything to blend together well.
T - Sweet vanilla, caramel and chocolate up front. As the beer goes on, there is chocolate, dark prunes, and light espresso. Finish is slight warming bourbon and oak which linger on in the finish.
MF - Silky, smooth beer with light carbonation. Light alcoholic kick and oak in the finish but otherwise a superb mouthfeel 
O - This beer shows why Firestone Walker is known as a great blender and barrel ager. It has great flavors, is silky smooth and no rough edges. I was really impressed by this one and surprised how much it stood out from some of the other RIS's I've had lately. 1,086 charactersjeonseh, Jan 26, 2013

Appearance: Black as the ace of spades with a small, tan had that eventually fades to the perimeter only.
Smell: Oak barrel, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, coffee, caramel. F'in delicious smelling, very similar to BCBS.
Taste: Immense barrel character, wow. A great blend of bourbon, dark chocolate and coffee give way to a spicy, tobacco like ending, with lingering dark chocolate bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Thicker than WWS, but not quite in the viscous territory of BCBS. 
Overall: Definitely glad I was able to try this. Not a bad brew by any means, but I'm just not thrilled about the spicy notes of this(similar to what I thought about that element in Sucaba)although it does lend to the complexity. This is also a little boozy on the back end of the drink. Aside from that, Firestone Walker makes a lot of good beer and I will continue to imbibe, I just personally like their IPAs better. 907 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Jan 26, 2013

Thick an viscous mouthfeel opens up to Very mellow bourbon tones, lots of vanilla, and a burst of chocolate on the finish. Mild carbonation that is right on for this. Incredibly mellow, and I am curioud is that is the age or the uncanny craft of FW. Prickle of alcohol burn on the tongue, and a nice bit of warmth on the way down.

Aged 12 months in a "combination of barrels" and additionally personally cellared several months by me. Served at cellar temperature (mid to high 50°s, F). Beer pours opaque black with nearly zero head. Intense aroma of brandy, apricot, and prunes.
The first sip is both sharp / finely carbonated and rich with big, dark fruit flavors and alcohol warmth. The middle of the beer is deceptively light on the tongue. The beer concludes with a gentle bitter edge, though I'd never have guessed anywhere close to the DIPA-worthy 82 IBUs the label claims. A little bit of treacle / bitter molasses in the end. For an imperial stout this beer is just super mellow; the barrel aging and oak flavors do it really well. Oh, except for the heavy alcohol of course. For a stout there really aren't a lot of roasty, nutty, chocolate or coffee flavors, either. But there are layers of bourbon, fruit and brandy 990 charactershreb, Jan 22, 2013

2012 vintage. Poured into a goblet. Dark chestnut, about a half inch of tan head that recedes into a thin ring. 
Smells terrific. Nice rich caramel, sugar, vanilla, a touch of bourbon, light coffee and chocolate. Very nice. 
This is one tasty brew. Sweet caramalized sugar, coffee, peat, bourbon, oak, bitter finish. Reminds me a great deal of some of the big high ABV bombs out there, but with a more reasonable ABV. This is great stuff. Thicker bodied, carbonation provides a light bite.
As far as I'm concerned, Firestone Walker can't miss. This is a terrific brew. Despite being nearly 13%, this is surprisingly drinkable. 686 charactersJohnnyBarman, Jan 21, 2013

Yeah, it's a big American double stout and it looks the part, black as night with a big-bubbled tan froth that builds fast before falling to a thin cap under the heft of the 12.5% ethyl alcohol. Again, it's a powerful American stout and we all know what the best taste like (and this is one of the best) - rich espresso, raw cocoa, burnt sugars, toffee, and a punch of herbal hoppiness all layered with a smooth bourbon whiskey flavor on top of an oak foundation. Smoooth. The barrel aging has rounded out the rough spots and left the alcohol nigh undetectable. Firestone Walker brews excellent beer and this is no exception. 639 charactersbump8628, Jan 20, 2013

A: Pours an opaque jet black in color with some very dark amber highlights and a very light amount of visible carbonation. The beer has a quarter finger tall dark tan to mocha head that quickly reduces to a small patch of very thin film and a very thin ring at the edges of the glass. Light amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Strong aromas of bourbon, oak, and vanilla along with some light to moderate notes of chocolate. There are some very light hints of alcohol in the aroma as well.
T: Upfront there is a strong flavor of chocolate, caramel, and coffee - the chocolate is more of a dark chocolate, a bittersweet chocolate. There is a moderate to strong flavor of bourbon, vanilla, and oak with just a hint of coconut towards the finish. There are light notes of roasted malts and vinous notes. Light to moderate amounts of bitterness in the finish.
M: Just shy of full bodied with light to moderate amounts of carbonation. Velvety smooth with a light amount of alcohol heat in the finish.
O: This beer is very enjoyable with a great amount of complexity to both the taste and the smell - this makes it a great sipping beer that is best slowly enjoyed... The beer smells much stronger than it tastes but the alcohol is not overly present in the flavor. The beer continues to smooth out as it warms and the complexity increases. 1,349 charactersdbrauneis, Jan 12, 2013

A: Pours a beautiful black with a brown head that fades to a ring
S: Nose is complex and full of vanilla with notes of earthy chocolate, roasted malt, caramel, coconut and oak. It begs the tongue to taste.
T: Chocolate, coconut and caramel up front, followed by big bourbon character, vanilla, caramel, oak and alcohol in the middle and finish. Aftertaste is delicious chocolate, bourbon and roasted malt. Just a touch short of perfection. Too much alcohol.
M: Full bodied, I'm sure, but I've forgotten the other details. I was too lost in the gloriousness of the beer.
O: Taste is what matters most. I'd say 99 out of 100, just a bit too much alcohol. I'll try it again and make a better review when 2013 comes out. 757 charactersBierJager89, Jan 11, 2013

S: Lots of dark roasted malt, bourbon, booze, chocolate, coffee
T: Out of this world. This bottle had 6 months age on it and there was a perfect blending of boozy heat mellowing nicely with the roasted malt. Lots of chocolate, toffee, coffee, oak, a bit of charred wood.
M: full body, sticky, easily coats the whole mouth with a sweet booziness.
O: One of the best beers I've had. There's really not much more you could do to this, a perfect example of a barrel aged beer. World class for sure 609 charactersmjohnson17, Jan 02, 2013

Dark as chocolate coal with creamy brown 2 finger head with moderate retention and sticky lacing
Smell is chocolate elixir and cocoa fire in one. Booze sweetness. It's the most pleasant alcohol booziness that I've smelled. Not afraid of being an imperial stout and a strong one at that. 
The most sweet, savory, chocolate rich, boozy, warm RIS ever! I don't want to type, I want to just drink more.
Full body, moderate carbonation, silky
The best stout I have had to date, much more on the chocolate side of things, the perfect Christmas beer. 639 characterswilliamjbauer, Jan 02, 2013

A - black, almost pitch, but when tilted and held to the light, a dark brown sugar color comes out on the edge. Very little carbonation, even an aggressive pour straight into the middle produces very little head. I wish there were a teeny bit more head, but almost no complaint here.
S - absolute 5 here. Top notch. Vanilla, bourbon, some very rich roasted malt, slight oak. Can't quit huffing this throughout the life of the pour. Really smells great.
T - also really really great here too. Vanilla, toasty malt, bourbon, rich deep flavors and I can't do a great job of describing. There are some hops that come in at the end and really assert some bitterness at the end. My only (tiny) complaint is that the hops may be just ever so slightly too bitter. As he beer warms, I find the hop bitterness less and less off putting, but I still have to say I'm glad I have another to cellar for a year or so to see if the hops quiet down.
M - again, no fault here. Where I complained a bit about no head, I have to give the beer props for perfect low carbonation. Rich, thick mouthfeel. 
O - Very close to 5s all around, but not quite. This is about as close to perfect as I can think of though, really excellent. 1,288 charactersBeerandboards, Dec 28, 2012

4.44/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This beer has been on my wish list for a long time. Being a fan of Russian Imperial Stouts, this is a premium example.
Poured from the bottle into a snifter, this stout was a dark black with little if any variation in the color. As expected, virtually no head was present as a reflection of a smooth stout. The aroma was boozy with notes a vanilla and dark fruits. I must note the aroma on this one to be close to nirvana. On the initial taste, one notes the smooth mouthfeel of vanilla that is implied by the barrel aging process. The booziness jumps ahead of the pack with a warming sensation. Dark fruits, darkened malts, cocoa, grape skin also make appearances before the warming sensation takes over. The thickness allows the warmth to linger nicely. The smoothness on this beer is unbelievable.
This is a great beer for a cold winter night. I was not as blown away by the taste as I expected, but still enjoyed this one a great deal. 941 charactersJohnnyHopps, Dec 24, 2012

Taste: huge oak start, dark chocolate--especially in the middle, vanilla, roasted maltsweet caramel, and whiskey
Mouthfeel: very sweet with slight roasty bitterness, moderate-high carbonation, heavy bodied
Overall: Amazing and roasty RIS. This one has alcohol bite but is never overbearing. My preference is for Sucuba and Barrel Aged DBA, but this makes for an excellent third place from the brewery. I love the oaking and the complexity with multiple layers of chocolate. I will try to pick this one up again. 687 characterstigg924, Dec 03, 2012

A - Pours very, very dark brown. Little head quickly diminishes to a ring. The ring sticks around, no lacing to speak of. Good look for a big stout.
S - This baby really knocks you out on the nose. The bourbon and roasted malts are clearly present, but the nose is far more complex underneath. Oak and vanilla as expected, along tobacco, leather, and a slight hoppy note. This is one of the best smelling beers I've ever had. Really remarkable.
T - Also kills it. Nice bourbon presence which greatly complements the vanilla, cocoa, and roatiness. This beer tastes full of dark, roasted malts, and you get the slightest hoppy note on the palate that comes through in the nose. This is just a pleasure to drink.
M - Perfect. Smooth, creamy, barely a hint of alcohol present anywhere. Coating and not cloying, the flavor on this lasts forever, and what lingers is very delicious. 
O - This is one of the very best bourbon barrel-aged stouts out there, if not the best. Truly a treat to drink. Buy many of these so you have plenty to drink now, and some to drink later. 1,117 characterskdb150, Dec 03, 2012

Notes of bourbon, oak, cherries, dark fruit, dark chocolate, coffee, some booze and brown sugar sweetness in the nose. Taste opens with bourbon and oak followed by dark fruits in the middle of the palate. Back end is a pop of intense milk chocolate and coffee that coats the mouth. The alcohol is imperceptible. Mouthfeel is thick and coating, among the best I've had. Parabola meets the hype and in some ways exceeds it. Certainly the best barrel aged RIS I've had (still waiting on KBS). 608 charactersspark3148857, Nov 25, 2012

4.27/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4The beer pours jet black with a razor thin tan head that settles down to a halo around the edges. As expected, the nose is bourbony, but its 12.5% abv is well masked. Notes of chocolate & coconut fight against slightly metallic notes of bourbon. It's definitely a bold elixir that drinks smoothly. The initial sweetness followed by much more bitterness (82 IBUs!) than I originally expected. It reminds me of wookey jack except with a lot more bourbon and booziness. The mouthfeel is bold and full bodied and despite spending 12 months in a barrel... there is ample carbonation. The aftertaste is a lingering vanilla bitterness that is possibly to bitter for its own good as the contrast overpowers the rich smoothness and drinkability I've come to expect in a good RIS. Regardless, this beer is damn good, but I must admit that I've had some that are better. 859 charactersThePorterSorter, Nov 17, 2012

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A friend of mine, and buddies of his - none of them beer drinkers, scoured all BevMo's within a 50 mile radius of SoCal in the summer of 2012 picking up how many ever bottles they could get, and gifted me their entire allocation, all 12 bottles, as a wedding gift. So I've had the 2012 vintage several times over the years. 
It started out as a 4/5 in 2012, and at the time of the tasting, I put it behind Sucaba 2012, and HoTD Adam. Quite honestly, the beer was a let down at that time, t'was way too bitter - much like a fresh Stone IRS.
And six months later, the beer had mellowed down and allowed the complexity to show through - almonds, oak, vanilla, bourbon, cocoa. What a pleasant surprise! 4.5/5
And another one followed, in 2015. This time, the brew had really peaked. Silky smooth chocolate, vanilla, almonds, mellow bourbon, dark fruits, gentle roast, aromas of very fine cigar and leather. 4.75/5
Finally, in the winter of 2016, cracked open the last of the ones. I expected this to be past its prime, perhaps more dark fruits and roast than anything else. I was, oh, so wrong! If one were to serve beer to the gods, this would be it! Perfection in every aspect - in the aromas, in the taste, mouthfeel etc. IT brought to the table, all of the aforementioned aspects, but with the smoothness of the finest china silk. This is a beer that every man, or woman, must sample at least once in their lifetime. Yes, it is that good. 
Thank you FW for all the good things you have given us, but above all else - for giving us Parabola. 1,545 charactersgshak, Nov 14, 2012

The aroma brings lots of dark chocolate and some subtle, boozy oak. I also get the faintest hint of roasted coffee and even some dark fruits. Extremely complex.
The taste has a ton of dark, bittersweet chocolate, with some vanilla and bourbon on the back end. Boozy, but not overly so. Just enough to let you know this beer means business. 
The feel is full bodied with solid carbonation. Creamy, velvety, and smooth. You can taste the bourbon at the back end of every sip. 
Overall, an absolutely fantastic beer. The bourbon character is a welcomed addition, and it's never too sweet or too bitter. Just well balanced all around. 731 charactersScaryEd, Nov 10, 2012

A- Pours a true opaque black color with a mocha-brown head, just about 2finger due to a healthy pouring. That head fades to a lip that will not go away.
S- BOOZEY right away, and strong. Once past the booze, there are notes of creamy vanilla, smokey oak, anise and cocoa.
T- Smores roasted over the fire, simply put. It tastes like it smells.
M- so smooth and velvety, great full and creamy body. But the booze just won't quit. No sign of the IBUs, either.
O-I'd like to see the ABV toned down or at least masked, and more than a bit. For me, I expect more balance in a RIS, but it's certainly not bad. 666 charactersNiceTaps, Nov 10, 2012

Taste reinforces the chocolate aromas; coffee and espresso notes; nice combination of hop bitterness and alcohol glow in the finish.
An incredible imperial stout: rich, flavorful, balanced and complex. The Firestone brewers have created a monster imperial stout, bringing out various malt and grain flavorings while taming the fairly high ABV. I hope to find some more bottles of this beautiful beast... 647 charactersbeergoot, Oct 30, 2012

T- Big roasty malts give way to sweet vanilla, caramel, burnt sugar, coffee, chocolate, notes of tobacco. Lingering aftertaste is simply amazing, with the roasted malts playing off of the flavors mentioned above.

4.92/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Parabola opens to a rich black coffee and heavy cream aroma, tinged with tobacco and ash, fig, prune, raisin, hazelnut, toasted pecan, vanilla, milk chocolate, and caramel, with a distinct Bailey’s Irish Crème and Ferrero Rocher overtone. The heavy barrel aging hasn’t so much imparted whiskey or bourbon notes as it has amplified the natural vanilla and smoky cream aromas, imparting distinct creamed coffee liqueur notes, as well as subtle oak tones, and when combined with the dark fruit esters, the barrel aging lends the beer a port/raisin wine edge. After sitting for a few minutes, the darker flavors seem to part, revealing a sweet, sugary layer of cherries, berries, and mandarin oranges. These are joined by pink grapefruits, lemon, and hints of pine from the hops. As a whole, this is a fantastic aroma: finely nuanced, potent, varied, and swaying delicately and dreamily between bitter and sweet, ashy and creamy, and easily one of the more unique and tantalizing Imperial Stout aromas on the market.
On the tongue, the beer opens with a huge shot of dark fruit esters, including fig, raisin, prune, plum, and black cherry, joined by molasses, caramel, and brown sugar. After a second or so a wave of heavily-creamed espresso shoots in, joined by fine tobacco and delicious ash. Huge vanillas and subtle oak notes follow, bringing about the port/raisin wine edge noted in the nose. Hold the beer on the tongue long enough and the sugars will die off slightly, revealing a grapefruit, lemon, and pine resin undercurrent. There is a slightly strong bourbon-like alcoholic burn about the edges due to the 12.5% ABV and the barrel aging, but this mostly blends well with the fruits and ashes to form a liqueur taste. Subsequent sips reveal deeper layers of milk chocolate, toasted pecan, and hazelnut, and the Irish Crème/Ferrero Rocher comparison rears its beautiful head once again. The aftertaste is a lovely blend of heavily-creamed coffee, milk chocolate and hazelnut, ash, and light pine resin, almost making this seem like a dessert beer instead of an Imperial Stout. Mouthfeel is a silky, oily medium to medium-heavy, and carbonation is medium-light to medium.
Overall, this is fantastic beer, and while it may not feature traditional, or even expected Imperial Stout flavors up front, I doubt many drinkers will care. The care and craft that went into this beer is palpable and commendable, and the layers of flavor would be more believable if present in the kind of coffee-and-ice-cream-and-brownie-liqueur desserts found in restaurants whose bills leave average people gasping. This is a definite must-try. 2,633 charactersjondeelee, Oct 26, 2012

Aroma is big, rich, smooth chocolates and caramels with a nice, roast and mocha backing. The bourbon and oak provides a solid addition without over-powering the big malt backing. Touches of vanilla, raisins, and a light alcohol hint. Flavor is similar. Rich, bittersweet dark chocolates up front with a good amount of roasts and caramel. The oak comes on with a lighter bourbon note as well as touches of vanilla, raisin, and licorice. Mocha, tobacco, and a bit more bourbon grows towards the end as this finishes rich, roasty, slightly ashy, and sweet with a nice bourbon warmth and dry oakiness. Lengthy aftertaste following a very smooth, mouth coating, full body and a soft, light carbonation. Overall, a very big, bold, rich, well balanced imperial stout with a solid barrel aged character. Not the most complex, but such a nice body and really enjoyable all-around. 996 charactersSamichlaus82, Oct 24, 2012

Pours a deep black. Opaque, with a surprising (almond coloured) head for such a large beer. Enticing.
The first thing I picked up as I was pouring was an almost tamari-esque quality. This got me somewhat worried. I've noticed such notes in brews before, and it's not a flavour I want in my beer. As I let it settle, however, coming back to smell it I did not pick up the same odour. Now it was all blackened malts and a cloying sweetness. Boozy dark fruits.
I... I'm not sure what just happened in my mouth, but I like it. The rich folds of complexity that are present... sweet, but not overly so, bourbon, but not overwhelming, alcohol, but folded into the flavour, not overpowering. I don't pick up quite as much of the oak as I anticipated, but there's some underlying things in there. Very rich. complex and tasty.

A: Poured from the bomber into a Duvel tulip. Body is black with a small - and quick-to-disappear - light chocolate-brown head. No lace.
S: A big nose - dark fruit (raisins & figs), bourbon, vanilla & molasses. Also some oak.
T: Follows the nose - and then some. Roasted malt, coffee, bourbon, liquid chocolate, vanilla, plummy raisins and some tannic oak providing a bit of bitter balance at the tail end, with some lingering roasted coffee beans as well. Finishes with a bit of alcohol heat, but that's not surprising for a 12.5% ABV beer. It's not overwhelmingly bourbony or boozy, though you wouldn't mistake this beer for a 7.5 percenter.
M: Heavyweight in heft. Full-bodied is an understatement. Carbonation is muted - it's smooth but never really becoming oily or slick - though it comes close. 
O: Really good stuff. A tad bit too boozy for me to garner a higher score anywhere, but if you like the -bal aged, bourbony RISes, you might rate this one higher than I did, and I wouldn't quibble with that.
Note: As I hit enter on this review, a bootleg version of "Loving Cup" by the Stones popped up on my iTunes. Perfect. 1,170 charactersKendo, Oct 14, 2012
4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52012 boxed bottle purchased from Belmont Station in Portland, OR. Shared with @LaitueGonflable and @tobeerornottobe during a brewday in Sydney, Australia.
Pours a fine deep brown-black, with a slightly frothy, large-bubbled head of mocha brown that leaves speckled lace. Body is solid but fluid, leaving fine carbonation, but swirling quickly. Looks good.
Nose is an excellent deep sweet oak-aged stout melange. Hints of vanilla mixed with a depth of roast, with a sharp ashy tinge like the cold remains of an overnight campfire. There's a little touch of sulphur to it as well, which lends some organics in a slightly weird, but not necessarily unpleasant way.
Palate is exceptional. Incredibly smooth and rich, and wonderfully balanced. Deep darkness is obviously the order of the day, but it's blended and folded over itself again and again until it has no harshness in it: it's smooth, rich, and certainly dark, but in the most mellow and approachable way. Light oak gives some vanilla, but as ever, that darkness sits around and draws the flavour back to its midnight depths. Wow. Incredible stuff.
Feel is smooth but with a lightness that again antagonises the true darkness that is at its heart.
This is a wonderful beer. It straddles the dichotomy of dark and light, of good and evil of sweet and bitter. Of everything. This beer is a little of it all. Really great stuff. 1,385 characterslacqueredmouse, Oct 13, 2012
4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage, served into a Duvel glass
Pours a nice dark roasty black color. You know what this beer looks like. It looks dark. Lots of head, especially for a beer with age on it. It looks great. Not much to say.
What sets Parabola apart from its competition is balance. The aroma is so complex but so balanced: roast, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, coffee bean, vanilla, dark caramel, bourbon, dark fruits, cherries. All of that is there in the aroma, but it all works together. It's got fantastic cohesion.
Same with the flavor. Things don't unfold in waves, really. Its more of an "all these flavors are happening all at once, singing as if in a chorus, making a joyful noise together" thing. Fantastically blended, these flavors. It's a very sweet beer, so keep that in mind. It's not Dark Lord sweet, but its close. What Parabola has over Dark Lord is that balance though. Phenomenal. 
The mouthfeel is full but not super-sticky, not ultra-thick. It's pleasant. I have to say this, this is important: there is NO alcohol burn on this year-old bottle. None. This is so smooth, so drinkable, that it should be illegal in most states.
While I can conceive of a better-tasting imperial stout, It's hard to think of one that could be better-brewed than Parabola. Everything works together. Perfect harmony. 1,313 charactersReaper16, Oct 13, 2012

Wow, I can smell the booze as soon as I open the bottle. 
Pitch black. A little half-finger head sticks around for a little while before fading. 
Underneath its boozey aroma I get significant oak, vanilla, and chocolate. 
It's flavor is a seedless meld of dark chocolate and French vanilla coffee. Bourbon soaked cherries come to mind. Alcohol is NOT hidden. Milk chocolate and hot booze sticks around on the finish. 
Full bodied, a little syrupy, with a prickly finish. 
Enjoyable, but not a breeze to drink. To be honest, i think the bourbon hurts this beer. It's a bit too hot for my personal tastes. There are other RISs that I enjoy more. So I was let down a Little. If I think of it as a beer, I'm not a huge fan. If I think of it as an after dinner cordial, I'm a fan. It has its place but you have to be in the mood. I just feel that the bourbon barrel aging added an unnecessary element to a beer that was probably perfect in the first place...and took some of its greatness away. 1,010 charactersjbertsch, Oct 11, 2012

First impression is this is one dark beer with a nice light mocha colored head that just stays on there forever. Smells of dark roasted chocolate and malts with the bourbon and oak smells coming through. Wow...it just smells so smooth. Now to tasting it and even more wow! Coffee, chocolate and the oaked bourbon tastes hit immediately finishing with a deep chocolate taste with slight alcohol taste. This is a really smooth drinking beer...I don't find as much alcohol as some other barrel aged imperial stouts I've tried so its has a nice feel with low carbonation and a warming feel.
All in all easily my favorite barrel aged imperial stout I've had to date. This is such a treat and I look forward to getting my hand on another one. A++ 754 charactersGoatshaver, Oct 06, 2012

Motor oil. As black and syrupy as 30 weight. The nose is all toasted malt, coffee, chocolate, with some spice.

4.62/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I had this beer at Dukes Alehouse in crystal lake IL. I shared it with some friends as the beer is rare and expensive.
Pours a deep black like all other RIS of this style. You probably couldn't shine a spotlight through it. There was also minimal head in the pour, but there was some decent carbonation.
Smell is chocolate, chocolate and more chocolate.
Taste is also of ... surprise chocolate! I was a little worried it would be a chocolate bomb but it was actually balanced pretty nicely.
Overall this is a fantastic beer, on par with bourbon county stout . 563 charactersjokemon, Sep 29, 2012
4.32/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at McLaddens Irish Public House in Hampden, MA on 9/29/12.
Pitch black, completely opaque. No head which is expected with a 12.5% abv but there are a few small carb bubbles floating around the edges on top.
Smells heavily of bourbon, dark roasted coffee beans and some rich milk chocolate underneath. Just a hint of oak as well.
Taste is similar to smell but the coffee shines through a little more. Bourbon is still the most prominent but the oak flavor is much more noticeable here. A lot of booze in the finish, very warming. Also VERY sweet. Almost too sweet.
Mouthfeel is smooth, heavy, LOTS of alcohol warmth as it goes down. Low carbonation.
Overall this is a great stout! A little too sugary and the bourbon is kind of overpowering but those are my only complaints. 785 charactersRyanLigeia, Sep 29, 2012

A- Black with a three finger mocha head.
S- Dark chocolate, oak, roasted malts, some coffee, some licorice.
T- Dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, charred oak, some tobacco, very rich.
M- Creamy, medium to full body, a kick of heat in the finish, but not too much heat.
O- A solid barrel aged worth the price. Bourbon is not overpowering. Hopefully next year it doesn't take so look to make it to Maryland. 448 characterslarryi86, Sep 28, 2012

My wife surprised me Saturday night with a surprise birthday party and I decided to splurge a little. I've been holding on to this for a special occasion and I'd say a surprise 40th birthday party fits the bill. 
This glugged out beautifully into my CBS snifter... thick and black with a slow creamy mocha head... coats the glass with each swirl... perhaps a little ruby going on as well? Excellent looking...
First whiff sends a shot of bourbon and chocolate up my nose as the barrel makes itself evident early and often. Rich aromas of dark roasted coffee present as well as a slight anise aspect and perhaps something along the lines of raisins... very interesting ans unusual...
The sheer density and creaminess of this beer makes it a sipper almost immediately... Loaded with flavors of chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and a healthy dose of licorice, this thing packs a punch as the flavors ride a thin ribbon of booze that carries it along very nicely. A delight to enjoy with friends by the bonfire on a chilly late September evening for sure... 
A very well done brew by FW here... 1,147 charactersTilley4, Sep 24, 2012

4.88/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52012 Bottle, No ageing.
Appearance - Pitch black pour with a finger of khaki head that dissipated pretty quickly. Some alcohol legs present with light carbonation shown ringing around at the top of the glass. B-e-a-utiful brew!
Smell - Dark, dank fruits with dark chocolate notes right upfront. Some alcohol notes present themselves along with slight coffee and licorice in the backdrop. Very appealing to nose.
Taste - WOW. It tastes just like it smells, but on another level. Dark fruits and dark chocolate are BIG. Coffee, licorice and even a slight tobacco taste in the background. The fact that no alcohol taste is present at 13% is just insane. What every Russian Imperial Stout wants to be, but only Parabola is.
Mouthfeel - Coats the mouth with a thick blanket of the best taste any Russian Imperial Stout can produce. Full bodied, very, very light carbonation, and a smooth finish that is just unrivaled. Very slight alcohol warm as it travels down the throat, which is still alarming at 13%. If they didn't give the numbers, and I wasn't feeling the effects after 22oz, I would estimate it to be an 8% abv brew. Quite the feat.
Overall - My current favorite beer. Period. World class doesn't even begin to describe it! The one Russian Imperial Stout that I haven't had, but was informed that it rivals it, and might even be better than it, is Cigar City's Marshal Zhukov RIS. Might have to give it a shot sometime. Until then, Parabola is as good as it get in the Stout category. If you can get it, buy two. One to drink fresh, one to age. My favorite stout, my favorite beer.

4.68/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52012 Vintage-22oz bomber to myself.
I am finally getting around to reviewing this and will preface by stating that I think this may be the best vintage yet for Parabola.
A-Jet black, thin light brown lacing that remains after a one finger head lingers for a minute. I would not expect anything less. 
S-Dark chocolate, figs and grain. Not a very aromatic beer in my opinion.
T-Lots of bourbon up front but not overpowering. Very mellow woody notes followed by an intense dark chocolate, cocoa, and caramel onslaught. 
M-Very smooth and without a burn. Oily and sticky with a syrupy feel that hides the alcohol.
O-Truly one of the best big stouts out there. A little more vicious and less balanced than others but delivers a high abv punch that is hidden rather well. The carbonation was dead on this year whereas last year I found it to be a bit high. 
My one complaint, I have to say this about a lot of bigger beers in large format bottles, it would be nice if they took the route of making this in smaller bottles. It is a fantastic beer but I can't always find someone to share the bottle with especially during the week. It is a heavenly elixir but a big beer so be ready for it. 1,190 charactersbeerhan, Sep 23, 2012

Smell - Not overpowering....some currents...some toffee.
Taste - The first and lasting impression is twizzlers. You could think of it as wine but It's a bit medicinal...not in a good way. Alcohol is nicely hidden. I do taste some vanilla and wood as well.
Mouthfeel - nice and smooth....luxurious.
Overal - I was so excited about this one but I have to say I'm disappointed. The synthetic fruit is overpowering and I think it is just not my cup of tea. I really prefer a more cocoa and coffee profile in my Imperial Stouts. I'm glad I tried it but I don't think I'll be getting it again. 658 charactersgroovejackson, Sep 18, 2012

4.57/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I've been sitting on this one for just over 2 years, and I'm really excited to crack it. Review is from notes taken on 9/15/2012 and poured from the bottle (2010 batch) to a snifter.
Appearance: Pours exactly as I would hope and expect - it looks thick, viscous, a little goopy; body is of course nearly black and it starts with a short 1/4 finger, dark brown head that fades quickly to nothing than a fairly thin circle at the surface along with a thin, wispy skim; thick and opaque, there's no chance light is sneaking through this one; can't get a read on any kind of carbonation, so the thin head is my only tell so far...; 
Smell: Again, pretty much exactly what I would hope for and expect - plenty of big, rich, sweet syrupy malts; some vanilla and some sweet cherry; touch of earthy roastiness, but really more on the sweeter side of the stout world; no sense of alcohol in the nose, so that's a little scary since it's a 13% beer... it must be well masked.
Taste: Wow. This is a fantastic beer. Easily a top 5 stout for me. Lots of the sweet chocolates up front, but I'm surprised by a strong presence of bitter, roast espresso grounds blending in with it; the bitterness overpowers a bit and it hides the vanilla, largely, which is a bit of a shame, but it's early in the beer and it might make more of an appearance later; definite presence of alcohol in the mouth, especially at the back of it -- really, I would have to say it's a bit like a jamocha shake from Arby's with bourbon in it. Pretty excellent.
Mouthfeel: Body is heavy, thick, viscous and a little syrupy; carbonation struggles through the heavy body, but it is there, keeping it soft, smooth and almost velvety; a thick, sticky coating is left all over the palate and the teeth are left with a gritty film as well; belly is left quite warm from the alcohol. I love a beer that makes its presence known.
Overall: This beer has just about everything going for it -- looks good, smells better, tastes great, thick and chewy body... what else could you want? This is a great beer for dessert, wouldn't want to drink too much on a full stomach though. The alcohol and weight will indeed slow you down a bit. 2,183 charactersbamadog, Sep 16, 2012

smell: very big and rich - bourbon, dark chocolate, chocolate cake
taste: This is a massive stout, and the 2012 vintage is drinking MUCH better than the 2011 bottle I consumed a few weeks ago. Dense chocolate cake, dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, coconut. The barrel aging delivers a lot of booze and vanilla, but very little wood - would have liked to see that in more balance.

3.62/5  rDev -20.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.524oz bottle poured into a Ninkaski pint glass. Pours a liquorice black into glass. Absolutely opaque color underlines a dark mocha head. The head pours fat but dissipates quickly with cappuccino tan slippery lacing. 
Smells strong of alcohol, the 12.5% is more than obvious here. Robust cherries and figs with overtones of purple grapes. Hints of liquorice are present, as well.
Taste is damn nutty and malty. Chocolate and a mellow fruit, slight liquorice type flavor is all that really comes to mind. 
Initially flat on the tongue, the taste rounds out on the back of the throat. Alcohol reverberates throughout the mouth while a cream-like feel touches off the finish. 
I've been waiting to open this bottle for a year now. I had planned on keeping it longer, but I've never been one for patience. Opening it when I moved a month ago was the idea, to christen the new house, and although that never came to fruition, temptation proved too volatile tonight. An $18 bottle I bought from Seattle last summer that I've seen for $15 here in Bellingham, needless to say I've had better. You're buying for nomenclature and exclusivity here. While it is a tasty brew, I've had twice as good beers for half the price. Unless you're buying for a wedding or dinner party, or just to impress a lady, stick with something else to fulfill your exotic craft or review-based needs. 1,372 charactersthatruth, Sep 14, 2012

Freshness Date: None
Reserve Series No. 003
A: Poured into a snifter. This brew is pitch black with a khaki head which fades to a faint rim. 
S: Bourbon alcohol with complimenting aromoas of tobacco, chocolate, espresso, oak and dark fruits. 
T: The flavors at first match the nose: tobacco, chocolate, oak and espresso. Then comes raisins, plums, cherry, vanilla, marshmallows, and smoke. All these complex elements are brought together by dark bread and smooth oat creaminess. Moderate warming bourbonesque alcohol and leafy bitterness throughout.
M: Moderate chewy mouthfeel with light carbonation. Creamy smoothness and good warming alcohol. 
O: Stumbled upon this gem at the local BevMo. Aged 12 months in oak barrels, this beautiful brew is the product of patient and knowledgeable hands. A complex, flavorful imperial stout that is both a joy and a honor to imbibe. 907 charactersElSid, Sep 04, 2012

Russian Imperial Stout. Reserve Series No. 002. OG 29.5 P, IBU 82, Cases 3000, 12 months aged in barrel, British ale yeast, 167 srm. Alc. 12.5% ABV.
Solid black, under a rich brown, cocoa head. Looks fantastic, that is to say, magnificent, or, so to speak, amazing.
Aroma: dense as can be. Molasses, chocolate, espresso, dark rum, …and let us not forget alcohol. Thick, rich, huge, …massive, really.
Taste: vast, voluminous, enormous, …thick, rich, malty, dark chocolate, coffee, dark fruit. high alcohol, but just shy of what we call "hot". Dense and dangerous. Viscous and vicious. We could keep this up all day, I suppose. I can crack open the thesaurus and round up the usual suspects. In short, it's as big and overblown as the best of them.
So huge, I couldn't finish it. Chose to drink it after a night of drinking other beers, and didn't have the capacity for taking the whole bomber down, after those initial notes. I capped the remains and finished it off last night, no worse the wear. Well, a little worse. Didn't hurt it that much though.
A magnificent achievement in the style, worthy of speaking of in the same breath as the previous champions. 1,229 charactersfeloniousmonk, Aug 28, 2012

t: very sweet up front. the vanilla is intensely prominent, as are the chocolate and the oak. the back end is more roast-y, with a bit of hop bite -- which, combined w/ the bourbon undertones, almost gives it the kick of a rye whiskey. this is a very good thing.
m: buttery, oaky, creamy, about what you'd expect.
o: complex. lot going on here. wish i'd gotten a second one to let it mellow out, because (personal preference here, and i know i'm drinking a 12.5% RIS) it'd likely be even nicer, but quite good as is. 740 characterssnatch210, Aug 28, 2012

Appearance: Pours a Midnight black like you'd expect from a huge RIS.
Smell: Smells of Barbecue smoke, vanilla, bourbon, coconut, slight chocolate, and slight alcohol. 
Taste - Taste mirrors the nose with charred chocolate and more smokey bourbon - delicious. You get a little bit of alcohol but it's not overpowering at all and works. 
Mouthfeel: Thick mouthfeel like you'd expect. 
Overall: One of the best beers I've ever had. Kind of reminds me of Yazoo Sue, without the cherry flavors, but I haven't had many barrel aged beers so I don't really know what to compare it to. 679 charactersGameFreac, Aug 26, 2012

S-a little alcohol, bread molasses and toffee. Despite the appearance no coffee smell. 
T- dark chocolate, toffee, carmel, Vanilla with an alcoholic maybe rummy bite and some bitterness on the back end. I can understand why some people lay this one down for a while. I also see why they use it for a blend at firestone. It would be great if that burn mellowed. 
M-as if you stuffed a satin sheet in you mouth. smooth lingering viscous the alcohol is apparent.
O- well I used my 2nd wedding anniversary to give this beer a try. I had been told if i had two bottles to try one now and to cellar the other. Like my marriage this beer has unlimited potential for improvement, is smooth and mellow (Ha with alcoholic undertones), takes two committed persons to enjoy, and Is versatile enough to blend well with others. But, I think ultimately its will reach its full potential over time! 
I don't know how they serve it but I know I cant drink a whole bottle myself. I wouldn't necessarily order another, That doesn't mean i didn't enjoy it. But I have been enjoying the double DBA a little more! 1,230 charactersUncle_Jimmy, Aug 22, 2012

A: Pours a dark dark black that is only slightly deep brown when held to the light along the very tip top... About half a finger of coffe colored head that dissapates quickly and leavs some lIght spots of lacing.
S: deep dark chocolate, oak, delicious toasty vanilla, burbon, caramel, toffee, the aroma here is ridiculous, I could smell this all day... 
T: much like the nose, except even more delicious, oak, dark chocoalate and loads of barrel and burbon character. Serious toasty vanilla notes, along with dark cherry and toffe, the oatmeal comes into play as the brew warms mingling wonderfully with the oak.... So well blended an well rounded... Delicious.
M; nice heavy full mouthfeel, creamy with a nice carbonation for the style... Nice and dry 
O: wow... One of my favorites from these guys and one Of my favorite barrel aged releases period.... This is an awesome barrel aged stout... Hard to beat this one. 989 charactersPeterIngemi, Aug 21, 2012

Pours a viscous motor oil black with a one and a half finger tan head. Huge aroma of oak, bourbon, and roasted malt. Bourbon, vanilla, and oak with hints of chocolate joined by the dense flavor of black cherries, hints of plums, and rich fig. Finishes with bold espresso notes and roastiness and a comfortable alchohol warmth. Full bodied, smooth, and even a bit of creaminess. Incredibly complex and without a doubt one of the finest barrel aged Russian Imperial Stouts available. 587 characterschanokokoro, Aug 11, 2012

S - Aroma is a mix of roasted chocolate malts, dark fruits, vanilla, toasted coconut, oak, Bourbon, and a bit of booze.
T - Starts off with dark chocolate and roasted malts with vanilla and some dark fruits. Through the middle, the Bourbon and oak comes through with some toasted coconut and molasses. The finish is a mix of dark chocolate, molasses, tobacco, vanilla, oak, Bourbon, and dark fruit with a bit of booze.
M - Medium-full bodied with light carbonation. Feels smooth and a bit creamy with a sweet and warming finish.
D - Very drinkable. Amazingly smooth for how big and bold the flavors are. The balance is really spot on and the Bourbon comes through really nicely. 832 charactersngeunit1, Aug 11, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52012 vintage. Tasted 16 July 2012, reviewed from notes.
Pours a deep chocolatey brown color, not as dark as many big stouts. Reddish tones at the edges. Medium coffee-tan head, about 1 finger, with good retention and lacing.
Smell is very rich and sweet, with a tobacco layer, and a fruit layer with plums and candi sugar. Really rich, chocolate roasted malts. 
Taste has a rich toffee-like flavor, kinda like candy sweetness. Slightly sugar, reminding me of hard sugar candy. Rich flavors, heavy on the chocolate, without the coffee or roasty bitterness. Finish is lasting, and I mostly taste the bourbon in it (but in a very good way). I'm impressed with how smoothly everything melds together, both here and in the smell.
Mouthfeel is thick, heavy, chewy. Fairly low carbonation, but for a -bal stout, that's okay with me.
Tasty stuff. Very smooth, with excellent melding of the barrel and the beer. The richness of the barrel combines really well with the sweetness of the stout. Probably not the best barrel-aged stout that I've had, but definitely up there. Has the same sweet-rich barrel aromas and flavor that Abacus has, and it's interesting to encounter those same characteristics in a stout vs. a barleywine. And now that I'm thinking about it, where's the alcohol in this beer? It's going to my head, but I barely taste it. 1,340 characterszeledonia, Aug 10, 2012
4.45/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Deep black with mahogany tones at the edges. Head is impressive, thick cap of espresso brown, tightly bubbled. Good retention. 
S: Distinct bourbon up front, shifts gear to richer vanilla. Moves from the sweet side to dark chocolate, and roasty malts kick in. Very pungent, want to just sit and soak it in. 
T: Quite sweet up front, vanilla is prominent, and sweeter rich molasses type flavor. The roastiness kicks in, like a perfect medium roast. Bourbon is muted for sure, but there. Leather or tobacco creeps in at times as well. 
M: Light carbonation, medium to heavy body, nice. 
O: Love the "vanilla" or butterscotch flavor that I get in F-W beers, didn't expect here but I got it. Not the "biggest" RIS I've had, but flavors are perfectly proportioned and blended. 778 characterschilly460, Aug 09, 2012

The aroma is grainy dark chocolate malts with some lactose and dark fruits and some sharp alcohol.
The flavor is sweet grainy chocolate malts, dark fruits with some roast and quite a bit of vinous alcohol in the finish. The mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with low carbonation.
Overall, it reminds me of Old Viscosity. I remember this being better than this sample. It's in your face and not really well balanced. Too sweet and treacly at times, and the alcohol is too sharp for me. It's still a good beer though. 668 charactersBeaver13, Aug 08, 2012

A: pour is lightly viscous, deep brown in color. Almost no head formation on this pour and minimal lacing. Little carbonation.
S: big sweet bourbon soaked raisins and other dark fruits are profound and there is an awesome touch of vanilla. A nice solid malt backbone holds this one together. Not all that complex, but extremely well balanced.
T: wow, this one is sweet delicious bomb. I pick up on the sweet brown sugar, alcohol soaked raisins, big bourbon and massive vanilla. Alcohol is more noticeable than in the nose, but I think it sits perfectly with all the other sweetening flavors. There is a very faint chocolate note and a mild hint of hops, thus increasing the complexity.
M: Full bodied, light burn of alcohol on the lips, and the light carbonation is perfect for this brew.
O: I find this one absolutely awesome. Everything is so well balanced in this one, but be warned that this is a sweet sugary bomb. The only knock on it may be the heat on this one. I find it appropriate for the massive sweetness in this brew. 1,044 characterstut2528, Aug 07, 2012

Appearance: Super rich brown, almost black color with a rim of espresso head. 
Smell: Distinctly bourbon barrel character, vanilla, chocolate, and roasted malts are all prominent. Intense scent that had a lot going on. All the aromas were easily distinguishable. 
Taste: Initially sweet with chocolate and some brown sugar flavor. Roasted malts really come out with a wood flavor, and the bourbon is definitely noticeable, although not overwhelming. Vanilla and some tobacco too. 
Mouthfeel: Medium mouthfeel, pretty strong alcohol flavor, and light carbonation.
Overall: FW kills it again. This is the first time I've been able to try Parabola, and it has so much flavor that I was analyzing every sip. Can't wait to try the bottle I have after it gets a bit more age on it. 833 charactersmfavoino, Aug 02, 2012

Pours a slick pitch black, with a two inch dark tan head, that leaves wonderful scattered lace. Smell is vanilla, chocolate, expresso, bourbon, and some molasses extraordinary. Taste is lots of vanilla and expresso up front, with some smoke and bourbon towards the finish, really huge flavors and every sip is as intense as the first. Body is medium large, perfect amount of life for the style, dry as you would expect from the style, and very drinkable for a big beer, that should be savored sip after sip. I have 4 more of these and am so happy about it. This is one of the finest BA Imperial Stouts on the planet. Firestone does it once again! 706 charactersSawDog505, Aug 01, 2012

Pour: Pitch black with a finger of tan sticky head. Dissipates quickly.
Smell: Bittersweet chocolate and tons of bourbon and vanilla. Some booze, but not much.
Taste: Wow. Chocolate and vanilla with a sweet bourbon warming. The bourbon is blended into the flavors of the beer perfectly. Some mocha espresso at the end, but not a ton.
Mouthfeel: Literally like silk going down. Little bit of warmth from the bourbon, but I actually like its presence because it reminds me that this 12.5% monster isn't playing around, and it supplements the flavors more than any other BB stout I've ever had. Presents a slight cloying at the end of the glass in the back of my throat that drives this down.
Overall: I love this beer. Probably my favorite BB stout, next to Black Note. Buy this no matter what if you have the money in your wallet. If not, go sell some scrap and come back before someone else buys it. 1,062 characterscfrances33, Jul 29, 2012

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Of all the beers I've ever tried, this one might have officially taken the crown as my favorite beer. 
Served on tap at 775 Gastropub.
Deep brown body, thick mocha head with solid retention for an imperial.
Rich aromas of coffee, cocoa, tobacco and more. One of those beers where you want to get a huge sniff in before a sip, and you want all the sips you can get. All of that fragrance translates into the flavor and it's as robust as any imperial stout you'll ever have.
It's clearly a strong beer, but the strength of the flavor works in tandem with the strength of the alcohol like cognac. Every sip is enjoyable, the alcohol is never overwhelming, but it makes its presence well known on the palate and in your body. Take it nice and slow. It's a perfect beer. 769 charactersTheRealBigC, Jul 26, 2012

Poured into a large, generic brandy snifter.
A:	Pours a deep, chestnut brown. This brew is super dark brown and opaque at its heart, with a bit of chestnut brown peering through at its edges when held up to light. Some slight red and orange streaks appear as it is swirled. Slightly lighter in appearance and viscosity than I anticipated. An appetizing, creamy, and burnt-khaki colored head pours half a finger thick and recedes into a delicious looking ring around the glass that floats on top. Tiny and intricate lacing with decent retention for the style; better than anticipated for such a high ABV.
S:	Delicious bourbon barrel wood and booziness hits first, followed by dark fruit. Classic barrel aged FW aroma (similar to the §ucaba). I love it! Nose then gives way to hints of a brown sugar sweetness. Inviting and intoxicating aroma.
T:	Boozy dark fruit and creaminess. This brew has a bitterness, but it’s a hoppy one as opposed to a dark chocolate like some beers in this style possess. The taste of the brown sugar from the nose is there, but not as intense as the aroma would suggest. There is some detectable alcohol, especially in the finish as the beer warms, but the flavor ultimately belies this brew’s 12.5% ABV; it is pretty well balanced. My only qualm is with a noticeable acidity that cloys ever so slightly, leading to a slightly dry finish.
M:	Medium bodied with decent carbonation; more carbonation than I expected from such an imposing beer. I expected a thicker, more viscous mouthfeel out of this one. Quite honestly, I think this is the only area where this beer could use improvement.
O:	Absolutely solid. One of the best smelling beers I have come across so far. One whiff and you want to take a sip – and only a sip – because it is impressive looking and it smells like a bourbon bomb; you know it might knock you on your ass. It is delightfully drinkable without being overly sweet, or too decadent. Wonderful balance. I only wish it was ever so slightly thicker. 2,037 charactersBWHD, Jul 26, 2012

Pours a very VERY dark brown. A bit of head forms, but dissipates quickly. Not as viscous-looking as I was expecting.
The nose is pure bourbon at first, followed by coconut and coffee. Very sweet and very enticing.
After the smell, I was expecting a bourbon bomb, but it's much less prevalent in the taste. All the smells are represented, but they're joined by caramel and roasted barley. The bottle says 82 IBU, but there's not much apparent bitterness, probably because of the intense sweetness. Divine.
Mouthfeel isn't particularly viscous, but it does coat the tongue very nicely. Certainly not a dry beer. All the tastes stick around long after the sip.
Three words: believe the hype. 742 charactersBlargimus, Jul 21, 2012

A- Pours pitch black with about a half finger's worth of a khaki colored head that quickly fades. Lots of sticky lacing along the sides of the glass. 
S- Lots going on in the smell. I get notes of coffee, chocolate, vanilla and maybe some dark fruits. The presence of alcohol is also on the backend of the smell. 
T- Tastes much like the smell. Up front I seem to get some vanilla and coffee notes more than anything. The woody-oak flavor is apparent from the barrels. This drinks rather hot in my opinion. Not a bad thing, as I taste some bourbon-type notes in there which I like.
M- Heavy, little to no carbonation. Drinks hotter as the beer warms. Real nice sipper or dessert beer.
This is my first time I've had the pleasure of getting my hands on Parabola. I was able to snag 2 bottles. The other bottle will sit in my basement for a year to see how this one does with some age. While many people say this one doesn't feel like 12.5% ABV, I think it does (which is fine with me.) Overall this was a a great beer and I'm glad I got to try it finally. 1,194 charactersvic21234, Jul 09, 2012

Black body, with a bubbly light brown head. Mild retention. Nose of oak, whiskey, chocolate and molasses. Sweet and completely balanced. Taste has more oak, vanilla, whiskey, lightly roasted malts, sweet molasses and chocolate. Quite thick in feel, no alcohol and super smooth. Not super complex, but an extremely well crafted BA'd stout. 412 charactersliamt07, Jul 08, 2012

A - Pours dark, impenetrable black with a small, chocolate-colored head. Minimal lacing.
S - Oddly enough, in addition to the normal range of aromas (chocolate, caramel, toffee, etc), I pick off the aroma of soy sauce. 
T - The nose carries forward in to the taste, big time. Bourbon, vanilla, caramel, chocolate, coffee are all very prevalent. Minor notes of cherry, oak, and a tiny bit of alcohol. It certainly doesn't lead on that it's 12.5%. Amazingly complex and smooth, not excessively sweet but definitely a dessert beer.
M - Smooth and creamy without being oily. It's not excessively creamy which is nice. Low, but present carbonation aids the beer without being overbearing. A slight warming sensation as it goes down hints at the alcohol content.
O - Very complex and very refined. And this one hasn't even been aged! This beer is fantastic as-is and doesn't need to wait to be enjoyed. I do plan on saving a bottle for another year or two and seeing how it pans out. Overall this beer is a phenomenal barrel-aged offering from the kings of barrel-aged beers. Firestone definitely hit the nail on the head with this one. 1,183 charactersthebornotaku, Jul 02, 2012

Midnight black, small chocolate head, low but enough carbonation to keep the beer flowing and drinkable. Aroma of chocolate, wood, lots of alcohol, very refined. The empty bottle aroma gets better, lots of butterscotch and vanilla.
Taste opens with big chocolate and very dark roast coffee that leads to very sweet dark cherry, lots of oak, wood. Barrel soaked rum, notes of brandy and red wine. The spirits effect of the barrel aging make this a most delicious treat, really doesn't try to hide the fact that this is loaded with alcohol, and I like that.
Another fantastic barrel aged beer. Easily makes the best of list, but it is getting hard to rank them all. 754 charactersB33R501, Jul 01, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52012 Vintage poured into tulip 
Appearence: Pours a dark brown to almost black in color with about a one finger size head. The head is of a light brown color that dissapates quickly to leave some real nice lacing behind.
Smell: The smell is of a rather simple bourbon and vanilla with a slight alcohol. I do pick up on some possible chocolate and a sweetness like molasses with some faint roasted character. It is a pretty sweet smelling beer.
Taste: Upon initial taste I get the bourbon and vanilla followed by some of the sweetness and some faint chocolate. On the swallow I do notice a light hop character that really seems to tone down the sweetness and prevents this from being overly sweet. I must mention that the alcohol is fairly well hidden but at the same time noticeable. I do get some very, very slight alcohol burn but in no way unpleasant. A rather simple tasting beer but one that for that reason is easily enjoyed!
Mouthfeel: This beer is surprisingly smooth. I was expecting this to be "hot" and not as creamy as it is. The carbonation is pleasing and the body very enjoyable too. It's silky smooth in my mouth and not too viscous but like I said befor very creamy and smooth. Excellent feel!
Overall: Just a very enjoyable experience with this one. Not overy complicated but a rather straight forward beer that is a sipping pleasure. I'm interested what some time would do to this but it is so good fresh I don't know if time would do this one good. 1,473 characterssleuthdog, Jul 01, 2012

Poured into a chalice. This beer pours a tinge lighter than black. An inch worth of mocha head rests atop. Light lace left behind. The nose is sweet with vanilla, maple, gingerbread, chocolate, oak. The bourbon isn't as strong in the nose as I'd expected. 
Moderate mouthfeel, with decent carbonation presence. Slight oily feel on the back end, but drinks nicely. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla. Again, the bourbon is underplayed, but its subtlety is what I like about this. Rounds out a nice roasted brew, giving a welcome sweet balance. I usually like to split my bombers with someone, but this one was a treat to drink on my own. Loved it. 700 charactersOnenote81, Jun 30, 2012

Appearance is midnight black. If light passed through it, I didn't see it. Great 1-2 finger dark tan head that shows off it's barrel-aging.
The aroma is strong of oak, bourbon, some vanilla and nice roasted coffee. It just smells rich and complex.
The taste follows the aroma nicely as it tastes as rich as it smells. Lots of roasted coffee and chocolate flavors mixed with the oaky vanilla complexity that makes this a great savoring beer. I feel like I need a cigar to pair with this beer. Some bitterness, but not overwhelming, I feel like some age could smooth it out some. Some bourbon, but blended well with the malt bill.
In terms of mouthfell it's a rich, robust, full bodied beer. Medium to low carbonation, but still retains a smooth feel. It may be like motor oil to some, but delicious for me!
Have 3 bottles of 2012 I'm looking forward to aging to see if it balances out even more. 1,041 charactersProspero, Jun 28, 2012

150th BA review
A big thanks to Pelican5 for sending this one over in a trade.
A: Pours a dark cola brown with lightening on the edges and 1/2 fingers width of mocha colored head which dissipates down quickly to only an outer ring with inner whisp.  Lacing is effectively none, with only the faintest spotty patches left on the glass.  
S: Dark fruit, chocolate, oak, and vanilla come out in that order.  It is also boozy with subtle bourbon notes, with aromas of black coffee and roasted malts. Could be richer. 
T: Initially there is a heavier bourbon presence on the tongue, which is quite nice but unfortunately this takes a backseat to a huge bitter component and booze.  There are also notes of roasted malt and a hint of dark fruits, but again these are overwhelmed by a  bitterness consisting of hops and bitter dark chocolate.  Not bad, but too boozy and too bitter, and the booze is not a smooth bourbon booze but a harsh cheap vodka booze.  The potential is there but I don't drink beers for their potential.  
M/D: I wouldn't say it's particularly thick or smooth for the style.  Over carbonated, which when combined with the bitterness, give it a biting quality. Finishes quite dry.  Drinkability is below average, mainly due to the dominating bitter quality,  plus the ABV isn't particularly well masked.   
O: Overall, this is a pretty middle of the road RIS in my opinion.  Some age could do this wonders I suppose, but as is, this one is a pretty big disappointment.  I am a huge fan of barrel aged stouts but this one is far too bitter and a touch too boozy. The bourbon is masked by an almost grain alcohol character, and the rest of the flavor profile is dominated by the bitter qualities.  I would like to try an aged one to see how it develops, but the fresh one is rather meh.  No where near the level of many other big RIS's I've enjoyed, and also no where near as enjoyable as Sucaba.   2,006 characterszac16125, Jun 23, 2012

Pours a light black with ruby and brown highlights with a small, tan head.
Smells of sweet bourbon/alcohol with notes of charred oak, chocolate, cherry, vanilla, and bready sweetness.
Taste is bready, biscuit malt up front that goes into a chocolate liquor middle (bourbon and hints of others) before finishing on a smooth, yet warm chocolate biscuit character with notes of vanilla and oak. Everything balances quite nicely.
Heavy body with low carbonation works well. The alcohol is a bit too present at this stage, would be killer with some age.
I couldn't ask for a better barrel aged stout. It's not too liquor forward, and it is quite drinkable without aging. No stopping FW. 700 charactersTenHornsProud, Jun 22, 2012

2011 batch.
pours a typical imperial stout used motor oil black; somewhat aggressive pour yields a 3/4" mocha toned head. expected below-average retention. nose is very appealing, stands out even in a style populated by worthy foes. rich notes of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and roasted malts.
flavor delivers follows and expands on the aroma. in addition to the above-mentioned headliners there are secorndary elements of oak, molassess, and raisin. full-bodied mouthfeel with adequate carbonation.
overall a stellar RIS, one of those rare hyped beers that meets (even exceeds) expectations. another home run from firestone walker.

T: Deep dark coffee dominates at first, with a fruity-honey center that evolves into a cocoa-dry vanilla whip-cream syrup. Absolutely delicious.
M: Very full bodied but never too syrupy with just the right amount of carbonation. This stayed slightly bubbly for the 2+ hours I sipped it.

S - Wow! There are so many componentes to this aroma. I get cherry, vanilla, chocolate, coffee, earthy hops, some leathery flavours, and big roasty character. This smells incredible!
T - I get the same components as in the aroma, but with some more sweetness. This is well balanced by bitterness from both the hops and the roasted malts. There are some definite vinous qualities here. This is a beautifully crafted work of art. 
M - Huge mouthfeel on this beer. The creaminess of an oatmeal stout x10! What an amazingly rich beer. This is a beer in no need of pairing, it is a meal on it's own.
O - I'm sure this is the best imperial stout I've tasted, and it's very likely the best beer I've ever had. This blew my mind, I'm soooo glad I've got one more bomber.

It's a beautiful black with a tan head that's gone before you know it. After one whiff I knew this was something special. I instantly picked up on sweet cherries that are nicely balanced by smokey oak and vanilla. Taste up front is of dark chocolate, bourbon, sweet raisin, dates and cherry. This gave way to the notes of burnt coffee, oats and roasted malt. I picked up on a bit of liquorice and several other flavors that my palate just couldn't identify. The bitterness and light carbonation in this stout is perfect. The brew felt thick and the booziness really warms is it goes down. Overall this beer is powerful, complex and excellent. I'll be aging another bottle to crack on a cold winter's day several years in the future. 809 charactersBeerevity, Jun 18, 2012

Looks nice, big and dark, decent carb. One finger head that dissipates, leaves some decent lacing.
This smells great. Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, a bit of a dark fruity character, some barrel notes. Really nice.
Taste doesn't quite live up to the smell for me. You get all the same flavors, but the balance seems a bit off. Stronger bourbon up front, not as smooth and balanced as the nose would indicate. A bit more heat than I'd like, it's not unpleasant by any means but it kind of hurts the drinkability. It's a great beer with a lot going on, but I think it needs some age to mellow out a bit. I'd be curious to see how the '11 is drinking right now. This is probably more like a 4.25, but I'm docking it to a 4 because it disappointed me when compared to my memory.
Nice mouthfeel. Big and thick, decent carbonation but not overwhelming. Coats the mouth nicely.
A really nice beer, but this is not as good as I remember the '11 being. I definitely think it needs some time to mellow out. The bourbon is a little overpowering, adds a bit more heat than I'd like and hurts the drinkability. I'll be holding onto my other bottle for at least another year before I try this one again. 1,205 charactersrodkin, Jun 16, 2012

About a finger of head when I got it. Color was black with tints of purple in it. Brown, coffee and caramel lacing. Good retention.
Smelled chocolate, caramel, chocolate milk and some light coffee malts. Also some dark fruit, maybe plum? Great smell.
Tasted a big dose of alcohol right away, mainly bourbon. That gave way to caramel, toffee, chocolate and light coffee. 
Full body. Average carbonation. Creamy texture. Smooth finish. The feel was the best part of this beer by far. I wish I could have given this a 5.5. Just phenomenal. I kept craving another taste when I put the glass down.

Pours an imposing pitch black with barely an edge of deep red clarity. A finger of medium brown head sinks down to a stubborn collar, a swirling island of tan retains in the center of the glass. Thin lacing and obvious alcohol legs.
Big, beautiful bourbon character strikes the nose. Milk chocolate and vanilla, boozy raisin bits, a touch of caramel, soft wood character - such a complex smelling beer. Incredible balance and depth.
Holy fuck this is tasty. That great bourbon profile bites the tongue immediately... the flavors exist in complete harmony with one another. Sweet bourbon, vanilla, heavy wood, cocoa nibs, dark burnt chocolate, a bit of dark fruit far and away. Divine.
I'm glad I finally grew the balls to crack this open. What a great beer. 912 charactersyamar68, Jun 15, 2012

Stats updated to be more reflective of this, the most current release
A: into a snifter, pitch black of outer space, dense head of dark foam
S: bourbon-soaked chocolate syrup with vanilla bean and black coffee
T: outrageously decadent, somehow another animal entirely than the previous releases - rich chocolate malts like syrup drenched in bourbon - had an almost merlot-like essence - hints of dark coffee roast and melted dark chocolate; hidden berries and dark fruits
M: supremely slick and smooth; dark silk; dense and full-bodied, but it plays light across the palate
O: incredible. Even more limited than previous years, but soooo worth it.
2012 release: 
A: stout 101: pitch black with a tan head; this head was fairly creamy (like a milk stout)
S: chocolate malt, bourbon, some vanilla and espresso
T: dare I say this was a more balanced bourbon experience than drinking a BCBS - bourbon is there, so is chocolate, vanilla, espresso, and very little anise (which I kind of liked)
M: creamy, a little bitter abv sting, rich, full
O: this made me think of what Goose Island's BCBS line would be if they were RIS - it was a little smoother, less syrupy, more creamy, and well-balanced - on par for certain - and I imagine everyone will have their own preferences - I loved it and was glad to get a hold of this limited release. 1,357 charactersGreywulfken, Jun 15, 2012

2011
A: Pours a straight black with a small dark tan head. Some noticeable ruby highlights, head recedes quickly.
S: A bit of liquor, sweet dark fruit and chocolate, slight booze.
T: Nice oaky bourbon, tannic vanilla, big dark fruit, sugary chocolate, a small dose of bitter roast and slight heat on the back end.
M: Pretty thick, small carbonation.
---
2012
A: Looks basically the same as the 2011. Better retention, less ruby highlights.
S: Bourbon, slight dark fruit and chocolate, roast, a bit more alcohol than the 2011.
T: Same as the 2011 with noticeably more heat and more vanilla. Less fruit notes as well.
M: Same as 2011.
---
O: Of course both were delicious. The 2011 was a little less roasty, less vanilla, less alcohol heat, and more fruit. I gave it a slight edge. 928 charactersEtan, Jun 11, 2012

A - About 1 1/2 fingers of lighter than expected head. Some decent cappuccino color to it. Nice tiny bubbles that stick around. Body is deep black that you cannot see through unless you get less than 4mm. 
S - Simple bourbon and vanilla. Some chocolate and a hint of alcohol. Wonderfully sweet, but a bit lacking.
T - Wonderful and simple in vanilla, chocolate, and bourbon. A little light molasses to it. Just a little bitter hops at the back-top of my mouth which pulls this down a bit.
M - Wow, I was not expecting that smooth milkiness to this beer. Just flows right through your mouth. Makes this a top beer. Good carbonation and decent body.
O - They don't try to do too much with this beer except make it excellent. Nice all around and best mouthfeel I have experienced. 822 charactersRuckusDu, Jun 11, 2012

A: Midnight black in color with a fast dissipating caramel head and lacing put on hold for another day.
S: Robust in nature: coffee bean, dark chocolate bar, smokey wood 
T: The star. Deep notions arise in the beginning with the kick of the robustness of the mentioned flavors above. As it warms it comes more complex in nature and can mess with your mind. Intriguing without coy.
M: Medium body, sticky, abv noticeable with heat senses, low carbonation, but present.
O: Completely stoked to be finally able to try this beer, and to have it on tap form makes the experience that much more pleasurable. World Class all the way. Next for me is finding a bottle...I recommend the same for you 727 charactersBuffaloTapHugger, Jun 10, 2012
4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter after being allowed to warm for a bit. Very, very dark with a nice 1 finger creamy mocha head. Lovely.
Smells of oaky vanilla soaked in just a few drips of bourbon. Yet you can tell that this is a big beer. Alcohol is there in the nose as alcohol soaked raisin and sugar. Just a dusting of cocoa dusted espresso beans in there. Complex and sweet.
To me, the taste profile follows the nose in reverse. I get cocoa and alcohol at first, with fruit in the middle. This beer is strong and chewy. A hint of bourbon with the vanilla. Held in the mouth a bit brings out the warmth and oak and a little black cherry. This beer has a large amount of sweetness to it, something that I wish was mellowed out a bit. I would have liked a little more dryness to this one. After the swallow, the beautiful roastiness comes through, with slightly bitter coffee and cream. So, so good.
Mouthfeel is practically perfect. Big and chewy. Thick and viscous. Completely coats your tongue in it's gigantic flavor. Very must a slow sipper. No beer I've ever had has gone down this slow. A bomber is to share for sure.
Overall, this is a world-class RIS that is full of big huge flavors. Most of the time I find that it is overly sweet and wish it was a tad more dry. I have one to age for a while and I cannot wait to visit this one again in the future with some years in the cellar on it. 1,391 charactersmarkmiller, Jun 10, 2012

A - Completely back, fully opaque brew. Light brown rim due to the pour into a snifter. 
S - Milky chocolate malts. Rye bourbon and vanilla candy sweetness. There's a bitter cream smell in here also.
T - this beer provides so many complex flavors. Begins with vanilla, rye and a bourbon barrel heat from what this was aged in. The barrel and wood quality hits first, but the base beer finishes. A chocolate truffle leads its way into a wonderful Colombian coffee roast. A heavy flavor of toffee ends this incredible beast. There's even a bit of maple syrup in here, just incredible.
M - Full bodies stout with mid level carbonation. Smooth drinking, and somewhat refreshing for a stout actually.
O - Sit back and savor this beast. I enjoyed every last sip of this. Utterly delicious. The base beer must be great, to barrel age it excess, but also necessary. One of my favorites from PBW, and one of my favorite stouts period. 965 charactershaazer, Jun 09, 2012

4.72/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Ah, to go back to the days when Firestone's Double-Barrel could blow my mind. But as Firestone has grown in popularity on the west coast, it's clear that they've needed to step up their game substantially to make a mark on the craft beer culture. And with Parabola they've done just that.
Appearance - Midnight black with a heavy head retention and consistent lacing.
Smell - Perhaps this beer is the distinct bourbon and sherry aromas that hit the nose instantly. Extremely complex
Taste - The complexity in this beer is matched only with it's distinct balance. Sweet tobacco flavors fill the palate as well as bourbon and red wine flavors. It's like a dark, beautiful explosion in your mouth.
Mouthfeel - Light carbonation with a thick, chewy movement. 
Drinkability - This one's for sharing if you get the bomber. Thick and strong, don't try to chug this.
Two Years Later: 
I'm coming back to Parabola two years after my first encounter with the beautiful beast. Still packaged in noble condition in a box with the insignia and a bottle to rival the finest wines, this beer is an experience to cherish.
Served just under room temperature really brings out all of the complexities of this brew. The midnight black body and ominous burnt head make this beer incredibly intimidating. The lacing and thick presentation add to the appeal. The aroma is heavily sweet with dark malt wafting in a big way. Bourbon, a bit of booziness, chocolate, carmel, and coffee notes all layer on thick on the nose.
The flavor profile is something that the written word can't even really harness, but here's a shot: Thick carmel and chocolate notes load the front end, yet flavors open brilliantly as you chew Parabola on the palate. Dark cherry and oat flavors come into play, smokiness comes in waves and the touch of bourbon at the back end plays with a hop bite to remind you that yes, they do still love their hops in California. Thick and chewy all over, this beer is not to be taken lightly.
No beer is perfect, but it's hard to find fault in Parabola. The far end of the aftertaste ends up with a lingering sugar taste that can be irksome, but I'll enjoy this beer for years to come. 2,183 charactersManuelHerrera, Jun 07, 2012

M: feels more viscous than it pours. Minimal if not absent of any carbonation. 
O: This beer definitely needs to age but It's potential is through the roof. The fruit notes balance very well with the roastiness and the minor hints of bourbon. I really wanted to give this beer a 4.5 overall, but it still has some growing up to do. Can't wait to get this bad boy aged. 830 charactersjorgeg528, Jun 05, 2012

I've had this beer so many times, bottle, and on draft, but for some reason now is the first time I've taken the time to really sit down and review it.
A: Damn near perfect. Just as black as you'd expect it to be. Pours with a nice fingers worth of off white colored head. Surprisingly thick lacing for the high ABV.
S: Smells so inviting. Honestly it's kind of hard to describe. You can definitely smell the barrels, but not overpowering, like some BA beers. Big time chocolate, vanilla, and coconut notes come through as well. Chocolate chip cookies come to mind.
T: OH.MY! Seriously, so perfect. Chocolate, vanilla, coffee, licorice, bourbon, and some faint smokiness. All of those notes blend together perfectly. Finishes with a slight sweetness, but then a strong dry bitterness comes along that cleans everything up.The 13% ABV is only apparent in the pleasant warming feeling you get as it goes down.
M: Silky, velvety smooth perfection. Parabola just glides across the palate. Carbonation is perfect. So so smooth, seriously. Doesn't get better than this.
O: As I said at the beginning of the review. I've had this beer countless times, and it never ceases to amaze me. Absolutely my favorite BA Stout. The balance is amazing. Firestone Walker, in my opinion, has the absolute best barrel program in the country right now. Beers like Parabola, PNC, and Sucaba all show the barrel aging dominance that is Firestone Walker. I really need to buy a case of Parabola next year....the 6 bottles I got this year seem to be dwindling quickly. 1,562 charactersbifrost17, Jun 05, 2012

A: Going from the bottle into the glass, this beer actually appears to be a very deep, dark, rich garnet/ruby mahogany as opposed to the sheer pitch blackness you see in a lot of imperial stouts. Beautiful pour. 
S: Bourbon, vanilla, dark rich fruits, malty sweetness. Intoxicating. 
T: Blows me away. Absolutely, ridiculously delicious. The perfect melange of bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, caramel, molasses, figs, dates, dark raisins, and malt all woven together by the woody undertones. Seriously, this is one of the best tasting beers I have ever had. I think I will probably pick up different nuances in this beer each time I have it. It's very complex. 
M: Perfect. This stuff is silky smooth, rich, creamy and dangerously drinkable. Probably one of the smoothest brews I have ever had. If this is really 12.5% ABV, I really can't find it anywhere.
I can see now why this beer gets so much hype. It deserves every bit of it and more. It is phenomenally crafted and I am grateful to have finally been able to try it (and glad I have a few more). I would drink/buy this at every opportunity and recommend that anyone else who loves world class barrel aged stouts to do the same. Simply amazing. 1,243 charactersbcostner1, Jun 03, 2012

Nose of dark chocolate, cherries, rum, coffee, graham cracker, sandalwood, toffee, and bourbon. Flavor is similar, but there’s a good deal of plum, nougat, vanilla, leather, and tobacco as well. Mouthfeel is silky, and rich without being too thick. The finish is pretty balanced, and absurdly lengthy, but there is char, and a hint of bitter coffee grounds which I happen to think only adds to this big boy’s character. In the same league with The Abyss, but more complex, and even better.

A- Pours a pitch black with a creamy mocha colored head. The head sticks around for a minute but dissipates to a thin ring around the glass. The body appears to be viscous; I wouldn't quite say motor oil but pretty damn close. Some spotty lacing hangs around.
S- I love what this beer brings to my nose. Notes of chocolate and cherries immediately become apparent. As the beer warms, the bourbon starts to come out. Vanilla and oak round out the aroma. I really am not picking out much coffee. The aroma is what a quality bourbon barrel aged RIS should smell like. 
T- Everything really blends together well. Very similar to the nose. Chocolaty malts, vanilla, some oakiness and a touch of caramel. I detect dark fruits in the background. The bourbon makes its presence known, which does leave a slight burn on the tongue.
M- Surprisingly smooth, creamy and drinkable for a beer that's 12.5% ABV. Medium-thick body with light carbonation. My mouth is coated with every sip. 
O- A fantastic beer. One of the better bourbon barrel aged stouts out there. This beer has a nice complexity mixed with solid drinkability. Definitely a must try.

No penetration of light whatsoever through the beer. 
An almost non-existent mocha colored head that disappeared before it could appear properly. 
Characteristic Firestone Walker barrel-aged aroma; with bourbon, some sherry, rum soaked dried fruits, raisin, charred wood, charred dried coconut, cocoa notes. There is so much going on in the nose, it is almost impossible to pinpoint the notes. The aroma gets better with time. 
In terms of taste, there is a slight sweetness upfront, followed by charred wood notes from a barrel and definite heat from the alcohol. Raisin, dried fruit, malts notes in the middle till the alcohol almost acts like a palate cleanser towards the finish. This is a very complex and a really "big" beer. Lots of flavors blend really well. Smooth, luscious, full-bodied mouthfeel. 
One of the best barrel aged RIS in my opinion. 
Age is definitely going to make this beer even better. 
Highly recommended. Definitely has Firestone Walker barrel characteristics stamped all over it. Lives up to the hype. 1,156 charactersCaptDavyJones, May 31, 2012

A – So damn black it almost appears to absorb light. One finger light brown head, which dissolved quickly. Lacing is a complete coat of teeny tiny bubbles.
S – Powerful aroma of chocolate, coffee, charred grains, and oak. Time to dive in…
T – Taste follows the nose; both dark and milk chocolates, oak, burnt grain, espresso, caramel, raisin, a hint of black licorice, and a little ash/smoke. Abv is so prevalent as to be slightly distracting. Still, many layers of complexity here. All the flavors are extremely deep and full flavored. Drinking this beer is the equivalent to eating a whole cake, its that rich. Pretty amazing.
M – Might be the best part of this beer. Smooth, silky, and very creamy. Slightly oily. Helps balance the booziness that comes out in the taste. Low carbonation. Full bodied, but not quite “chewy”. 
O – World class, but this is one intense beer. Calling it a “slow sipper” is an understatement. I’ve had spirits that drank easier than this. Took me over an hour to finish the bomber. But lest you think that’s a critique, it’s not. This imperial is challenging but accept the challenge, and you will be rewarded. If there is a minor flaw, it's that it's just slightly "hot". I would love to sample this after a couple of years of aging. 1,350 charactersTempeBeerMan, May 30, 2012

Throughout the taste Carmel flavor is masking alchohol while still allowing the hazelnut esspresso to approach. Damn
Mouth. Thick syrupy. Thin for most part but syrup appears at the end and coats the mouth with a maple syrup viscosity.

Reviewed live. Expectations are high given this beer's reputation. 
Served straight from the refrigerator and allowed to warm over the course of consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. 
Not paired with food. 
A: Pours a one finger head of slight tan colour, mocha soft cream, good thickness, and great retention for the 12.50% ABV. Colour is a solid nontransparent black. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Predictable for the style, but nevertheless appealing. 
Sm: The aroma's starting to get me more interested. Cream, vanilla, chocolate, moderately heavy oak, hints of roast, a light hint of booze, unwelcome caramelization, and unwelcome caramel. The oak distracts from the general tone of the beer. I'm a bit concerned about the oats, and I worry they'll make the mouthfeel too porter-like. A moderate strength subdued aroma. Not at all the bold flavours you'd expect from the style, but I'm hoping that's indicative of subtlety rather than restrained character. 
T: Oak-laden, with nicely balanced caramel and hints of vanilla & chocolate. Nice dark malts comprise the foundation. Slight yeast comes through. Where's the roast? The style demands roast and it just isn't present. Certainly not a unique or special beer. It's a touch too sweet. The sugars used seemed simple and predictable. Built pretty close to the style; it lacks experimentation or boldness as a result. Some decent layering and subtlety, but not particularly complex for the style. I detect slight plum after suggested. Structurally indistinct; the first, second, and third acts are not clear and divisive but rather vague and poorly managed. It's good, but I'm far from impressed with it. The alcohol comes through as it warms. 
Mf: Smooth - overly so for the style (even considering the oats). Tries too hard to have porter-like smoothness. Would be better with coarseness (ideally from roasted barley) to coax out the flavours. Not dry enough either, instead offering only jarringly overdone wetness. Adequately carbonated. Moderately heavy on the palate. A touch too thin.
Dr: Drinkable for the ABV - which is hidden alright. The expectations created by its high ratings and hype are certainly not met. This has been done similarly - and better - before many times There's nothing special or unique here. Pretty pricey for the disappointing quality. I expected great and got pretty good. I might try this on draught, but having now had most of Firestone Walker's beers (including Sucaba) I know that I oughtn't to get me hopes up.

Revisited this on-draught because I kept seeing it hyped in the forums. Truncated review below. 17cl for $7.00. 
A: 3 finger head, creamy, nice soft complexion, great thickness. Damn good (~10 minute) retention. Opaque black body colour. 
Sm: Marshmallow, dark malts, chocolate malt, vanilla, cream. Lovely bourbon barrel notes including subtle vanilla and oak. No alcohol is detectable. Lovely aroma overall. No yeast or hops is/are detectable. Way better than the bottled form. 
T: Syrupy, with molasses and marshmallow. Nice cream on the climax. Boozy. Chocolate malt, dark malts. The barrel notes hardly come through at all; no evocative vanilla or oak here. Very low flavour duration; it's brief and then it's gone. Timid intensity (save for the alcohol); shockingly restrained, to its detriment. Balance is off. The absence of roast is regrettable.
Mf: Nice creaminess, thickness, and carbonation. Smooth and wet. Strange presence on the palate; comes off somewhat artificial. Doesn't feel custom-tailored to the flavour profile. 
Dr: Drinkable the high ABV, but quite pricey. Underwhelming overall compared to the hype. It's a decent beginner's imperial stout with timid barrel character, but timid and restrained does not equate to subtle and well integrated. I revisited this in good faith, but it's just not remarkable enough to justify its reputation or its high ratings. The barrel notes in particular are lacking compared to top beers in the style.

3.5/5  rDev -22.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.51 pt 6 fl oz brown glass bottle served in a snifter, reviewed live:
A - Pours a jet black color with a light tan, thin head of one finger. Retention is decent, especially given the high ABV. Inviting, if a bit standard. 
S - Earthy oak notes dominate over a strong but pleasant roasted malt body. Cream and caramel are present. Spicy ethanol on the back. I like the oak on the nose, though I think it hides some of the fine, subtle notes. 
T - General oak notes are dominant. Surprisingly sweet. Restrained roasted malts are countered nicely by cream and lactic notes. All of the flavors are a bit subdued, in my opinion, and the alcohol is very present, even bordering obtrusive. Weak plum on the finish. 
M - Full bodied, thick and coarse on the finish. Definitely boozy. 
D - A good beer, though it's a bit restrained and I'm disappointed by it given the hype. Not memorable or unique. 893 charactersblakelive784, May 29, 2012

4.82/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally picked this up after missing the show last year. Excited to partake.
Pours a dark black ale with a nice brown head that quickly turns to a ring around the glass.
Picking up some great vanilla, chocolate, heavy oak, booze soaked fruits and more barrel booziness.
The taste is outstanding. A combination of chocolate, light coffee, vanilla, caramel, wood and the distinct presence of warming alcohol. It all works. Very complex beer that keeps me guessing as to what else I taste and smell.
The mouthfeel could not get any better. Creamy and smooth like silk. Amazing.
Overall this lives up to the hype. An outstanding beer and not to be missed. I think it is drinking great right now but I am cellaring a few to see what becomes of it. Great stuff!! 761 characterskaseydad, May 27, 2012

A- dark black with a cherry hue along the rim. No carbonation at all for this 12.5% beast.
S- bourbon, walnut, tobacco, cherries and molasses .
T- brighter than expected with a lovely hot affect similar to carbonation but directly from the backbone of hard core bourbon barrel. Nice anise aftertaste representing the imperial stout well. Tons of leather and molasses flavor.
M- perfect for the style!
D- great flavor and limited release are worth the price. Don't miss an opportunity regardless of the sacrifice. Highly drinkable. 647 charactersmacktbone, May 27, 2012
4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52012 from the bottle. David Walker himself told me at the event where I picked it up that this beer needs no aging. It's great to drink right now. That makes sense seeing as it was in a barrel for a whole year.
A: Deep, dark black. Didn't pour as thickly as I expected. A medium-brown foamy head that dissipates quickly and leaves behind some decent lace with good retention.
S: Sugary, malty, chocolaty booze. Molasses. Very faint hops. But mostly alcohol. Warming but stings the nostrils a bit.
T: Huge, sweet, roasted flavors. A bit of cloying lactose sugars which is strange but it doesn't detract too much from the slightly dark fruit, chocolate, boozy malt. Some very strong coffee beans are in there, too. Overall, great, complex flavors.
M: As smooth and easy-drinking as a 12.5% ABV RIS can be. Very enjoyable flavors. Never grew tired of any aspect of this beer throughout the entire bomber.
O: An incredible, special RIS. At the price, it's a great treat. I must say, I was lucky to try this on-tap a few days before I cracked open my bottle so I'm able to compare. Much better from the keg with some carbonation and maybe some proper aging conditions to mellow it out a bit more. Nearly a "5" on-tap and close to a "4.5" overall in the bottle. 1,260 charactersGatch, May 27, 2012

2011 vintage
Many thanks to mschoefield for the chance to try this.
Dark, burnt brown. Nearly black. Not a thick head, but consistently wispy retention and a soapy collar remain. Some splotches and specks of lace, too.
Aromas of deep, roasted grains with tangy overtones. Airy booziness greets the nose, especially as it warms. Dark fruit notions. Hints of wood, char and mild sweetness. Earth and peanut butter. The flavors lean more toward charred and burnt tomes, much to my liking. Short, roasted chocolate; this is comfortably on the dry side. Molasses and an underlying graininess. Full, viscous, coating feel. Carbonation is very low, noticeable only on the back end. Warming finish with bold residuals. Barrel flavors are well-integrated and supportive, with wood notes emerging as it warms. Very smooth feel.
This is really nice. Its pretty hot and might do well to mellow a bit, but it's plenty enjoyable now. Recommended. 991 charactersRyan011235, May 26, 2012

Pours black with a tan head. The head dissipates but a nice ring forms on the edge.
The nose is wonderful I can smell it very easily from the pour. Wonderful coffee vanilla a slight bourbon 
The.taste is nice sweet with cocoa and coffee but a nice bourbon flavor. The bourbon is subtle but very nice everything is well balanced and the sweetness is cut by the alcohol. 437 charactersbishopdc0, May 25, 2012

A- aggressive pour yields a 1 finger mocha colored head that rests atop a black body. Leaves decent lacing 4  
S- deep boibon smell upfront, vanilla, cinnamon, roasted fresh coffee, nutmeg, apple pie, a floral hop scent, ripe dark fruit like figs and dates. 4.5
T- taste follows the nose. Sweet bourbon, vanilla, roasted coffee, almost like a cinnamon taste and chocolate.  All the flavors play off each other so well. Perfectly balance and the barrel aging made this preety much a perfect imperial stout .  As it warms I get some of the wine barrel notes also. Its not hot but there is a some alcohol taste but it is quite lleasent in this oneThis is amazing. I wish I had more bottles.  
4.5
M- excellent moutfeel. Low carbonation which I tend to like in my stouts. Great feel. 4.5
O- a top notch imperial stout. Not the best but it's definitely worthy of the hype and ratings. I should have gotten more to age. 4.5

A: Black or really really really dark brown, half a finger of mocha tan, with lots and lots of lacing
S: Chocolate, Cofee, roasted malt, oak, vanilla (wow). 
T: Similar to the smell, except there is quite a lot of bitterness at the end. I can also taste some dark fruits and brown sugar. Maybe it could be a tad bit less bitter and less sweeter for my liking, but regardless, this is a world class beer. * maybe my memory is just bad but, I don't remember Batch 1 and Batch 2 having this much coffee and chocolate taste. Bourbon also seems a bit milder on Batch 3. Maybe I'm just losing it. Batch 3 reminded a bit of Peche Mortel. 
M: Near perfect. Thick and syrupy. I love how the beer coats my mouth. There is a slight alcohol burn at the end but not much. 
O: I can't believe I haven't reviewed this beer until now. This is easily my top 5 stouts I have ever had. 968 characterssukwonee, May 20, 2012

Appearance: Jet black with a mid-brown head and fairly big bubbles. 
Smell: Huge dark chocolate, vanilla, oak/wood, and bourbon notes with a general, but not unpleasant, whiff of vaporizing alcohol. 
Taste: Sweetness is the most overt taste but, once I got accustomed to it, plum, coffee, raisin, chocolate, vanilla, and bread crust flavors come through. 
Mouthfeel: Heavy, sticky, and somewhat alcohol tingly. 
Overall: Parabola is probably my favorite stout of the moment. It manages to be the perfect balance of sweet and complex without being overwhelming. After having my first pour, I went out and purchased two bottles. 795 charactersTheEarl, May 18, 2012

 - Poured 22 oz. bottle into stemless wine glass on 16-May-15 (aged 1 year)
Tasted this side by side with a 2012 vintage and was clearly the winner. All the flavors were more prominent. Bourbon oak presence was one of the best I've experienced.
 - Batch #3 / 2012 vintage (Cellared 10-May-12)
 - Poured 22 oz. bottle into stemless wine glass on 16-May-15 (aged 3 years)
Tasted this side by side with a 2014 vintage and although the mouthfeel was good and consistent between vintages, the flavor profile was weaker than the 2014. I believe it is mainly due to the changein recipe.
 - Batch #3 / 2012 vintage 
 - Poured from 22 oz. into stemless wine glass on 16-May-12
Got a bit of the sweet decadence of Black Tuesday, the vanilla from the Bourbon and the chocolate biscuit from the oatmeal stout; mixed in with the bitter earthyness like that of KBS. I'd have to try again, but may be the best stout I've ever had.
 - Batch #3 / 2012 vintage (Cellared 10-May-12)
 - Poured 22 oz. bottle into stemless wine glass on 20-Dec-12 (aged 7 months)
Get oak barrel in aroma first, followed by vanilla bourbon. Tinge of metal. Tastes sort of follows.. charred oak, almost tart presence much like dark cherries. Vanilla bourbon around the edges. Bitter espresso finish. As it warms and mellows, getting some toffee. Could only drink half the bottle bc the bitter and acidic roast was getting overbearing. So far, not liking this with little age.
 - Batch #4 / 2013 vintage
 - Poured from 22 oz. into stemless wine glass on 3-May-13
Again, fantastic fresh. Good amount of bourbon and barrel presence. Packing heat, but not boozy at all. Nice balance.
 - Batch #4 / 2013 vintage (Cellared 10-May-12)
 - Poured 22 oz. bottle into Lost Abbey Teku on 19-Oct-13 (aged 17 months)
Best version yet. Almost like a Port wine, still full of chocolate, mild coffee and bourbon barrel. 1,893 charactersRollzroyce21, May 17, 2012

A shes black right out of the bottle with just a little cola at the edge, two fingers of dense mocha foam quickly falls to a thin film and only leaves a couple little spots of lace 
S dark bakers chocolate, vanilla, smokey woody notes, boozy bourbon, dark chocolate covered fruit, raisins, a little licorice and molasses, this one covers a large spectrum of dark roasts. Only some booze keeps this one from perfection 
T even more boozy woody bourbon notes with just a little sweet black coffee, slightly more dark fruity notes then I could smell. A little tobacco on the finish but it still has everything from the nose in one form or another, amazing complexity, one year isn't enough age for the 12.5% however but its a minor complaint 
M stuck in your teeth thick with just enough carbonation too give it some life, leaves my mouth with a slight tingle and a lingering strong aftertaste, just a little sticky on the lips and the booze hits my chest before my throat somehow 
O I'd bet another couple years would help this one hit perfection in nearly every area, my only complaint is it's still a little boozy but considering how strong this one is I should expect it, wonderful beer that everyone should seek out
I can't thank Rutager enough for this one its just great. I tried to age this one but it was taunting me from its little box telling me I didn't have another to gauge the aging progress so I should crack it, so I did. 1,535 characterswordemupg, May 11, 2012

Because you're either going to be blown away and really dig it, or you're going to be under-impressed with it. Guess which of those two this beer was for me. The latter. Sure, it's nice. Has some nice characteristics to it that work well. But this thing is rated up there with other beers that I've had that really made an impression. This one does not do that so much. There are nice vanilla and bourbon tones and a good profile, but there is nothing really interesting about it. It's "nice", but doesn't really do anything for me at all.

The stream from the bottle is a very dark brown, and it appears entirely black in the glass. A thin veil of mocha-colored bubbles appears atop the liquid, but disappears quickly - unsurprising for a beer of this gravity and ABV. Scattered dots of lacing cling to the glass. 
The aroma is of toffee, caramel, bourbon, hazelnut, vanilla, oak, dark chocolate, date, plum, and both brown and cane sugar. It has an almost “caramel-covered candy apple” aroma to it with the dark fruits in there. 
It tastes of roasted malt, toffee, oak, bourbon, vanilla, milk and dark chocolate all right up front. Cane and brown sugar, plum, raisin, and caramel all really jump out towards the finish. Exceptionally balanced and not overly sugary by any means. 
Mouthfeel is thick, coating the palate thoroughly on first imbibe. It thins to a nice, velvety finish accentuated by ample carbonation. 
Overall, this is one phenomenal brew. The bourbon notes are easily noticed, but not overpowering. They add to the beer as opposed to dominating it. Immense kudos to Firestone Walker for this one. 1,198 characterseclipse54, May 07, 2012

The aroma is subtle yet powerful. Cocoa, subtle alcohol head, and an almost fruity sweetness come through. 
The taste is smooth and rich. Exceptionally blended. A ton of complexity comes through, but almost as a single flavor due to the way it's blended. It has a bit of dark fruitiness and candy sweetness as well. Nearly no heat, but quite sharp tasting. 
Medium to full thickness and medium weight. The finish is dry and moderately sticky.

The beer pours pitch black. Little head but honestly I wasn’t paying close attention because it was too cold so I set it off to the side to warm while I finished the 2010 Abyss I was drinking. When I get to the Parabola I take a deep whiff and smell chocolate, bourbon, and roasted malts. I am blown away by my first sip and it only gets better. The alcohol is hidden very well and I get chocolates and bourbon. The beer is sweet and delicious. This is definitely one of the best stouts I have ever had. I am going to pick up a few fresh bottles when it is released this year but I will not hesitate to age as a few years has done this beer well. 721 charactersbvdubn, May 01, 2012

Taste: Rich chocolate flavors, up front, with the oatmeal/raisin and marshmallow flavors developing; by mid-palate, the Bourbon adds its heft to the sweeter elements, creating a boozy counterpoint; after the swallow, the sweeter flavors re-emerge, providing balance into the finish
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, slightly creamy; boozy, with low to moderate carbonation
Overall: As can be inferred from the geometry of its name, this beer is still moving along the curve to the apogee; not sure how long the process will take but it is still a ways away from its optimal point of consumption 770 charactersbrentk56, Apr 29, 2012
4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very dark brown, with a brown-tan, quickly attenuating head. Aromas of sorghum, coconut, chocolate, and tobacco. The mouthfeel is creamy and viscous, with some scrubbing on the back of the tongue at the finish. Milk chocolate, coconut, and unflavored leaf tobacco are prevalent and alternating flavors. There is even that mild pang in the back of the jaw that occassionally occurs with dry leaf, unflavored chewing tobacco. Notes of sorghum and bourbon as well. This is my favorite FW brew. It's a phenomenal concoction. 528 charactersDocJitsu, Apr 29, 2012
4.21/5  rDev -7.3%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Pours deep black with a small coffee head that lingers around the rim. Good sludgy lacing.
Smells strongly of chocolate, with bourbon in the background along with some roasty malts and licorice.
Chocolate is the overpowering flavor as well. The barrel asserts it's presence and while it finishes with a nice boozy kick, it's more subdued and barely noticeable at times until it reaches room temperature. (Take note of this Sucuba). Not one note, but definitely a little two note. Chocolate and bourbon overshadow everything else a bit.
Thick mouthfeel and got a bit cloying as it warmed. Low carbonation.
Very good beer, but not the best in style. This one is good as a sipper, but I wish it were more complex and the sweetness were dialed back a bit. I know they are different styles, but so much better than Sucuba, it's not funny. 837 charactersjmarsh123, Apr 24, 2012

Pours nearly, but not quite, jet-black; with a small, frothy tan head that settles rather quickly. Minimal patchy lace.
Aroma of bourbon, certainly, and accompanying vanilla; fudgy chocolate, roasted, charred notes; caramel. Complex flavor has a bit of sweetness and stickiness; fairly bourbon forward; some heat that has been tamed to a pleasant level by age; caramel, chocolate, burnt sugar, vanilla, charred malt, oak, traces of dark fruits underneath; raisins, dates, and figs.
Medium-full bodied but not viscous; medium-low carbonation. Smooth, creamy, and delicious. Not the biggest or most over-the-top barrel aged stout but one of the most well-balanced and drinkable, certainly. Would love to see what a longer cellaring would bring about. 766 characterstobelerone, Apr 24, 2012

A: Single fingered head that dissipated quickly leaving only a few suds behind. Deep dark brown bodied brew looks great, but unfortunately no lacing to speak of.

A: Pours 5000 mile motor oil black. Small, dense medium brown head. Fades pretty slowly, leaving some traces of lacing on the glass. 
S: Big and boozy aroma. Huge bourbon notes, lots of oaky vanilla with caramel, molasses and toffee. Hints of dark fruit like cherries, fig and raisin. Roasted malt notes poke through just a bit. 
T: Thick and creamy roasted malt character right up front. Loads of roasty char, chocolate and a little coffee. Mixes almost instantly with surprisingly dulled (compared to the aroma anyway) bourbon notes. Burnt caramel, molasses, toffee, vanilla and oak. The bourbon and roasted malt balance with each other quite nicely. There are hints of dark fruit as the two flavors fade away into the aftertaste. As it warms, maybe a hint of black licorice and perhaps even leather?
M: Thick. Creamy. Like melted chocolate rolling over your tongue. 
O: One hell of a barrel aged RIS. It smells bourbon-heavy but luckily it didn't taste overpowering. Just a touch boozy which suits the style nicely. Great balance between all the roasted malt flavors and the bourbon flavors. Melds better than almost all other similar beers (just short of a KBS-class beer). 1,192 charactersDope, Apr 12, 2012

4A: Very little head. Pitch black.
4S: Vanilla. Flat, sweet, malt. Oak aging? Toasted coconut? Vaguely alcoholic, which is impressive.
4.5T: Mmm. Huge, substantial...interesting butterscotch hard candy (this is exactly what it is). The aftertaste is bourbon and super-strong vanilla. Lightly bitter, roasted finish.
4M: Smooth, seductive, and slightly harsh from the alcohol (this is a good thing).
4.5O: An excellent beer! Highly recommended. A model bourbon-aged imperial stout.

Black, flat, viscous. Ensorcelling and boozy (in a good way). I really like the nose. The flavor has mellowed, the mouthfeel thinned, but the flavors have exploded. Toffee replaces butterscotch, bourbon is floating in the background, roasty-toasty malts float throughout, bitterness (both dark and piney-light) is pervasive. Overall, a stunning beer that has improved with age.

Vintage 2011, No. 002
Pours black with some tann on mocha foam that falls to a broken sheet in a couple minutes. Nose is complex - honey, molasses, marshmallow, bourbon, vanilla and some black cherry. Flavor is sweet with toasted and roasted malts, molasses, dates, raisin, bourbon, oak, vanilla and hints of graham. Body is a little thin for the style initially with higher carb than I'd prefer, and a semi slick finish that resonates longer than I'd anticipated. This beer was better this time around than previous excursions. I like the nose here, and I rarely am dissappointed with a FW nose. 3.5/4.5/4/3.5/4
Initial review on 11JUN11
Vintage 2011, Batch 2
A: Pours a black as night beer with ruby and honey hues as light passes thru. Less than single finger of head over the coarse of the pour. Spotty lacing. Scattered light tan patches on surface.
S: Honey, vanilla, molasses, fig. The other day when I had this, it didn't smell nearly as nice. This one is lively with layers of malt, oak, wood, charred marshmallow, black cherries. 
T: Dark chocolate, bing cherry, medium toast oak, hints of alcohol, vanilla. This is much different now than several days ago, I was not impressed then - now: yes. Resonating finish with molasses, warmth, raisin and cherry. Nice oaky flavor carries through the entire palate and into the finish well. Some maduro feeling to this flavor profile, particularly on the finish.
M: Medium body for the style with moderately high carbonation on the style IMO. Semi dry finish mends the former two notes and it seems this beer could use a little viscosity to help weave the beer. 
O: This is certainly a sipping beer, and an excellent one at that. I'm glad I hopped across the street for a beer to drink in this hotel before hitting the airport. As noted above this beer has excellent olfactory and palate play, but I think the mouthfeel takes away from the excellence of the beer. I also think this beer has such dominent wood character, that this would benefit from a year or two laying down to help it all come together. Granted, I think the malts would eventually turn this one really, really sweet, so it could be a delicate balance. Great beer for an oily, slow-burning, dark cigar. Or some pipe tobacco. Mostly would want the smoke in the air, not to actually take in as it would interfere rather than compliment the beer. 4/4.5/4/3/4 - 4.0 2,401 charactersharrymel, Apr 05, 2012

A: Black, with brown head (pretty low).
S: Strong vanilla, (fairly light) hazelnut; freshly baked dark rye bread with some raisins and plums in the mix; some oakiness.
T: Strong vanilla again; ridiculously delicious; cream (not just texture-wise); surprisingly, no alcohol flavor; wood, though not just oak; dark caramel; mocha aftertaste, as if having just drank real mocha; chocolate milk; black currrant (not surprising, given that I often sense that flavor with oak-aged beers). Generally complex and very interesting.
M: CREAM; smoothest, creamiest beer ever? Holy Jesus... Heavy bodied - to the point of being "sumo-wrestler-esque" - would be an understatement.
O: Not a session beer, to be sure, but one of the most complex and interesting beers I've tried. 861 charactersshleepy, Apr 03, 2012

A: The pour itself is as black as night. There is very little head. This beer is as dark as charcoal. 
S: The bourbon is present along with fantastic roasty malts and even vanilla. This beer smells sweeter than many other bourbon barrel aged beers. Smells delectable. 
T: Tasts exactly how it smells and better. The alcoholic bite from the bourbon is balanced perfectly with the roasty coffer like characteristics and vanilla sweetness. You get the bourbon for a short period of time and then it finishes with a superb amount of vanilla flavor. 
M: Oh my god. This is my idyllic view of how a stout should feel. It is as thick and sticky as molasses and goes down the throat extremely smoothly. At 12.5% there is very little bite from the alcohol yet the bourbon taste is still very evident. 
O: One of the best beers I have ever had hands down. 887 charactersareich6, Mar 27, 2012

A- Whoa. Very very VeRy dark. Tiniest of heads leads to a ring around the part where my glass ends and the darkness begins
S- If you weren't impressed by the look wait til you smell it. Lots of bourbon but not the bad way you get from some stouts that are all bourbon all the time. It's gentile with some background malty sweetness. You know this beer will call you back after tonight, its not one of "those" beers
T- Okay, if the look and smell both didn't impress you the taste will. I promise. The bourbon is just as the nose predicts, soft but undeniable. Sweet RIS characteristics in the background: malt and hop sweetness play a perfect compliment to the smooth bourbon. Their are the Pippen to the bourbon's Jordan
M- Thick and viscous. No BCBS but not far behind by any means.

A- Pours pitch black, I mean really really black, looks sticky and thick, produces only a very thin brown head that dissipates to a black mirrored surface.
S- Sweet aroma of bourbon, lots of vanilla, dark chocolate, fruity alcohol.
T- Big chocolate and coffee flavors, blended perfectly with a smooth bourbon flavor with vanilla, coconut and oak, a bit of smoky char and fruity alcohol, finishes with coffee and gooey dark chocolate. This is pretty perfect for a barrel-aged RIS, the malt character is massive, loads of chocolate cake and coffee flavors, while the bourbon, vanilla and amazing coconut complement this really well and are smooth and well integrated, not a hint of roughness or heat in sight. 
M- Full-bodied, thick as hell, chewy, oily feel, low carbonation, this is exactly how a massive RIS should feel.
O- This is an incredible beer, spot on for the style, blends big sweet bourbon flavors with heavily roasted malts and chocolate for a mean combination. I'm really happy I have a second bottle of this, with about a year of age on it it's doing very well. 1,131 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 14, 2012

In the taste, chocolate like roast with a bourbon end, and vanilla and oak presence all the way through. A boozy bite and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a dry oaky vanilla and bourbon like aftertaste. Big bourbon presence, with a nice stout underneath it all. 361 charactersOWSLEY069, Mar 03, 2012

A: Pours a jet black color with a one finger tan/brownish head with decent carbonation. Thin lacing forms all around the glass. 
S: Great aroma. Some bourbon, vanilla, plenty of oak, chocolate, and a little bit of roasted malt. There are some faint dark fruits, mostly raisin and plum. 
T: Lots going on, nice rich chocolate, oak, bourbon, and plenty of vanilla, which really hits home on the finish. A little bit of roast mixed in. 
M: Fantastic, slightly heavier than medium bodied, but extremely smooth. One of the easiest drinking imperial stouts I have had. Slightly dry finish. 
O: Fantastic beer, moves up to one of my favorites. Great combination of flavors and so easy drinking for a big beer. 808 charactersmdaschaf, Mar 01, 2012

Note: 2011 vintage
Appearance: Black, black, with more black, utterly devoid of life - virtually no head, minimal lacing - just a slight brown ring
Smell: Pretty epic - tons of burnt, roasted, caramelized malts - brown sugar, sugar - chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, burnt coffee, some oak - dark and intimidating
Taste: Heavy and rich - tons of malts with lots of depth - a ton of chocolate - burnt, cooked, caramel malts - bourbon and wood, not excessive but in good balance - chewy, like a meal - some char, some dry, dark fruits
Mouthfeel: Chewy, sticky, oily, heavy, sludgy
Overall: A great, great RIS
Simply put, this beer does everything right. The barrel aging adds a lot of flavor without being excessive, and the malt profile is wonderfully complex. This is a sipper that will only improve over time. 854 charactersangrybabboon, Feb 28, 2012

A: 1/8" or thinner level of tan coloured head over cola coloured liquid.
S: Coffee, vanilla, oak, toffee and red wine come to mind.
T: Vanilla, cherry, toffee and some alcohol up front with red wine, oak, coffee, chocolate and toasted malt in the finish. Very complex and very nice.
M: Medium mouthfeel with a medium level of fine carbonation. Some drying from the alcohol.
O: My only complaint is the the heat from the alcohol, but even this was relatively minimal. I chose to drink this beer now, about 8 months after release in order to still have the oak taste present while diminishing some of the heat from the alcohol. I believe this balance was met, as this was a beautiful and complex experience of a beer. 734 charactersDaftCaskBC, Feb 24, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz bottle of the 2011 vintage courtesy of RWNewhouse, thanks a ton Ryan for this one! Pours very black, no highlights. Small tan head, even with an aggressive pour. Modest lacing.
Nose is lots of chocolaty bourbon with some secondary aromas of vanilla and raspberries. Smells soft and beautiful, I cant wait to indulge in this one.
Powerful bourbon-wood-vanilla combo with a balanced sweetness and drying finsh from lots of alcohol and a fair amount of leafy hops. The barrel treatment is very evident and the alcohol is pretty well integrated. Gets better as it warms, I'd be hard pressed to have to choose between this and BCBS. Its not as rich, sweet or boozy and the mouthfeel is thinner. But it is less hot and more integrated out of the gate. Whereas I can see BCBS aging well for at least 5 years, with Parabola I am not sure if any time in the cellar would be beneficial. Tasty as shit though, I like it quite a bit. 929 characterstwiggamortis420, Feb 22, 2012

Pours a deep black with a small tan head that drops to the thinnest of crowns. 
Nose has some alcohol heat mixed with woodiness, dark fruit, some vanilla and slight caramel.
Promise of the nose is delivered in the taste. There's also a nice roast and coffee flavors. Alcohol shows up more as it warms. 
Mouthfeel is decent. Slighly syrupy. Definitly a heavier beer.
Overall an excellent beer. Don't know hoe this will age. I enjoed it to much now to save a bottle. 504 characterschicano4craft, Feb 21, 2012

I have wanted to try this one for a long time and I couldn't wait any longer and had to pop this bad boy open. My bottle was a 2011 Batch #2. I poured the bomber into my DFH snifter to find an awesome deep, dark brown body with a nice mocha colored head. 
The aroma was just fantastic, bourbon, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, and malt.
The taste is simply world class! The flavor is rich and in your face. Every sip got better and better as it warmed up. 
This is a full bodied beer that I thought wasn't to hard to drink. I really took my time drinking this one sip by sip. There was a good amount of carbonation but was well balanced with just a little bit of heat at the end. 
Overall a fantastic RIS, a great example of the style and I really just can't say enough good things about this one that hasn't been said already. 873 charactersDan3279, Feb 20, 2012

S: Pure bourbon, but without the aggressive alcohol that usually accompanies bourbon. The smell is very very complex. Elements include dark fruits, cherries, cocoa butter (hinting at the beer's richness) and liquorice.
T: Wow. This is right up there with the greats. A simple sip takes you through a world of velvety smooth flavours (creamy sweet chocolate with a hint of sweet cherries), right down to a refined bitterness of cocoa and dark fruits. All of this concludes with a dry finish that doesn't overstay its welcome and leaves you wanting for more.
M: Velvety smooth carbonation, and together with a heavy, full body, this beer caresses the tongue in a way few drinks are able to.
O: A perfectly matched beer. The appearance matches the taste and smell perfectly. The mouthfeel and taste are so intermingled that it is hard to tell them apart. A majestic beer. 995 charactersGary779, Feb 09, 2012

2011 Vintage 
No. 002 
Thanks to pittsburghkid66 for hooking me up with this bottle. 
Appearance: Parabola looks thick and oily as it gloops out of the bottle, it is pitch black in the glass with deep red edges when back lit. A rough pour yields a small, creamy, mocha coloured that displays average retention and leaves a little lace. A light swirl causes the head to slowly reform as well as leaving a brown residue on the glass. 
Smell: My first sniff tells me that I am in for one super delicious beer, this could be right up there with Abacus! Sweet milk chocolate, stunning bourbon, oak, vanilla and dark toffee make up the initial aroma. Further analysis yields sweet dark fruits (raisins and cherries), toasted coconut, molasses and chocolate liqueur. As the beer approaches room temperature the bourbon notes increase and a hint of nose tickling alcohol is noted. 
Taste: The nose lead me to believe this was going to be a super delicious beer and the flavour does not disappoint! 
The initial flavour is of dark caramel, sweet chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and sweet dark fruit. This fades into Molasses, roasted malt and Liquorice notes. The finish has a welcome bitterness and a distinct roasted coffee bean note. The alcohol is not totally covered and there is a distinct bourbon flavour and warming which grows as the beer warms. 
Mouthfeel: Perfect! Full, heavy body, lightly sticky with a moderate level of smooth, creamy carbonation. 
Overall: This is my second beer from Firestone Walker and again my mind has been blown! I will most certainly chase down a bottle or two of this from each future release! 1,651 charactersThehuntmaster, Feb 07, 2012

4.38/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle of the 2011 vintage, batch #2. Purchased at either Huckleberry's or JB's in Spokane about 6 months ago for $14.99.
Poured, with great viscosity, a dark brown color with a large bubbly and creamy mocha-colored head. Lots of lace. When held up directly to light, no light passes through.
At first, the nose is dominated by dark fruits. As it warms up, mollasses and sherry notes emerge in the background.
The taste is of figs, chocolate covered cherries, and prunes. It is then wrapped in a smoky, oaky flavor, imparted, no doubt, from the barrel aging. In the background is a sherry-like booziness, and it all ends with a moderately dry hop zap.
Mouthfeel is thick and silky, just what one would expect from an outstanding Impy Stout.
A trememdous beer, all around. I’d like to find another one and compare it to an Abyss. Would have been an excellent dessert to the rib-eye I had last night, except I was too full! I will buy this again, despite it’s $15 price. 982 characterswoemad, Feb 05, 2012

Served from bottle into a Green Man snifter. Poured pitch black with a half finger light tan head that subsided to basically none fairly quickly. Maintained excellent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit, alcohol, wood, and greatness. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, dark chocolate, wood, sweet alcohol, milk chocolate, and dark fruit. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fantastic brew. How in the Hell have I never tried this before!? The aromas and flavors in this brew are ridiculously good and very well balanced. When I saw that it weighed in at 13% I was afraid this one would pound me in the face with alcohol, but that was not the case. Allowing this one to sit in my cellar all this time has definitely worked its magic to subdue the alcohol. Absolutely a must try if you have not done so before. Might have to crack my 2011 to compare in the near future… 1,089 charactersthagr81us, Feb 05, 2012

A - Pours pitch black with less than one finger of brown head. Looks thick and rich.
S - Big aromas of vanilla, chocolate and bourbon with moderate oak notes. All of the aromas seem well integrated, nothing seems to dominate. Some alcohol presence but not overwhelming.
T - Bourbon is even more noticeable in the taste than the aroma. Nice vanilla and oak with a bit of alcohol bite mixes with a thick chocolate taste, mostly semi-sweet. Nice bourbon finish.
M - Full mouthfeel that is somewhat viscous. A bit dry with an alcohol bite on the finish.
O - This is a very nice barrel-aged stout. The bourbon is a big component, but it works very well with the heavy chocolate base. 696 characterswarnerry, Feb 05, 2012

Appearance: Thick black body with a beige head that quickly dissipates.

Taste: Vanilla, bourbon, coffee, slightest bit of caramel, and some chocolate too. Unbelievable taste. Bitterness in the finish. Great balance. 
Mouthfeel: Thick, low carbonation. Definitely a sipper, but I want to another sip as soon as the first is gone. Really have to control myself.

A: Deep, black, thick color. No light seeps through the edges. Aggressive pour leads to a 1-finger light tan head that sticks around in a ring on the outside. Lacing is spotty.
S: Holy bourbon batman. This one is full of barrel in the nose along with some roasted malts, coffee, cocoa, and some dried bitter berry. Bourbon. Lots and lots of bourbon.
T: Bourbon is toned down, but it has been replaced by alcohol. It's a burner for sure but there's a lot of other flavors going on such as vanilla and coffee. But mostly alcohol.
M: Nice big feel to it with ample carbonation. The burn does not go away.
O: This is a huge mother-effing-stout. It's got a lot of bourbon and not a lot else. I'm hoping the alcohol backs down over time because there is a lot hiding underneath. 875 characterssuspect, Feb 02, 2012

The pour was thick almost like used oil. It poured jet black with a creamy mocha head that dissapated, leaviung a tan oily lacing throughout.
The smell is a virtual corocopia of scents. I smell Coffee, Toffee, Chocolate, Vanilla, and sweet Jesus....Is that whiskey...no Bourbon. I cant wait to taste it.
The taste does not dissapoint. I get some coffe up front, as it coats my mouth, it tastes like an expensive cold chocolate elixir. The finish has the sweetness and smokiness of the Bourbon without the harsh alcohol burn. Feckin Deeelicious.
The mouthful is thick, meaty, heavy...like a chocolate milk. The swallow is smooth like a top shelf scotch. Alittle burn that coats and soothes.
The overall drinkability is top notch. I suggest buying two. Drink one and age one.

A Pours the deepest of browns with a 1 finger mocha head that recedes quickly into a small ring with very little lacing.
S Bourbon right away, followed by chocolate, vanilla, coffee, roasted malts, and a hint of coconut in the background. 
T Oaky vanilla hits me first followed by espresso and chocolate. There is a bit of char in the background as well as some alcohol heat, but this is a 12.5 RIS, so that is to be expected.
M Creamy texture, almost dead on for me, but needed a bit more carbonation.
O Still a bit hot for my tastes, as I tend to like aged RIS better as they mellow. Flavors were great, especially as the beer warmed. Not an everyday drinker, but great none the less. 730 charactershannydawg, Jan 26, 2012

4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Parabola has a dark brown body that borders on black and is definitely opaque. The brown head is made up of very small, tightly packed bubbles. Although the retention isn't great, as the head fades fairly quickly, it does leave behind some lacing. Not bad for such a high ABV beer.
The aroma is great. Loads of bourbon, hints of wood, a little bit of char. Chocolate and coffee notes are also prevalent.
The flavor is almost identical to the aroma, with a little bit more heat added in from the alcohol. Loads of chocolate and some brown sugar and molasses lead things off, as well as a little bit of coffee flavor. I would describe the coffee flavor as closer to a “mocha with cream” than a straight “black” coffee. There is also a healthy dose of tobacco in there. The next characteristics are more barrel-focused, including lots of bourbon. I would say the bourbon is the most pronounced flavor in Parabola. In addition to the bourbon there is a noticeable amount of char and a touch of spicy oak. There is also bits of vanilla and coconut, and although I could honestly be mistaken about either of those, but probably not both of them. The finish is fairly hot, maybe even a little bit hotter than I would like, but it isn't overwhelming.
Parabola is huge and creamy, with great carbonation and body for the style; overall the mouthfeel is excellent despite the heat at the finish.
I've tried Parabola a few times, and I've really enjoyed it every time. Although big stouts that are really hot tend to turn me off, Parabola still worked for me. Very complex, and although the barrel flavors are huge, so is the malt bill. Overall, Parabola is a little hot, but still a great beer. 1,696 charactersHojaminbag, Jan 18, 2012
3.95/5  rDev -13%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3A- Thick creamy emulsive head of deep chocolatey brown. We are talking long lasting, low frothing from carbonation, sticky lacing. Very appreciable and inky dark. No fake out edges, no almost stout appearance. This is Steee-out!
S- This smells like cheap espresso, but its delightful. I don't need no starbucks, intelligentsia "shi shi" coffee aroma today. This nails it. You couldn't mistake espresso if it came up and bit you in the ass. Sweet lactose sugar makes me think of a nice latte. There is a bit of sharpness to the back end. Like a middle of the road spirit. A bit of darkened fruit, similar to dried cranberries. There is the bitterness of crushed beans that have oxidized for a week or so. Altogether, very enjoyable.
T- Oo, biting alcohol. Its bitter, sharp, and a tad bit hot. Is that bourbon sweetness on the opening? Like a... earthen sucrose and brown sugar mix? The bitterness is both in acrid burnt grain but also in black coffee. Nothing superb or complex, just a cup of joe you could throw together on Saturday morning with the right effort.
So, initially its a smash of alcohol harshness, followed by sweet dark fruits. Plums and cranberries. After that is a noticeable roast flavor, but its all about old coffee flavors in terms of bitterness. Its like an aged coffee stout without all the flavors dropping off. 8 months? Not sure how to gauge this one. There is lactose sweetness that perks up occasionally. The finish is what you would expect. Bitter grains and coffee grounds.
M- Like before harsh alcoholic flavors, 10-12% burn. Biting bitterness. The creamy opening can be attributed to the carbonation being low, well placed. It helps attenuate some of the alcoholic problems. Sticky flavors and an overall creamy but medium body present an altogether tasty beverage.
Good, not great. Would drink again, but it really goes downhill after the first two senses are tickled.
Coffee RIS? Barrel Aged Coffee RIS? I don't think I've had this one, and if I have its been a long time since I have had it.
Reveal is... Parabola! Oh cool! This is nothing like I expected it to be. After loving Abacus and XIV and XV this should have been amazing.. Kind of dissappointed, but still a good drinking beer regardless. 2,241 charactersKhazadum, Jan 17, 2012

S= From the nose you get bourbon right off the bat however it's a little more complex because you also get chocolate,coffee, and peaty malt.
T= Much like the nose you can tell that this was aged in bourbon barrels you get hints of chocolate and coffee in the aftertaste.
M= Syrupy, oily/greasy with very low carbonation.
O= Overall I thought this was a great beer and could really drink this anytime. I really enjoyed it and I'm glad I got the chance to try this wonderful beer. 563 charactersLiquidBread219, Jan 16, 2012

4.85/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Jet, jet black and pours like motor oil. Very thin, fine head of bubbles across the top. Deep rich and roasted aroma. Rather boozey but in a good way. Really reeks of bourbon. Just a big old hunk of rich roasted and bourbon flavor. I was not expecting it to be this rich. Nothing wrong with that though. Vanilla, oak and some sherry notes. Dark chocolate and expresso all over the place as well. Sharp bite from the booze, though it almsot comes as a kick off the barrel aging process, not the beer itself. Thick and syrupy rich body. A touch of an acrid burn but that's definately part of the whole body. A total complete desset beer. I could not finish this is one sitting and am enjoying it again a 2nd day. I have a bottle from last year to enjoy. Will stay a want for sure. Killer beer all in. 798 characterslackenhauser, Jan 15, 2012

A: Pours a super dark oily brown with a thin mocha head. This beer has some serious legs on it. It coats the glass in a thin greasy film. Very little lacing as it drinks. This beer looks great.
S: I’m picking up some bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, and some really nice roasted notes. This beer begs to be sipped. And I shall oblige.
T: This beer starts off a bit sweet with a blast of raisins, but the dark malt and bourbon come to the forefront right after. There are mixed flavors of vanilla, chocolate, caramel, oak, and maybe a little bit of coffee. This beer is legit.
M: Full bodied beer. This brew is sweet, silky, and coating. The flavors linger on the palate for a bit. I'm loving the smoothness of this beer.
O: This beer is damn tasty. All of the aspects are top notch. I’m really diggin’ on the smell and taste of this beer. It’s a wonderfully easy drinking brew. 963 characterstrxxpaxxs, Jan 12, 2012

I can not understand how there are 28 beers that are rated higher than this on the top 100. I have tried several of the beers that are rated higher, and I just don't see it. 
A- Black with copper head 
S- Coffee, dark chocolate, cherries, roasted malts, vanilla 
T- Oh my goodness. I was in love with the first taste. I actually got in my car quickly and went and bought the other two that were left at the store before I finished it. Coffee and bitter chocolate are the primary flavors- but not overpowering coffee. It is sweet too, with a lot of cherry and vanilla. 
M- This is my favorite body. Flat, thick, stays in your mouth. 
O- Like I said, a perfect beer. I always take value into account when doing overall, and even though I spent $14 on these, I think it is a great value for this beer 909 charactersStoryOfTheGhost, Jan 09, 2012

It pours a really sexy jet black color, thick viscous motor oil like texture as it fills the glass with a nice thick foamy caramel colored head on top which dissipates rather quickly leaving a nice ring of caramel color along the rim of the glass and a slight film at the top of the glass. The aroma is great, mild bourbon, definitely cut down from aging, strong tobacco and chocolate are big players with faint bitter coffee at the end. The flavors are superb, bourbon up front with smooth creamy chocolate right at the front, coffee is in there but muted as a result of aging, with tobacco playing a major role but definitely at the back end with some vanilla and toffee flavors as well. The body is unreal, silky, creamy, full and chewy, bold and viscous, perfect for the style and takes this to another level.
Verdict: Easily one of the best stouts I've ever had, and one of the best barrel aged beers of any style I've had. If you are fortunate enough to come across this vintage or the 2011 vintage, make a point to try this, you won't be let down. 1,178 characterskevanb, Jan 06, 2012

The taste is just like the aroma, which is very nice indeed. The chocolate and dark roasted malt are up front, and the raisins, figs, bourbon, oak, and vanilla play a solid supporting role. I have had this in the cellar for a while, so I am guessing that this helped to tone down the alcohol heat.
Full bodied, rich, somewhat creamy, and smooth. As mentioned earlier, there is some alcohol heat, but it has been toned down after sitting in the cellar, and this is drinking real nice. A very nice RIS from Firestone Walker. 713 charactershardy008, Jan 06, 2012

Review from notes..
Poured pitch black with no light getting through this stout! Produced 1 finger of creamy tan head... pretty decent retention. The head worked its way down to a thin film and left no lacing.
The aroma produced great notes of bourbon, milk chocolate, dark chocolate, vanilla and oak... possibly some coffee and graham cracker as well. This stout smells AMAZING!
Taste follows the nose. Amazingly smooth and very delicious!
Full in body with just the right ammount of carbonation. Velvety smooth and if I definitely remember getting a boner while drinking this. Awkward....
To put it simply, this stout was amazing. One of the best BBA stouts that I've had. 732 charactersdcloeren, Jan 04, 2012

4.52/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5650 mL bottle poured into my CBS snifter. Split three ways. 2011 bottle.
Appearance - Standard imperial stout look. Black body with a small khaki head. Poor retention, but it's 12.5%, so yeah. Sticky looking as it swirls in the glass. Looks like it could be a sugar bomb.
Smell - A lot of barrel. Not all bourbon, though. Along with the bourbon is a fair dose of vanilla and some hops from the stout. Some of the stout comes through, but it's mostly barrel.
Taste - Wow. Vanilla and bourbon up front followed seamlessly by chocolate and coffee roasted malts. Hefty hop bitterness, but not excessive. Adds complexity and a nice bite that reminds me that it is indeed an RIS. Really spectacular flavor.
Mouthfeel - Thick, but not a hint of sweetness. Low carbonation, but not sluggish to drink. Coats the mouth and the hop bitterness lingers without being intrusive.
Overall - A wonderful stout. I need more of this. A welcome change from some of the sugar bombs I've had lately. 982 charactersAlieniloquium, Jan 03, 2012

T: It tasted like rich dark chocolate and oak and vanilla, with roasted coffee and brown sugar and cream and toasted coconut. It had a clean and bittersweet aftertaste, with some alcohol warming.
M: It was oily with moderate carbonation. Pretty full and slick body.
D: This was a very nice and refined bourbon stout, with delicious scent and taste, and very nice body. The alcohol wasn't bad, so it wasn't difficult to drink. But some age would probably help improve this. Still very good fresh. Recommended. 718 charactersPencible, Jan 02, 2012

Scent is coconut, bourbon and chocolate with nutty and sweet molasses notes. Understated nose - takes some concentration to discern.
Taste is coconut, dark and milk chocolates, vanila, soft oaky wood smoke flavors. Figs, dates and dark sweet fruits. Black strap molasses.
Mouth is outrageously creamy, thick and coating. Rolling it in my mouth it feels weighty and nearly viscous. Alcohol hidden very well for a 12.5% beer. 
Balance is fantastic. This is a complex and well crafted stout that drinks like a great big milkshake of a beer. Love it. 667 characterssethmeister, Dec 31, 2011

appearance: Gorgeous darkest brown. Thick fudge head.
smell: Wow, I hate to use the word subtle on such a complex nose. In this case, it's a compliment, an easy going but amazing nose. Where to begin. Nothing takes front and center, but a big team of equal contributors. There's soft, dark chocolate, a hint of coconut, vanilla, bourbon, and oak. If ever there was a beer milkshake....
taste: More goodness. Not as awesome as the nose, but a delicious beer.
Left the preceding sentence in place, but as this masterpiece warms, each sip gets better and better, much like the Abacus my best friend generously shared with me. Upped from a 4.5 to a 5.
overall: Beer at it's best. Thankfully my wonderful wife picked up 6 bottles so I have those to age and enjoy.
5/26/13: Landed some batch 4 and just as awesome as 1 and 2 (missed out on 3). Drinking a 2 year old batch 2 cellared for a couple of years now. Damn. Thank you Firestone Walker and carry on you awesome masters. 1,023 characterscindyjeffsmith, Dec 30, 2011

Had this again on 2017-07014 in Columbia, PA from a 2017 12 oz bottle.  Reduced the taste rating from 4.75 to 4.5 because of the anise/licorice flavor, which I am very sensitive too and I don't like black licorice candy.
A - Dark brown/black with a slight tan head. Plenty of alcohol legs but little lacing.
S - Bourbon, peaty malt, chocolate, coffee and lots of alcohol.
T - Some bourbon, roasted coffee, toasted coconut, vanilla, sweet/dark chocolate, nutty, oak, light anise, deep-dark fruit, anise, alcohol. Mostly roasted bitterness. Aftertaste is more of the same with lots of lingering deliciousness. A great big barrel of tasting fun! 
M - Syrupy, thick body and very light carbonation.

Pouring into a Fifty Fifty Eclipse snifter. Black in color with a 1 finger medium-tan foam that retains partially. Strength evidenced by the sticky legs. 
Toasted oak, dark bittersweet chocolate. Booziness is present and a bourbon-character is also notable but not overly harsh. 
Beautiful marriage of dark, bittersweet chocolate, burnt caramel, charcoal, and espresso. Touch of vanilla. Medium-high/high bitterness level stemming from hops and the dark roasted malts. Lingering dark chocolate and earthiness in the toasted oak finish. 
Medium-full in body with a moderate level of carbonation. Fantastic warming sensation, ultra-smooth on the heat. 
Overall this is an absolutely wonderful choice to pop open on Christmas Eve Eve. Deliciously dangerous complexity, excellent marriage of roasty/barrel aged flavors. Firestone knocked it out of the park here and I can only wonder what additional age might do to enhance/detract from a stellar beer today. 1,033 charactersBrewerB, Dec 24, 2011

Batch 002
Bottle 2011
A- Pours a pitch black color, nice carbonation comes off the bottom of the glass, opaque cannot see through it, nice dark brown 1 finger head that dissipates to a thin layer around the glass. Nice lacing on the side of the glass as well.
S- Alcohol is present right away in the aroma, I can smell the oak from the barrels as well, the bourbon is not as apparent as I remembered from the first time I had it, slight vanilla notes, slight coffee presence.
T- Wow, Really impressive, well balanced, the bourbon is well balanced with the roasted coffee notes, vanilla comes out chocolate/cocoa notes, oak/wood notes from the barrels, really complex, love this beer.
M- Big mouth feel, coats the palate, smooth drinking, crisp finish, dry aftertaste.
O- World class beer, wow, I’ve had this beer before when it first came out. From hearing all the stories about FW beers not aging well I was expecting this beer to have lost some of its complexity, but the beer is still as good as the first time I had it. Very satisfying, everything I love and crave in a quality Bourbon Barrel Aged beer. Glad I have two bottles left to have on a cold winter day. 1,231 charactersChriscrundwell12, Dec 22, 2011

I very much like the way the 13% abv edges have been smoothed out and the Bourbon flavors have become integrated into the beer. Definitely noticeable Bourbon notes, but it doesn't dominate the beer, and it's become oh so smooth. Pours inky black and viscous with a thin brown rim of a head and some legs on the glass. Nice aromas that present as a seamless whole- outstanding notes of licorice, vanilla, bourbon, and molasses. The taste is even better- really nice bourbon notes coupled beautifully with roasted notes, dark chocolate, licorice, and a slight woodiness than underlines the beer. Wonderful stuff. Absolutely silky in the mouth, with the sense of having swallowed some excellent drinking chocolate laced with good quality whiskey. Thoroughly enjoyed this, and I'm glad I was patient enough to wait. 923 charactersGeorgiabeer, Dec 21, 2011

A- Pours thick syrupy black. Very thing brown head. Really had to get aggressive to get a little from it.
S- Started out really strong with the bourbon. Let it warm a bit and vanilla creeps though. Roasted notes with some coffee hints mixed in. Once you get past the bourbon at first, pretty nice. 
T- Nice roasted malts pop out first. Coffee undertones throughout the drink. Some chocolate flavors in the middle. Vanilla here and there. Bourbon really compliments the flavors nicely. Pretty smooth drink!
M- Full body. Low carbonation. A little syrupy, maybe a touch creamy. 
O- Was a little nervous at first with big bourbon nose to it. Once it warmed flavors really did blend together very nicely!! Was expecting a little more from the flavors, but wow they really all go together great and make for a great beer. Thanks guys, can't wait to age them a bit more. 999 charactersHosP, Dec 20, 2011

Score: 97
2011 vintage bottle shared and served in a snifter glass.
Appearance: Jet black, opaque with subtle ruby highlights at the top of the body. Pours a thin, bubbly, mocha-colored head that settles into a ring around the glass. Pretty good lacing for a 12.5% ABV beer. A very attractive looking Russian Imperial Stout. 4.5/5
Smell: Soft notes of vanilla and oak up front. There is lots of vanilla and oak, but it is not in-your-face-strong. Figs, raisins and cherries pretty apparent too. Creamy chocolate. Some really mellow bourbon notes and a little molasses. Touch of booziness. Very complex and balanced aroma. 4.5/5
Taste: Very smooth, nuanced, complex and balanced! No single flavor is in your face, but there are a lot of different, noticeable flavors here. Brown sugar and creamy, unsweetened chocolate hit first. Then lots of dark fruits. Tons of fig and raisin sweetness on the mid-palate. Vanilla and oak, a little dark rum towards the end. Some bourbon and molasses in the finish with a little alcohol warmth. As the beer layers, I am detecting hints of roasted nut. Plum comes out too, and more bourbon as it layers. More unsweetened chocolate in the finish as it layers. This one is absolutely delicious, and boy does it linger! 5/5
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, thick and oily. Quite viscous, with the perfect level of carbonation. Finish is slightly sweet. 4.5/5
Overall: An absolute flavor bomb that is incredibly balanced. The bourbon builds up as it layers, but neither it nor the dark-fruit sweetness of the beer ever overwhelm. Can't wait to see how age affects this brew.
Recommendation: An absolute must-try beer for all. Not too intense for casual beer drinkers, and loaded with enough complex flavors for even the most jaded beer geek. This is a brew that lives up to its hype. Bottom line: seek this one out.
Pairings: A well-aged steak. This is a special beer that should be paired with a classy meal. Probably would pair well with a fancy warm chocolate cake. Colleen, I'm looking at you.
Cost: $17.99 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle. 2,200 charactersjegross2, Dec 19, 2011

A: Pours a very dark brown coming out but looks completely deep black in the glass. Very still with a small wispy brown head that dissipated rapidly. No lace and only a thin ring remained throughout. Bubbles surfaced with a few swirls but this is very still, dark and mysterious looking.
S: Rich milk chocolate up-front, mature bourbon, wood, honey and vanilla. Towards the back of the aroma is a vanilla wafer cookie aroma that really wraps up all the flavors nicely. It's somewhat sweet but has a nice barrel aged appeal to it, hopefully this translates well to the taste.
T: Slightly bitter chocolate notes are the first thing to hit your palate, followed with a nice bourbon element. The caramel and roasted dark malts show up midway, along with slight tannins. The back end is a bit bitter with a dry, woody finish. This is really nice and does a great job at balancing the stout qualities with the barrel treatment flavors.
M: Good carbonation, smooth and somewhat creamy though I would have liked a bit thicker of a mouth feel. There's a nice touch of heat in the throat and chest, too.
Parabola was really good, it had a wonderful balance between the base beer and the bourbon barrel elements. I enjoy a strong bourbon presence and this certainly had one, it just wasn't overwhelming and that's okay. This is a great showcase of the style. Best ever? No, but pretty damn good. 1,581 charactersShanePB, Dec 19, 2011

Thankfully, this is not one of those. This one has been tamed by a year in a barrel.
A: Black with a tan head. Leaves a thin ring around the glass and has a nice leg.
S: Big alcohol aroma, like a barrel-aged sherry. Hints of molasses, licorice, roasted nut and dark sponge toffee.
T: The alcohol is up front, but in an extremely pleasing way... like a fine port or sherry. Plenty of molasses, bakers chocolate, light licorice, a little rum, vanilla, sponge toffee, roasted nut, solid bitterness. Well done.
M: Well-attenuated, moderate-to-full body, modest carbonation, slightly oily, hint of roasted acidity, drying alcohol finish.
D/O: A divine sipper. A beer this big really does need some age, they used a barrel... and they did it well. 
Now I wish I had saved this for my 2000th review. What an epic brew.

A- The bottle claims its midnight black. Who am I to argue. No ruby opaqueness noted to light. The head is a thick tan coloration. No retention is noted. Wafts of lacing mark my glass. The beer looks pretty nice.
S- The aroma of the beer is bruelled figs, burnt sugar, vanilla, chared darkly roasted malt cocoa almost to the espresso level. Major loads of bourbon. This just keeps getting more complex as I continue to drink.
T- Nearly perfect delivery of darkly roasted and burnt malts. Vanilla and figs combine with cocoa and majore loads of bourbon. This kind of reminds me of bourbon balls. The beer has the dark roasted malt tones I am hoping for in an RIS. Instead of heading into the region of ashy flavors this one rounds out with burnt sugar notes. Very complex and keeps getting better as the beer warms.
M- This beer is full bodied. The carbonation levels are perfect. Flavors are long lasting and well done. Only flaw I can find is a the alcohol is a little too hot. 
O- I am enjoying this beer alot. Really wishing I had a few more bottles to let them cellar for a few years. This beer is almost as good as a RIS can be. 1,299 charactersnlmartin, Dec 10, 2011

The aroma hits you with a lot of chocolate and bourbon notes, as well as some roasted malts. The taste is very chocolatey with a touch of bourbon and vanilla and finishes with roasted malts. The mouthfeel is thick bodied with decent carbonation, and has a smooth and creamy texture.
Overall, a very good beer from Firestone that will get better with time when some of the heat from the 12.5% alcohol dies down. 526 charactersmkotsayfan, Dec 09, 2011

Pours thick and black with an inch of dense dark tan head.
Aroma is strong, deep and malty. Roasted dark and chocolate malts dominate but there is some nice balance of dank hops in the mix as well. Dark cherries, oak wood, dark chocolate and leather add complexity. Bourbon comes through more as it warms.
Taste is quite dark and malty. Heavy but not too heavy on the roast, with lots of oak and dark chocolate. Good coffee and a welcomed booziness that is reasonably tame for the sheer size of this brew. That bourbon flavor is welcomed here in its modesty, a characteristic that is often too pronounced in these bourbon barrel aged stouts.
Very full body, extremely smooth and creamy. A pleasure to drink. Lasting dark malty finish.
This beer is drinking great right now and I'm not certain that cellaring it further would enhance it. Hats off to Firestone, another delicious dark and strong beer. Among the best I've had! 1,017 charactersibbjamin, Dec 08, 2011

A: Dark dark black, almost opaque. When you sip, you can see a hint of reddish brown at the edges. Nice, surprisingly hefty dark tan head. Oh, and did I mention how thick this beer looks when it pours? I've had a fair few thick brews in my day, but this is one of the thickest pours I've seen in a while.
S: All the usual suspects are there: dark chocolate, roasted coffee notes, a bit of sweetness, more coffee, alcohol, and did I mention coffee? And alcohol. Kinda screams "hot mess". But there's something else there that I can't quite put my finger on. Hmmm...
T: Star anise, that's the mystery smell! And hot damn does it come out in the taste as well. I've never heard the term "licorice bomb", but this beer deserves it every bit as much as Stone's anise impy stout, although this beer does a better job of balancing it with other flavors, particularly a roastiness that almost reminds me of charcoal, along with the usual dark chocolate. Not much sweetness, though, which is fine by me-I prefer my stouts bitter rather than sweet. Still, I'd prefer it if the licorice wasn't quite so overpowering. Of course, the bourbon comes through as well, and here lies one of the strengths of this beer. It seems tough to get the bourbon to come through in a bold and distinct manner without overpowering the beer itself, but Firestone pulls it off well with this brew. Unfortunately, either from the bourbon or the high abv of this beer, the alcohol flavor is pretty strong as well. I actually like a light alcohol flavor more than most folks seem to, but this is a little much for me. Maybe some time will mellow it out a bit. Good thing I've got another bottle to age!
M: This is where this beer really shines. Just unbelievably thick and viscous. It coats the tongue well enough that you taste it for a while. Despite the generous head and nice lacing, the carbonation is barely noticeable, which works with the thick, creamy texture of the beer. This beer might have the best mouthfeel of any beer I've had excepting Caldera's Mowgli. Outstanding.
O: Maybe it's the hype, or the fact that I have such fond memories of the small sample I had a couple of years ago at the Portland International Beerfest, but this was a bit of a disappointment, though only a bit. It's still a great beer, but there are better beers out there that are both cheaper and easier to find. 2,426 characterseatabagofbooger, Dec 06, 2011

3.98/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into a clear pint glass. Paid $14.95 at Corvallis Brewing Supply, the most I have ever expended for any beer.
A-Pours a midnight black. Very dark. No light gets through this beauty. A two finger, dark tan head slowly recedes into a modest lace.
S-Alcohol from the bourbon barrels is the predominant aroma. Very fragrant. Vanilla and raisin notes are also present.
T-This is definitely a bourbon stout, and probably deserves its own style classification, as it is very different from non-bourbon barreled double stouts. I admit it is not my thing. Bourbon whiskey from 90 days aging in bourbon barrels is the most dominant flavor profile. However, there are some very nice stout beer flavors in the background like brown sugar, bittersweet chocolate, and dried fruits, especially raisins. Taste definitely improves as it warms, and becomes very sweet. The alcohol adds to the flavor rather than detracts from it. 
M-A bit too astringent from the alcohol and too thin for style, i.e., not nearly luxuriant enough.
O-This is a decent beer. Best enjoyed by sipping. Didn't live up to the hype for me. 1,129 charactersvelosuds, Dec 05, 2011

The beer pours a blackish brown color with good head retention and minimal lacing. In short, this looks like a beer that had seen considerable barrel aging (which I gather it has). On the nose, I get dark chocolate and bourbon, but not much more than that (surprisingly). On the palate, however, this beer is just killer, with considerable dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, licorice and light dry citrus... and a ton of bourbon (yum!). Although the beer is fairly sweet, there is enough dry bitterness to counter the sweetnees, making for one rich, over the top, flavorful RIS. Mouthfeel is long, rich and fairly sweet, with considerable licorice and dark chocolate in the finish. 
Just delicious, and a beer that I suspect will only get better with age. Impressive. 789 charactersJohn_M, Dec 03, 2011

Bomber poured into a tulip
A-- Poured black, one finger light brown/ sugar cane colored head. Decent retention. Little bit of spotty lacing, visible alcohol legs and bits of spotty lacing. 
S-- Sugar. Lots of sugar. Very little barrel notes, what was there was faint and short lived. Vanilla and coconut were faint and fleeting. More coffee and roasted malts mixed with lots of sugar. 
T-- Sweet dairy milk, sugar, more sugar. Somewhat thick and smooth. 
M-- Feel and carbonation are perfect. Good body. Sugar is much more toned down in the feel and more about chocolate and malts. Have to note had BA Yeti before having this and the barrel notes in BA Yeti were much more obvious in every respect. 
O-- Decent sweet beer. was it really aged in a barrel?? That was my biggest question. Bottle says so, so I have to concur. Really disappointed but as a straight RIS it was OK. 929 charactersmulder1010, Dec 01, 2011

Poured into a miniature snifter. Pours a deep, dark black with ruby highlights around the glass. A deep, coffee/mocha head rests on top of the brew. Really awesome looking.
The nose on this thing is INSANE. Gobs and gobs of vanilla play on the bourbon notes in a ridiculously great way. Holy wow. 
The taste is absolutely excellent with the dark chocolate playing nicely off of the bourbon and vanilla flavors. Tobacco, and other leathery notes are in there as well. Extremely complex and incredibly enjoyable. 
The mouthfeel compliments the beer to a T while being thick and viscous but with enough carbonation to keep the beer from being overwhelming. 
A homerun by Firestone Walker. Just wow. One of the best BA stouts I've ever had and probably ever will have. 825 charactershippityhops85, Dec 01, 2011

Pours a deep brown/black with a tan coloured head of foam that formed up well when agitated and left a bit of dripping lacing as it receded into a crown around the edges of the glass.
Smell was very sugary, took a while for toasted coconut to appear and when it did it was lovely, but only stayed around for a couple of minutes, before the sugar came back.
Taste was cane sugar, plenty of it. Very sweet and one dimensional. Not a lot of barrel could be detected. This surprised me given the world of flavours i've come across in some of their other big beers like 13 and Abacus.
Mouthfeel was ok, decent body and the sweetness didn't really become cloying.
Having had this straight after Barrel Aged Yeti, it didn't come close. I know FW make awesome beers, but this seemed like it had lost a lot of the complexity that i know it probably had. 963 charactersMrKennedy, Nov 28, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Pours stout black, coffee colored head is slow to form. Body appears to be quite viscous. 
S: Big sugary bourbon bite is my first impression of the nose. Milk chocolate thrown in for good measure. Subtleties exist under the layers of whiskey and chocolate; vanilla and oak are big players. 
T: No surprises here, pretty much follows the nose with bourbon and chocolate. Coffee and vanilla round out mid sip. Finish is sweet overall, with a woody tannin note that sort of stuck out for me. Alcohol is well masked. 
M: Thick, supportive of the flavor profile. Carbonation is on the low side of medium.
O: A nice BA stout, held back slightly by what I perceived as an off note in the finish. 695 characterszoolzoo, Nov 28, 2011

Roasty malt up front with a nice bourbon and oak aroma. Nothing overly powerful, all is blended well. Hints of dark chocolate with a whiff of alcohol. 
Milk chocolate and cocoa notes up front. Roasty flavors are light. Smooth bourbon and oak notes, without drying tannins. 
Medium body, lower carbonation. Everything here is balanced to perfection. Very little warmth from the alcohol. Outstanding. 497 charactersBierguy5, Nov 27, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to cbeer88 for this bottle in the US/Canadian BIF.
Poured in to CBS Snifter.
A - Poured a thick dark black with a small amount of light brown head. 
S - Huge bourbon, oak and vanilla aromas are present up front. Some light cocoa notes are evident in the background but the barrel aging characteristics are definitely dominate the nose. 
T - The barrel aging is evident up front - the bourbon, oak and vanilla notes that were evident in the nose are abundant in the palate. There are other subdued flavours in the background, specially cocoa and charred malts. Despite the barrel aging qualities dominating the palate, this is still an excellent and very complex beer and the entire bomber was gone before I even realized it. 
M - Full bodied. Thick and viscous. Light carbonation. A perfect mouth feel. 
O - An excellent beer. I was able to track down another bottle to age and I am looking forward to trying this one a year down the road. 951 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Nov 27, 2011

A: Poured black almost oily with very little head. Some lacing on the glass.
S: sweet with hints of oak and coffee.
T: Initially strong dark fruit/raisin flavors. As the beer warmed up a bit I got dark chocolate, roasted coffee and hints of vanilla. Amazing complexity and drinkability as the beer opened up. 
M: The colder it was the more syrupy sweet it stuck in my mouth, almost cloying. As the beer warmed up it become much smoother.
Overall great beer, wish I could get my hands on another bottle. 540 characterspoibag808, Nov 27, 2011
4.34/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5No. 002, 2011. Black with just the faintest of dark brown edges. Brown, soapy bubbles formed a collar while extremely fine bubbles coated the surface of the beer. Decent head retention with a bit of spotty lacing that wasn't too sticky. Bourbon was evident as soon as the cap was popped. Boozy aroma with vanilla and oak apparent, notes of toffee and coconut, roast and chocolate, faint licorice and figs. Great texture, full without being heavy, moderate carbonation that provided an airy mouthfeel, a bit of astringency from the kilned grains and wood, slightly sticky. Alcohol started warm and ended a little hotter, but still well controlled. Nice depth of bitterness, both from hops and the dark grains. This worked well with the considerable malt presence, toffee and chocolate sweetness, roast and light licorice. Quite oaky as well, vanilla throughout, with plenty of bourbon character. Unfortunately, the prominence of the wood and bourbon in the flavour seemed to mask some of the complexity present in the aroma. Overall, a very strong offering from a great brewery. 1,077 charactersDrJay, Nov 26, 2011

Smell is of dark bakers chocolate, vanilla beans, sugary rum, bourbon, and intense caramel. Sheesh! I could smell this all afternoon.
Taste is of the aromas with a fine sipping version of caramel, vanilla, and cocoa. Obvious bourbon influence on amwell done imperial stout. Hells yeahs!
Mouthfeel is a tad boozy, as expected, full bodied, chewy, with a resonating sugar cookie and chocolate chip finish. 550 charactersweeare138, Nov 26, 2011

The smell of the beer was roasted and sweet, some aromas of wood and sweet bourbon on the nose. The taste of the beer is just stunning... I really couldn't believe how nice this tasted. The sweet bourbon flavors come out perfectly in this brew. The mouthfeel of this beer was thick and oily just like it should be. Overall this brew is special.

poured into Bruery tulip
Color: This beer is a solid deep dark brown to almost black. A dime sized tan ring forms at top of this brew. A nice amount of lacing is left on the glass and the head retention is very limited.
Nose: Complex! At first sniff you get the vanilla in this beer followed by the coffee and beautiful bourbon aromas rising from the glass. There is also the smell of bitter dark chocolate and roasted malts, truly a great smelling brew. Gets better as it warms by the way.
Palate: Explosive and layered. This beer is extremely drinkable and the carbonation is spot on. As this beer hits your taste buds and sits on your tongue you realize how wonderfully crafted this beer is. The taste of vanilla and bourbon dance the tango in your mouth, its beautiful, yet rough and sophisticated. Then comes the coffee and with it brings tobacco and velvety bitter chocolate. All these textures are present and invited. This is the wow portion of this beer.
Finish: Warm, full bodied, and extremely complex. A wonderful example of the usage of barrels with stouts. Firestone keep up the good work, this beer is a gift to all beer lovers!

I have been aging this for about 6 months
Pours a viscous pitch black with 1/4 finger of mocha colored head. A little bit of spotty lacing on the glass.
First thing I notice in the aroma is a metallic smell- must be from the hops. Upon further inspection, I get lots of barrel aromas- oak, vanilla, charcoal- followed by caramel, chocolate, and a little coffee.
Parabola is very rich and decadent. Feels like a meal in glass and I am drinking the whole bomber by myself. Very sweet- the flavors are dominated by vanilla, caramel, maple syrup, and milk chocolate. There is also plenty of oak in the flavor profile along with a bit of coffee and bourbon on the finish. I wouldn't say it is boozy though.
Mouthfeel is pretty slick, oily, and creamy. Somewhat chewy but, a little thinner than some other barrel aged stouts I have had. 
Overall, too sweet to finish the whole bomber myself. 903 charactersDubber55, Nov 20, 2011

 Jet black with a sheet of dark brown bubbles for the head. Hardly any lacing but the beer itself clings to the glass sip upon sip. Certainly "strong" looking.
 Aroma is mostly vanilla and bourbon. Some alcohol here and there, nothing fusel though. Taste is signature -bal stout: slightly sweet with notes of vanilla, slightly acidic with a powerful roasty and woody finish and lingering roast on the palate. While not a coffee stout, the aftertaste is very close to chewing on a roasted coffee bean.
 Certainly warming in its strength with a medium body among similar examples. The carbonation is too high for my liking. Another flaw, in my opinion, is the excessive wood. Whisky sits in a barrel to get mellow; the effect of barrels on this beer seems to be the exact opposite. Not that I mind an intense beer but Parabola sometimes feels like wood and vanilla, and nothing more.

It has the color of something you'd regret drinking in 2003. Ruby edges, and nothing deep; reminding of that shitty home brew you had in 2002 that was super awesome at the time. Smells like booze and brownies. By booze I mean 2am shots of cheap bourbon. Not exactly pleasant, but super fun and something you'll do again. It tastes like bad sex. It was good, fun, and something you'll revisit. But it's not an ass you wanna stick your tongue up. 467 charactersSkunkdrool, Nov 17, 2011

4.22/5  rDev -7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Serving: 22oz bottle, marked 2011. 12.5% abv. Into a brandy snifter. I'm judging this as a young beer.
A: Poured black as night, absolute darkness, no transparency whatsoever. No head to speak of, a thin foam of brownish white head that disappeared immediately.
S: Wow. Strong sweet presence - vanilla, wood, lots of alcohol. Alcohol is strongest character.
T: Not as impressive as the smell, or at least not as complex. Alcohol can be felt my throat as the beer is swirled in my mouth. Very slight roast, heavy sweetness, lots of boozy alcohol. I wouldn't call the booze unpleasant, it's to be expected in a beer this big. Some little bit of wood, some slight vanilla and very very sweet notes. Bitterness on the backend, leaves almost a dry mucky feeling on the tongue.
M: It's thinner than expected, considering that by using a gravity calculator ,if the bottle is accurate at 29.5 deg plato starting gravity, that's approx 1.035 final gravity, which SHOULD be a thick slop. So based on that I'm guessing there's some off numbers. Regardless, it's thinner than expected, leaving a bitter taste on my tongue at the end. It's not as thick as say, Deschutes Abyss, but it's oddly as filling. 
O: Well, hrm. I had huge expectations of this beer, based on my opinion of Firestone Walker, the reputation it has, and the price tag. I'm also unfairly judging it against Abyss, which I consider the best beer I've ever had (which is a substantial statement). That said, this beer disappointed a bit. A good beer? Yeah. It didn't blow me away. At $14 I expected a bit more - I understand production costs, especially on aged beers. The nose implied a much better palate, but it was a bit of a letdown, lots of hot alcohol, a bitter strange finish that wasn't as satisfying. 1,771 charactersPainkeepBrewing, Nov 10, 2011

S: Heavy chocolate aroma with malt and hops in the background. It is one of the best aromas that a beer can have.
T: Awesome. There are chocolate, malt, hops. The balance is rivaled by none.
M: Thick as tar but it is not that carbonated.
O: Amazing beer. Well worth the price. You absolutely need to have this beer a the benchmark for stouts. 455 charactersjvillefan, Nov 10, 2011
4.07/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Beer enjoyed with aasher. Poured into new belgium snifter with a quarter-inch of mocha head that leaves a little lacing. Beer almost has a cherry color to it, rather then the jet-black color that i expected.
Smells like dark chocolate and toffee with some hickory. Any smell of alcohol that is on the nose is slighty masked by the chocolate.
Chocolate immediately hits the palate with lots of coffee and lots of alcohol on the tail end
the transition from dark chocolate to lots of alcohol doesnt make for the best mouthfeel on this beer, and the 82 ibus are starting to make sense
Overall i was pretty impressed with this beer, but it didnt quite matchup to some of the other stouts ive had. Def a sipper, and i appreciate it for that reason 746 characterszep9865, Nov 10, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 42011 vintage courtesy of BrewerB, thanks Brian! This beer pours a medium bodied dark chocolate brown in color with a one finger dark kahki head. It smells of sweet milk chocolate, dark chocolate, roasted malts, sweet vanilla, toffee and creamed coffee. It tastes of bitter chocolates, coffee with cream, a lot of oak, and bourbon. It's a pretty well integrated blend. It drinks very smoothly and isn't as viscous as a lot of imperial stouts. It's overly drinkable for the style and pretty approachable. The bourbon is there but kind of mellow. If I were to not pick I'd say it could he stronger but its not a big deal. Overall this is a fine beer and definitely worth trying. Kudos to FW for making this so available. 717 charactersaasher, Nov 10, 2011
3.35/5  rDev -26.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Revision on 11/5/2011: Batch 001 has simply fallen off a cliff. Less heat, but simpler flavors. I am no longer optimistic about Batch 002 improving. In fact, I'm disappointed: a recipe change that results in a beer I don't particularly enjoy fresh, and it doesn't age into something I enjoy later? Time to be honest with my score. I honestly don't plan to buy Batch 003. 
---
Batch 002 review from 6/7/2011. 
A: Pours a dark brown body (I'd call it an opaque black, but some light penetration at the edges makes it evident that that's not quite right). A finger of tan head leaves a nice collar on the edges. No lace. 
S: Dark chocolate, roasted coffee, earth, licorice, tobacco. Bourbon is muted. In reading over my comments for the previous batch, I'm surprised by how much the impressions are the same. They seem to have dialed in the recipe. It's a little hoppier than I remember from last time, though. 
T: Dark chocolate, roasted coffee, and an earthy, borderline green hoppy bitterness (Willamette?). The flavors work fairly well together, but I've never been a huge fan of bitterness in my barrel-aged imperial stouts, and I confess that I find it a distraction here. Flavors of tobacco and charred oak only accentuate the bitterness. Bourbon, licorice, and a mild presence of dark fruits (plums) are pleasant, as is the vanilla on the finish, but those are all weaker elements. There's a light spicy bite in the aftertaste. 
M: Medium-full bodied with low carbonation. It's creamy. Bitterness lingers on the palate. It's a little warm as far as ABV goes, with a bite to it. 
O: It's merely good right now. I suspect it will become better with time as the bitterness fades, but truthfully, I'm not that enthused about it. I wish they would use the old keg recipe.

Old review of Batch 001: 4 / 4 / 4.5 / 4.0 / 4.0 
Chilled bottle into a glass. Split with the girlfriend, who is becoming a connoisseur of expensive barrel-aged stouts. 
A: Pours a dark, not fully opaque, black body in the glass, with a finger of short-lived mocha head. Edge penetration shows ruby colors. 
S: Dark chocolate and roasted coffee in equal strengths, when cold. As it warms, the aroma gets more balanced brings out tobacco, earth, light anise, light bourbon, oak. 
T: The taste is big, but balanced (or at least, not as overwhelmingly bourbony as so many other barrel-aged impy stouts). The base beer shines through first in dark chocolate and roasted coffee flavors. The barrel kicks in later with a contribution of bourbon, tobacco, charred oak, vanilla. I pick up anise at times, but it's very light. I pick up some dark fruits lingering faintly behind all this, but I can't tell what they are. There is an underlying earthy bitterness that works well with the tobacco and oak to counteract the sweet flavors; at no point do I feel this beer is cloying. Parabola actually reminds me a lot of the 50/50 Eclipse (Heaven Hill). 
M: Full-bodied in flavor, though the body isn't uber-viscous. Low carbonation, giving it an overall coating, creamy presence. 
D: I paid $16, which is a fair price for a stout of this caliber. I would go no higher, though. I think some of the tannic and bitter flavors could stand to be toned down a bit, but I'm sure if I wait a few months the beer will hit its sweet spot for me. Right now it's not in the top-tier of barrel-aged stouts, but it's just on the cusp. 3,401 charactersArbitrator, Nov 06, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 Vintage
Appearance: Black (only appears very dark brown at the edges if held up to a light) has a 1/2" dark brown head which dissipated quickly. 
Smell: Mild Bourbon, vanilla, and coffee/roasted malt notes almost equally balanced. 
Taste: Bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate, and roast malts. The finish is fairly dry with just a hint of sweetness. Slight alcohol presence in the finish but very subtle for the ABV.
Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied with very subtle carbonation appropriate tor the style. 
Overall: My first time time trying this beer and I like it. Unfortunately the availability in Southern California isn't so hot compared to other RISs I would consider in it's class (e.g. Abyss). I would gladly seek it out at the price I paid if it were distributed in decent numbers to my area. 808 charactersIKR, Nov 05, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at The Bottle Room, Whittier. 9 oz pour
This is just about as black as black can get. No light gets through this one. Has a minimal brown head, if you can even call it that. Its more of a thin blanket that recedes to the sides of the glass. It leaves minimal, spotted lacing down the glass. The aroma on this one is amazing. A very strong vanilla presence, chocolate, espresso, dark fruits, and a nice touch of bourbon booziness. It smells sweeter and sweeter as it warms up as well. On to the taste test. Just as the nose described, really heavy tones of vanilla, bitter chocolate, coffee, oak, and booze. The boozy taste is by no means in the way. Its the perfect complement to the rich sweetness. Taste is just phenomenal and very complex, all of the flavors just seem to meld with each other perfectly. It has a very rich, thick, and creamy mouthfeel. Just phenomenal. I was very excited to try this, and very glad to say that this exceeds its hype. Being someone that is fairly new to BA Imperial Stouts, they are quickly becoming my new favorite style. Cheers. 1,074 charactersBrewtifulMind, Nov 05, 2011
4/5  rDev -11.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Notes from Hulmeville Inn Beer Geek BBQ July 2011
black as night. motor oily. no head on this baby, just thick, syrupy, viscous. it looks fatty actually.
smells like bourbon and a little rummy, some vanilla, coffee, milk chocolate, some lactic acidity, smoky, oaky, boozy. there's a sense of conflation in the complete aroma that is interesting.
the first sip is BOOMING: vanilla, coffee, wood, caramel, chocolate, oat, burnt wood, booze burn. the first gulp is leveling, however, subsequent sips are underwhelming in comparison. the flavors are good, but they're vigor seems to fade into the aforementioned conflation.
it's thick and rich and oily. it has a great deal of viscosity and creaminess on the front of the palate, but heading out, it finishes with a bitter, dry burn.
it's solid. a straight "good" across the board. the first impressions were impressive, but it didn't sustain its initiated characteristics enough to warrant an elite standing. i enjoyed it, but i'm definitely coming back to see if i'm just being picky and snooty from the hype. 1,062 characterspatm1986, Nov 04, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522oz bottle via Best Damn Brew Shop in San Diego, CA.
This is one of the best examples of a barrel aged beer i have come across to date. I rank it up there with BCS Rare and Angels Share. 
Appearance: Dark, dark black with just a think film of head and absolutely no lacing. Its beauty is apparent but no way indicative of what's to come.
Smell: Sweet, deep bourbon and caramel. Vanilla and butterscotch. Each notes evolves into deeper complexity as it warms. Smelling this beer soothes the heart while concurrently and quickening the pulse. 
Taste/Mouthfeel: Everything the nose had to offer but with the backdrop of wood, toffee, deep body, and some complex hop notes. The dark syrup coats the pallet and helps you to remember and anticipate the next sip. Small bubbles help to keep the flavor evolving as you hold it in your mouth. 
Overall: A top bourbon barrel beer with complex aromas and flavors. Just thinking of my experience with this beer makes me start to scheme as to how I can get more. 1,005 charactersMscarpen, Nov 04, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a snifter. Batch 2.
A - Black with a fast diminishing tan head. Looks quite carbonated actually.
S - Malt and bourbon. A little sweetness in the nose, almost a little fruity. Little hints of the oak in there as well. Get different aromas each time I go in.
T - First thought is balanced. The bourbon is well done with having it enhance the malt and roastiness, but not being overwhelming. The sweetness and oak of the barrels make for a long lasting aftertaste. So many tastes as it warms. Dark fruits, hints at chocolate and some bitter coffee flavors, but the sweetness seems to override that quite a bit. Very good.
M - The feel is pretty incredible all things considered. The heavy parts of the mouthfeel mostly come from the slight barrel, all the other flavors play and meld together, but stay silky smooth. Really one of the more easy drinking BA imperial stouts I've had.
O - As I drink this, I can't help but think of just how well made this is. Everything is so well balanced, the mouthfeel makes this very drinkable and the aroma is prevalent but not overbearing. The flavor is complex, inviting, and delicious. No part of this beer screams out and dominates, but the sum of the parts create an amazing beer and one that you can tell was well made. I could drink this every day. 1,320 charactersScrumtralecent, Nov 04, 2011

A: Pitch black, looks syrupy as I pour. Very small brown head that dissipates very quickly to a small lacing.
S: Smells a lot like a sweet bourbon. Vanilla and oaky with a roasty chocolate smell with a slight underlying hops.
T: Very oaky flavor throughout the flavor with a vanilla bourbon flavor upfront which finishes with a roasty chocolate flavor. Sweet yet dry with slight hops showing up. Very complex and balanced. I like this a lot.
M: Syrupy and thick with very little signs of carbonation. Leaves a nice coating on the tongue.
O: I like this a lot, it has a nice oak wood flavor with a nice vanilla spicy bourbon kick to it. The roasty malts and chocolate flavors finish fantastic. 748 characterskeanex, Nov 04, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to angrybabboon for splitting the bottle.
Appearance: Black, seriously black. Pours thinner than anticipated. Deep browns and reds when held to direct light. No head and no visible carbonation. It sits there like a big dark lake. So very still.
Smell: Bourbon! Vanilla and oak in good measure. Caramel and toffee as well, all from the bourbon. Malts are burnt and roasty. Cocoa and hours-old coffee in the back. Touch of char and smoke. Loads of vanilla. The malts are beefy enough to stand up to the high bourbon aroma.
Taste: Roasted malts hit up front and quickly lose ground to the bourbon. Vanilla, oak, lots of burnt malts. Drops cocoa and bourbon like a pro. Touches of char. Bourbon takes the forefron and pushes the malts to the back. Touches of citrus...hops? Great depth of flavors. Flavors meld perfectly. Bourbon is prevalent and in no way overpowering. Shockingly balanced for such a big beer. Some heat on the back.
Mouthfeel: Barrel aging thins it out a touch. Nice and full despite this. Super smooth.
Overall: One of the best applications of bourbon-barrel aging I've ever encountered. Smooth and well moderated. Tons of flavor and depth. Time will only smooth out some of the heat. Truly a great take on the style. 1,245 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Nov 04, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -6.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 422oz bottle courtesy of Ghettofabulous. 2011 Series. Into a Stone IRS glass. 
A: Pitch black with a few loose tan bubbles that almost form into a head. Completely opaque, no light penetrates this. With no head to speak of, there is of course no lacing to speak of. Definitely would look better with some semblance of a cap of foam. 
S: A get a lot of bourbon and oak from the initial smell with a fair amount of chocolate as well. A fair amount of caramel and toffee along with a lot of vanilla as well. As it warms a few notes of coffee and burnt malt really start to shine. Even a touch of hops in there, really a nice smelling stout. 
T: Absolutely huge here, tons of coffee and chocolate and caramel in the beer mix with a nice woody barrel and a ton of vanilla coming from the barrel as well. Fair amount of bitter burnt malt that almost verges on charred, but never quite gets there. Not overly hoppy, but there is a fair amount of hop resin in here, and a very nice amount of bitterness to counteract the sweet malt and liquor. Fair amount of brown sugar and molasses in here as well. A slightly astringent bit of booze on the finish. 
M: The mouth is just a bit off, right amount of body and thickness, but the carbonation is just a touch too high. Quite sweet and sticky on the lips, but the barrel helps to dry things up a touch. 
O: A very good imperial stout that is drinking excellently right now. I was fortunate enough to grab another bottle at a store in CO and I will be hanging on to it for another two or so months, as I'm really enjoying the way this tastes right now. 1,593 characterspokesbeerdude, Nov 04, 2011
3.8/5  rDev -16.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5On a dark and stormy night…actually, it’s pretty clear on this Halloween evening - it’s the Parabola in my glass that’s so dark and foreboding. I’m really glad that I have the chance to try this one out, especially living in Indiana; thank you once again to tripelhops, that badass trader.
Brewed approximately five months before the date of this tasting (June 2011 Vintage).
A: I have never seen a darker beer; there is literally no light shining through this. The texture looks thick as ever, adding substance to the darkness. The head is dark tan, pretty stable at a half-finger, with a superbly creamy look – looks silky smooth. Its pitch blackness gives the foam even more contrast, calling attention to an awesome shininess of the lacing as I swirl the glass. This one’s an eye-catcher, for sure.
S: Barrel-aged spirits are strong and upfront: vanilla, oak, brandy, woody bourbon. The alcohol is strong, fiery even in the nose. Malts are thick and creamy: bitter dark chocolate and graham cracker breadiness. Interesting aromas of baked desserts on the end: fresh-baked brownies and cinnamon apples. In all, it’s rich, with big emphasis of caramel and barrel-aged alcohol. Complex; lovely.
T: Fiery, roasted, and surprisingly bitter. The alcohol is huge, playing with the strong bitters to pull off some strange tastes: a bitter, herbal fruitiness of sherry, dark roasts (almost burnt at times), licorice, a slightly-off hop taste, and a medicinal alcoholic tinge. It’s a bitterness that I’m not sure I like, almost acrid or artificial-tasting. The roasts aren’t even that – they overwhelm what little coffee tastes are there with burnt barley. It throws the balance off a bit. The aftertaste is pretty peppery and dry, with a light vegetable taste. Was this beer aged in corn whiskey barrels? It has that kind of taste.
M: Oddly thin at times, but with a more-than-ample showing of carbonation. I’m not getting a mouth-coating texture, but there’s a good fiery feeling on the way down. Feels like an “RIS Light,” almost.
O: Well, it’s different, I’ll give it that. Maybe I got a bad bottle, but I didn’t think this beer was incredibly satisfying. I understand that new, interesting flavors are the goal, but sometimes they can expose the tastebuds to an unpleasant palate. So, as it stands, there’s a dozen other stout’s I’d have before this; I’m still open to tasting other bottles, though, just to make sure I’m not crazy. 2,485 charactersBarryMFBurton, Nov 01, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Received bottle in trade with a BA on the east coast. Having bought a bottle myself, I was surprised when it arrived without the box, and had sticky fingerprints on the outside of the bottle. Was concerned about possible handling issues, so with that in mind...
Poured from 22oz bottle into Bordeaux glass.
Bottled in 2011.
Aroma: Dark cherry (dark, fruity sweetness-not tart), anisette, vanilla, chocolate syrup, and a mild, boozy, bourbon note. I think I'm gonna like this one!
Appearance: Very dark brown/black with a brown halo around the outside where the liquid meets the glass. 1/2 finger head disappears to a ring of dark brown foam. Splotches of fine bubbles stick to the inside of the glass as it's tipped back with each sip.
Flavor: Smooth, rich dark chocolate. Dark cherry and fig. Toasted coconut, and sweet bourbon. A tad bit of an oxidized off-flavor, which may be coming from mis-handling of the bottle. Some enjoyable, mild peppery heat from the alcohol. 
Mouthfeel: Medium-low, creamy carbonation. Medium body, and a bit of boozy heat.
Overall: Off-flavor aside, I'm really impressed with this one, and look forward to trying one that's been properly cellared. This beer reminded me of Ivan the Terrible, which is probably the best imperial stout I've had. Can't wait to try it again, and highly recommend it! 1,333 charactersmdvatab, Oct 29, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bottle into a stemless red wine glass.
2011 vintage.
A: Pours a deep, dark, midnight black. Ruby highlights appear looking down at the beer from above. A tight ring of espresso colored head rises up and falls into a perfect churning circle. 
S: Beautiful nose. Smooth, round notes of vanilla and oak. Sugary maple aroma with some molasses and light bourbon heat. Char and smokey wood.
T: Aromas translate and carry over very clearly. Some lightly hot vanilla, almost extract like. Charred dark fruits with brown sugar and smokey caramel. Bourbon profile is smooth and very approachable, semi-sweet bakers chocolate and oak are all very well balanced.
M: Heavy body, but very drinkable in comparison to a lot of other barrel-aged stouts. Parabola carries a dangerous drinkability compared to, let's say Bourbon County Stout which demands small sips. Carbonation is consistent, level and allows the complexities to really roll around on the palate.
O: This is just a wonderfully crafted beer. The blending effort and careful aging process is very clear in the smooth, balanced and complex flavors and aromas present. I'm very happy I ended up with a few bottles this year, and actually don't plan to cellar this as I think it is so well-rounded fresh in it's bottle year. 1,294 charactersRHCP313, Oct 29, 2011

This is as black as midnight. Oily. A dark tan head of a finger fades into a ring with a light layer on top that slowly fades. 
Tons of bourbon, charred oak, and sweet roasted malt. Also, lots of molasses and dark chocolate. 
All of the components from the nose follows. There is also a lot of vanilla that I did not pick up before. Dark fruit and hops are both barely noticeable. 
Mouthfeel was smooth, creamy, and thick, exactly what I would expect from a world-class stout. 
Overall, this was very enjoyable. Glad I have a couple to age. 584 charactersfatmcb1, Oct 27, 2011

4.33/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had on tap at Teresa's Next Door on 10/24/11.
Poured into a tulip glass and appeared almost pitch black with a chocolate brown head. Head receded almost completely and lacing was minimal as I drank this brew.
Aroma was not very strong. Mostly got a sense of chocolate and vanilla. As I tasted it, the chocolate became even more pronounced, particularly in the finish. A very complex, multidimensional beer with several distinct stages of flavor. Vanilla came out more along with bourbon and a bit of smokey flavor in the front of this beer. Very balanced. I did not let this beer come up in temperature enough as I drank it too fast (it was just too good!)...next time I will let it come up a bit more because I would like to see how that would affect the balance/complexity of flavor.
This brew is pretty heavy with nice carbonation. There was a bit of an alcohol burn with it, but it wasn't overwhelming. This was my first time imbibing in this particular beer and I enjoyed it very much. It was smooth...very drinkable for 12.5%! 1,035 charactersMsRif, Oct 25, 2011

Tremendous stout! Served on tap and poured into a tulip glass, this beer was a rich opaque black with a lovely chocolate brown head, nearly a finger of it, which receded a bit during the session and left just a bit of soapy lacing behind. Luscious aroma of rich bittersweet chocolate, with notes of bitter coffee and a touch of vanilla and bourbon. All these qualities followed through in an excellent way on the palate, with the smooth, rich chocolate taking the foreground, both in the front and the finish, with a good balance of coffee bitterness mid-palate. Alcohol warmth definitely present, but barely boozy at all in the taste. Woody with subtle oak tones, and just a hint of dark fruits: cherries and figs. Full-bodied, rich, and quite the amazing drink overall. 813 charactersRifugium, Oct 25, 2011

A-Deep dark opaque black with a foamy dark mocha head and good lacing.
S-Chocolate, roast, vanilla and a fine charred oak.
T-Lovely bourbony sweetness in the front with milk chocolate, some roastiness and a delicious dark fruit. Delicious balance and rich layers of flavor. A hint of booziness is well hidden.

O-A bit mellower after six months in the TND cellar, as compared to the bottle. Still delectably smooth and mellow.

BeerAdvocate review #1000.
Body is perfect black hole darkness, topped by a dark tan/light brown two finger level head, that levels to an oil slick sonn after.
Knock out aroma of vanilla, bourbon, dark fruits, dark chocolate, and just maybe a hint of expresso.
Taste follows nose. Vanilla/bourbon dominate. Dark fruits, chocolate, and a hint of coffee. Warming alcohol is enjoyable, not over burning.
Mouthfeel is a bit light for the style, more a full medium than the thick near syrup I was expecting.
I went over my standard $10.00 bomber limit for this, and have no regrets at all. A superior Imperial Stout which I will enjoy each sip of tonight. 692 charactersRonfromJersey, Oct 23, 2011

A - Pours a syrupy, opaque black color with a thin finger of frothy dark cappuccino foam with decent retention falling over a minute or two to a thick collar and spotty lacing on the glass.
S - Huge vanilla, sweet caramel and milk chocolate aromas up front. Sweet bourbon layers on top of the already sweet base. Dark roasted malt, potent coffee and a touch of burnt toast, cherries, oak.
T - Caramel, molasses, milk chocolate, black coffee, oak, burnt/charcoaly bitterness, bourbony sticky sweetness, vanilla. Basically the aroma doesn't lie...all the complexity is found in the flavor profile as well.
M - Really smooth, thick, syrupy full body. Carbonation gives it a little life but really stays regulated and low enough to not interfere with the huge body of this beer. Mix of sweet and offsetting bitter gives excellent balance tho tending to stay on the sweeter side of the equation.
O - Great overall imperial stout. This is excellent fresh and seems like it would age with the best of them. Definitely a sipper, but the alcohol is hidden far too well. Incredible smoothness and complexity. One of the best I've had in recent memory. 1,205 charactersportia99, Oct 21, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage. Big thanks for bobertkuekn for this bottle.
Poured into a Cigar City snifter.
Black and thick... this is a proper stout right off the bat. The head is a little slow to rise, but it is a beautiful dark fudge color. The head retention is pretty weak, though not unusual for the style. No lasting lace.
Smells of rich chocolate and fudge with hints of peanut hulls. Freshly opened and still cool, the beer is awash with aromas of fresh whiskey and other liquor, but with warmth this becomes much more mellow and balanced. Surprisingly as this neared room temperature I was getting some wonderful tannic notes from the oak. Musty old barrels and red wine layer Parabola with depth and fruity undertones.
From the very first taste I knew this was going to be a fun bottle to sit down with and sip throughout the night. As in the aroma, at first I feared that this brew would prove to be a one-dimensional whiskey-fest. But careful patience will reward you with the best evidence of why Firestone Walker is the king of the barrel.
Dark chocolate fudge is thick and chewy in Parabola. Roasty malt and charred barrel are lovely additions of flavor, while neither contribute the more harsh ashy bitterness that many beers exhibit. Damp oaken flavors add body and texture, while the dark fruited notes of red wine and plum lend softness and nuance.
Thick, sticky, and luscious. Warming but never hot or boozy. Chewy as any self-respecting RIS ought to be. At 12% I'll easily sip my way through the entire bomber to myself. This is only further evidence that Firestone Walker NEEDS to distribute to OH. Seriously. While not quite as complex or unique as FW14, I think I prefer this beer. And though I didn't buy this myself, I want to say that it is cheaper to boot (paid $21 in Chicago for a bottle of the anniversary beer). 1,834 charactersSpider889, Oct 20, 2011

Dark and thick with a tan but short lived head and minimal lace. Aroma and predominant flavor is chocolate and malty. Up front there is lots going on. Licorice leads to dark chocolate with some bourbon/oaky tones and dried fruit in the middle. A bit of booziness, but not too bad for the ABV. Very big body and medium carbonation. Glad I saved this one for dessert and a cool night. 440 charactersLittleDon, Oct 16, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a tulip. Thanks to goodstrongbeer for bringing this over.
Appearance: My glass is a thick looking mahogany color with a very thin brown head that reverts to a collar rather quickly.
Smell: My nose is filled with notes of roasted malts and coffee, some tobacco, smoke, dark chocolate, molasses, vanilla, oak, and bourbon. No one smell really dominates, making me think that I am in for a treat.
Taste: Parabola is a demonstration of brewing excellence. There is a confidence that a nuance will be noticed and no flavor must bludgeon you with its strength. Up front, roasted malt takes on a lightly charred character, and semi-sweet dark chocolate and a bit of molasses add further flavor and sweetness. Roast coffee and vanilla add some more delicate flavor, with a bit of oak and bourbon hardly noticeable at the end. 
Mouthfeel: The full body of this beer works well with the light to medium carbonation to create a decadent and creamy feel. The thickness is necessary to provide a reasonable base for such a rich and complex beer. 
Overall: This is a beer that definitely lives up to the hype. A bourbon barrel stout that still manages to be delicate and complex is a rare find. I will definitely try to stock up on this beer and look forward to having it again. 1,302 charactersKickInTheChalice, Oct 16, 2011

Aroma is exactly as advertised - tobacco and charred dark chocolate but the bourbon is not overt.
The bourbon quiet in the scent is upfront and defining. The alcohol too is loud. Not nearly as bitter as anticipated, rides from mid taste through the long lasting aftertaste. Final persistent echo is of semi sweet chocolate. Thick full bodied mouthfeel. Incredible at room temp!

Review from notes that I found in my pocket at work.
Poured into a snifter
Pours out very black with a mini tan colored head. 
There is a lot of booziness on the nose, together with lots of oak bourbon notes.
Flavors are a lot more balanced than the nose promised to be. Vanilla and coffee notes mixed with chocolate and dark roasted malts. Great hop and chocolate bitterness.
A medium to full bodied beer. A bit more of a burn than I like but all together a good mouthfeel. Flavors linger forever.
Overall this is a great stout. The aroma could have been better but the flavors make up for it. I wish the alcohol burn would have been a little less. I'm very glad to have tried this beer and happy that it does live up to the hype. Thanks a bunch for the beer Brooks! 888 charactersdoopiedoopiedoo, Oct 13, 2011

No. 002
Poured from a 22oz bomber to a cigar city snifter.
A. S.- Pours pitch black with less than a half finger of golden brown head which retreated to a small collar that leaves little lacing. Big aroma. Chocolate, dark malt, dark fruit, a bourbon-like boozeiness, lots of sweetness, oak, tobacco. The aroma is just a bit sweeter than what I'd expect from an RIS.
T. M.- Mmmm. Pretty creamy, I defiantly get coco, sweet espresso, tobacco, dark fruit and a big warm boozie finish. Medium body with a great feel, just a little sticky but creamy at the same time, lots of flavor hanging out on the back of the tung and roof of the mouth 3 or 4 minutes after the last sip.

Review #625
The beer poured midnight black with motor oil colored edges. Quite viscous. No head or lacing, but the liquid was topped by a bubbly, saddle brown ring of froth.
The nose was remarkably smooth and complex. Quite sweet overall. Lots of brown sugar and raisins. Moderately roasty. Strong powdered cocoa notes. A few minutes in, I thought I picked up a hint of oxidation, but this quickly subsided. Strong vanilla and sweet cream notes also came through. Some molasses as well. Toward the beer's end, a touch of bourbon-like booziness was detectible.
The taste was also rather interesting. It was similar to the nose in many ways but a touch edgier. Deep, dark and roasty. Strong chocolate notes. Unlike in the aroma, the chocolate here was more pure and raw. French roast coffee was also noticeable. Some brown sugar and vanilla as well. Hints of dark fruits. Piney, citrusy hops came through in the moderately bitter finish. At 13% ABV, this imperial stout masked its alcohol prowess exceptionally well.
The mouthfeel was smooth, frothy and creamy yet definitely thinner than anticipated. I was expecting something more full bodied.
Parabola is an excellent beer, but it is perhaps a bit more tame than I was anticipating. Ideally, I would have liked a stronger bourbon presence and a more robust body. To those of you who have a fresh bottle, I would definitely advise you to cellar it for at least a year. We sampled a 2010 vintage next to a 2011 and the former showcased a flavor profile that was far better melded and an alcohol presence that was much more subdued than the latter. 1,735 charactersDamian, Oct 10, 2011

poured into my Rodenbach snifter. Fairly standard RIS black color with a mocha head.
Smells sweet vanilla and bourbon; a hint of dark fruit.
Roast coffee with oak, vanilla, bourbon. Very well integrated. Moderate heat on the back end; delicious.
Near perfect creamy, moderately thick mouthfeel. Again, some heat on the end, so you know the ABV is up there on this guy but you could easily guess 9-10%
A world-class -bbal RIS. If they produced fewer cases this would achieve whale status; but FW made enough to go around and thus I'm able to try it without jeopardizing my family's financial stability. 724 charactersCruisaC, Oct 10, 2011

big thanks to youradhere for sending this my way.
2011 vintage, No. 002, 22oz bottle at cellar temp poured into a snifter. bottled 4/28/11
pours out a completely opaque black color with a dark brown colored head, somewhat fizzy, faded to a creamy dark ring rather quickly. a quick swirl of the glass rouses some lacing and a quick return of some head. some legs are also evident on the glass.
big notes of smooth powerful bourbon blend very well with a deep roasted/ burnt malt. i would say the bourbon is most obvious in the aroma however, becoming increasingly so the more it warms. some solvent like alcohol. also noticeable is some chocolate cake batter, vanilla, a bit of some dark fruits and a bit of molasses and brown sugar. 
again, the big powerful bourbon is at the forefront, pretty boozy, but in the best way possible. very smooth and rich and just melds with the rest of the flavors so nicely. deeply roasted/ burnt malt, some oaky, vanilla, barrel qualities noticeable. behind all that there is some chocolate cake batter, molasses, dark fruits, dark chocolate.
big, full, chewy body. extremely warming to almost your whole body. carbonation is on the low side. so smooth, especially in the finish. slick, heavy and hot.
this is defiantly a solid, very well made BA stout, one of the better ones, but there are still a few i would take over this, 09 BCBS, and BA sexy chocolate to be specific. the 12 months spent in the barrel really does show with a big, smooth bourbon character with some oak as well. this is really a bourbon lover dream. personally i think this would benefit from at least a year or 2 of age. 1,651 charactersdogfishandi, Oct 09, 2011

T: Quite complex, the taste is very similar to the smell with flavors of oak and vanilla and also has notes of chocolate and hints of wine in the flavors. The complexity increases as the beer warms up.
M: It feels full-bodied and smooth on the palate with a light to moderate amount of carbonation with heat from the alcohol in the finish.
O: Despite its strength, the beer doesn’t taste overly strong but is a good sipping beer because its complex aroma and taste will retain your interest. 777 charactersmetter98, Oct 09, 2011

The two amazing things about that statement are: Parabola "on tap" and "Finnegan's" which is about to go under. Anyway, I tasted this with a beer guru buddy and cherished every drop. From my notes:
A= This stout poured pitch black with a super dense dark tan head that rose just 3/8" and then stuck there for a good while. Once it settled, it left a small bit of lacing on the glass.
S= The aroma was incredibly complex. Sweet dark molasses, roasted grain, chocolate, leather, a hint of tobacco, vanilla, oak...Christ it had it all! 
T= Much like the nose indicated. Super complex, with wave after wave of flavor. Lots of rich sweetness up front, but never cloying. Roasted notes were firm and bitter without being too much. Hops were in there with an earthy presence that helped to balance everything without getting in the way. The boozy bourbon, vanilla, and oak character was there but never too much. This was honestly one of the better balanced barrel aged RIS' I have ever had. 
MF= Full body with a fairly low carbonation level. Slick and pleasant across the tongue.
D= Its a sipper for sure but a damn fine one that I would go a long way to get more of. 1,228 charactersspointon, Oct 07, 2011

S - Smells of roasted malt, milk chocolate, and licorice. Not an overwhelming aroma, but more of a subdued scent that improves as the beer warms.
T - Exceptional. Flavors range from malty, bitter from coffee, sweetness of cocoa powder, to a boozy warming feeling at the back end that belies its potency yet doesn't trash your taste buds. Overall profile is smooth and blended well.
M - A true sipper in the mold of a good big stout. Syrupy thick consistency, robust flavors, and a heavy bite. Not a beer to have with a meal, because it essentially is a meal.
O - Easily as good as the top imp stouts in the world. Firestone Walker is fast becoming a favorite brewery of mine with the quality in their elite beers. Highly recommended for Imperial Stout lovers, and I'd love on eof these on a cold January evening. 908 characterssocon67, Oct 04, 2011

A: This one pours completely black. Basically no head, but what is there is nice tan color. Great lacing. Alcohol legs for sure. Some red on the edges when you tilt the glass.
S: Lots of vanilla/bourbon notes. I get some deep dark chocolate and some espresso notes as well. Beautiful roasted malts, pumped up by the bourbon/vanilla hints for sure.
T: Just flat out awesomely blended beer. Absolutely no hop bite. It comes to life in the middle of the mouth and through the back of the throat. Lots of deep dark chocolate along with the bourbon, vanilla, and bourbon. You get some of that coffee bitterness, but just a touch. Alcohol is completely hidden at 12.5% which is amazing. I have had lesser BA beers that blast you with bourbon, and this one does not. Again, great blending.

Black with a thick brown head (darkest that I have ever seen) that dispersed slowly and left a lacing on the glass.

Dark caramel sweetness at first then it becomes dark chocolate and coffee in the middle. Light vanilla and alcohol at the end, finish is thick and oily on the tongue.
This is an exceptional beer. With it being 12.5% the alcohol could barely be detected. There are not that many beers that make sit back and go wow, this is one of them. Believe the hype. 560 charactersBurt, Sep 29, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5My friend found out that early last week that we would be working together at the same company come November. That combined with him finding a secondary stock of Parabola at Binny's LP = a really really drunken night for us. We worked through 2 bottles of this within a couple hours. Served in a stemless wine glass. 
A - Standard coloring. Noteworthy item here would be the smooth khaki head that really looked great and better than I'd hope for from 12.5 %. 
S - Honestly, pretty damn similar to KBS. Same level of bourbon and incredible dimension of other undertones. Spice, oak, chocolate, so on and so forth. 
T - It's a bit sweeter than I thought it'd be. More milk chocolate and spice balance over secondary bourbon flavor. Somewhat tannic on the backend.
M - Smooth-as-butter through and through. Seriously the smoothest beer I've had. Moderate/heavy body. Fair carbonation, nice dry and lingering finish. Brilliantly good in this category, deserves more than a 5. 
D - At first, I wasn't sure. But 15-20 minutes into the glass I decided that this was probably the finest barrel-aged stout I've yet come across. I'd put it on over the Founders counterpart as my new reference for this style. All's well that ends well.
Edit - over many revisits, I'm not quite as impressed with this but it remains relatively consistent from year-to-year. 1,352 charactersAuracom, Sep 28, 2011

A: Dark molasses color, opaque, with a minimal head that faded very quickly.
N: The smell was quite captivating. Dark fruits, caramel, chocolate, coffee and a hint of fig pudding.
T: Expecting to find the same qualities here as in the nose, I was quite let down. I found the taste to be rather one dimensional. All I could get from this beer was dark roasty malt and chocolate. I got none of the Bourbon barrel nuances that were present in the nose. Bummer.
M: As expected, a very big bodied beer, but again I was let down by the finish or lack there of.
O: Not a bad RIS, but in no way does it stand up to its hype, IMO. It just didn't work for me, too one dimensional. I kept going back to it, not because it was so good, but because I truly wanted to find something I liked in the beer, but alas there wasn't much to be found. Maybe my other bottle will fare better with a little age on it. 947 charactersubufan2112, Sep 28, 2011

4.61/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle (Batch 002) poured into a snifter. Black color with a thin tan head that dissipates pretty quickly to a thin film. Light shows through the edges, deep mahogany. Little tan bubbles constantly rise to the surface. After the beer settles, a quick swirl brings up a beautiful shimmering flash of tan bubbles to the surface.
Aroma is dark roasted malt, rich bourbon-soaked pipe tobacco, charred oak, and vanilla. A nice complex blend.
Taste generally follows nose: a swirling symphony of bitter roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla, dark chocolate, toasted coconut, and nice warming booze as it goes down.
Mouthfeel is velvety, slick, a little sticky.
This is definitely a special beer, one to be sipped and savored as it gradually warms. 743 charactersdraheim, Sep 27, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Parabola No. 002
Served slightly chilled into a goblet.
It's nearly black in color with redish hints around the edges. The head is very short and settles almost immediately.
Aroma is rich, malty, and boozy. I get the barrel aging right away with hints of wine, bourbon, and rum.
Flavor is extremely intense and complex. The base beer is a very dark roasty stout and it needs to be to support all of the aging. Espresso, bitter dark chocolate, and earthy hops. Then the influence of the barrels adds bourbon, rum, vanilla, and tannins.
Mouthfeel is full bodied, smooth, and low in carbonation. The alcohol is certainly present but not obtrusive. Noticible after a few sips, however.
Overall a really big imperial stout and a special one as well. Worth the effort to seek this one out. 789 charactersGilGarp, Sep 27, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 2 - June 2011. 
A - Pitch black body with a dark khaki head that didn't stick around too long. Excellent lacing and retention.
S - Loads of bourbon, coffee, and chocolate. Roasted malts, and some slight alcohol.
T - Bourbon. Extremely smooth and buttery. The usual RIS chocolate, roasted malts, and coffee are here as well. Just amazingly smooth and well balanced. Its warming but the alcohol isn't dominant at all. The mouth feel is really velvety and smooth.
O - A delicious barrel aged RIS. I prefer bourbon county stout over this, but then again I've only had the 2009 vintage. This beer is already crazy smooth and delicious at a few months old, I'm sure with some age this will become incredible. 712 charactersdavey101, Sep 27, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A two for two (Parabola/Brute) trade with NJBeerNerd!!! Thanks bro!
A- Pours a deep, pitch black with a one finger creamy brown head into my Bruery Tulip glass... Not a trace of light shines thru... it's like a liquid black hole! A touch oily as I swirl it around the glass, and little traces of lacing that drip down and fade away. This is really nice! 
S- Rich 60% cocoa, fresh pressed espresso, vanilla, oak, dried cherries, fresh split figs and a touch of honey. Picking up some black strap molasses, brown sugar and toffee notes as it warms up. The alcohol is definately present, but it's warming, pleasing, and blends well... highlighting the experiance of all the other flavors. This is superb, and well worth wating for! Gets so much bigger and more down to earth as it warms up! 
T- DEPTH!!! The first word that comes to mind after the first sip... Roasted cocoa beans, fresh brewed espresso, dried cherries/figs/prunes, vanilla, tabacco, wood soaked alcohol, brown sugar/molasses and a touch of honey. It wraps around your tongue and lets each flavor do it's worst/best!!! I love the vanilla and smoke that the barrel aging imparts. A bit heavy on the alcohol bite... i'm sure some aging will mellow that. This is near perfect!
M- Not quite as thick as some Russian Imperials... but certainly leaves the tongue coated with a roasted oil slick of toffee, smoke, dried fruit, vanilla and chocolate. This is exceptional!!! The roasted coffee notes, vanilla/oak, cocoa, alcohol and melody of dried fruit are unreal! This just entered my top 10 RIS's! 
O- This one has it all... Near perfection! I can't wait to see how my other bottle ages. Other than a bit hot (which never really bothers me), and it could be a touch thicker... I have nothing bad at all to say about this fantastic stout! So well done... wish this was more available to me!!! 1,855 charactersThickfreakness, Sep 27, 2011
3.96/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A second shipment seems to have come into Illinois, picked up 2 bottles last night, should be about 4 months of age on it by now. Poured into my St. Bernardus glass.
Thick, viscous pour. Huge, creamy head that nearly toppled this glass. Not much lacing...strange.
Nose - Alcohol first...hmmm....cocoa, nibs, some vanilla. I'm a bit nervous, I don't seem to remember it this way.
First sip. Goodness this is rich. Strong dark chocolate and espresso are dominant. A bit of alcohol on the back palate. 
Body is chewy and rich...yes, wow...rich rich rich. Loads of vanilla after it warms and I've taken in a bit more than a sip. This thing is massive (yes, that's what she said). BCS without such a bourbon onslaught. Enormous chocolate character. Is that bit of red wine in the background? Yes...almost like Cab. Sav.!!!!
Finish sites back palate. Long, with warming alcohol ending.
This stout is huge...absurdly huge. I can't imagine how much malt was used to make this beast - the Midwest/Great Lakes area is lucky to finally have it here. Fans of chocolate bombs should seek this out. Splendid stuff. 1,106 charactersdrumminbrewer, Sep 26, 2011

big oaky booziness, touch of burnt sugar, coffee. pretty intense.
big roasted flavor upfront, slightly sweet, touch of molasses. really intense oak flavor, some higher alcohols as well. tannins from the oak create a sort of sopping effect on the tongue.overall pretty good.
mouthfeel for me in an imperial stout is perfect. full bodied, not super sweet. spot on.
overall this is a great oak aged stout. my favorite? probably not. worth picking up though. 590 characterswyattshotmaker, Sep 26, 2011
4.48/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I was sitting at Backcountry Pizza in Boulder when I saw the bartender pull out a bottle for the guy three or four seats away from me. After he took a few sips I asked him if it lived up to all the hype and his response was "Absolutely." The bottle was also pretty reasonably priced at $18, so I dove in ordered a bomber for myself. I was not disappointed.
APPEARANCE: Pours a stark black and looks very viscous, you can see the deliciousness pouring out of the bottle. There is no head and no lacing at all though.
SMELL: Not as strong a nose as I would have liked, but what is there smells great. There is a good dose of chocolate and hops as well. The hops provide a hint of grapefruit and pine, but very subtly.
TASTE: This is where the Parabola completely lives up to all the hype. This is an outstandingly delicious beer. Vanilla and coffee dominate up front, but as the beer warms the chocolate lurking in the background becomes more and more noticeable. A touch of hop flavor also sneaks in, but not nearly as much as one might expect from an 82 IBU beer. The bitterness seems to come more from the coffee. 
MOUTHFEEL: Superb. It feels exactly how a big, imperial stout should; thick, viscous, and a near-perfect balance of dry and sweet, although it does lean a bit to the sweet side. 
OVERALL: The Parabola really dose live up to the hype and at $18 a bottle, this was more than worth it. I can not wait to try my next one. 1,438 charactersStoneTSR, Sep 25, 2011

S - Lots of coffee and big chocolate. Some vanilla, and chili too. Disappointing for all the hype it's been getting... 
T - HOLY HEAT! This brew is not nearly as good as the Abyss... Lots of dark roasty coffee, almost tastes like it got burnt... Not too sure what everyone been getting excited over. The flavor is pretty smooth considering.
M - The HEAT is on!!! Lots of sweet bitterness. perfect carbonation. 
O - This brew needs a few years to mellow and relax... I still have two more shipped directly from Cali, this one was snagged in Denver... I'll be anxious to re-review if worthy. 723 characterschugalug06, Sep 25, 2011

A: pours pitch black. One finger of tan head leaves beady remnants on my glass. Enough already, I could smell it from across the room!
S: the nose explodes with complexity as you draw the glass near. Loads of caramel, chocolate, fresh coffee, bourbon, roasted malts, and booze. I swear there's ice cream in there too -- definitely some lactose. Wish they made Parabola-scented candles.
T: deep chocolate & coffee right off the bat. Smooth caramel flows in and out with ease. Roasted malts, oak, bourbon, and booze all take their turn with my tongue as well. Fantastically complex, and utterly delicious. Nice boozy warmth as it descends.
M: medium- to full-boded and oily, yet still creamy. Minimal carbonation works well. Hard to give high marks to an RIS on mouthfeel after experiencing Dark Lord and Zhukov.
D: the complexity -- not the booze -- makes this one a sipper. But I could sip it all day (and night) long. It's a big beer for sure, and the alcohol isn't particularly hidden, but the boozy warmth soothes your throat without any burn whatsoever. Now I need another bottle. :(
What a way to cap off a beer tasting! 1,206 charactersbrystmar, Sep 24, 2011

T-Roasted and vanilla notes upfront with some dark, stone fruits and warm, spicy bourbon notes on the finish.
M-Medium bodied with ample carbonation and a drying yet warming finish.
D-A very solid and complex beer, yet, when it comes to bourbon barell-aged stouts, Bourbon County is still number one for me. I wish the feel on this was a little richer and the malt background was more pronounced to balance the bourbon. 583 characterssamie85, Sep 24, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422oz. bottle served at 53 degrees in a tulip. Pours one shade shy of black with a frothy, half inch, mocha-colored head that eventually dissipates into a tight band around the shoulders. No lacing on this one. Nose expresses bourbon, licorice, burnt sugar, a hint of vanilla and ethanol. This beer is a major malt bomb. There's quite a bit of char happening in the flavor profile and the alcohol is a little caustic - it definitely lets you know it's there. Bourbon and vanilla resurface towards the back once the alcohol dissipates and a suggestion of toffee also reveals itself in the mix. The mouthfeel on this beer is exceptional. Body is medium in consistency with an oily, slightly viscous quality and there's also some residual alcohol burn that lingers at the back of the throat between quaffs. Carbonation is very pleasant; not too assertive, yet not still. Overall, I found this beer quite enjoyable, albeit a little hot. That said, I'm glad I tried it fresh because I'd definitely like to see how this one develops over time. I think it has great cellaring potential and in my opinion, will only improve with age. 1,124 charactersJwale73, Sep 24, 2011

S: There is definitely some bourbon and boozey-ness to the aroma here. There's also some vanilla, dark chocolates and dark fruits in the nose. I think I'm picking up a little of the oak cask as well.
T: Bourbon and vanilla notes are fused with the rest of the flavors, like cocoa, a hint of coffee and some of the dark fruits. A little bit of the oak is present as well.
M: Light on the carbonation for a nice full bodied beer. Huge on complexity. 
O: Overall, an awesome beer. Very enjoyable, I will savor every sip. Very glad that my local beer guy hung on to this one for me. 768 charactersDaktyls, Sep 24, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522 oz. Bottle poured into my Duvel tulip. 
Appearance: Black with a small 1/16” head that instantly recedes to a thin cap and ring. Very nice lacing. 
Smell: Vanilla, bourbon, and roasted malt, complexity is evident immediately with the aroma.
Taste: The vanilla and the bourbon stand out against a strong roasted malt backbone. Intense flavor but I have to say the vanilla seems to dominate the beer on my palate, riding on top of the bourbon. I really love this combination of flavor (although I must note that my drinking buddy found the vanilla too much and overpowering; however, I loved it).
Mouthfeel: Extremely creamy and smooth on the palate (falling just short of cloying).
Overall: Well crafted beer, a heavy flavorful stout that lives up to its reputation. 775 charactersBobZ, Sep 23, 2011

(review from notes.)
pours a typical imperial stout used motor oil black; somewhat aggressive pour yields a 3/4" mocha toned head. expected below-average retention.
nose is very appealing, stands out even in a style populated by worthy foes. rich notes of coffee, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and roasted malts.
flavor delivers follows and expands on the aroma. in addition to the above-mentioned headliners there are secorndary elements of oak, molassess, and raisin. full-bodied mouthfeel with adequate carbonation.
overall a stellar RIS, one of those rare hyped beers that meets (even exceeds) expectations. another home run from firestone walker. 686 charactersperrymarcus, Sep 16, 2011

A: Dark color with just scant hints of brown in the pour. 1/2 finger tan head that settles down to a thin layer before disappearing completely half way through the glass
S: Nose is decadent. First thought was this smells like a Mounds candy bar. Dark chocolate, bourbon, coconut, caramel. Love the coconut presence; upfront but ties everything together. Just a touch of roasted malt and nuttiness to round things out
T: Dark chocolate, which imparts a slight bitterness. Light roasted coffee, almost expresso-like. As I was hoping, there is a hint of the coconut in the finish. There is still a bit of alcohol, but it's not enough to deter from this being an amazing stout. Very complex
M: Full bodied, smooth. Carbonation briefly tingles the palate before fading, creating a creaminess. Roasted bitterness aftertaste
D: Such a big barrel aged stout that delivers on all fronts. There is still a fair amount of alcohol, so I would love to see how this tastes after a year of aging 1,037 charactersBrez07, Sep 16, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours out a very dark brown. No head formed at all and I poured right down the middle of the glass. Only a slight ring of bubbles formed around the side of the glass and stayed there. The smell is mainly dominated by alcohol notes and perhaps a slight tobacco smell. I can taste more than I could smell of this beer. I can taste a cherry like sweetness that gets balanced out with a nice bitterness. There is a flavor change as the beer progresses through you mouth. The finish is has a lingering bitter and kind of has a warm like feeling. The mouthfeel is very heavy and with little to none carbonation. 
Overall this beer is fantastic. I was really worried that the hype behind this beer might turn out to be just that. It is everything people say it is. The flavor is really really good. A fantastic beer that if you see one you should buy it immediately since they will be even more scarce and hard to find every day that goes by. 936 charactersbroken22, Sep 12, 2011

Appearance: Pours pitch black in the glass, with about an inch of dark khaki head. Retention is decent, lacing reduces down to a ring around the edge of the glass. Legs are good, to be expected from a 12.5% beer.
Smell: Smells of roasted malts, some char, light coffee, and baker's chocolate. Lots of vanilla, woodiness, and bourbon notes as well. Bourbon heat isn't overly prevalent with this beer being around a year old now, but I still get a bit.
Taste: Bitter dark chocolate, a touch of coffee, some roast and char in there as well. Some woodiness emerges. Nice linger of bourbon and vanilla on the finish. Again, not too much bourbon heat. A year old is a good age to drink this one. 
Mouthfeel/Overall: Body is just over medium, with a fair amount of carbonation. This was the weak point of the beer for me. Would prefer to see little more body, maybe a touch less carbonation. Overall though, a very nice barrel aged stout. Again, the barrel qualities were excellent, and the base was more than enough to hang with the barrels. 1,125 characterszhanson88, Sep 12, 2011

22oz bomber poured into a snifter. 
A- Pours a jet black color with a medium creamy brown head that leaves nice lacing. I can't make out any light coming through even on the edges of the glass. This baby is dark. 
S- Bitter dark cocoa and plenty of bourbon and red wine barrels in the nose. I don't think I've ever picked up as much 'barrel' quality from the nose before but this certainly makes its presence known. 
T- Wow, now I know where the hype has come from. Right off the bat there are rich creamy milk chocolate flavors with a nice smooth bourbon note that lingers on for quite a while. Some very sweet hints of vanilla and oak are noticeable as well and add another level of complexity to the flavor profile. I must admit that I am a fan of Barrel Aged Stouts but they are easy to overdo. However, this beer melds all of those distinct flavors together without having any singular flavor overpower another. Really really tasty. 
M- Velvety smooth mouthfeel. Creamy and thick with just the right amount of carbonation. 
O- Truly an outstanding beer. Unfortunately this isn't something that distributes in our area which is a shame. But maybe it's for the best...I imagine I'd go broke quickly spending $20 each time I wanted one of these (which would be often)! A wonderful beer and I'm glad I got the chance to try it. 1,409 charactersprojectflam86, Sep 05, 2011

4.72/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 52011 vintage.
I grabbed three bottles of this beauty, and couldn't resist trying a relatively fresh one.
Pours "midnight" as it is described on the bottle. Not quite a jet black- a little dark brown creeped in. Head is cocoa and minimal, yet a bit dense for what sticks around.
I know from the aroma that I'm going to love this beer. Big bourbon right away, with faint hints of chocolate and the littlest amount of coffee. Heavy, thick aroma.
I am admittedly biased when reviewing bourbon barrel brews. I love bourbon, and I love them fresh and boozy. This one has booze in spades. Quite smooth and a bit sweet- perhaps some dark berry flavors here. Some sweet chocolate as well, but very light. For a bourbon nut, this one hit the spot. I wish I hadn't shared it ;-)
Mouthfeel is solid, complimentary to the flavors, and true to the style. Some might want it a bit more viscous, but I thought it hit the mark pretty well.
I loved this beer fresh, in all its boozy glory. I imagine this beer will mature into something quite complex, but I'm considering drinking my remaining stash sooner rather than later. 1,113 charactersstonermouse, Aug 30, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a sniffer.
Appearance: Pours thick and black with a mocha colored head about a finger thick that fades into a thin ring around the side of the glass. 
Aroma: Notes of vanilla, oak, bourbon, chocolate, licorice, raisins, and a touch of alcohol. Very complex, I could smell this one for a while. 
Taste: Chocolate, oak, vanilla, bourbon, with a touch of coffee. Definitely complex and could also use a little more time to develop. 
Mouthfeel: Thick and rich, a sipper for sure, with a slight sweet alcoholic finish.
Overall: An exceptionally good beer. The only down side was the noticeable alcoholic finish, but with time that should mellow out. 661 charactersjamescain, Aug 30, 2011

Pours jet black with a tan small tan head. Smell is a huge bourbon presence some nice roasted malts. Big vanilla and milk choclate on the taste some slight toffe sweetness. Mouthfeel and carbonation are pretty spot on. Great sipper but nothing mind blowing. 287 charactersjoefuzz, Aug 30, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22oz bottle into a stemless snifter.
A: Pours a deep chocolate with a full latte-coloured head.
S: Dark roasted malts, chocolate, a bit of bourbon and spicy hops dominate the aroma.
T: Very good. It lacks some of the complexity of the smell, but is just laden with flavour. Dark chocolate, raisins and the familiar vanilla-oak-heat of the barrels shine through.
D: Not exactly chuggable, but it is perfect for the heavy, boozy, syrupy animal that it is. They should really release this in the winter...
Overall: Another great beer from FW and a classic barrel aged stout. However, this one seems a little hyped. It doesn't come close to Bourbon County and I found Abacus to be much more complex and original...still a great beer though. 755 charactersJohnnyChicago, Aug 29, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 Vintage. Jet black, looks to be kind of syrupy, but not overly viscous. Thin head of dark tan foam. Leaves a nice ring. The aroma is quite hot. Apparently 15 months in the bottle is not nearly enough time to mellow the alcohol on this beast. Dark chocolate, touches of licorice, and more alcohol fume. Not alot of complexity yet. 
The roasted chocolate flavor is smooth and rich, and balanced well by the booziness. It's more mellow than expected from the aroma. After a few sips a bourbon-like presence begins to dominate, especially after the finish, with notes of oak and vanilla. The bitterness is only slight at the back, giving way more to the sweet alcohols. The mouthfeel is definitely syrupy, not too heavy. Adequate subtle carbonation. 
Overall a tasty barrel aged Imperial Stout. I'm wishing I had waited at least another year to open this though, and that is just what I will do with my other bottle. Hopefully the extra aging will make it that much better... 978 charactersbennetj17, Aug 29, 2011

A - Dark, inky black with a short-lived mocha-colored head that recedes to a slight ring and wispy haze.
S - Dark chocolate and roasted malt with huge caramel, vanilla, and oak aromas from the Bourbon barrels. Incredibly dark and complex!
T - Oboy. Tons of dark chocolate, espresso, malt, and molasses with a strong Bourbon character. Deep, sweet, and pleasantly boozy, this is what a BA Stout should be.
M - So smooth, velvety even, with a creamy mouthfeel, full body, and nice prickly carbonation. Superb.
O - Easily one of the best Barrel-Aged Stouts I've had, this is an exceptional beer! 659 charactersjsanford, Aug 29, 2011

A. Solid Black with a tan head that dissipates quickly, some spotty foam remains on the surface.
S. Chocolate, roasted malts, bourbon, vanilla, oak all brought together by a lingering sweetness.
T/M. Wow, amazing. A full bodied beer that gets into every taste bud. The alcohal is very well hidden for a 12.5% beer The first flavor you get it Bourbon and it is great. Followed by bitter chocolate, espresso, coffee and vanilla. Im getting a little of the tabacco taste on the finish I often get after smoking a great cigar. The oak is always there as well but never prominent. This one is world class.
O. This is a special beer. I am glad I have a few more to crack open in the next few months and years. It will always be for a special occasion because this is a beer that deserves it. This beer was not over hyped it deserves all the hype and praise it gets because wow it keeps getting better with every sip and blows away ones expectations. Buy/Trade or do whatever you need to do to get your hands on this one because you will be kicking yourself if you dont. 1,080 charactersDemer, Aug 29, 2011

2011 Parabola, Reserve Series 2, 300 Cases Produced.
A: Deep dark black in color. The head is soft and a coffee and cream in color. 
S: Sweet and bready smells come out right away. Followed by molasses, dark chocolate, and coffee. The bourbon aroma is always present with notes of vanilla and spice. 
T: It starts sweet and smooth, with vanilla and oak flavors, the finish turns a little more mean with a significant hit of bitterness and malty tannin. There are some berry notes as well as a touch of booze. Some nice oak notes in there. Definitely an interesting tasting brew, atypical of a lot of other brews in this style. 
M: Thick and syrupy. The carbonation is there but simply can't stop the thickness that this has. It clings to your mouth after you swallow, coating your mouth with a syrupy feeling. 
O: Overall very good. Interesting flavor, and presentation, but it lacks grace. Definitely a great beer, but the finish comes on a little strong for me. Still... damn tasty. 1,007 charactersBeejay, Aug 28, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From the June 2011 bottling:
Pours and absolute pitch black with 2 fingers of thick and sticky dark tan colored head. Fades a bit quickly but leaves a nice sticky residue behind. 
Vanilla, oak, and bourbon greet the nose and seem to dominate the aroma. Little room is left for roasted coffee notes and a slight hint of fruit. 
First sip reveals a complexity of flavors that are all fighting for your attention. Roasted barley, chocolate, and dark fruit are overlaid by the barrel flavors which are heavy on the oak and vanilla notes. Tobacco and molasses also add to the complexity before a bit of leafy hops rounds it out. Bourbon/alcohol flavors make this one a bit hot at this relatively young age. 
Creamy and velvety smooth texture with a heavy bodied mouthfeel. Overall, Parabola is wonderfully complex barrel aged stout and it will be interesting to see how these flavors integrate over time.
2014 Vintage: Just as good as ever. Maybe even better this time around. Not quite as much heat on this one. Bourbon comes through nicely but will plenty of room to let the stout shine 1,087 charactersKinsman, Aug 28, 2011
5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Silky black body, very thick. Nice one finger dark tan head with good lacing. This is what a stout should look like
S: Getting a lot of vanilla, bourbon and coffee in the nose. Very, very sweet smell with a bit of alcohol in there
T: Very roasty, a lot of complexity on this one. Getting a very dark, almost like baking chocolate flavor first, which transitions into sort of vanilla and coffee. Then the barrel flavor hits and I absolutely melted. I am picking up the bourbon, but not too strong and it accentuates the roasted malts to make a perfectly balanced imperial stout for the gods.
M: As noted in the body, silky. Liquid velvet. Nice and thick with little carbonation and a nice warm finish courtesy of the bourbon barrel
Overall there is not enough praise I can give this beer. This is a picture perfect RIS, and without a doubt the best one I have had to date. I would gladly buy it by the case if it was easier to obtain. My hunt for this most elusive beer was well worth it. 994 charactersBobheed, Aug 28, 2011

S: upfront vanilla and coffee notes along with a bourbon/buttery finish
T: intense and complex flavors of semi dark chocolate, butter, coffee, char, bourbon, and vanilla. As this vanglorious concoction warms up more of the bourbon barrel aging is prevalent and be reassured that this gets better!
M: thick and chewy, almost viscous like motor oil yet thins out as it warms up
O: 1st taste if parabola and I'm lucky to have gotten a few extra bottles. Amazing is the only word I could use to describe it. Tastes great and the booze at 12.5% is not noticeable until halfway through the bottle as it is very drinkable. 657 charactersDrewShal9, Aug 28, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -4.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle poured into snifter
Pours an opaque blackness with a thin dark tanned head, which quickly dissolves into clouds of filmy retention. Some spots of lacing left on the glass while drinking. 
Soft, fragrant, yet very enticing nose, filled with oaky bourbon and wood, touches of vanilla with cocoa powder and caramel. Decent alcohol warmth but not overwhelming, plenty of roasted malts and some dark sweetness character as well. 
Large roasted malt presence up front with cocoa, dark chocolate, and hints of molasses. Spike of dry hoppiness is apparent. The barrel character is right up front with some boozy notes and oaky wood, although not over the top. Some sweetness from vanilla and caramel. Finishes boozy and warm with another dash of hops. 
Full, luscious, creamy body that slides across the tongue, nicely carbonated. Excellent taste and feel on this one, and I'd really like to see how this does after another 6-12 months after the hops die down a little more. 982 charactersxnicknj, Aug 27, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -5.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very deep brown color, almost black. The brown head is short with fine carbonation bubbles, which settles into a light ring.
The aroma is of semi-bitter chocolate, vanilla, and wood. There is a subtle hint of bourbon and I think I detect some smoke. The overall aroma is not overpowering but its quite pleasant.
The taste starts off with a bitter chocolate and a strong roasted malt flavor. Some caramel and char from the malt as well. This is then followed by the barrel aging characteristics; vanilla and bourbon. The barrel flavors aren't too strong, where it dominates the flavor. It mixes well with the RIS base.
The feel is very thick but it is smooth and velvty. The carbonation is light but prickly. The stout starts off sweet but finishes with a roasted bitterness. A bit sticky and hot in the finish.
A very good stout; big and roasty. The barrel aging adds a nice flavor without overpowering. Impressive.

A: Pours a jet black. There is no way light could even dream of entering this chamber of emptiness. A 2 finger dark brown head shines on the pour with a great liveliness. Frothy and bubbly, the head leaves some nice sticky lace and has some legs to boot.
S: I pick up the bourbon right away with a the great oak barrel as well. Light vanilla with a light alcohol complimenting it as well.
T: Incredible flavor combination. I get the bourbon right upfront which smooths out to a great woody barrel barrel and light hoppiness. The finish consists of some sweet vanilla, light chocolate and a warming alcohol with a touch of heat. Just really hits all the notes.
M: Very smooth and incredibly warming down the throat. Heavy bodied with little carbonation, but just enough make it alive down your through.
O: I thought this was a great barrel-aged RIS. The flavors all meshed wonderfully and I wonder how good this could be with a little bit of age on it. 1,028 charactersTreebs, Aug 27, 2011

Dark brown with a deep cinnamon colored head of 2 fingers. Nice lace and retention. 
Body is full and creamy. Very solid. 
Overall-- this review got rushed despitethe fact I had 2 glasses... Stupid conversations!
In any case-- this is a fantastic beer. I had 2 glasses for 3 reasons: 
1). I had a festina peche while I reviewed the liquor store I had just stopped at. 
2). I had a life and limb because I missed out on bottles!
3). The tap handle said "robust porter" and I hadn't looked at the menu, so I didn't know it was on tap!

Cardiff Seaside Market
Cardiff, CA
Dark as night black with a thin brown head. This beer looks shiny, oily, menacing, and splendid. Spotted lacing down the glass.
Incredible, complex, and perfect aroma. The rich bourbon, vanilla, and wood come flooding forward first, followed by sweet caramel and toffee, and an underlying yet powerful scent of freshly baked coconut macaroon cookies. As the beer warms, more and more layers open which include sweet, rich, sticky molasses, gingerbread, chocolate, and char. Simply phenomenal!
Rich bourbon flavors, including the oak barrel, earth, and vanilla are the initial invaders, followed by more and more coconut as the beer warms. Sweet caramel, toffee, molasses, and gingerbread are present, though the roast and chocolate and a mild bitterness keeps the rich dessert sweetness in line. A slight alcohol warmth and burn as this beer goes down adds to the overall flavor. Brilliant!
Medium to thick mouthfeel and a touch oily--absolutely coats the mouth.
A stellar beer. True perfection. 1,050 charactersehammond1, Aug 25, 2011

M-Pretty viscous, but not as think as you might think from the appearance.I could take down a bomber alone for sure.

4.18/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4A - Pours black, with a thick tan head that has good retention and actually laces quite a bit better than I had expected.
S - Bourbon notes hit first, then rolls into rich baker's chocolate and a little bit of roast.
T - Cold, the bourbon is muted a bit with bigger notes of sweet chocolate and a little roasted malt. Finishes warm with the bourbon coming through again. After it warms up for a few minutes, the bourbon becomes much more prevalent.
M - Full body, low carbonation, thick and chewy. Doesn't finish great with some residual sugar left coating the mouth after the finish. 
O - I'm generally not a fan of bourbon barrel beers, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one. The bourbon is not overpowering, and compliments the heavy chocolate notes well. Alcohol presence is hidden extremely well. A nice treat, but at this price, I probably won't seek it out again. 870 charactersgaruda, Aug 25, 2011

4.2/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Vast, boozy, but pleasing black concoction. Maybe it's the color, but I think of tar and liquorice. Rather sweet, like whiskey, but more of a candy taste. Quite hot and tangy with alcohol, like a liqueur. Malt is a big wall of taste with that sweet Sugar Daddy flavor all the way to the aftertaste. Hops are robust enough to stand up to the sugar and barrel flavors. Intense is the word.
Sippibility is good, if you're in the mood for a strong dose of hootch. Label says this is 2011 batch.
June 15, 2012 update - tried the 2012 version. Lovely aroma of Yukon Jack, and that hot malt is endlessly tasty. But it still tastes like something that squirts in your mouth out of a liqueur chocolate. 695 charactersmactrail, Aug 22, 2011

A Pours a dark black color with a thin mocha head that dissipates quickly. 
S The nose is strong with a lot going on. There are notes of bourbon, vanilla, licorice, oak, and booze. Quite nice and complex, I could spend a long time smelling this one. 
T Equally as complex as the nose with each sip revealing something different. There are notes of chocolate, oak, bourbon, vanilla, a slight dark fruit note, a hint of smoke and a lot of alcohol. 
M The mouthfeel is thick but not syrupy and is accompanied by a long lasting warming feeling. 
Overall this might be the best Russian Imperial stout I have ever had. I am so glad I have another bottle of this one. 706 charactersbeerandcycling88, Aug 22, 2011

The smell is a spectacular roasted malt and bourbon aroma that improves as it warms.
The taste includes bourbon and cocoa and licorice and vanilla. It is in the complex area more so than adding up it's parts to make a great beer. Very, very tasty.
Mouthfeel is thicker at first then tends toward medium as it warms.

boozy molasses flavor is most dominant, with vanilla, soy sauce, coffee, cocoa, oak, a bit of dark fruits, some dark rum, plenty of booze. sweet, roasty and boozy.
pretty full-bodied and syrupy with some prickly carbonation and a significant alcohol burn.
very good beer. doesn't quite meet the expectations I had, but one that I would drink again. Definite candidate for cellaring, and I put my other bottle away. Will revisit in a year or so. I think some time will put this beer into the upper echelon.
___
though there are people who say Firestone's barrel-aged beers don't age well... the alcohol burn in this one subsides significantly after just 6 months. I wouldn't age it for years though. 6-9 months seemesto be the sweet spot for this one. 1,113 characterssilentjay, Aug 21, 2011

3.95/5  rDev -13%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Medium black, seemingly flat in the pour but eventually nice 2 finger head forms and seems to linger well. Not overly dense or motor oil like (shucks). 
Black cherry, coffee, chocolate, and bourbon aromas. 
What an interesting beer. It has notes of bourbon, but the fruit aromas are certainly in the flavor and rather strong. I believe they hinted at red wine barrel aging? I think that has to be this fruit flavor. Regardless of how they did it, they have crafted a full complex and rather interesting beer. This embodies those complex floral notes that Russian Imperial Stouts should have intermingled with the chocolate and coffee roasted flavors of a stout. Chocolate and roasted notes are the biggest show cases here though. That sweet floral flavor is a background note near the end as it warms, but up front it is pretty damn powerful. 
Thick and creamy, yet not motor oil thick. I nice balance is struck here, but it lacks that perfect carbonation to round things out. Good but not great. 
I’ve only had a few firestone walker beers, but all have been outstanding for their styles and simply showcase level beers. This one…well it is competing with perhaps my favorite beers so it is hard to compare. It isn’t the coffee forward beer I had been lead by reviews to believe I was about to enjoy. It has barrel aged but really it reminds me more of non-barrel aged Russian imperials. All that said for the 25th best beer in the world, I’m a bit unimpressed. A perfect 5 in complexity, but is complex enough? Very very good, but truly great? Maybe a hair short. e 1,579 charactersbobhits, Aug 19, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.252011 Version.
Pours almost black (darkest brown ever) with a nice tannish brown small foam head that sticks around with a bit of lacing. 
Aromas begin with a ton of bakers cocoa powder. Dry, roasty bitter chocolate. Next I get a lot of the barrel; oak, vanilla, charred wood and some booze. As it opens up more I get some more of the sweeter dark caramels, nice sweet vanilla and surprising nuttiness in the background; really inviting. 
The taste begins with a lot of dark and milk chocolate flavors; next I get the darker roasted malts, not coffee per say just like a roasted nuttiness mixed with caramelized, borderline burnt sugars. Vanilla and oakiness and more subtle barrel flavors emerge as it warms a little more. There is a solid toasted, graham cracker underlying toastiness which I really like. As it continues to warm the charred barrel and roasted flavors dominate the finish. No heat or alcohol flavors which is always appreciated for beers of this magnitude.
Mouthfeel is full bodied but not too thick, syrupy or cloying by any stretch. Adequate carbonation which helps to balance the heft in this delicious monster. Finish is nice and dry (for the style, not compared to normally crisp dry hoppy ales or pilsners). Not too boozy but the heft is evident as you slowly consume the 22 ounces.
Overall this beer is stellar. Firestone Walker is definitely winning with their barrel aging series of beer and I have loved Abacus, the anniversary series and now Parabola. Definitely recommended for fans of barrel aged beers and big boy stouts. I am going to call this a sessionable Barrel aged Imperial stout as it is really balanced and blended so well you almost don't recognize the boozy barrel flavors initially. Basically, yum. 1,747 charactersclaspada, Aug 19, 2011

I've had this one a few times now and it seems different each time - and for some reason that I can't quite identify it isn't a beer that does all that much for me.
Pours a dark, dark brown with a tiny bit of mocha foam.
Initially smells of a lot of espresso, some vanilla and bourbon sweetness, before finishing with anise and some hoppy/burnt bitterness. As it warms more bourbon sweetness and booze shows up.
Flavors follow the nose - coffee, vanilla, bourbon, anise and a hoppy bitter finish. A bit sweeter as it warms. There are also some tobacco and leathery qualities. It's pretty well balanced - flavors blend fairly nicely - but aren't quite as smooth and well integrated as they could be. Despite the different flavors, it doesn't quite feel complex. Maybe a little time will help.
Mouthfeel is good - a bit creamy - but a bit thin (I like my stouts hicghly viscous).
A tasty beer that doesn't quite live up to the hype (for me). 977 charactersreadbaron, Aug 18, 2011
4.28/5  rDev -5.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 422oz bottle (batch 2) poured into a snifter:
A: Pours pitch black with about 1 finger of frothy mocha brown head that fairly quickly dissipates to a thin film with espresso-like bubbles. Decent lacing and alcohol legs.
S: Oh what have I gotten myself into! Bourbon soaked chocolate fudge cake, vanilla, coconut, toffee maybe a touch of espresso, a hint of dark fruit, bourbon-like alcohol notes. A little on the boozy side. 
T: The bourbon is right up front and a little hotter than I expected, but not overpowering. Tons of chocolate flow right behind the bourbon with all the nuances of the barrel aging. Vanilla, oak, coconut, molasses, hints of char and dark fruit. Finish is warm with just a touch of bitterness, the alcohol has a little drying effect though there does seem to be plenty of residual sweetness left. Charred wood and bitterness come through stronger in the finish. 
M: Full body, Moderate to slightly light carbonation. Extremely smooth and velvety texture. It is still a bit hot though.
O: A solid BA RIS that might be amazing with a little more time. It's a bit hot and bourbon forward right now, but otherwise a really solid RIS with a good bit of complexity. 1,188 charactersSatchboogie, Aug 18, 2011

aftertaste is quite nice linguring on my tongue for a while
overall an amazing ba russian imp, you can pretty much gurentee any of the firestone brews are gonna be solid!

N: Highly aromatic nose. Huge, sweet bourbon, very fine dark chocolate, sweet toffee, coconut, vanilla and hints of oak.
T: Oh my God! Rich, chalky dark chocolate, toffee, bourbon, creamy vanilla and coffee grounds upfront. This is followed by liquid dark chocolate, espresso, truffle and notes of cherry. Finishes with lingering vanilla, bourbon, oak, toffee, dark chocolate and a hint of coconut.
M: Medium-full bodied, chewy, soft, silky, creamy, sticky, warming and dry.
O: Absolutely phenomenal! Just the right amount of bourbon. Not too overpowering with fantastic vanilla and oak flavors. Complex, rich, thick and deep in flavor. Almost no alcohol presence. Makes an excellent desert beer. Save this one for a special occasion. 897 charactersjustintcoons, Aug 18, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Deep brown and tight brown head with good retention. Chocolate alcohol and oak. Rich chocolate and roasted balance with alcohol. Finishes with barrel aged rum, vanilla, and light peat with a rather high hop content. Thick robust and smooth.
Good balanced flavor with alcohol enhancing it. Roasted a little high and there are some nice notes but they are more at the end rather than throughout the beer. It’s extremely easy considering the beer with a great smooth flavor but, honestly, somewhat disappointing. My expectations were unfortunately high. 553 charactersBriken, Aug 17, 2011

A: Beautiful brown two fingered head with a creamy black body. This is exactly how I want my stouts to look.
S: OH MY GOD. I can't stop smelling this beer. Chocolate, sweet tobacco, coffee and a slight smokiness. If they made air fresheners that could copy this, I'd buy them out. As the beer warms, the chocolate really comes out as the forward aroma.
T: As the beer warms, the taste gets better. Alcohol is very well hidden by the chocolate, dark fruit, and coffee flavors. As it warms the chocolate goes from sweet to bitter. I'm also getting some cherry that I assume is from the barrels.
M: Good body and carbonation considering the ABV. Nice and creamy.
O: This beer has ruined other Imperial Stouts for me. This is probably one of THE best stouts I've had. I can't wait to see how this beer develops over time. 862 charactersActonBrewer, Aug 16, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Candied bourbon...this is a great boozy RIS. Normally I struggle with an alcohol as apparent as this, but for some reason this works for me. The bourbon is prominent, but there are many other complexities here. Vanilla and some barleywine on the nose. Caramel and molasses on the palate. Sticky and sweet, and of course the booze. Very warming and a true pleasure to drink. This is a really fine liqueur, riding incognito as a beer. 432 charactersRalphs66, Aug 16, 2011

S: Thick chocolate and coffee malts, molasses, bourbon and alcohol. Hints of coconut, vanilla bean and some more subtle notes of caramel and sugared fruits are present.
T/M: Big creamy mouthfeel with heavy and rich notes of chocolate and espresso on the initial sip. The coconut flavor is a beautiful touch. Bready malts and sweet vanilla go really well with the rest of the body. Maple and caramel sweetness are also some nice features. Burn of alcohol is not necessarily hidden, but not as intense as i would expect. Exceptionally smooth, rich and full overall body. Mild carbonation.
D: Fantastic. One of the most well-crafted beers i've had in a while. Easy drinkability for a very full bodied brew. 822 charactersYouSkeete, Aug 15, 2011

Smells strongly of caramel and toffee flavored malts, toasted bread and coconut. There is also a mild vanilla oak like element to the smell. 
The beer has a strong delightful toasted coconut flavor to it. The coconut flavor adds a smoothness to the beer. I get undertones of coffee, chocolate and caramel to the beer as well. There is a mild vanilla like flavor as well. The beer is very smooth. It is sweet but it is not too sweet and it has a nice amount of balance to it. 
There is a low carbonation and it has a smooth mouthfeel to it.
Overall a fantastically smooth Barrel aged imperial stout. It is not hot like many barrel age stouts yet it has a nice oaky and mild bourbon flavor. 743 characterschumba526, Aug 15, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52011 vintage. After lots of seeking, sleuthing, battling, and waiting, I'm finally gonna crack this one. It better be worth the hype and wait. Also gotta thank Visionaries and womencantsail for last year's vintage that I never ended up cracking.
Pours a fairly thick oil level viscosity midnight black syrupy looking beer, with a smaller 1/2 finger fizzy black head that fades fairly quickly, not one photon of light getting through.
Nose erupts with chocolate, baker's, dark, cocoa, hot chocolate, milk chocolate, etc. Some roast, light coffee, but not a ton of roasted malts, dark malts, fairly malty but lots of dark malt aromas, hints of caramel and dark crystal malts, hint of licorice and some oats. Then a light bourbon touch, some sweet candy bourbon, as well as a bit of a wood and barrel, with quite a bit of vanilla as well. Hints of booze waft out, and bring a very slight earthy hop kick.
taste starts creamy and luscious, dark malts just sit. It's fairly sweet from the loads of malts, balancing out the booze a bit that doesn't come on as strong as 12.5%, but you can tell is there with a bit of tingle and lots of warmth. Again loads of chocolate, some dark chocolate, baker's, hot cocoa and almost cocoa nib like addition, and creamy chocolate milk almost. Lots of oats as well bring a nice creamy thick almost gooey feel. The bourbon is there too, but not dominant, it plays a role in helping to round the heavy beer off, bringing more of the oak and wood, especially vanilla, but just a bit of the sweet molasses like bourbon. Then come the hops, it starts slightly bitter but gets more so the longer the sip goes and fades, bringing some big earthy hops, light spicy and chewy hops, a slight salty bitter hop quality. There is a slight touch of brine between the charred malts and earthy hops. As it fades, some caramel comes out with the vanilla, and a bit more of the bourbon, a big mouth coating that just blankets the mouth for minutes after, and still a bit sweet. But that all gives way fairly quickly to the bitterness and earthy hops that bring a bit more salty and earthy bitter tastes long after the sip is gone. 
Mouth is big bodied, very big, thick and luscious, creamy, a bit velvety, and slightly syrupy and mouth coating, lower but decent for the style carbonation, and some hot booze.
Overall great, worthy the hype I think. not the best of the big Imperial Stouts around, but definitely a great Imperial Stout. Big and bold, great stout flavors, doesn't overpower with roasted malts or briny scorched malts, and doesn't overpower with booze or sweetness but definitely lets you know it has both. The oak, wood, and vanilla help round it some, but the bourbon is just an afterthought compared to the big malts, chocolate, and other big flavors. The nice creamy and lucious feel are great. And then when the big earthy spicy hops kick in it really brings it up to hype level of awesomeness. Can't wait to see how it ages. 2,961 charactersjlindros, Aug 14, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Having another 8 bottles sitting around makes me feel extra special. 
Appearance - It pours a very dark liquid, almost black with a very dark brown color noticeable on the edge. Very minimal head that dissipated quickly. Lacing was similar to a web of tree branches down the glass. 
Aroma - Bourbon oak at first, then quickly came roasted coffee, chocolate, caramel, toasted malts, and finally molasses.
Taste - This is by far the best RIS I have ever had. Now on to the taste, roasted coffee, chocolate as well as molasses and eve some caramel. Just as the aroma implies. The bourbon barrel aging is clear in the finish of this lovely stout. The finish had me wanting for more and more. 
Mouthfeel - Rich, somewhat oily, full-bodied, viscous and awesome. No other like it.
Overall - Complexity in a beer is always welcomed here. The first sip showed how complex and rich this one is. In that respect it wanted to let you know that you should savor this beast. The finish did not linger for long, so I was caught taking quicker sips than I should of to savor it. 1,067 characterstrixdout, Aug 14, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance-Pours a thick viscuous black with a whispy-thin brown head that quickly bubbles away, leaves some legs and dabs of lacing but not much. Looks good.
Aroma-Powerful but not overwhelming, I could smell it the instant I opened the bottle. Woodsy oak soaked in bourbon is the first and dominant scent to assail the nostrils, other aromas include black molasses, unsweetened chocolate, dark cherries and the faintest hint of smokey charcoal. The smell is warm and 'inviting' to say the least.
Taste-The flavor begins with the aforementioned black molasses noted in the aroma mingling with light charcoal before being joined by the bourbon. The bourbon, rather than dominating or obliterating the other flavors, mingles with the other flavors as an equal adding its own unique brand of sweetness as it in turn is joined by the woodsiness of the oak barrel itself. The flavors of bourbon and oak persist towards the end before being joined by semi-sweet chocolate and black earthy coffee. The flavor lingers for at least half a minute, gradually losing sweetness until fading into a final dry and palette cleansing note. Phenominal.
Mouthfeel-Rich, thick, viscuous; hits every note that a big barrel aged RIS should hit in terms of mouthfeel.
Overall/Drinkability-The complexity and strength demand this beer be sipped and savored but it's so addictively delicious and drinkable for its ABV that you may find yourself taking sips in rapid succession. 1,457 charactersManoftyr, Aug 12, 2011

S: Rich toasted malts; chocolate, coffee. A little bourbon and wet oak. Caramel and vanilla came out as the beer warmed and the significant alcohol aroma cleared.
T: Just like the nose. Mellow and flavorful up to a warming, dry finish. Malt characters evolved as the beer warmed. Delightful malt complexity.
M: Medium body. Low carbonation. Smooth, rich and creamy up to a warming dry finish.

4.45/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Beautiful barrel-aged RIS, extraordinary blend from Firestone Walker that makes quite the sipper.
Presentation: 22 oz boxed brown capped bottle. Exposed cardboard box with the seal of the brewery presiding it and highlighting the name. Back box label notes history of the brewery, expertise aging brews in barrels, intent of ales and blending process, and Parabola overall release. Bottle offers a simple Firestone paper label with brewery branding and brew details, noting 2011 Reserve Series, O.G. 29.5, IBU 82, British Ale yeast, 167 SRM, a production of 3000 cases, and 12.5% Alc. by Vol. Served on a snifter. 
A - Black pour with a short-lived creamy head, small surface memory and a couple of shy touches of lacing.
S - Nice nose that while never as long as expected is good and emerges nicely after a while with vanilla, chocolate, roasted malt and bourbon notes.
T - Long malty flavor, plenty of bourbon takes a front seat as the brew sit for a bit, bitter coffee touches coating a long chocolate range, vanilla, caramel, touches of dark fruits under the bourbon, charred touches with a hint of tobacco and oak.
M - Full body, with low and smooth carbonation, creamy stickiness with a nicely woven boozy touch that shines slowly as the brew makes its way.
O - Beautiful sipper, comes through perfectly as it settles in the mouth. 
Notes: All hype is deserved. So far all the barrel aging, blending, and more I've been fortunate enough to try from Firestone Walker has been extraordinary and this one is right there. This might age beautifully, that is if one can resist keeping one set aside. 1,607 charactersDaniellobo, Aug 11, 2011

Well, this beer tastes like it's in between the two. The bourbon is a little hidden in the smell, but it comes through in the taste. However, it isn't as dominating as in the bourbon county, allowing the dark fruits to make their tiny presence known. Overall, a very good example of why bourbon barrel aging should be done more often. 404 charactersLintyfresh, Aug 10, 2011
4.36/5  rDev -4%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Seven A+ ratings in a row?! Unheard of! Overhyped, right? Dunno yet. Gonna find out. 
Burnt brown in color...wait. I'm looking at it in the glass and the aroma is tackling my olfactory senses, screaming to be heard. It demands the floor. Appearance can wait as the smell has commandeered my attention. I'll oblige. 
Booze, coffee, chocolate and roast. Yeah, the typical Imp Stout nose, but the balance is something else. Roast driving the coffee sense, I'm used to that, but the chocolate and the booze coming together to make a chocolate liqueur smell...that's new. Eat your heart out Godiva! The alcohol is really strong in the nose, but not unwelcome. I'm getting just a little hint of oak and vanilla from the barrel-aging, but not much. 
Back to the appearance...um, burnt brown color, right? Yep, covered that. As close to black that I've ever experienced in a beer. The head is a bit sad. It effervesces (like ginger ale) for a nonce and then gives up and acquiesces to the monster beneath. No lacing. I'm bummed about that, but all that booze may have killed the foam.
Holy Cramoly! This is one full-flavored and complex stout! The alcohol and the roasted malts really attack first. With a slight cherry essence and all that booze in there, one might think that kirsch was added. If you survive the twin attack of booze and burnt, the chocolate makes a reappearance and adds a little sweetness but it then gives way to roasted notes of coffee and burnt toast. The alcohol lasts into the aftertaste. I've only ever experienced that before with a Belgian strong dark, but if you let the beer really warm up the roasts take over in the aftertaste. Very interesting. 
Ever get one of those chocolate-covered cherry cordials that has WAY too much liqueur in it so that you barely taste the cherry and even the chocolate is subdued, that is what I get here. Not a bad thing...not at all.
The body is silky smooth as it brushes along your tongue like crushed velvet...crushed velvet that's been soaked in alcohol. Yes, there is a lot of heat in this one, but nothing too much for you to handle. The sweetness of the chocolate notes and the bitter of the roasted malts do much to knock it back a little. 
A handful of breweries are now starting to brew what they're calling Triple IPAs and I guess that means they're pushing for a new style. Fine! Let the hop heads have their superlatives. But if so, there needs to be a Triple Stout style as well. In that case, this would be the king of that category. Sorry DFH, WWS is too mondo sweet to take the crown.
I've looked at my scores and I don't think they'll keep the A+ rating going. Sorry. Maybe I should have finished half the bottle before I started to review. Maybe I'll come back after that and redo my scores. Nah. A phenomenal beer to be sure though and I will fight like a bride on a budget at a sale featuring designer wedding dresses at 90% off when it comes out again next year. 2,948 charactersNaugros, Aug 10, 2011

A: It's beautiful! It's a boy, Mrs. Walker, it's a boy (100 points to anyone who gets the reference)... Dark brown, caramel colored head, 2cm high, really lasts. I'm ready to dive in with my nose.
S: It smells of chocolate, coffee and alcohol at first. Behind it, there's a citrus hop note, orange, and the actual hop smell. I'm praying that this is as good as it tastes...
T: Oh. My. God. This is a tremendous stout! All the flavors that I smelled are confirmed, and with the power of the Dark Side. This is a Sith Lord of beer, and I could not be happier right now.
M: Spectacular. Not a rating I give out a lot. Medium-bodied, chewy, well-carbonated, sweet finish, glides over the palate smoothly. I'm duly impressed.
O: This is a tremendous beer. I only wish that my beer store had (a) bought more; and (b) allowed us to purchase more than one bottle. Outstanding with my leftover ribs. Cheers! 1,111 charactersbogus564, Aug 08, 2011

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a deep, deep brown almost black with brown hues on the edges. A very nice super dark mocha, almost milk chocolate, creamy head that fades to leave a nice mocha halo and good clouding. Very nice. 
S - Very nice rich carmel, roasted malts, chocolate, slight vanila and barrel, along with light bourbon.
T - Wow, this is good. This is damn good. More of the carmel and chocolate. Great roasted malts and oak with smooth bourbon. All these flavors work together in perfect harmony. So smooth and mellow and wonderfully done. The aging did this beer wonders. Again, no heat from this big ABV.
M - Smooth and creamy. So this is silk on the tongue with a touch of velvet. Superb. Practicly no ABV on the mouth.
O - Overall, this beer was spectacular. My only qualm, which is pretty trivial, is the lack of long retention. Nose could also be slightly stronger. This is still a spectacular beer. Glad I have 5 more bottles to mess around with. 1,109 charactersrudzud, Aug 08, 2011
4.94/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522oz bottle into a Duvel tulip. Thanks to BA morningthief for picking this up for me in Boston. 2011 batch, 12.5% ABV, 82 IBUs. 
Appearance: Free pour yields a 1.5 inch frothy tan head that dissipates slowly and leaves tight rings of lacing that don't last. Pours solid black. Big legs, no lacing.
Smell: Mostly a heavy caramel aroma, along with some roasted malt, chocolate, cookie dough, and a mild influence of oak and hops. Not enormously aromatic, but what's there is nice.
With some warmth, the aroma quickly opens up. The 12.5% ABV starts to show itself with some reasonably heavy booziness, but, as with many great high gravity beers, this deepens the other notes rather overshadowing them. The interplay of alcohol, hops, and deep pastry and dark fruit smelling malt (along with some restrained barrel influence) is very satisfying. 
Some surprising, savory molasses comes out late in the bottle, urging me to push this score up to a 5.0. I'm sold; there's the beautiful, decadent dessert stout depth, but the savory molasses and roasted aromas take it all to another level. Exceptional.
Taste: Mellow and smooth up front, with cookie dough, caramel, and some mild oak, leading to a welcome bitter and somewhat highly carbonated finish. Long aftertaste in which the bold alcohol heat dances with roasted malt, chocolate, and caramel (I know "dances with" sounds a little precious, but the heat persists while different beautiful malt flavors make appearances through the long aftertaste).
The flavor integration in this beer is amazing. The caramel, cookie dough, oak, and mild roasted malt flavors up front are silky smooth, rich, and utterly devoid of alcohol heat. Then the back end has a big hop kick, tons of heat, and lots of deep roasty stout flavors. While "start" and "finish" are very distinct, the notes (especially in the start) are in such harmony that it's more artificial than usual to talk about distinct cookie dough, caramel, chocolate, (etc) flavors. 
I hate to give out so many 5s, but this is a real "wow" beer. Virtually nothing left to improve upon here.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, very smooth and creamy, with a great bitterness and high carbonation apparent at the end that allows for the extremely rich flavor up front. Nice long aftertaste that tries its best to say "I know this beer is delicious and you want more, but take it slowwww...." Wouldn't change anything about it.
Overall: This is a stunning beer. I'd heard that Firestone Walker were barrel aging masters... and it seems they live up to their reputation. 
For the first couple sips, I thought, "This is indeed a great beer, with nice dessert flavors balanced out by bitterness and heat; around a 4.5 in most categories." Then in all aspects the beer just kept getting better... if you want more out of a beer than Parabola delivers, you're probably asking too much or are confused. Seriously close to perfection. 2,921 charactersPahn, Aug 08, 2011

4.68/5  rDev +3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Review #500!
’10 Vintage. Served at cellar temperature. A million thank you’s to the incredibly generous Ryan for this wonderful treat!
Pours thick black with a one finger brown head that leaves some spots of lacing and holds a small creamy cap all the way to the bottom of the glass. Very inviting.
The incredibly potent aroma features strong bourbon notes, deep dark roasted malts, premium dark chocolate, coffee beans & espresso, vanilla & oak, a touch of smoke and some alcohol. Like many top-tier bourbon barrel aged stouts, this is a great "sniffer" as I get just as much enjoyment from the aroma as I do the flavor. Wonderful.
Flavor is like bourbon-soaked chocolate-covered raisins, bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla, oak, premium coffee/espresso, some caramel, rich roasted malts, dark fruits, some molasses and anise, minimal hops, moderate alcohol but not bad at all for a 13% brew...well hidden for its size. Fairly sweet, one to sip and savor...a dessert in a glass! Super-tasty.
Mouthfeel is THICK and sticky, just the way I like it. I’ll put it this way...Ten FIDY is too thin for my tastes and Parabola is one of the heavier Imperial Stouts I’ve encountered. Soft carbonation. I’d score it a 6 if I could!
My goodness what a brew! I’m a sucker for bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts and this is top shelf stuff right here...right up there with KBS and BCBS. Saying this is amazing makes me feel like I’m selling it short...adjectives just cannot do it justice. Can’t thank Ryan enough for this one...wow! 1,542 characterselgiacomo, Aug 08, 2011

this is the fabled parabola, oh ya thanks Hank for this one. this poured a midnight black that had a very chocolate milk looking 1 finger head, that quickly dissolved into a dark ring of bubbles around the edge. the smell of chocolate and bourbon hit the nose first, kinda makes me think of cellared kbs, with hints of BBA 4D also in there. im looking forward to this first sip. definitely makes me think of BBA 4D with the first and second sip, i get the barrel aging, i can taste slight chocolate, a slight tang of malt and this lingering burnt aftertaste. the aftertaste im liking. this is a lively beer it has lots of dancing carbonation that leaves lots of tingle to the tongue. a nice wet finish to the sip and its off to the overall. man i could drink this more often, too bad its not in distro here. overall a good beer one that i would like to have at the end of a night, like i do with most of my imp stouts. This is an easy drinker for anyone that enjoys a good RIS and the flavors are very well paired and flow together nicely. Get one, at least one and youll be happy you did.
EDIT: the burnt flavor i was saying i liked earlier, well i dont like it so much now that its a lot warmer and closer to the bottom of the bottle, this taste is everlasting torture in your mouth unless you enjoy that ashy burnt carbonistic taste, pasted on your tongue. im not gonna change my score or rating or whatever but this is a bit irrattating 1,527 characterskaips1, Aug 07, 2011

Look: Darkest brown, both almost identical, very thin lace, with a really nice viscosity. Not quite motor oil, but pushing the envelope.
Aroma: 2010- chocolate,roast,espresso,vanilla, really well blended with a hint of dark cherry/plum/raisiny scent. alcohol is present but not over powering. 
 2011- more of a dark roast, closely followed by chocolate,vanilla, less of a coffee smell. a very slight hint of dark fruit. Alchol is more prominent. more of a grassy hop scent as well.
Taste: 2010 - Very low carbonation, well balanced over the tongue. Smooth, easy drinking. All the aromas are present in the mouth with a fantastic blend. nothing over powering. Alcohol is present and well hidden.
 2011 - Slightly more carbonated. Tastes are a little more definable. There seems to be a hop presence that fades in th e 2010. 
Mouthfeel: Both excellent. As good as it gets in this style.
Overall: 2010 - wins by an ever so slight margin. These two beers side by side was an exceptional treat. 1,041 characterscavedave, Aug 07, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Shared this one with the girlfriend who mainly likes dark beer. 
Poured out an oily black with some reddish highlights when held up to the light. Brownish head that was about half a finger but still stuck around for the whole beer. Nose is full and vibrant. Chocolate and coffee are big with cherry brandy and bourbon. Vanilla and roasted dark malts. Body is thick and warming. Flavor is a complex combination of layers. Chocolate and coffee, roasted dark malts, boozey bourbon and plum/raisin/cherry from the barrels. There is a definite alcohol finish that burns a little at your throat but it doesn't bother my palette because of the numerous flavors still lingering. I bought another bottle I plan on aging a couple years and at that point I'm sure the alcohol will smooth out and the many flavors will be meshed even better. 829 charactersDrinkingDrake, Aug 07, 2011

The aroma is intense, full of stinging sweet bourbon, and oak. Hints of vanilla, and cocoa hide behind these fumes with rich roasted malts and coffee notes. 
The taste is full of sweet bourbon and oak. Roasted malts,bakers chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and brown sugar make up the body. Earthy notes peek through to balance things out. Very complex and interesting blend. Nicely balanced but quite intense.
Super, silky smooth and creamy. An awesome beer, but definitely a sipper. 574 charactersJayS2629, Aug 07, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 Vintage. 12.5% ABV per bottle. 22oz bottle poured into a snifter.
Pours a solid black with a half finger of brown foam for a head. The head dissipates very quickly, leaving a thin tan ring around the glass. Tiny wisps of lacing stick to the glass with each sip and slowly slide back down. Pours pretty heavy and looks viscous as it hits the glass.
Nice aromas from the nose. Sweet at the beginning. Dark roasted malts, chocolately with some oak and vanilla. Some dark fruit is present but it's not as prominent as the other aromas. There is a nice bourbon note that is present throughout and it stings the nostrils when inhaled deeply. Really pleasant and complex.
The taste is extremely close to the nose. It's sweet, with some nice dark chocolate notes and some coffee, which wasn't in the nose. Roasted malt is here as in the nose. Dark fruit is stronger here but still in the background. Vanilla and oak notes are more prominent as well. The bourbon is again a nice complement. It is definitely strong enough to make itself known but stays in the background and allows the other flavors to play of it nicely. It does provide a pleasant warming feeling in the throat with each sip, which seems to be softened by a nice bitterness.
Huge, thick body with soft carbonation. Velvety, rich, silky and extremely smooth. There is a warming in the back of the throat from the alcohol but, as mentioned, there is a nice bitterness that evens it out.
This is really a fantastic beer. Huge and complex aromas and flavors, all playing off each other exceptionally. The aging in bourbon barrels seems to have imparted as much oak and vanilla as bourbon. Probably the most most balanced barrel aged stout I've had this fresh. 1,724 charactersms11781, Aug 07, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours out an extremely dark brown, bordering black. The head on this looks great. Its thick, medium brown and with excellent retention. There is a good amount of lacing as well. 
S - Roasted malts and tons of bourbon to start off with. There is also a good amount of smokiness. Undertones consist of vanilla, coffee and warming alcohol.
T - Taste is sweet. Lots of vanilla lots of cherries and again tons of bourbon this time with underlying oak flavors. Still getting the smokiness and the coffee seems to be playing a bigger part as well. Alcohol isn't as hidden in the finish and leaves a nice warm feeling.
M - Mouth feel is full bodied. Its thick, soft, silky and pleasant. Carbonation seems to be just right.
O - Amazing RIS. I'm so glad I got to try this. I Probably won't be getting another bottle of this some time soon so I' going to enjoy the hell out of this. 879 charactersdepechemode1983, Aug 07, 2011

The nose carries strong sweet bourbon barrel, bittersweet chocolate, toasted sweet coconut, freshly dark roasted coffee. The taste mirrors the nose if not somewhat amplified. Goes down relatively easy though it is a touch sweet and you know you are strong beer. Looking forward to trying this with some age on it. 415 charactersTrilogy31, Aug 06, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Yes this is one fine beer for sure. Black as pitch with a one a half finger light tan head. Fades away to a tan ring, but leaves lacing sheeting down the glass. The aroma is lovely bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, sweet white oak, and oh so balanced. What the aroma advertises the flavor delivers. Big on roasted malt, chocolate, bitter malt and paired with brilliant barrel aging - bourbon, oak, vanilla and char without being over the top. The finish is chocolatey, ashy and dry, not sweet or cloying in anyway. Nice and thick, but a little hot on the end. Overall I truly love this beer, eager to see how it ages. 612 characterspmlondrigan, Aug 06, 2011

A - Poured dark as the evening sky with minimal head and a tan lacing.
S - Chocolatey coffee with vanilla hints and a definate bourbon like quality.
T - Bourbon taste with sweet malts with hints of caramel, chocolate and coffee.
M - Velvety smooth with just the right amount of thickness.
O - This isn't just a beer, it's an experience, from the box packaging to the bottle, right down to what lies within. Definately the best stout I have had (although I am not normally a stout guy). Blended incredibly well, with all the flavors coming together in perfect harmony, and throw in 13%abv and I will seek this out whenever possible. 730 charactersGoGators, Aug 05, 2011

S: Sweet roasted cocoa with oak barrel aging prominent. Bourbon aroma present with cocoa and booze.
T: Strong bourbon and oak right off the bat. Extremely smooth with healthy chocolate flavors and more barrel flavors at the end. Yeah there is a little booze present, but not unfamiliar territory with something as unforgiving as bourbon. I really thought this went down very smooth and could definitely enjoy it as it warmed up even more. Very drinkable, light carbonation and medium to thick body. 
O: This is a keeper, I had not expected it to be this good based on the hype that some other beers have and have small run numbers. I cannot hate a great product that is brewed in larger quantities. Bravo Firestone, bravo 853 charactersalpinebryant, Aug 04, 2011

Poured into a chalice a very nice thick black color, very nice carbonation, with a quick/fizzy creamy tan head, which leaves a pretty nice medium size oil slick/island, with some minimal sticky lacing. The nose is very nice, malty, with a very nice touch of chocolate/toffee, vanilla, cherries, figs, plums, pretty nice bourbon/oak notes, some licorice, slight coffee. The taste is really freakn' awesome, malty, very nice vanilla sweetness, very nice touch of bourbon/oak, licorice, dark fruits, chocolate/toffee notes.

Beer pours black with absolutely 0 head, carbonation was still there, but just formed a thin layer of bubbles on the edge of the glass. Swirling it leaves a nice legging effect as beer sticks to the glass.
Smells great, lots of oak, little bit of bourbon, some nice caramel flavors coming through. Seems to be more balanced than most other barrel aged stouts. Amazing that this one has seen at least 12 months on wood.
Tastes a lot like it smells. Amazing finish on this one, seems to last for ages. Once again great balance between the deep rich stout, and the oak. Vanilla, coffee, dark fruit and caramel round out the palate.
A tasty treat, very happy to get a bottle of this, will open it at a stout tasting when the weather starts to get a little cooler. 939 characterspkeigs, Aug 02, 2011

M- Firestone makes a damn good bal-aged beer. Great balance, full and rich mouthfeel.

A - this is one of the darkest beers I've ever seen. Black pour yields black body. Medium brown ring of foam with a thin film and pack of bubbles in the middle.
S - Hot bourbon! Super Boozy! Vanilla and wood. Banana. Smoked meats. There are some good bourbon barrel notes and some good stout notes beyond the alcohol.
T - Lots of alcohol here too. Not as dominant though. Wood and smoked meats on the forefront, dark malty flavors, vanilla and bourbon sweetness throughout. But man, that booze really lingers.
M - This is a huge and beautiful mouthfeel. It's very smooth, very full. Only problem is the alcohol numbness that lingers when the beer is gone.
O - Well, I wish I had saved it longer. It seems like this would be exquisite with subdued alcohol notes. I guess some might call it a boozy mess. It's more of a boozy delight. 850 charactersColdPoncho, Aug 02, 2011

Thanks to Sean for this one. Shared with my brother, 22oz 2011 bomber split into two New Belgium snifters.
A: Pours jet black, dark as midnight, with a dark brown head and great alcohol feet; viscous and heavy.
S: Bourbon barrels; oak and vanilla; hints of molasses and dark fruit/red wine; dark roasted malts; and hints of earthy bittering hops.
T: A sweeter beer than I was expecting, with lots of chewy dark fruit flavors; the barrel characters (whisky/bourbon and red wine are discernible) and roasted malt and booze and woody notes all mixing together beautifully. There is some chocolate here as well, and slight coffee bitterness on the back end.
MF: Hella smooth, creamy, viscous, chewy. Medium/heavy body with light carbonation. The alcohol thins the mouthfeel a touch. 
O: A really good BA stout, with pretty intricate flavors and characteristics. I'm not sure how old this bottle is but a couple more months would only help; however it's quite enjoyable now. 1,072 charactersScotchboy, Aug 01, 2011

A: Carefully set in front of me because the pour ends right at the edge of the glass. Clearly, the server was not expecting any head formation. Very dark appearance, like a rich cup of coffee, with small brown bubbles settling at the edges forming an incomplete ring.
S: Very impressive complex aromas of coffee, cocoa nibs, butterscotch and toffee, sweet chocolate, and finally bourbon, but not overpowering
T: Vanilla first (a surprise due to muted presence in the nose) and great chocolate and toffee flavors, slight alcohol burn, bourbon on the tongue, tobacco lingers and dries the palate
M: Creamy, coats well, leaves a dry finish, alcohol not overpowering, one could drink this faster than expected

A- Pours pitch black with a half-finger mocha-colored head that quickly dissipates to a thin cap. Huge legs, but not much lacing.
S- I smelled this beast immediately upon opening. Barrel notes and bourbon greeted me upon cracking the cap and filled the room. Closer inspection reveals sweet sugary vanilla, chocolate, and well-cured tobacco notes.
T- Starts off intensely sweet with sugary malts and vanilla notes that are balanced by mellow barrel and bourbon flavors. Ends with spectacular tobacco and chocolate notes that also have a smokey character.

This brew pours a dark dark brown and settlea pitch black with mocha head. Oily lacing slides down the glass with grace. The nose is chocolate infused with oak, vanilla, basically bourbon characteristics. The taste is much the same. Sweet choxolate and toffee are presented up front, followed by a slight booze welcome.

Appearance: Pitch black with a one half finger tan head that recedes to a lacing.
Smell: Chocolate and coffee notes, brandy/bourbon, and heavy barrel scents dominate the nose. Smells very sweet.
Taste: Very good taste. The barrels play a major role but find the perfect mix where the beer still stands out on its own. It is very chocolate and coffee forward though neither are added. I want to say there is a good amount of Brandy and Bourbon presence, both of which work great in a beer like this. It is a little sweet and a little boozy but I feel that some time can take care of this.
Mouthfeel: Nice and thick which I like, slightly too carbonated but not overpoweringly so.
Overall: Lives up to the hype and I am so glad they distribute near me. Very solid beer and I am glad I have a vertical started as I would love to see how this ages over the years! 944 charactersOddNotion, Jul 30, 2011

Poured gently into a large Tripel Karmeliet glass. Pitch black with a faint, spotty tan head. Great lacing and sticks to the sides of the glass very well. Very viscous looking.
Aroma hits you right away with a deep, dark chocolate candy bar sweetness. Roasted malts, toffee, and oaky vanilla all there as well. Some slight warming alcohol comes through more and more as the beer warms up. The flavor is very similar to the nose but has a strong dark fruity/fig sweetness that mixes in well with the dark chocolate, vanilla, caramel and coffee flavors. Very big, bold imperial stout. Leaves a sticky coating on the palate and finishes with a warming alcohol presence.
Excellent offering from FW. Really enjoyed this beer. 821 charactersmuttyd, Jul 30, 2011

Pours a pitch black with a finger of cinnamon head that dissipates in a matter of minutes. 
Smells of oak, vanilla, and toffee.
The taste is very robust and vivid. The vanilla and oak hit first followed by toffee and light chocolate. There is a dark roast finish, but it's subtle. 
The mouthfeel is very thick and creamy. The alcohol gives off a fairly heavy burn, but it plays well with the oak and vanilla. I'd imagine this would drink extremely well with a year or two on it, but I appreciate it young, too. 
This is a top notch imperial stout well worth the hype and deserves to be in the discussion with the big boys. 824 charactersVonerichs, Jul 30, 2011

 A- Dark tan head upon a mild pour. Head fades to a very faint almost not even there head. Its as black as can be and no light will pass through this beer. Head seems to awaken as this beer sits and warms up, though its still not very much. 
S- Seems a bit muted upon first pour though charred wood and rum raisins strike me first. Really opens up upon warming.
Sweet bourbon smells are mixed with choclate covered cherries and other sweet aromas. All these compliment well with the charred oakiness. A pleasure to smell.
T- Buttercream frosting sweetness upfront melds to sweet cherries. All this is abruptly pushed out of the way by a charred smokey bitterness. Alcohol is evident and hot tavelling down the gullet. Leaves a dry charcoal taste in the mouth. This is very fine, like sipping on a fine bourbon. And tastes better as it warms up. 
M.F.- Thick and creamy. Like whole chocolate milk. Alcohol and carbonation provides a nice bite that doesn't leave the sweetness clinging to you your palate. Has a nice clearing effect. 
O- This is wonderful and will get plenty good with time. I suggest letting it warm up past 55 as it only seems to taste better the warmer it gets. This beer is still young, but its roughness is pleasent and reminiscent of sipping on a fine bourbon. Well done. 1,375 charactersnicnut45, Jul 28, 2011

Fancy cardboard 'case'. Nice looking bottle, love the label. 
Pours black, dark ruby tints around the rim. Nice off-brown, dense head. Love it. Solid, rich, smooth
aroma differs from the tap version a bit. This one has more of a chocolaty foundation. The leather, baked caramel, vanilla and wood are in there, but not as prominent. It's a smooth chocolate, not too sweet. Black plums and anise. 
yeah, taste is more chocolaty, too. It's complex, but not as much as tap version I think. The carbonation doesn't life the flavors up and around. Still, the black strap leather, plum, raisin, coffee, vanilla, and caramel. 
Feel is drier than tap, and it was fairly dry. Some tannin and velvet-ness at once. The chocolate gives way to a prune-like finish. Still smooth and darn tasty 847 charactersMebuzzard, Jul 28, 2011

Smells of bourbon, oak, malt, vanilla, chocolate, and a bit of cherry. Taste is mostly bourbon, followed by a sweet malt, chocolate, then comes the vanilla, and then slammed with more bourbon. Everything seems kind of meshed together though. Not layered very well. Burning in my nose from the bourbon. Mouthfeel is full bodied and creamy. Bourbon burns my cheeks. Kind of a funny finish on this. Overall, this dude is way too hot. It just tastes messy to me. It's good, but not what I was expecting at all. Very underwhelming from the reputation, and the rating, IMO. This was hard to get, and I've had better beers that are easier for me to get. I do have 2 bottles left, and I'm not touching one at all for at least a year. I'm hoping the bourbon mellows and there will be less of a mess. 857 characters1Adam12, Jul 28, 2011
4.34/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4On tap at Map Room. 10oz pour into a snifter.
A: The appearance was really the only unremarkable thing about this exceptional brew. That is, if you are of the traditional mindset that stouts (and especially imperial stouts) should be jet black. It actually was more of a very dark brown to light black, almost maroon-colored at the top when held up to the light. A surprising amount of dark tan head disappeared relatively quickly (expected), with minimal lacing on the snifter.
S: The bourbon hits you first, but is not overpowering. Raisins, cherries, caramel, and dark chocolate follow in a perfect harmony, all with an underlying oak base. A magnificent smelling beer. I would have given this a 6 out of 5 if possible.
T: Chocolate-y, raisin-y, dark fruits and bourbon. The bourbon is amazingly not too hot. Instead it is perfectly woven into the beer. At 13% I fully expected this to be way too boozy. I was glad to be proven wrong. I remember Goose Island's BCBS to be a hot, boozy mess at 13%. A lot of reviews indicated a vanilla taste - I did not perceive this. Perhaps this is something that is more present in the bottled version of this beer. Complaint: too much of a soy sauce presence in the taste.
M: Viscous and thick. Syrup-y. Often beers are described as "milkshakes" - this is definitely like a shake in every bit the best way.
O: Deceptively drinkable at 13%. Actually dangerously so. The beer got better and better as it warmed. Cut out the overpowering soy taste and this is a home run. 1,513 characterscccarson, Jul 27, 2011

Smells of coffee, chocolate, licorice, with hints of vanilla, oak, sweet bourbon and alcohol. Thick like maple syrup body has a creamy smooth mouthfeel and a light level of carbonation. Wow this one has some residual sugars that's for sure. Taste starts out with licorice and chocolate but they are assaulted with bourbon, vanilla and oak very quickly. Coffee and chocolate step in but disappear as the whole thing turns into an oddly dry finish. Long lingering alcohol heat and earthy hop bite rolled in roasted grains. This is a big beer that is tasty. I find it a bit hot in the finish, I'm curious to see what a little age does to this one. 735 charactersjohnnnniee, Jul 27, 2011

great small great mouth feel taste is 2 nd to none. Definitely the best stout i have tasted in a long time.
I have not tasted such a complex beer in a long time.
Bought the rest that was on the shelf from the only craft shop that carried it. 374 characterssbegraft, Jul 26, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Serving Container: Deschutes Tulip.
A- Pours a tarry black with a deep bronze head. Head retention is minimal (as is expected with a beer this heavy), and quickly recessed to a ring that clung to the sides of the glass. Beautiful.
S- Bourbon-y. Lots of vanilla, Almond, toffee, black licorice and hints of black cherry and expresso. Brilliant stuff.
T- Rather sweet to begin with, notes predominantly of bourbon and chocolate. As the middle of the beer approached, I began to taste more carmel, molasses and vanilla, along with the faintest hints of toasted almond. The back end continued this trend with a fulfilling, slightly hoppy aftertaste that harbored traces of black cherry. Finish lasted for a good half minute.
M- Creamy, with only a slight alcohol presence at the very end. Nearly flawless.
O- Bloody Brilliant. I could wax poetic about this beer for hours. Only minor flaws mar what was an otherwise fantastic tipple, flaws which will probably be eliminated after a year or two of aging. If I were king of the world, I would drink this with and for breakfast, lunch and dinner. 1,094 charactersnerow, Jul 26, 2011
5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Dark as night, absolutely viscous appearance. Very minimal head with strong lacing on the glass.
S - Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits, coffee, oak. You can barely smell the alcohol.
T - Sweet roasted malts and chocolate up front. On the back coffee, toffee, caramel, and vanilla. You can barely taste the bourbon.
M - Very good smooth feel. A lot softer then I would have guessed. Just like velvet.
O - Wow, that was the first word that came to mind after the first sip. This beer is as close as excellence can get in my opinion. By far the best beer for me this year and definitely in my top 5 all-time. Thank god I have one more bottle aging! 660 charactersSkiBum22, Jul 25, 2011

Big thanks to the Central PA group of the Gang Bang BIF for this bottle!
Another big Want brought forth thanks to this BIF. Good times. It pours a straight onyx topped by a finger of tan foam. The nose comprises chocolate syrup, roasted malts, molasses, very light oak, vanilla, and caramel. The taste holds notes of dark chocolate, roasted malts, molasses, light vanilla, very light coffee, and an even lighter touch of char. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a kinda chewy feel. Overall, a great impy stout, one that seems to warrant the hype it receives. Get some. 645 charactersTMoney2591, Jul 25, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I stalked the forums on this site for weeks and was lucky to grab a bottle at Hawthornes in the one day or so before it sold out. This beer poured black with a thin tan head. The aroma was of bourbon and oak, with notes of vanilla. The taste was a mix of notes of whiskey, brandy, raisons, and vanilla along with with some hop bitterness and alcohol burn in the finish as it warmed up. The mouthfeel was creamy and relatively light considering it's a 13% RIS. There's definitely a lot going on with this beer so it's better to sip it slow so you don't miss anything. This was a phenomenal beer and was worth all the effort it took to get it, and also worth the $21 I spent on the bottle. At this point, I'll try anything that this brewery puts out. 748 charactersjonvan04, Jul 24, 2011
4.52/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle of the 2011 batch, allowed to warm significantly before being poured into my Duvel tulip.
Parabola pours an impenetrable black. The dark caramel head ends up at three fingers of height. The foam shows good staying power, but lacing is a bit on the light side. The nose is very good, but not great for a barrel aged stout. Sweet milk chocolate with a vanilla base is the predominant aroma, but there are also background notes of coffee and a smooth bourbon presence. That set the expectations for an above average beer, but the flavor profile blows right past that en route to legendary. The entirety of the nose is present, and in addition, caramel, cherries, and marshmallow can be appreciated on any given sip. There's so much going on with this beer that not everything gets to shine through each time I raise my glass, but it's all here and it's all delicious. The body is as rich and full as I could possibly want, with carbonation that just cuts through the sweetness and preserves the beer's malty nature. I'm not sure that I'm ready to declare Parabola my favorite barrel aged stout (hi Bourbon County Vanilla, Rare), but if it's not it's surely in the pantheon of great beers, and more proof that no one is consistently brewing big beers to the quality the Firestone Walker is 1,298 charactersaxeman9182, Jul 24, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a snifter
A: Completely opaque black. There is not even any hint of light around the edges when held up to a very bright light bulb. When I poured it, there was a very thin head, more of a cap, of tan foam. This quickly dissipated into a small ring around the edge of the glass which left very light lacing.
S: The smell is sweet and dark. I’m getting a lot of fruit smell, primarily raisins and cherries. There is a powerful backbone of sweet roasted malts which give the smell a lot of its heft. Alcohol is a notable smell and it blends well with the bourbon scent.
T: This is a big beer. The first thing I taste is a lot of dark roasted malts which give an almost sweet taste to open up with. The quickly moves into a warm, boozy bourbon flavor. The fruit scents from the smell are here as well and smell slightly lighter with an emphasis on cherry and wine. The oak flavor is very strong and becomes even more noticeable as the brew warms, complementing the spiciness of the bourbon and alcohol. Throughout the drink I can taste a sweet vanilla flavor. There are also notes of coffee, dark chocolate and toffee. What is fantastic about this beer is the balance. I can taste all of these things at once as I savor and focus on individual flavors. Nothing here is too dominant and everything comes across clearly.
M: Thick and full-bodied. Not too syrupy and the alcohol is moderately well hidden.
O: Unquestionably one of the best stouts I’ve ever had. Incredible range of flavors that somehow remain balanced and appreciable. 1,573 charactersWankelEngine, Jul 24, 2011
4.09/5  rDev -9.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Parabola 2011 looks black, thick, and syrupy, but that syrupyness does not translate to the taste or the mouthfeel; it's drier than you would expect. The bourbon soaked wood hits you... and burns you. It's not as balanced of a beer as KBS flavorwise and a little too hot with the bourbon. I feel myself wanting more dark chocolate, better quality coffee flavors, and less bourbon and oak. Hints of Madagascar Vanilla bean shine on the palate, but the smell of Parabola is better than the taste for me. 501 charactersaficionado, Jul 24, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into my DFH snifter. Shared with fellow BAs infi, brun and several others.
Pours that thick, dark inky blackness of all good imperial stouts. Impossible to see through and that's just the way it should be. Dark cream-colored head rises to about half an inch before receding, leaving really sticky, spotty lacing. It's really easy to see the legs on this brew too, they're quite present and possibly sexier than a supermodel's. Smell is full of that amazing buttermilk aroma that is only present in the rarest and greatest of imperial stouts, so this is definitely a good sign for Parabola. Dark cocoa follows that up, along with a smattering of roasted malts, dried dark raisins and dates, and that assertive bourbon. Wow. Just nothing short of exceptional.
The dark roasty malts are evident right from the get-go, providing a sweetish introduction into the big bourbon kick that follows. Lots of boozy warmth overrides the palate, but it's never overpowering and serves as a complement to the other flavors, which is a great thing because those others are hints of vanilla, dark baker's chocolate, dried fruits and toffee. In other words, some of my absolute favorite characteristic components of imperial stouts. All the nuances are balanced very well, allowing you to enjoy all of them to the fullest. Finishes with a drying, coffee twang and some more bourbon goodness, along with a little bit of oak as well. Mouthfeel is full, with just that right amount of weight on the tongue. It's coupled with a velvety smooth texture and chewiness that's just sublime. 
Parabola really is a fantastically amazing beer. Very few things live up to the hype, but I'm glad to report that this particular brew not only delivers, but sets the bar so high for other beers of its style. So glad Firestone Walker is distributing on the East Coast now, allowing me and my fellow Mid-Atlantic BAs the opportunity to taste this superb drink. 1,948 charactersr0nyn, Jul 24, 2011
5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer poured jet black with a thin brown head. the head faded fast, leaving no lave.
This beer smelled strongly of vanilla. I also got some oak aroma, mixed in with some bourbon. Sweet caramle and molasses were alos poesent. A slight chocolate note mixes in as well.
This beer tastes like it smells. Sweet caramel with a healthy dose of vanilla. Bourbon as well, but more subtle.
This beer very smooth. It leaves a vanilla like aftertaste. The alcohol is well hidden in the aroma and the flavor.
This beer might not make a good session beer because it is pretty high in alcohol. 
Overall: I had this at Howie and Sons in Visalia. I have had it before, and I have always loved it. This is probably one of the best bourbon aged beers I have ever had. 757 charactersOStrungT, Jul 23, 2011

A - Viscous and dark as night. Very little head and strong lacing on the glass.
S - The smell of this beer changes with the temperature. Colder temperature you'll pick out more of the coffee and oak character, but as it gets warmer you'll start to really notice the chocolate and bourbon smells.
T - All I have to say is wow. This might be my favorite "rare" beer of 2011 due to its availability and cost. The taste is phenomenal! Chocolate, coffee, oak, bourbon. The alcohol is barely detectable.
M - Viscous and syrupy. Definitely something you want to drink before having other beers.
O - As stated above, this might be my favorite stout of the year that's widely available. It's just a great beer for a great price and can be had without standing in ridiculous 4 hour lines at brewery releases. 904 charactersunitmonster, Jul 22, 2011
4.76/5  rDev +4.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bought on 7/21/11, and tasted on the same day. Poured it into my trusty Shakey's Mug, and it poured jet black with a nice tan head on it. I have to say that I was unimpressed with the smell. I tend to like the molassesey smelling stouts. Once I took a taste of it my opinion quickly changed. This is one fantastic tasting stout. I really liked the after burn in your throat you get about a minute after drinking it. It tastes of strong coffee, and dark chocolate. It has an after taste of bourbon to it. I have been eating a Chocolate Crisp Bar, bought at Aldis, with each stout that I drink to see if it brings out the chocolate taste. I can say that this one goes great with a piece of chocolate when you drink it. This one has been the tastiest by far. 755 charactersGritch, Jul 22, 2011

A- Pitch black with one finger light brown foam, and good lacing on the glass.
S- Chocolate, oak, vanilla, dark fruits, coffee, bourbon, and you get just a hint of alcohol.
T- Sweet roasted malts and chocolate, followed right away by coffee, vanilla, and oak. Dark fruits, bourbon, and bitter chocolate/coffee at the finish. Surprised how well the alcohol is masked, although it is more noticeable as the beer warms.
M- Full bodied. Has a bit of an oily feel to it. Slight dry finish with alcohol present, again more so as it warms.
O- I would say Parabola lived up to the hype. Abacus has a slight edge in my book over Parabola both Parabola is one of the best Imperial Stout's I have ever had. Can't wait to try this on tap somewhere. 769 characterskawilliams81, Jul 21, 2011

That's right, off the shelf in NH!!!
Price - $13.49/bomber
This bad boy pours midnight black with a creamy one inch tan head. This beer is dark and sticky with polka dotted lacing staining my Imperial Stout snifter. It simply looks dark and delicious.
The aroma is strong in the nose with bourbon, dark chocolate, burnt wood, tootsie roll a hint of honey and a whole lot of sweetness. The scent is powerful and addicting which keeps me sniffing the glass before each sip.
The flavor is close to a masterpiece. A wonderful balance of malts and hops that just blows my mind. Chocolate, molasses and caramel followed by vanilla bourbon. Unlike other bourbon beers I've had this one is much more subtle in the flavor and not overdone.
The mouthfeel is thick and sticky with an amazing balance between sweet and bitterness. The finish is both smooth and peppery as the vanilla and bourbon tear into the taste buds.
Overall I really dig this one. I'm confused with the release date though but at the same time delighted. I only wish I could get this on a regular basis. 1,138 characters05Harley, Jul 21, 2011

Pitch black, slightly opaque. One finger fine bubbles espresso foam colored head rises just as quickly as it falls into a fine collar of microscopic bubbles. To style, but nothing speshul.
Smell is bourbon forward with vanilla, caramel and light wood notes up front. Then it moves into a more chocolaty finish.
Taste Shows a lot of barrel and heat up front then moves into chocolate caramel and charcoal notes. Finishes sweet with touches of vanilla caramel and an ever so slight bitterness.
Mouthfeel is exceptional, silky smooth, not over carbed and wonderfully warming. Truly outstanding.
Overall this is a great beer but I'm on the edge about seeking out more. I'll probably wait until next time it releases and make another pilgrimage to NY beer mecca. 867 charactersSTEG, Jul 20, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage.
Pours an opaque black with a 1 inch khaki head that fades to a thin film on the top of the beer. Foamy rings of lace form around the glass on the drink down. The smell of this beer is very complex with toasted coconut, vanilla, wood, milk chocolate, and roasted malt. Taste is the same as the nose with more of a cocoa powder flavor coming through than milk chocolate. Mild roasty bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a thick and creamy mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout with very complex smells and flavors. Some of the smells and flavors remind me a lot of Abacus which I can only assume is from the barrel aging program both beers went through. I am glad I have a few more of these in my cellar to enjoy in the future. 800 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jul 19, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5b2, 2011 – #1 of 9 at the NYNENYGHT.
Poured into Corsendonk tulip.
Typical stout-colored bodied with transparency and vibrant, blood red edges when held towards the light. Half-fingered mocha colored head that also had some hints of red in it. Very beautiful looking and a sight to behold. Bourbon-barreled oak aging is something I'm truly beginning to understand. The vanilla character from the oak tannins was so incredible in this. Buttermilk sweetness all around. Also found in an '08 BCBS and the Founders CBS/KBS. It's always the first scent that catches my attention. But underneath that huge, buttery aroma are detectable hints of melted, milk chocolate; caramel, and the 13% boozy heat on the back end.
Taste began with a little, spicy bourbon kick but immediately segues into a strong and sweet malty backbone, embellished with tons of smooth and milky caramel and vanilla touches. On the finish is a burnt coffee-like astringency that leaves a lingering dryness on the palate. Great amount of balance in the beer. Seriously, a very great tasting beer.
Mouthfeel is incredible. My brother said it perfectly– it drinks exactly like chocolate milk. Same smooth and silky texture. An absolutely, incredible feel. Thankfully we were able to pick up multiple bottles of this mathematical shape. I had huge expectations for this beer, after hearing many good things about it, and it really surpassed them. Thank you to FSW for actually distributing to us in NY. A long time want for me! 1,499 charactersinfi, Jul 18, 2011

Pours a thick, viscous black with a large dark tan head that slowly recedes. The smell is rich and chocolate. It is big and luscious with a hint of roastiness. There are notes form the barrel aging with some vanilla and oak. The flavor is a bit boozier from what I've have liked it to be, but nice regardless. Flavor also picks up chocolate and perhaps some caramel with a big dose of coffee, oak, vanilla, dark fruits, and alcohol. It isn’t ultra-complex at first, but then as you drink more and more of it subtle flavors come out. The warm alcohol sensation is a bit cloying. A solid imperial stout from a fantastic brewery nonetheless! 688 charactersCuriousMonk, Jul 18, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 22oz brown bomber into a clear glass snifter. 2011 vintage. Purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA) for $15.99.
A: Black with 1-2 fingers of light brown, fomay head with decent retention and plenty of lace forms down the glass.
S: Dark maltiness dominates easily above the bourbon qualities, although the oak and vanilla are certainly as strong as the bourbon character. The dark malt notes highlight fig, coffee, dark and milk chocolate. There are some minor earthy hops contributions.
T: THe flavor is bold and unapologetically big beer in nature with a huge chewy dark maltiness including espresso, dark chocolate, and dark fruits like fig and raisin. The hops component is balancing mainly with some earthy, herbal, tobacco roundness. The vanilla and barrel qualities are most decidely oak in nature, with very little bourbon component. Alcohol mainly produces a warming effect, although there is some cherry-berry quality of it too.
M: Very smooth and chewy but not as heavy in body as you would imagine for the ABV.
O: A very interesting beer that really aims high. I still like Bell's Expedition and a handful of other RIS's better, but I plan to grab another bottle and age this as I think it has a lot of aging potential with the high ABV and complex maltiness. Parabola is an excellent brew. 1,328 charactersargock, Jul 18, 2011

Aromas are wonderful and quite pronounced. Vanilla, chocolate, coconut and booze notes.
Taste is of toasted coconut up front, dark roasted malt flavors, bitter bakers chocolate, and a bit smoky. Beer them settles in some creamy vanilla, toasted oak, and some warm booze and pine bitterness on the finish. Very complex and full flavored.
Mouthfeel is good, quite soft, but with good body. Wish it was a touch heavier though.
Overall, an outstanding brew. I can see how this makes a great component of the anniversary beers. Another home run barrel aged beer from Firestone Walker. 644 charactersflexabull, Jul 18, 2011

A: Pours like I'd expect from a 12.5% stout, pitch black, viscous, minimal head, color of cocoa colored head, some lacing
S: the nose is perfect. Mellow notes of vanilla, coconut, and raisin give way to rich dark chocolate and some coffee character. The bourbon and oak character pairs with the base beer in a synergistic fashion. Amazing.
T: the stout character comes first and presents with huge roasted profile and then comes waves of vanilla and oak which build up as this brew is sipped. This brew features impeccable balance considering the high ABV and the bourbon aging. Very nice.
MF: smooth velvety texture, mellow carbonation, no issues here
O: This beer lives up to every bit of hype that has been mentioned. The only bourbon barrel beer that I can think of that has better balance is Bourbon County Rare. This one is well worth seeking out. 899 charactershomebrew311, Jul 17, 2011

4.12/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42011 Bottle - Figured it was finally time to drink one of these.
A: Pours dark brown/black with a pretty fluffy tan head and minimal lacing. For a beer this big, I'm kinda shocked at the level of carbonation and lack of viscosity.
S: Bourbon, oak and sweet chocolate come together with a hint of alcohol as well. This smells a bit like a chocolate cake covered in bourbon. 
T: Bourbon and chocolate are the two predominant flavors up front with some hints of vanilla. The finish interferes with the deliciousness, however: the combination of oak, roasted malt and a bit of heat combine to detract somewhat from the awesome start.
M: Medium-bodied and a good amount of carbonation, not nearly as thick or flat as most beers this big. 
O: This is my 2nd time having Parabola, and the first time I thought was mindblowing (but it was at a beer festival, so I didn't review it ). Upon further reflection, perhaps I overlooked a few of the flaws in this beer - most notably the odd finish. That said it's still a damn good beer, but I'm glad I sat down with it on its own to properly evaluate it. 1,096 charactersstarrdogg, Jul 17, 2011

poured into a snifter glass.
Appearance: dark black beer with dark brown head. This beer really is got a huge head for a barrel aged beer.
Smell: Barrel notes of vanilla, oak, and bourbon. Also chocolate and dark fruit come through the barrel notes as the beer warms to room temperature.
Taste: follows the nose of the beer really close bitter chocolate upfront that integrates with the vanilla, oak, and bourbon. Mild boozy heat noted in aftertaste and as you exhale after a sip of beer. Dark fruits, molasses and tobacco all linger in the back adding nice complexity to this great RIS. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied beer with low carbonation but, its almost moderately carbonationed. Silky, oily, and sticky.
Overall: This beer has beat the hype and still remains a fantastic beer! Taste is similiar to Older Viscosity. Really well done and really enjoyable. 919 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jul 16, 2011

Sits a near perfect midnight black in the glass. Some ruby highlights around the edges. No head rises, no lacing whatsoever. There's an oil like consistency to this beer.
Broad and complex to say the least. Vanilla, bourbon and oak off the bat with toffee, dark fruits, tobacco and bitter dark chocolate. Some very mild grassy hops. This is tremendously balanced. Everything in equal doses, nothing outshining anything else. Fabulous.
Follows the nose closely. Vanilla and bourbon up front. Lightly toasted oak, dark fruit, tobacco, toffee and bitter dark chocolate through the middle. The finish is of rich chocolate, dark fruit, bourbon, and vanilla.
Full bodied, rich and decadent. Oily/sticky and just plain delicious. It works really well with the breadth of flavors/aromas going on but I can really see the smoothing out with age.
Overall, this is a pretty spectacular RIS. It reminds me a lot of fresh Kate, just not as smooth. However, the barrel aging makes up for some of that. The flavors and nose are there, it just lacks on some of the finer points. An excellent RIS. 1,119 charactersColForbinBC, Jul 16, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A-This beer pours absolutely black. Motor oil slick as is glugs from the bottle. A thin tan head forms and dies away leaving a film atop the viscous liquid. Tiny patches of lacing speckle the glass. Big, intimidating look from a big, bad stout. 
S-Wow. Big, and frighteningly rich aroma. Powerful notes of chocolate and wooden goodness. Vanilla extract and burnt roasted coffee. Alcohol is detectable but it should be here. The bourbon aroma is not overwhelming but is at a great balance. Dark, dried fruits are also there. Smells like a chocolate brownie dipped in coffee liqueur.
T-Oh my, this is absolutely delicious. Luscious chocolate hits me first. Then the vanilla, dark fruitiness, and wooden oakyness come into play. The alcohol is big and bold but I love how it plays with the flavors. Just an unbelievably rich, and complex beer. I get some awesome toffee flavors here too. The flavor absolutely lives up to the hype here. Very happy.
M-Viscous and slick. Gentle bubbles tickle the tongue. The alcohol rounds out the feel. Exceptional feel for a big RIS. Iam a big fan of the carbonation. And the aftertaste is awesome.
O/D-Yeah. This lived up to the hype, and then some. I was worried having such a huge beer on a warm night would not be the best idea, but I loved this one. Firestone Walker seems to be one heel of a company. Double Jack and now this one...doing an unbelievable job. I love how its boxed, and for $12.99 in MA; the price is actually pretty damn good. Absolutely a great time in a bottle. 1,521 charactersVelvetExtract, Jul 16, 2011
4.26/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Based on the information passed around on the forums, this review should have been posted a few weeks ago. 22 oz. bottle into a Duvel tulip.
The pour is... audible, like olive oil from a jug. Thick and viscous, though there's a curious soda-like carbonation. The one-finger head reminds me of cappuccino froth, and it lasts and clings to the glass. Very nice.
Plenty of fresh coffee grounds in the nose, with a hint of vanilla - cafe au lait comes to mind. Overall, the aroma is pretty restrained: even as it warmed, this didn't give off a particularly rich or full bouquet. 
Loads and loads of bourbon in the taste. The -bal presence is enormous, and there's charred oak and leather to go around. That said, this isn't brash or abrasively hot, and the heat is pretty mellow. The finish is all bourbon, and it lasts and lasts. Fudge brownie flavors from the base beer counterbalance the liquor character. 
I had a feeling the mouthfeel would be spot-on from the pour, and I wasn't disappointed: thick and rich, this is a modicum of the style. 
Right out of the gate, I prefer Parabola to fresh BCBS. I'm very excited to lay this down for a year or so - it's a little one-dimensional right now, but it'll be spectacular in 2012.
EDIT: Happened upon a bottle of 2011 this past week. This beer has matured beautifully over the past several months. The barrel presence has mellowed without losing its bourbon bite, but the base beer has taken on an absolutely gorgeous, mellow dark fruit sweetness that complements the chocolate notes very well - it is, in many ways, quite akin to BCBS. This is drinking so well, and I am updating my score accordingly. 1,655 charactersamphion1065, Jul 15, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A huge thanks to Thorpe429 for sending this one! 22oz brown glass pry-top bottle with plastic "foil" and a box. 2011 release.
Pours super thick inky black with very thin light tan head. Nose is dominated by an espresso notes and roasted grains. Coffee, toasted oak and mild dried fruits.
Palates is slick and big, but structured. Dried fruits, black vanilla beans, heavily toasted oak, creamy cappuccino froth, woody earthy (mulch) and top soil. Sweet cream and vanilla ice cream come to mind on the finish. Long, and gripping (woody) finish.
Yum. A bit less sweet than BCBS, but in the same flavor bracket. Super tasty...I want more!!! 639 charactersSFLpunk, Jul 15, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5just about ethereal -- (i think Abacus may have the edge), but what does that say about these beers? one an imperial stout, one a barley wine -- well -- "barrel-aged" of course. and while the barrel aging provides an incredible overtone to the taste and aroma -- this beer shines on the depth of the malt base -- a simply delicious, delectable fine luxurious drink.
pours a good rich black as night with a MILKY WAY of tan swirl and froth in the middle of the glass. you sort of get a Big-Bang/moment-of-creation in the pour.
smell is amazing -- deep chocolate and roasted malt, spicy, hazelnut -- very inviting aroma.
serve not too cold and you get a smooth smooth drink -- the bitterness is sooo appropriate -- perfect bite on top of the rich filling stout. you can sense the QUALITY of this brew as you sip -- the roasted, chocolate and caramel malts dance on top of a rich base and the barrel aging provides the vanilla/liquor MELLOWNESS. did i say SMOOTH already?
SUPERB DRINK -- wowed by abacus, floored by parabola. 1,026 characterscolforbin73, Jul 14, 2011

Appearance: (4.0)
- Nice super dark murky brown and black. Thick fingers of mocha tan head, nice and creamy looking.. slowly settles to a thin blanket and large ring ready to create more rings the whole way down the glass. 
Smell: (4.5)
- Lovely sweet toffee, vanilla, oak earthiness and a tart bourbon touch. Barrel aging has worked well with the aroma on this stout. Chocolatey smooth grain and sweet creamy candy. Light grassy bitterness.
Taste: (4.0)
- Very sweet toffee, vanilla, and bourbon flavors melded very well with a candy-like chocolate and dark bitter chocolate. Big bourbon notes with fantastic flavor. Dry bitter grassy and earthy hops are quite present as well to attempt to balance this sweet beast. Super good and doesn't taste too hot. Guessing this beer will taste even better with a few years on it. 
Mouth Feel: (3.5)
- Little sticky and syrupy as of now. Cloying, chewy, and drying. Pretty viscous body with a healthy amount of carbonation. Not too bad, but again, something I feel will get much better, and maybe even more creamy and less sticky with age. 
Overall: (4.0)
- This is a stellar stout, and rises above many in its field. It is damn fine fresh, and is sure to be a real hit aged. I am hoping to find a couple more to cellar as I now only have one left in the cellar. Damn good, and get it while you can. 1,384 charactersDocer, Jul 14, 2011

July 4th 2011
*From notes
I'm skipping ahead in my reviews a bit as this is my 200th, and thought it only right to make it a special one.
A: As expected, it's a rich and dark molasses - almost black. A gorgeous 1.25 finger head that looks like the crispy edges of a homemade chocolate chip cookie. Decent lacing rims the snifter.
S: Dark caramel and chocolate. Rich, with thick layers of tobacco and cocoa that you can cut with a knife. As it warms, that toasty coconut I love so much comes out. The alcohol is present from beginning to end. A top notch bouquet.
T: Boozy. It's apparent from the get-go that this could take some time in a proper cellar. The tanninic acid and bourbon come out right away and never let go. As it warms, the beer really opens up - the toasted coconut and melted 65% dark chocolate come out to play. A refined layer of malt balances the heat here, and the nuances of this beer really come to life over the hour-plus I consumed it.
M: The mouthfeel is good. Very good in fact, but not great. The rich feel to this one is thick and luxurious, but I've had bigger stouts. It's also a bit oily from the barrel conditioning, though it doesn't effect the overall presentation of the beer.
O: Firestone-Walker's Parabola is a wonderful and masterfully balanced Russian Imperial Stout. I feel that with some age, this could be one of the best RIS's in my cellar.
Without question, Parabola is in the upper echelon of the style. I highly recommend seeking it out. 1,558 charactersRhettroactive, Jul 12, 2011
4.03/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Reviewed from Notes
Black with thin light brown head. Lacing is more along the lines of how wine sticks as a film. Smell is somewhat mute with some dark malt and slight hint of booze bourbon. Flavor is more complex, lending some more bourbon than the smell as well as hints of chocolate and fruit. I feel like there is another liquor working here, but having trouble picking it up. A hint of smokiness as well. Slight burn from the alcohol here. Lighter mouthfeel than I prefer, but still acceptable. Overall, another unique interpretation by Firestone Walker here. It’s not your standard barrel aged stout. The complexity of the flavors keeps me guessing some. 664 charactersBlanco, Jul 11, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5OK, so I had to pick one of these up, even though it's not exactly a "summer" beer. It pours very thick into a tulip glass. Dark, thin head. Black color, no light coming through at all. Smell a little chocolate, not much else going on. Ahhhh, but the taste. Roasted malts, chocolate. Absolutely delicious! I rarely comment on the mouthfeel, but I really dig the creamy, heavy taste of this beer. Overall, one of the best stouts out there. Must grab another soon! 462 charactersDrStiffington, Jul 11, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -6.6%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52011 22oz bottle enjoyed for hours on end.
A: Pours pitch black. No real head to speak of but some slight bubbles and whisps of foam. Standard barrel aged stout.
S: Whoa, lots of that great sweet bourbon emanating from this glass. Smells of chocolate, brown sugar, molasses, and some alcohol.
T: This is awesome! Big and bold flavors. First thing noticed was that sweet bourbon flavor, it is so well integrated into this beer. Flavors of bitter chocolate, lots of licorice, brown sugar, dark candied fruits, oak barrel flavor, and plenty of alcohol to make you slow down and enjoy the complexities. Some roastiness is left over after the swallow with a very slight lingering hop bitterness.
M: Thick and creamy. This has a lot of sugar so it leaves your mouth slightly sticky. Quite low carbonation.
O: This beer is instant gratification from the moment you pop the cap off. I would jump at the chance to get as much of this as possible. Firestone does magical things with barrel aging, this and their anniversary beers have set the bar very high with that technique. I might open my next bottle once the heat drops out some, this is a slow sipper by all accounts. 1,169 charactersschwaeh, Jul 09, 2011

22oz bottle poured into a Duvel Tulip, served at cellar temp.
A: Pours pitch black, motor oil thick. The pour came with a small half fingers worth of head -dark mocha in color. Little to no lacing left on glass. 
S: Bitter dark chocolate followed by mocha/expresso and bourbon. Also getting some rich molasses and vanilla along with some woodyness, Oak? The nose is very rich and complex. With one sniff, this beer will have you on your knees. Very, very good. 
T: Oh. My. God. FanFREAKINGtastic. Once you start sipping you just can't stop. Bitter sweet dark chocolate paired with charred oak and vanilla. also some expresso notes coming through along with a small amount of dark fruits. There is some booziness coming through in the taste of bourbon, but that is to be expected this fresh. Its actually a nice note that works well with the other flavors. This thing is like sipping on a nice scotch. Rich, complex and satisfying. 
M: Full bodied, with some carbonation. Would like a little more carbonation, but that is to be expected with a barrel aged beer. There is a slight amount of heat from the alcohol but unlike with most beers, it blends in perfectly with the other flavors. 
O: This beer is one for my own beer tasting history book. Completely amazing. I only bought one to try, but I will be going back TOMORROW as soon as possible to pick up some more. Worth every freaking penny spent. 1,418 charactersCaptainTripps, Jul 09, 2011

Mouthfeel is nice and punctuates the very thick body.

Appears a super dark brown with a tiny tinge of black. The most fantastic swirl ever of a tiny film is appearing on top that looks like something from Led Zeppelin 4's cover.
Smells a bit of licorice. I smell the classics: coffee and dark chocolate.
Taste is excellent but a bit heavy. All the smells are present in the taste. What's interesting in this beer is that the tastes blend together in a good way... they meld.
Mouthfeel is really nice. Consistent with a slow finish.
I very much enjoyed this beer and am so happy that I was able to try it. Super-limited edition that I was able to get two of. Having my second tomorrow. 676 charactersYagman3000, Jul 08, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter. Utter darkness. Not even a hint of light coming through this beer. There isn't any head to speak of. What little there was, dissipated quickly. No lace is sticking around on this one, this is possibly due to my snifters being washed in the dishwasher (tisk, tisk) or maybe just the high abv.
Smells of vanilla, coffee, and chocolate, with hints of bourbon barrels and a little smoke. All these are wrapped up in a nice whisky booze package. It almost smells as fantastic as The Abyss.
Tastes of dark roasted coffee, bitter chocolate and brown sugar. There is also some spicy flavors of tobacco and charred wood. The barrels are here as well, bourbon, oak and whiskey tastes. Just a perfectly blended Imperial Stout.
The mouth is quite fantastic. Deep rich flavors all the way to the end. Alcohol warminess sooths the throat all the way to the belly. There is no carbonation to speak of. As this warms it almost drinks like a glass of bourbon.
Overall I really enjoyed this. I believe this has cracked my top five Russian Imperial Stout list. Seek this out at all costs!! Really!!! Thanks to aandresen for this bottle. 1,144 charactersazdback, Jul 07, 2011

Into the Duvel tulip, Parabola pours out a sludgy black color resembling night time. Pretty viscous looking streaming down, it is jet black once in the glass. A nice mocha brown inch of foam bubbly and lasting leaving some marks.
Smell is something to marvel at. It's bold, pungent and full of everything you would think. Bourbon clashing with a big roasted malt scent. Wood with chocolate hints and a underlining vanilla scent. Bold and beautiful.
Had a sip, meh, had another, yeah, and another, give me more!! Roasted malts play a big part as does the bourbon and wood at this young stage in the bottle. A bit of char and smoke and a faint drop of dark fruit resembling cherry. Not sure what the wine barrel influence brings, but something gotta be there. Chocolate over slight and I mean slight vanilla. Not a sweet beer, but well balanced with all above.
Feel is what you would expect from the look. Viscous, a big ol body, adaquate carb yet goes down smoother than that. With all the flavor it's best to sip this slow to get to know it better. A bit oily and a coater of the throat. Get a bit of char with bourbon in the aftertaste and some heat to go with it.
Im not the biggest rizzzz guy, but for what Parabola puts out, im more than game and if a bottle needed to be drank by myself, I would do it. It would take me four hours to do it, but it would get finished. A sipper at heart that begs to be drank more and more and more.
Overall I think this is an excellent BBA beer and one of my top three. It helps that it is not insanely overpriced like a certain ops from Brooklyn. The other barrels used impart so much more than just your average Barrel stout and it shows from the complexities, especially the faint cherry. Got one to lay down till wintertime, maybe christmas. 1,937 charactersBARFLYB, Jul 07, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -2.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Tasted the 2010 and 2011 together. Overall scores are an average.
2011 vintage. Stone Oakquinox taster glass.
(3, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5)
Pours a very dark brown coffee color, almost no head and no lacing. Smell is very chocolate forward, creamy vanilla, with the bourbon way in the background (a little more forward once it warms, but still...) Taste is also very chocolate/cocoa forward, vanilla, some more bourbon and oak present. The flavors are stronger here than in the 2010 version, and the bourbon is definitely more subdued. Smooth and chewy, medium carbonation and full body. Alcohol is quite well hidden, but becomes a little more noticeable as it warms; still, this isn't anywhere near "hot", just slightly warming. Overall, this is top class bourbon aged stout, very drinkable.
2010 vintage. Tulip glass. Thanks to spry for opening this one up.
(4, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5, 4.5)
Again, pours a very dark brown coffee color, with a ring of dark khaki foam that has good retention, but minimal lacing. Nicely balanced sweet bourbon, vanilla, plus a little brandy (?) as it warms. The bourbon is much more forward than in the 2011 version. Taste is cola and cocoa, bourbon, nice oaky backbone, fairly dry with a smooth chocolate finish. Mellow, thick and mouthcoating, medium-low carbonation, alcohol is a little present at the finish. Overall, this is a nice contrast to the 2011 vintage: more mellow, more bourbon forward, less chocolate, but still nicely balanced. 
I'm not picking up any of the fruit that you might expect from this (and that a number of other reviewers reference), so perhaps this merits another go at it.

2013 vintage
Fresh: Something was off with this vintage. I get more heat/alcohol, a thin body, moderate tobacco, and very little chocolate/bourbon/etc. After a year: A little better, with substantially less heat, but the roast and ashiness are still prominent (though the flavor overall is fairly muted). 1,939 characterspmarlowe, Jul 07, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 Vintage enjoyed on 6/1/11, shortly after its release. Poured from 22-oz bomber (obtained direct from the brewery/taproom) into Delirium snifter.
A: Midnight black with thick brown head that fades fast to the outside leaving wisps of white to swirl in the center, giving the appearance of the Milky Way Galaxy.
N: Raisins and bourbon and chocolate and a bit of vanilla.
T/M: Creamy body with alcohol burn on the finish that lingers. (This beer is HOT!)
Toffee and a toasted note are initially evident on the tongue. Subtle dark fruit notes in the middle, which give way to a chocolate and boozy character. From middle to finish, there is a defined hop spice that remains just perceivable below the dark malt's contributions. 
This is an excellent stout. I honestly prefer Parabola's barley wine cousin to this--the beer is very hot and I think the darker, toastier malts tend to mask the barrel aged qualities that I really enjoy. 
I think this will improve with age (alcohol may tone down a bit and the flavors may blend a bit more, while the hop spice recedes a bit), while I found that the Abacus seemed quite at its peak. 1,134 characterspeacebone116, Jul 06, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +5.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 522oz. bottle poured into a snifter.
A: The thickest beer I've ever seen (Edit: Ten Fidy now holds this mark). Black, nothing getting through this one except cutting it with a knife. About a quarter finger head with a nice mocha color. Doesn't stay that long, but do you really expect it to? Lovely lacing. Top notch looking beer.
S: Very complex. Bourbon. Dark cherries, light raisins and figs. Nice roasted malts. Dark chocolate. Fresh dark roast coffee. Vanilla hints. Light oak and black licorice aromas peeking through. All with a good light booziness.
T: Sweet dark chocolate, dark cherries and vanilla upfront, quickly followed by other dark fruits, and the roasted coffee. The licorice and bourbon come towards the finish. Very light boosiness throughout, which is this beers only (minor) flaw (could have been hidden just a tad more).The awesome butterscotch after taste, that Bourbon Barrel Aging gives, lingers forever while the light boosiness creeps in just a little more, letting you know this is a Big Boy. 
M: As full bodied as you can get. Chewy (my friend, who is not a beer drinker, was the first to say Chewy). Creamy (he said this immediately after). All while having a velvety texture. Awesome warmness while not overpowering anything. The taste lingers forever, allowing you to savor every little sip.
O: Easily the best beer I've ever had. As I mentioned earlier the only flaw, and the only reason it didn't get 5's across, was because for the very slightest moment you thought about the alcohol. I'm sure with a little age that will be gone. Just a world class beer and nothing else. 1,612 charactersdoughanson78, Jul 06, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A
Black in appearance and poured out with a good, heavy viscousity, forming a short (~1/4 inch) but long lasting creamy head.
S
Aromas of chocolate, coffee, figs, whiskey or Cognac/wine, and vanilla. High ABV so alcohol was very pronounced but hightened the whisky/cognac aroma rather than detracted from it.
T
Wonderful. My wife commented it tasted like a fine wine. We're not sure whether it was a whiskey or cognac barrel but we'll put our money on cognac because of the smooth, not burning sensation with some grape-like qualities to it. Dark, moderately bitter chocolate and coffee flavors stand out with some vanilla in the middle and lingering chocolate at the end. Great example of an imperial stout with alot of complexity to each flavor. A real sipping beer.
M
smooth mouth feel with medium/high viscousity. Coats the tongue nicely. 
O
If not for the high price ($18) for one beer, I'd buy this more often. As is, it's a definite must-have for special occasions. 976 charactersbugaboo416, Jul 05, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a deep dark near-black with minimal cap of brown creamy head, gone quickly save for a ring around the edges and a pool in the middle. Scent is amazingly complex and as almost as important as the taste... Strong bourbon and cocoa notes, backed by ample vanilla, dark fruit, strong coffee grinds, roast and char throughout. Light touch of acidity, coconut and fresh cut wood. First sip is heavy on the bourbon but amazingly doesn't overpower. Strong dark Belgian chocolate, port wine and vanilla. Roasted grain and charred oak Espresso, berry and leather also noted. full bodied and smooth, lacking only a little creaminess, perfect carbonation. Amazingly fantastic beer. One I would love to partake in on a regular basis. Another great one from FW.
Update: Had on draft 8/1/11. While slightly superior in body and flavor, I can not justify submitting a second review that would barely raise the rating. 908 charactersrfgetz, Jul 04, 2011

a - a beer like this called for the big guns in glassware so i pulled out my southampton 2011 RIS oversized snifter for the job. opened the bottle and gave a generous pour...the beer is dark as halloween night with a nice rich shine. at first there was a thin deep brown head which quickly dissolved to spotty mocha bubbles. i don't usually expect to see a head on a barrel aged RIS but every now and again you get one. this one could be rebuilt on command with a swirl of the glass, but it never hung around long. also, love that this beer comes in a box with a wrapped cap...just adds to the specialness of it.
s - in a word deliciousness. a nice dark fruit booziness. wonderful balance. fruity and rummy and bourbony...dark cherries dominate the fruitiness, but there are certainly notes of chocolate and roasted malts. smell very rich, but spot on.
t - that's a BIG beer...and it has a HUGE flavor profile. dark cherries, coffee, roasted malt, chocolate and a variety of boozines. extremely well made and well balanced. heavy like a chunk of chocolate cake.
m - rich and full, the heat is in the flavor but not so much in a burn.
o - overall this is a top beer. this is a beer that you talk about. this is a beer that blew my mind. far and away worth the praise it receives. 1,327 characterscosmicevan, Jul 04, 2011

A- a stiff pour yields a small cap of tan head that settles quickly and leaves a think frothy ring around the glass and a wispy island on top. A hard swirl brings the head back nicely then settles as before. Utterly completely black in color with no light making it through. 
S- bourbon forward with chocolate and some dark fruits. Lots of dark roasted malts bringing coffee and a touch of anise. 
T- opens up with a sweet chocolate liquor and espresso punch that smoothly rolls into massive dark roasted malts and creamy vanilla. Bourbon is well integrated and creeps up slowly then finishes strong but not over baring. 
M- full bodied with a touch of chew to it and lightly carbed with a smooth creaminess to it. Nice amount of heat in the back that works perfectly. 
O- this is a stellar barrel aged stout. This style is becoming a bit over done but when you get one this good it makes it all worth while. A sipper for sure and very complex but so easy to enjoy. This stuff kicks ass. 1,040 charactersoglmcdgl, Jul 04, 2011

S: Nose is boozy,oats, light bourbon, cocoa. 
T: After having Parabola on draft numerous times and initially at FW 13 release I thought the bottled 2011 was a tad bit hotter and bourbon heavy than previous years. Nose and taste mirror are very close with molasses and dark chocolate being most prominent with some bourbon and oak in there. This beer is pretty boozy but the ABV is hidden pretty good. If you dont watch it this beer will sneak up on you. 
M: This brew is totally full bodied and smooth. The ABV is pretty high and this keeps drinkability at Good. Not a session beer for sure but great for a cold day!

Moderate carbonation and a lively, full mouthfeel. Creamy and not too thick. Chocolate up front followed by vanilla, bourbon, molasses, and a lingering espresso bitterness mixed with caramel, more cocoa, and boozy warmth.

4.53/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Trenton Road Takeout for this. Finally some Parabola in the area. Poured into a snifter,midnight black not to crazy of a fluffy heading from a hard pour. It did leave some great globs of lacing though.
Smell was not what I anticipated. Although it did have some nice bourbon notes not huge but mostly of a heavier oak barrel aroma.
First sip again was a solid bourbon taste not overpowering but noticeable detected.Big oaky notes are more detectable like the nose and there is a heavy hop bitter kick towards the end. A kind of hot anise finish.
Mouth is tremendous. Super slick velvet texture. Excellent full body and not very thick and chewy for such a high ABV.
This is a damn good barrel aged version. Probably my favorite right now. Easily drinkable for such a high ABV at 12.5%. 798 charactersTheFightfan1, Jul 02, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52011 bottle into a La Chouffe tulip. Gigantic thanks to Hopstoopid120 for bringing this long-anticipated want by NEBCO while I was canning up some homebrew.
A: Pretty f-ing black, with a finger of creamy light-brown foam. Good retention, spotty lace. Very attractive, especially for being an enormous 13%.
S: Gigantic chocolate, with more than a hint of chocolate-covered cherry. The wine barrels really add some serious complexity, but this is all about the rich, sweet, chocolatey malt. Significant, but acceptable booze.
T: Mmmm. Chocolate, vanilla, molasses, cherry, wine, tannins, and more chocoate. Huge, sweet, lightly boozy finish. Truly spectacular in its sheer decadence.
M: Creamy, full, and well-carbonated. Insanely good.
O: Holy crap, that's a beer. I can't imagine drinking a whole bottle, what with the intense sweetness and alcohol, but I'll be damned if I wouldn't like to have a small snifter of this with dessert every single night. I love eating chocolate and drinking a robust red wine, and this beer was like that but amplified and melded into pure liquid nirvana.

4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - Beautiful pitch black pour with a tint of dark brown on the edges.
Smell - Powerful aromas fill the air as you sniff this. The symmetry is an imprecise sense of pleasing proportionality and balance.
Taste - With every sip the focus changes. Chocolate and coffee switches back and fourth. Then at it's vertex sweet vanilla and caramel comes in and gives a wonderful intense flavor.
Mouthfeel - Silky smooth.
Overall - Parabolas can open up, down, left, right, or in some other arbitrary direction. 513 charactersdvsbizzyb, Jun 28, 2011

M: Thick, obviously, but the carbonation is nice. The bitterness at the back end gives you that puckerness, but I like it.

4.23/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 002. Pours pitch black with a very light cocoa head. The nose is chocolate, roasted malts, oak and a touch of booze. The taste is sweet vanilla, bourbon and oak, melded together against a dry chocolate and charred roasted malts. Also, just a touch of licorice. Comes together very nicely, but the finish is a bit dry and overly bitter, with a bit much in the way of oak tannins. It brings out an excess in the charred malt / chocolate flavor. This is really my only problem with it. Really fantastic mouthfeel - silky and full on the tongue. The barrel and the medium-low carbonation just round the mouthfeel out to smooth, smooth, smooth. Overall, this is a really good beer, particularly when it warms - the anise flavor blooms a touch more and some of the dryness and bitterness in the finish mellows. I think a few months might really bring this beer around. Once again, FW does some fantastic work with a barrel. 923 charactersseeswo, Jun 25, 2011

4.27/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Parabola! Fancy boxed bottle bought at Whole Foods Bowery for $17.99 plus tax. 
Appearance: Served in my Sierra snifter, looks great, super dark and thick with a good one finger of mocha-colored head that doesn't last long. No lacing or retention whatsoever, but good carbonation. Super black, with some mahogany tones when swirled.
Smell: Petroleum (gasoline), sharp booze, oil well. Lotta smoke, wood. A tad of dark fruit and vanilla. Hot chocolate, thick, European style. I also get a barnyard aroma that takes me back to the American Heartland. Native prairie on fire, or warm hearth inside a Galician palloza in the Ancares.
Taste: Carbonated and sharp, tingles and burns the tongue. Thick and spicy chocolate, the Aztec-Mexican kind. Bourbon, some distant sweetness at the end. Smoke and barrel, but above all, FIRE! :-) This reminds me of the artisanal "aguardiente" ("fiery water") made in my native Galicia. Some prune/smashed pickled cherry. Dry spicy finish with a hint of wood. 
Surprisingly, a second bottle yielded a much creamier, smoother and chocolaty feel and taste, not as hot and brutal as the first taste. 
Mouthfeel: Full body and flavor, no doubt. Sweet, heavy finish. Great carbonation. Starts out too hot, but it opens up like a fine wine and becomes balanced, complex, smooth, delicious. If anything, a little too dry!
Overall: A solid 4.5. Grows up on me, mellows out as it settles on the glass. A schizo beer- super drinkable, with the 12.25% (not 13% as the listing says) ABV nowhere in sight, but also hot and fiery. Would love to try this aged a further year (beyond the 12 months it already spent in a barrel). As it is, feels a little too young and green, but still so very delicious. 
More balanced and less sweet than other barrel-aged stouts like Goose Island's, but also not as enticing. It lacks that "wow factor" that makes my knees weak. 1,884 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Jun 24, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured at a tasting/bottle-share with a couple friends into my Stone Specialty Tating glass on 6/18/11. 2011 Vintage
A: Black. Pours, excuse the phrase, black as night. Extremely viscous coming out of the bottle and into the glass. There is a medium-small mocha head, maybe just under a finger. Great lacing, especially for a barrel aged beer. Obvious alcohol legs on swirl. I knew this was going to be a winner when the beer settled and a Happy Face appeared in the head
S: To put it simply, I will quote my friend who was at this tasting, "I want to make cologne of this!" Ya, it smells that amazing. The first thing that hits me is roast, followed by lots of chocolate and vanilla. I can also pick up some welcome oaky aromas. Can smell a light bit of alcohol, but it is the amount that seems to draw you in for more instead of forcing you away.
T: The first sip was amazing... i just wantd to savor it and not think of anything. Again, the roastiness is what hit me hard upfront, followed again by that chocolate vanilla mix. I know this fits more into mouthfeel, but it actually tastes velvety smooth. Has a great richness that is balanced from the barrel aging, and a good, medium alcohol burn that seems to only further enhance the overall tastes.
M: This is one viscous beer. It coats the mouth well, but not to the point that I would describe it as chewey. There is a great light carbonation. More than I would expect after aging. Again... velvety smooth.
O: I flat out LOVE THIS BEER. There is honestly not much else to say. I was afraid of it being overly complex and tough to decipher after reading some other reviews, but it was balanced near perfectly. To be honest, the only fault I can find with this beer is that it almost smells better than it tastes. Don't get me wrong, it tastes amazing, but if i had to put a number on both, I would put Smell at 98 and Taste at 96. I can't wait to open my next bottle, which I'm sure will be sooner than I had anticipated before tasting this one. 2,007 charactersbaybassboy, Jun 24, 2011

A: Very nice.Dark brew, nearly black with only a little light showing through the edges when held up. Light brown head, about a fingers worth rises from a mildly gentle pour and settles back to persistent lacing.
S: Fudge and booze (bourbon. Some hot caramel and vanilla oak smells but definitly bourbon and chocolate dominant. Smells very good.
T: Chocolate and bourbon again dominant. Caramel, some dark bread flavors and licorice come in to play. Licorice and oak dominate the finish with some alcohol becoming apparent.
M: Rich, thick, smooth through the majority with some bite after it settles in a handful of seconds later. Some slightly apparent wood tannin on the finish and the alcohol spice again finds it's way in, but not incredibly strongly.
O: Very good but wish I'd set this aside much longer. Tried a few ounce sample of '10 and it had melded into something much richer and smoother. This was very good, but it lacks the harmony that settling for a year or more will bring. Definitly something I'm happy to wait on though quite good now.
This is better than my review would lead me to believe. However, all the components are in place for this to be a monster of a brew, devastatingly complex and delicious, with some time. Give it time. 1,309 charactersoregone, Jun 23, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed on-tap @ the iTap House in Chesterfield, MO for $7. This was served during the Parabola event which was a huge success! Tapped from the Parabola Tap Handle into a 12oz Snifter glass and enjoyed over a good period of time.
Aroma- Starts off with a huge bourbon and vanilla aroma. Tons of roasted malts used, a hint of espresso, and strong. Perfect for the style! No flaws at all.
Appearance- Received with 1 finger of bubbly and dark brown head. It has an extremely dark brown body (almost black but can see brown in the light), Opaque, and lace is left all across the sides.
Flavor- Has an aged bourbon whiskey start and almost an oaken barrel of chocolate mousse. The finish has a warm feeling and notes of Merlot. Very rich, nice malts used (once again), and complexed beyond belief! Could grab more attributes but enjoyed too much to think about all of them. 
Mouthfeel- Full Bodied, Thick as Motor Oil, Chewy, and actually leaves Spice behind on the palate with a hint of bourbon. Not sure what to think of this!
Overall Impression- Intense! This guy has some serious complexity and one of my favorite beers of the month! I bought 2 bottles of this from Lukas Liquor and am going to see how they age. Could/Would only want to enjoy one of these because of how strong it is. Had a nice buzz going after this beer. Will be promoting this beer! 1,358 charactersDCon, Jun 22, 2011

S- the aroma on this puppy is rediciously complex. Starts out with big fresh brewed espresso and decadent dark chocolate truffles. Perfectly intergrated oak barrels shine with notes of vanilla, caramel and aromatic high end bourbon. Finishs with pungent dark juicy cherries and warming heady booze. Only gets better and and more aromatic as it warms.
T- the flavor in this is just as rediculous as the aroma. Dark chocolate with cocoa notes begin the flavor. Italian coffee flavors with an espresso bean character. Big bourbon and soft oak flavors intertwine with notes of vanilla and a semi sweet caramel. Warming big but pleasent alcohol boosts the previous flavors instead of detering them. Finishs with a bittersweetness and a rich round bourbon aftertaste.
MF- rich full creamy mouthfeel that brings to mind gourmet hot cocoa. Full body with a soft low carbonation.
D- incredibly drinkable for the intensity of the beer. Smooth and Lucious. 1,093 charactersViciousknishs, Jun 22, 2011

Poured from a bomber into an AleSmith Brewing imperial pint glass...
A - Pours black with a one finger brown head on a fairly passive pour. There is a good amount of head retention, but there is next to no lace to be had...
S - Coffee, chocolate, a hint of vanilla, and a good dose of bourbon. Smells a little hot, but still inviting...
T - Dark chocolate and coffee are the most prominate flavors up front. Vanilla is present along with some sweet caramel, and oak. Smooth bourbon comes through in the finish with some lingering valilla. For a 12.5 percenter this one is exceptionally smooth and balanced. Delicious...
M - Nice and creamy, with an above average amount of carbonation for the style. This one rides the line between being full/medium bodied...
O - Ridiculously drinkable considering the abv. The hype for this one was high, and it lived up to the praise. Firestone impresses again with another top notch brew...

Reviewed from Notes

Edit: 2011 Vintage
This beer pours a thick fully opaque black with a thin brown head, which faded quickly and left minimal lacing. The bottle label describes this beer a “Midnight Black”, which is accurate. The aroma is lot of chocolate and bourbon in the initial smell with dark chocolate, coffee, oak, vanilla, and raisins becoming more present as the beer warm close to room temperature. The taste to me seems vanilla, oak, chocolate, deep roasted malt, and toffee. This beer feels velvety with almost no alcohol heat. It drinks like a fine wine.
Overall this is a fantastic beer. Very much lived up to the hype for me. 704 characterscodynevels, Jun 20, 2011

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5After the Abacus, I immediately added this to my wish list for brews. Luckily, there were quite a few to be found in Columbia, though my frequented stores ran out rather rapidly. Still, I got a hold regardless, and let's see what this is all about:
The near-black body gives away this beer's nature immediately. A tan head swirls to life, but pulls away very slowly, leaving only a ring around the edges of the brew. I don't even need to lean in to get my first impressions - the smell hit me from a mile away. Regardless, the chocolate notes are unreal, along with a nice mixture of robust, roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, and just the slightest bitterness. Surreal, potent, powerful - these are what a beer should be.
Sipping it reveals the best this beer really is. First impressions are like drinking a mocha beverage. Clean, smooth, almost like a dessert in a glass! As the thick body warmed, it's harsher side slowly came to be. The bitterness started to attack the tongue, reminding you that this is a wholly American-style Imperial stout. Notes of coffee and vanilla formed at the front of the tongue. What amazes me is that there was absolutely no trace of alcohol to be found here. Astonishing brew.
Overall/notes - I didn't think it possible, but Firestone Walker topped Abacus on this one. It's like perfection bottled. I never thought I'd live to see the day I tasted what I feel is a perfect brew. This will forever be on my watch list. I just need to get some dark chocolate along for the ride next time I can find it. Seek this out and savor it. A true sipper. 1,579 charactersbbkd3b, Jun 20, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.522oz Bomber. 2011 Edition (No. 002). 12.5% ABV
Poured into tulip.
Color is absolute opaque black with an initial finger of light mocha foam, settles to a small ring. Very small amounts of lacing.
Aromas include coffee and chocolate, boozy port wine. The oaky/vanilla/wood notes are there, but are relatively subtle. A small sting of alcohol at the end of the draw. A lighter aroma than I was expecting, but it does improve as it warms.
Taste is initially super delicious, sweet chocolate malt with a quick to appear roasty bitterness. Again, the barrel presence is there, but it is restrained in a very good way. Melting vanilla-chocolate swirl ice cream middle. The booziness really emerges in the finish. It doesn't kill the experience by any means, but I like it less than the start of the flavor. Seems like a perfect candidate for the cellar (no surprise given the ABV).
Absolutely love the mouthfeel of this one. Soft and silky, but not overly cloying. Medium to slightly-full bodied with very appropriate medium-light carbonation for the style.
I could mention a bbal-aged stout that I like better than this, but it really is a great beer. 1,152 charactersbrotherloco, Jun 20, 2011

4.52/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This is the 2011 vintage, and this is a quite a unique and tasty beer that meet my expectations from what I've heard and read about this beer before. 
A: Jet black body with pretty good legs and some lacing, but not much. A nice tan head dies down rather quickly. 
S: Smell has lots of charred malt and some savory bacon/rauch like notes which is interesting and intriguing. Charred oak, chocolate, vanilla bean, dark fruits, and a little bit of bourbon like a cherry on top rather than being a forerunner like BCBS or other like beers. Not too much heat and a nice compact full aroma. 
T: Follows the smell with a huge peaty malt and smoke base to it which is again unique and unexpected, very nice. Fudge, some bourbon but not too much (a nice subtle addition), Charred black malt, berries, a little bit of alcohol but not nearly what I expected at 13%, bacon again , and even some nutty maybe chestnut like flavors. A very complex and unique bourbon aged stout both in that the bourbon is much more subtle and elegant than normal and the huge smoke flavors with a bittersweet chocolate back. 
M: Very nice smoked burnt feel thats still dripping with flavor and a nice bitter dry yet flavorful lingering finish. Just the slightest bit of heat thats really hardly there. Nice thick feel. 
Overall a nice beer that deserves good revues and stands out from the pack of most beers in this style. Excellent. 1,409 charactersDreadnaught33, Jun 19, 2011

A: Black with no light penetration whatsoever besides a brown ring around the top. An initially generous head for an RIS, composed entirely of larger tan bubbles. Head dies quickly. 
S: Terriyaki, baked seitan, chocolate, and hickory all in the nose. Sniffing with any extra intensity will likely get some alcohol burn in the nose, warning me right off it was likely going to be a little hot. 
T: Brown sugar, bourbon, and a little roast hit on the initial taste, followed by a wave of creamy, melted chocolate that transitions into crem brulee with an emphasis on the burnt sugar. After the flavors mostly disappear your mouth feel and lingering taste is much like a while after you've had an awfully good piece of chocolate-- a little bitter, a little sweet, and even a little salty. Alcohol is a little too evident in the initial and middle taste, making aging seem promising. Overall, very nice flavors that like most RIS evolve with slight temperature changes. 
M: Loved the mouthfeel on this, but it being just a nudge on the watery side in the mouthfeel kept me from giving it a 5.0. Carbonation and all else were excellent. 
O: A really excellent RIS that blends its smokey and bitter notes better than perhaps any other RIS I've had. Some aging to tone down the hotness could perhaps make this my favorite RIS. Definitely a must if you have any love for RIS. 1,485 charactersKlym, Jun 19, 2011

A: Black that slowly gives into a deep brown coffee rim. Looks as it should with deep brown bubbles. Looks like a fine dark chocolate dessert with the bubbles resembling fine dark chocolate shavings. Tons of small formed bubbles. Caviar in the glass. One finger head with a violent end pour (wasn't the soberest hand, I won't lie).
S: Strong chocolate almond milk laced with high quality vanilla. There is a sauciness to it that is suggestive of hazelnut butter with an alcohol finish that makes me think sherry. Amazing woody finish to complete a complex nose. 
T: A soft and subtle introduction of woodiness. Middle is a deep dark chocolate covered wild raspberry, truly decadent. The nuttiness of the wood cuts through the bitter chocolate. This beer has very solid flavor transitions, a real thinker. There is a hidden spicy quality that sings of shaved chocolate, cocoa nibs, and flash torched brown/cane sugars. A buffet of dark digestives. 
M: Light prickling carbonation dances around bitter chocolate in such a way that you believe you have something fancy in your mouth. A winner of a mouth, like a dark chocolate cotton candy that tingles as it goes. A truly wonderful sequence of slow evaporation. A wonderful fit to the medium-heavy body. 
O: Worth the excitement, this beer has some real cascading flavors. I highly recommend sitting with this beer a bit colder, and letting it go its full flavor spectrum even beyond recommended serving temp. It remains a dessert beer throughout, featuring truly deep chocolates with a fancy alcohol pairing. Many in the style come off savory, even starting out in the realm of salty meats; but I would emphatically say that this beer came off as dessert even when a bit cold. The rolling flavors fought for my attention, and I tried to quell their excitement so that they all could be heard, "One at a time, not all at once!". This is a deep brew. It's like the first time you watch Mulholland Drive: You don't know what just happened, but you know that it was good. Would drink again, tomorrow or years later. Hold on to a few for yearly celebrations. 2,205 charactersCavery, Jun 19, 2011

T: Tastes of bourbon, chocolate and fruit like plums and cherries. Alcohol burn too that lingers as you lick your lips and get more chocolate. 
MF: The bourbon and chocolate notes linger on your palate and makes you want more which I wouldn't mind until the bottle is empty. 
This is a great limited release stout. Even though it's aged in bourbon barrels it's very forward on the nose but very subtle on the palate. With some age on this the bourbon will probably be gone and the chocolate will be more pronounced but I will have to find that out myself. 740 charactersBigB415, Jun 18, 2011

A: Very dark black pour with about a pinky of light brown head. Not a lot of retention and minimal lacing here.
S: Bourbon, oak, and vanilla noticed first and foremost. A bit of roastiness and other characteristics of a stout. Not a lot of the booze noted at all. The smell seems to be right on par with the other good Bourbon Barrel aged stouts.
T: The taste is everything I hoped it would be. Big bourbon and vanilla flavor, aided by some chocolate and hints of coffe, starts it off with some warming booziness following. This RIS has been aged on so many barrels I can't say much of a stout flavor remains, but the coffee finish is really very good. If only it retained some original hoppiness or stout flavors, this would be one of the best beers crafted today.
MF: Velvety smooth; creamy, and thick body. Plenty of carbonation and a flavor that keeps you coming back for more. The 13% ABV is essentially non-existant, which for a beer this good is nothing short of dangerous.
O: This was $15 per bomber and really hard to get. Every place I found it they had one case and was hidden in the back. Considering the amount of work Firestone Walker puts into this beer, I'm quite happy to taste the result. They really must know what they're doing. Probably the best barrel aged RIS I've had, but I'll review it below Kate the Great simply because Kate has a better RIS taste without the Bourbon, this is good, but I'm missing the stout characteristics mainly. Truly lives up to the hype.

S Big hit of bourbon with equally large dark fruits, molasses with an impressive chocolate body. Just a huge smell that is unlike any we've had so far. 5
T My word I forgot how good this beer was. Beautifully integrated bourbon, chocolate, roast, and molasses. The bourbon and chocolate is just outstanding. This is one of the best bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts on the market. 5

4.38/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Vintage 2011, poured into a large snifter.
A nice solid simple light brown, creamy head given to dark walnut black body. Nice whisps on the top of the drink with a good sheen. Some small leg action that's about it. Not much more I could say but it looks very impressive.
Bouquet is a one trick pony. But it is a good one, it is a giant creamy vanilla bomb... that's it, there is no sense of heat from the high mentioned abv at all.
Taste is once again vanilla dominant. It's everywhere, it's creamy as all get out. However it masks much of the flavor profiles of chocolate, coffee, that one would expect. I also strangely got a sensation of orange fruit on this a bit which was interesting. The beer is so big as well on its feel, but there is not even a hint of boozy alcohol what so ever, it's like a giant chocolate milk shake.
Overall stupidly addictive, but not my favorite I think. Still quite an exceptional product I must say. I wish the nose was more varied. 971 characterssmakawhat, Jun 17, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage, poured into a snifter.
Pours a thick pitch black with a one finger mocha head which settles to a ring.
On the nose I get roasted malt, roasted espresso, chocolate, molasses, prunes, fried plantains, and caramel... All very well balanced with bourbon and oak.  Smells amazing.
I predominately taste bitter dark chocolate, cocoa, and a shot of strong Italian espresso.  There's a deep complexity in the spices that I'm having trouble placing... cinnamon, cayenne pepper?  Hints of bourbon at the end, just enough to let you know it's there. EDIT: As it warms up, it's actually not teribbly complex at all. I'm mostly just getting bitter dark chocolate overload...
Mouthfeel is nothing like I've ever experienced before in a stout.  When it first hits your tongue, it tingles a bit... I can't tell if that's fine carbonation, spices, or alcohol burn.  Either way, I welcome it.  Otherwise, it's full-bodied and coats the palate with bourbon and bitterness.
Overall, I'd say this beer lives up to the hype.  It's probably the most complex stout I've had, the only thing it lacks is superior smoothness and drinkability... Something a little age will surely cure. 1,184 charactersAdrianized, Jun 17, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Series 002
A - pours a black color with a nice 1/2 finger mocha colored head off of an aggressive pour
S - caramel and molasses from the bourbon stick out the most with a bit of cola and chocolate malt hidden beneath; subtle hints of charred oak are in the mix as well. Nice blend of aromas with nothing too overpowering.
T - vanilla and milk chocolates jump out immediately and provide a welcoming introduction. This then segues into LOTS of spicy bourbon on the back end that is slowly overtaken by a a very rich, dry, dark chocolate flavor with subtle hints of caramel that lingers after the exhale. Definitely let this guy warm up a bit as the bourbon hides itself better in the flavor profile the closer it got toward room temperature.
M - nice and full as it goes down; the body complements the rest of the beer nicely. Has a very dry finish and leaves you wanting another drink.
D - really solid BA RIS. I feel like the heat was a little overpowering at first but as this warmed up it turned into a really nice beer. I feel like a year or two would do wonders with this beer. Luckily I have a couple of bottles to lay down and anxiously await to crack in the future. 1,178 charactersbirchstick, Jun 16, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 bottle, so about a year old at time of drinking. Gave a rough pour into a snifter which yielded about a half inch of cola-colored head which quickly receded to a thin ring of bubbles with very little lacing along side the glass. The liquid itself? Black. How much more black could this be? The answer is none - none more black.
The smell was pretty rich. Roasted malts, coffee, vanilla, dark chocolate, a little bit of booze. The taste was a lot more bourboney, in a delicious sort of way. There was a really pleasant, not-too-cloying sweetness to it. As it warmed up the vanilla and chocolate really came to the forefront. The toasty oak flavors have been incorporated extremely well into this beer.
The mouthfeel is creamy and thick. It is full bodied with medium carbonation. Overall it was a fantastic stout which I'm glad I finally got around to cracking. 867 characterssurlytheduff, Jun 15, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Popped off a bottle of 001 for a cousin's wedding reception Sunday night. Thick, viscous black and a mild cherry cola head to it. Less than forceful aroma of chocolate, oak, mild boozy bourbon, vanilla and cherry. 
Wow, what a treat, a sipper, yet hid the alcohol so well. Nothing was dominant, equal parts of play between the chocolate, bourbon. Others got more coffee roast than I did, but I really appreciated the smooth cherry and vanilla aspect of this. Didn't even have that warming presence it hid the alcohol so well. Chewy. Would think there was oatmeal in here it was so chewy and smooth. 
Sets itself apart from the wanna be barrel agers. This one actually tasted nice, not harsh. Going 'big' on the bourbon is often a mistake. Found it ironic that this is a part of the Anniversary blend, yet this had been blended so well itself, to not yield the alcohol heat, and allow every little nuance of the barrels and base beer itself to be noticed (and this was after a day of drinking, albeit a blood orange hefe sixtel).
I've bought 7 bottles of this both years. I think its the right number to keep doing every year. Not too many beers in that elite company (PTE, Bigfoot, Parabola, Celebration, Eclipse) 1,216 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jun 14, 2011

A: Viscious, extremely black, and with a head only a shade or two lighter than the brew itself.
S: Subdued bourbon, dark fruit, and a bit of dark chocolate to balance that out. Potent, but not too.
T: Fairly hot, chocolatey, and extremely viscious in general. This totally wasn't what I was expecting. I got a generous amount of heat on the aftertaste, but tons of chalk also.
M: Thick, but not as thick and creamy as I was hoping. Still, this was lightly carbonated and very cloying.
O: Disappointing. I'd heard lots of amazing things about this one and it kinda let me down. That's a shame, because I totally dig Firestone Walker overall. 692 charactersChaney, Jun 13, 2011

Stouty looking stout
Smells of roast, wood, vanilla, and bourbon: rather inviting.
Bourbon has mellowed in the year since I last had this, but plays wonderfully over the base stout. Barrel imparts smoke, rich vanilla, light woodiness, and milk chocolate covered cherry. 
Mouthfeel is medium thick and lowly carbonated, making this is nice, enjoyable, should be sipper, that I chose rather to injest in swatchbuckling sized gulps.

Beer poured black as night with a brown head that dissapated quickly.
Nose is chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, and charred oak. It does not get any better than that.
Taste is big on dark chocolate, bourbon is definitely treading lightly in the background. Notes of vanilla and hops balance the sweetness quite well.
Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and very smooth.
Overall drinkability is very good. This is definitely a world class brew. Viscosity is not quite what i had hoped but very good nonetheless. Definitely one to pursue for impy stout lovers! 777 charactersarizcards, Jun 12, 2011

Pours a very deep black with a nice light brown head that fades slowly into a ring, light lacing.
Aroma of bourbon, smoke, vanilla and chocolate.
Taste was smoky, roasty, woody, strong bourbon, with a mix of vanilla, toffee and dark fruits.
Mouthfeel was full to medium body, very smooth and boozy. A very nice bourbon ending.
Overall this is an outstanding Imperial Stout, there is a nice bourbon flavor, not the alcohol taste you get with the majority of bourbon barrel stouts. Great job. 539 charactersdtivp, Jun 11, 2011

Smell is all chocolate bourbon and barrel. Love it. 
Tastes like awesome. First taste if barrel smoothness. Followed by a nice roast with some oak and a little bit of rare in the bite. Aftertaste gets you the bourbon I'm after when I drink a bourbon barrel stout. 
Mouthfeel is as it should be. Nice aggressive after taste. perfect consistency. 
Overall I am really looking this brew. Much better than I remember it from last year, though I didn't have it very often last year. 511 charactersSebowski, Jun 11, 2011

Smell is strongly vanilla, delicious bourbon vanilla. Mouthfeel is warm, the booziness coming through. Tastes magnificent, I love the vanilla, also roasty flavors coming through strongly. The main detractor (for me, at least) is the booziness, at 13% I'd expect it to be coming through somewhat less, actually. But I'm cellaring a few bottles, and I anticipate that age will mellow this and make it even better. 496 charactersstupac2, Jun 11, 2011

This beer smells like bourbon, chocolate, and coffee with the latter two struggling to persevere over the bourbon. The taste follows the nose with alcohol being prevalent but not overbearing; aftertaste of hops, dark chocolatiness, and bourbon.

4.57/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at The Hungry Monk
Appears black, no head but I blame the pour. Little to no lace either.
Smells delightful, dark bitter chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, smokey bourbon and a bit of booze.
Extremely well balanced for what it is. This is the the most balanced "fresh" barrel aged beer I've had. Starts out roasty and chocolatey with hints of vanilla, in the middle it takes a complex dark fruity turn, with dark wine varietals and a bit of tartness. Bourbon flavor and a slight bitterness in the finish. along with some heat that is to be expected from a 13% barrel aged beer. Still this beer is incredibly smooth and balanced compared to other "fresh" barrel aged imperial stouts.
This is way too drinkable for what it is. Medium-heavy bodied with low carbonation, incredibly smooth, not too chewy but on par for the style.
This is my second time having it on tap and I look forward to having it again if there is any left tomorrow. Be sure to let it warm up before imbibing. 982 charactersAllpe45, Jun 10, 2011

Color is dark brown, almost black. Aroma was intense boubon, vanilla and caramel, no hop aroma. Taste was fantastic as expected. Huge alcohol beer that reeally needs to warm up to be fully appreciated. Flavors of oak, biurbon, vanilla and chocolate malt. The beer is extremely well balanced and complex. Mouthfeel was light for such a big beer. Bought a bottle to let age a good while.

4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this on tap at the taproom In Buelton
Look: Extremely dark purple color to the point where no light can pass through it the beer had very little head maybe because it was poured to the very top of the 6oz snifter and had very little lacing
Smell: Spicy bourbon notes and alcohol are the front runners on this beer and are back up with hints of roasted coffee and chocolate
Taste: Much of the same as the smell. This beer can be alittle over powering on the power and the 13% abv is definately noticeable. When you get past that it has a very nice flavor profile with hints of burnt oak, coffee, chocolate and bourbon
Mouthfeel: It has a very silky smooth feel on the palate with alittle bit of heat from the bourbon and abv
Overall: This beer is good now but will be great with at least 1yr of aging most likely 2 just to dumb down the alcohol punch that it gives you and lets the true flavors really come through. So buy several like I did and forget about them 971 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jun 09, 2011
3.58/5  rDev -21.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Had this numerous time, both batch 1 and batch 2. This is my first review though I've been scouring this site for some time and going out of my way to collect bottles. On the the beer...from a batch 1 bottle. Pours black in the glass with a small brown head. Aroma was molasses, roasted grains, chocolate, hot bourbon. Really pronounced flavors, a lot of that molasses I got with dark chocolate, maybe some raisins. As a BA stout it's all right, not my favorite. Mouthfeel was thick and creamy. Kind of messy and really sweet overall. I guess this would fall into the "over rated" camp in my book. 597 characterskayalla, Jun 09, 2011
4.66/5  rDev +2.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep black with hints of brown at thee bottom and when held up to light. A vigorous pour yielded a one finger head that was a coffee brown and quickly turned into a very small ring of bubbles.
Aroma was slightly faint I thought for sucbh a big beer. Aromas of oak, coffee, roasted malts and a hint of the alcohol held within were present.
The flavors during my first sip were incredible. A complex mix of coffee, vanilla, roasted malt, dark fruit, and black licorice. As it warmed the roasted malts and coffe got stronger and so did the bitterness. With all that going on, there was hardly a notice of the alcohol content unless I took a really big gulp.
The mouthfeel was pretty much perfection. Smooth and thick like velvet. It was pretty much like drinking off of cask. Drinkability was great for such a big beer, but next time I'll probably spli the bottle with someone. This was outstanding and I'm glad I got a few more to put down. 949 characterssnpub540, Jun 06, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I was really thrilled with this beer. A very enjoyable Imperial Stout.
Firestone Walker Brewing Co. is becoming one of my favorite breweries. And lucky for me it is only 45 minutes away from my house. So whenever they have something fun on tap or realeasing, I try to stop by and see what's going on. I had one of those opportunities last month when Firestone Released their Parabola in bottles at the tasting room in Paso Robles, Ca. 
Serving type: 
on-tap poured into a 6oz snifter and 22oz bottle poured into a large wine glass.
Appearance: 
It is quite dark. I held it up to the light in a large wine glass and even at the edges it was hard to see any light coming through.
Smell:
Much more fragrant in the large wine glass than in the snifter. My buddy and I would just sit and smell it over the course of the half hour it took us to finish the 22. It is almost as enjoyable to smell as it is to drink.
Compared to:
My other favorite in the imperial stout category would be Dogfish Head's World Wide Stout which I would say is quite similar. There is definitely much less of an alcohol taste with Parabola. I would say that when it comes to flavor, they are right on par with each other. It would be hard to name a favorite. 
With Parabola now in bottles (and $15 for a 22 at the taproom), I am very happy that an amazing Imperial Stout will be accessible now. Way to go again Firestone! 1,398 charactersclaybeerman, Jun 06, 2011

A-Poured dark as night with a full one inch creamy mocha head, which dissipates to a lasting film. Beautiful lacing.
S-Oak tannins, vanilla, caramel, all aspects of the bourbon blending in nicely. Bitter chocolate and roasted malt intermingling underneath the sweet bourbon aroma. Just a hint of bourbon soaked dark fruit. 
T-Vanilla and caramel are the key players here. Again, bitter chocolate and oak coating the mouth. Light fig/date sweetness. Ass end leaves a lasting rich caramel/vanilla bourbon warmth. Delicious. Leaves you salivating for the next sip. 
M-Spot on. Not to thick, not too thin. Carbonation is just right. Again, a really inviting bitterness coats your mouth. 
O-A really nice BA stout. In my eyes, it doesn't tackle Silva, but is up there with a lot of other great examples of the style. I did a lot of leg work to track down bottles of this in the greater San Diego area. Firestone seems to spread our limited release allotment pretty thin, but I was glad to pick up several of these. I think a year or so would do interesting things to this, but its going to be hard not to crack into more. 1,183 characterscb462, Jun 05, 2011

Poured a very dark brown / black with a half a finger of creamy mocha colored head. Head dissipated after several minutes to a thin collar at the edge with some nice lacing. Swirling reformed a finger of quickly dissipating head and showed a bit of alcohol legs.
Nose was very nice, rich dark chocolate, smoothly brewed coffee, dried dark fruits plums and raisins, molasses, red wine like fruit and a tinge of astringency, charred oak, and light vanilla. Really opens up as the beer further warms to room temperature.
Follows the nose. All of fruitiness gets richer as it warmed, along with the charred oak and vanilla. Very nice chocolate, coffee and cherry notes throughout. Delicious.
Full bodied, rich and creamy. Smooth small bubble carbonation further contributes to it. No alcohol detected for this year old keg. 889 charactersnataku00, Jun 05, 2011

3.47/5  rDev -23.6%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I know that this is a highly rated and sought after beer, but for me, it just didn't meet the hype. It was the expected black, but had no head. The aroma was subdued to the point of blandness. Some grainy malt, a whisper of roast and a solid alcohol scent.
The flavors weren't any bolder or more well-defined. The body was decent although much thinner than typical, which did help with drinkability. Overall, a good but not great beer. A relative disappointment from FW, a brewery I think very highly of. 505 charactersbeertunes, Jun 04, 2011
3.5/5  rDev -22.9%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5A - Poured pitch black like Vin Diesel into over sized "Balloon" wine glasses, 1 finger head that dissipates at a medium pace.
S. Coffee, Toffee, Vanilla, Chocolate.
T/M - Coffee, Coffee, Coffee, Chocolate, Toffee, slight vanilla, almost no hint of bourbon flavor on its own, though you can tell its in there. Thick and rich bodied, reminded me of Black Gold BBL.
Overall - I am not sure about the hype on this one, don't get me wrong its good, and should age very well. I prefer a bit more presence of bourbon on something aged in bourbon barrels.
PP (Price Point) -- I paid a $5 premium on the bottle, it should have been around $15 but I paid $20 and snagged 3 bottles. I will probably get a few more for trading but as I said didn't really live up to the hype to me, though it was an excellent beer, only slightly above average for the style. 850 charactersalexhahn82, Jun 04, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had this for the first time yesterday on tap at City Beer in SF.
A- Poured pretty damn black into a snifter. Couldn't really tell how black due to the place being dimly lit. Had a 1 finger head that gradually faded away after a couple minutes. Hardly any lacing but left a ring throughout my experience.
S- Had a  potent bourbon aroma with some slight dark chocolate and vanilla fused in there as well.
T - Upon first sip was bourbon and alcohol heat. Kinda unpleasant. 2nd sip after warming for about 5 minutes was a completely different experience. Has a nice chocolate taste with a sweet vanilla finish.
M - Medium bodied but not a thickest that I've had. Very smooth and drinkable.
O - What we have here was a highly anticipated beer that exceeded my expectations. When served cold, not so awesome. When given a chance to warm up, watch out now. Can i take a Bomber to the face? Sure, but this is one that you wanna share and enjoy with others. I've already searched all over Hawaii and nothing to be found. Once I get back to Cali, the hunt is on. 1,059 charactersDevi0us, Jun 04, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A: Rich and inky-black, topped with the chocolaty brown head that I appreciate in an imperial stout. Some come with quite a white hue that offer an attractive contrast to the beer, but the deeper brown ones suggest a 'serious stout.' 
S + T: Loads of vanilla, brown sugar, and chocolate. A sweet stout, though not one of the thick and intense ones (ie: Abyss, Dark Lord, Ten FIDY). There's nothing particularly subtle in either the aroma or flavour, but there is plenty of going on in each profile. There's a sweetness that I want to associate with dark fruits, but I can't name one off the top of my head that I would like to suggest. There are qualities to it that I would probably most attribute to something like dried tropical fruit... say papaya in the level of sweetness it offers on the finish. That's not to say it tastes like papaya... you know what? This isn't going well. Let's just say it there's a fructose quality that alludes to some tropical fruits without... no, that's rephrasing the statement. Forget it. Try it. 
M + D: The one negative element I found in this beer was in the body. Considering the look, scent, and flavour, I would have expected something richer and thicker--and I would have preferred it for being such, even if it was following others of the same style. It seemed a little thin, and I found that it slipped down my throat quite quickly, leaving some alcohol burn that is slightly disappointing. Fortunately, the other elements of the beer make up for it. As for drinkability, it's got a pretty high ABV. It's an evening sipper or 'end-of-the-day' type brew--best slow and steady to finish the day up. 1,643 charactersProteus93, Jun 04, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: vigorous pour into a tulip glass, about 1/3 inch of head which dissipates within a couple of minutes. It's as dark as Abyss or a strong cup of drip coffee. Not as opaque as Old Viscosity, however. 
Smell: I'm really excited about this one and at first I kept smelling it without actually tasting it trying to nail down exactly what's coming into my nose. Definitely smelling bitter chocolate and the aroma you get when you grind beans for espresso. As it warms up the bourbon smell becomes a bit more apparent.
Taste: First sip - very rich - chocolatey and thick. What a mouthful! I could feel the heat of the alcohol, but I wasn't tasting it very much at just-out-of-the-fridge temp. As it's warmed up, it's tasting a little more like smooth tobacco and of course imperial stout, and while I know there is a bourbon flavor here somewhere, I am not really tasting it yet.
Mouthfeel: Sucking a bit of it into my mouth, and before it's really on my taste buds, it really does have the mouthfeel of chocolate milk--then when the flavors spread on my tongue I'm quickly reminded that I'm drinking a very impressive adult beverage.
Overall: I'm going to need to get a lot of these. This rivals KBS in my book -- they're different versions of one of my favorite styles. I'm going to have to go head to head one of these nights. Quite a commitment to drink a 22 of 13% imperial stout, but on special occasions, this will deliver quite a treat. 1,452 charactersellswrth, Jun 04, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle poured into my Deschutes snifter. Really looking forward to this beer!
Appearance - Pours a deep, dark black color with about a fingers worth of dark brown looking bubbles that aren't quite creamy, but that's probably the best descriptor for them. Head diminishes pretty quickly, but leaves a nice dark tan ring and a grouping of rockier bubbles in the middle.
Smell - There are some aromas of barrel aging, but they aren't overpowering and not strictly Bourbon barrel notes in the smell. There's a good deal of oak and barrel juice, but not straight bourbon barrels like some other beers (think Older Viscosity 2011). Makes sense though because they didn't just age this in Bourbon barrels, it's blended with some other stuff as well. Other notes in there are big bitter dark chocolate and burnt roast malt like a wonderful RIS should be. Behind that there's some pretty strong vanilla, hints of coffee and I feel like what I can't quite put my finger on is notes of dark fruit or slight dark cherry. Very complex and enjoyable aroma! 
Taste - At first, the taste hits me with lots of dark roasted malt, smooth bittersweet chocolate, vanilla sweetness, charred oak, and some Bourbon hints. The barrel aged flavors are complex, but not strong or overpowering at all. You can tell there was some blending going on, some bourbon barrel aging, some other things as well. Next I get more of that rich dark chocolate and rich roasted malt and maybe some toffee and some of the dark fruit from the nose. Finish is some more dark chocolate and bold roasted malt of an RIS with just the slightest alcohol hint of alcohol on the way down, but still so smooth and wonderful. Overall, I think the taste of this is near fantastic. You can tell it's Bourbon barrel aged (mostly, but not all), but it's not in your face about it. The flavors meld with a complexity that I think I've yet to experience in any other beer I've had. Frankly, I think this is pretty damn deserving of 5.0 in the taste. I can only imagine how this one is going to age after a year or two. 
Mouthfeel - Mouthfeel actually tends towards the lighter side for an Imperial Stout, but not light by any means. I was surprised to find myself not needing an extended amount of time between sips to get the mouth coating dryness to go away so I could take another sip. That aspect makes this one very drinkable and almost dangerous for the ABV it's at. I would describe the mouthfeel as velvety smooth, with a full, rich body (not heavy) and a moderate carbonation.
Overall - I just can't say enough about the complexity of this beer. It's like the *perfect* amount of everything mixed in. I'm not a fan of drinking a stout that tastes like someone slipped a shot of Bourbon in it. If I wanted that much Bourbon flavor, I'd just drink Bourbon. But this beer finds a wonderful middle ground between Bourbon and the other barrels used and it really just compliments what I can imagine the base beer being. Absolutely wonderful beer and I can't wait for the other half I have warming up from fridge temp! 3,071 charactersmatttttYCE, Jun 03, 2011

M- This is what really stood out to me on this beer is the mouth feel. Just like a big thick cask condition Imperial Stout. Supper creamy and gentle on the palate, like a glass of milk. Truly awesome.

A - Pours dark as night, with a thick creamy 1 finger brown head. Fades to a thin head, leaving spotty lacing.
S - The smells are so wonderfully combined, of coffee, dark chocolates, burnt toasty oak, and ever a little bit of black licorice.
T - Dark chocolates hit the tongue right away. The middle gives way to vanilla, and a chared woodsey flavor. Very warming as it goes down. The taste is just as complex as the smell is.
M - Nice and thick, full-heavy mouthfeel. Perfect amount of carbonation for an imperial stout.
O - This is a very well crafted imperial stout. It's everything a stout should be, thick, complex, robust. It's all here. I can't wait to see what some aging will do to this... 751 charactersRizalini, Jun 02, 2011

Blacker than the inside of a dead mans coffin on a moonless night.
Scent of chocolate, bourbon and coffee.
Great, complex flavor, a little boozie but that dessipates and comes back oakie and charred.

T: Complex layering of consisting of chocolate (so good!), vanilla, oak, toffee, bourbon but not overpowering, and some coffee/espresso.
M: Perfectly thick & rich with mild carbonation. 
O: Outstanding big beer. FW continues to impress with their Parabola. This beer is very complex and hides the alcohol nicely! Just the right amount of bourbon comes through. Don't pass up the opportunity to try some if you have the chance! 629 charactersAngst, Jun 01, 2011
4.11/5  rDev -9.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a tulip, black as night, with a 2 finger brown head. Wow. This is one good looking beer. Good luck trying to see through this one. Leaves a bit of lacing as well. I primarily smell booze and some vanilla, with a little bit of dark chocolate, and a slight hint of cherries. The smell is pretty good and clearly has a lot of dimensions to it..however, I feel like the booze is a little too prominent in the smell. Taste is bourbon, dark fruits, vanilla, dark chocolate. For such high IBUs, I really do not get much bitterness at all..the end is mostly bourbon rather than hops. I could really use more chocolate and less booze in the taste. I think I would love this beer if that were the case. 
I am going back and forth on this beer. Just for the record - I am not a big fan of bourbon barrel aged stouts. I generally find them too bourbon forward and not balanced enough. This is by far the most balanced bourbon barrel aged stout I've had. However, overall, this is still not a beer I would seek out or trade my first born for. It's a very good beer...and I'm curious to see how it will drink with a year on it. It is still too hot to me right now. It leaves a slightly unpleasant boozy aftertaste that I'm not fond of. Luckily, I have another one, so I think I will sit on that for a while. When it comes to imperial stouts, the Abyss has my heart, and so far nothing has come very close. This is no exception. 1,426 charactersatowle25, Jun 01, 2011

A: Pours black with fluffy brown head. Decent retention that leaves some lacing around glass. Some dark reddish brown hues around the edges when held to the light.
S: Roasted malts, oak, chocolate, vanilla and some alcohol. Alcohol becomes much more pronounced and begins to overpower the other aromas as it warms up from cellar temperature.
T: Layers of extremely rich and delicious bittersweet chocolate, oak, roasted malts, vanilla with some bourbon notes and a touch of alcohol. Fantastic.
M: Silky smooth full body with moderate carbonation, a bit more carbonation than I like in an imperial stout. Very little heat for a fresh 13% ABV barrel aged stout.
O: One of my favorite imperial stouts. You can really taste the additional complexities from the bourbon barrel aging without having the bourbon overpower everything else thats going on. Another world class beer from Firestone Walker. 977 charactersAzurescens, May 28, 2011

4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52011 version, acquired from the Firestone Walker brewery in Paso Robles. Massive props to my mom for picking this one up for me on her way to SF! The bottles states 12.5% abv. 
A: Dark motor oil with minimal dark chocolate head. No light penetrates the glass ... beautiful.
S: Intensely complex. Oak, vanilla, roasted caramel, bourbon and subtle hops.
T: Very palatable for such a high alcohol beer. The bourbon character from barrel aging is well-balance. Layers of complexity one would expect from a world class barrel-aged imperial stout. Impossible to describe but it is massive and dangerously drinkable. I imagine the flavors will meld and the hops will mellow in time ... will probably be a 5 with a year of cellaring. 
M: Surprisingly light ... I don't get any of the syrupy/oily aftertaste one might expect, which is a good thing. 
O: This is one well worth seeking out, although I suspect many will be disappointed with its availability, especially us in CA. I didn't give it a 5 because this will only get better with age. However, it is outstanding right now. 1,076 charactersSFGuy187, May 25, 2011

Pours a deep deep dark brown, with a slight mocha colored head.
The nose is out of this world, chocolate brownie or fudge followed with carame, toffee and oak.
The taste follows the nose perfectly, chocolate and vanilla with toffee tossed in. A mild oaky bourbon flavor towards the end, the alcohol taste does not indicate 13%.
The mouth is smooth and oily. A nice thick texture.
An amazing beer that should really age well. 502 charactersYnot2, May 23, 2011

Yesterday on the official release of this '11 Parabola, I didn't have time to stop by Firestone on my way to a wedding in San Luis Obisbo. But I'm glad because today we stopped by and took our time and was able to enjoy a meal as well as this phenomenal beer. 
From the tap to a snifter tasting glass:
Poured a beautiful thick pitch black color. Nothing visible while held to light. Light frothy khaki head. Very little head retention. 
Notes of deep chocolate/cacao, rich bourbon, roasted malt, leather and a little roasted nut. 
Deep, dark full flavor with the Same flavor notes for the most part. Nice chocolate flavor up front with sweet/dark maltiness, nice alcohol-bourbon and a little oaky. 
Smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel at first to the bourbonny alcohol zip. And that nice chocolatey bourbon aftertaste. Low carbonation. 
The only reason I did not give this beer a perfect score is because it will be absolutely perfect after some proper aging. All the extra levels of flavor will open up that much more to make this beer a life changer. It is crafted So Well. So Balanced. Not overwhelming in Any way. I got 2 bottles for myself and can't wait for the right time to enjoy this Perfect Imperial Stout again. 
Smooth and silky with the alcoholic zip. Low carbonation. 1,309 charactersMrVonzipper, May 23, 2011

S: Super dark and rich notes of black licorice, spicy bourbon, caramel, and dark roasted malts.
T: Follows the nose with big notes of licorice, bourbon, roasted malts and maybe a hint of chocolate and coffee. The finish is full of vanilla, marshmallow and latte foam. The aftertaste is extremely roasted, smoky and lasts forever.

Pour: Jet black with a one fingered dark tan (espresso) head that lingers for a few minutes then turning into a small bubbled edge clinging head.
Nose: Fudge brownies, vanilla, charred oak, toffee, caramel, slight hops, espresso, slight alcohol and marshmallow. The bourbon character seems very smooth and well integrated into the beer. Very complex.
Taste: Fudge brownie, vanilla, charred oak, thick molasses, slight alcohol, bourbon (toasted coconut, charred oak, toffee and caramel), marshmallow and espresso. Also, a nice hop profile comes into play at the end of all the massive chocolate and bourbon notes.
Mouthfeel: Thick and oily, tongue coating (hell, mouth coating). This is a beer to bs respected.
Overall: I absolutely think FW has it going on here. An incredibly crafted stout that is underrated as far as I'm concerned. It's better (IMO) than The Abyss, Dark Lord, Speedway, MZ, etc. Absolutely amazing. 946 characterswaltersrj, May 22, 2011

Chewy thick syrupy full body. Smooth, creamy, and velvety. Low carbonation enhances the creaminess.

O - An excellent BA stout. It's truthfully hard to find something wrong with this beer, besides the looks.

A-Gorgeous jet black with 1/4 inch of chocolate milk colored head. 
S-Bourbon oak, vanilla, caramel. A little boozy, but nothing significant.
T/M-The first thing that strikes me about Parabola is the wonderful silky mouthfeel. It coats the palate, allowing the full range of flavors to creep in slowly. Lots of bourbon oak, obviously. The requisite caramel/vanilla flavors are well integrated. This is a really great BA stout. The finish is warming and boozy. Never gets too sweet, which can be a problem with other beers in this style. The finish reveals a light roasted coffee bean flavor that I didn't catch right away. Full bodied with low carbonation.

A- Pitch black oil comes out of the bottle and a dark mocha colored head forms on top of it. A nice size and good retention. Frothy cloud and ring leave a nice coat of thick lace.
S- Bourbon and very rich chocolate. Pretty much no alcohol. Good oak notes. Smells like a very decadent chocolate cake dessert, yummy.
T- Roasted malt and rich chocolate followed very nicely by whiskey, toasted oak and vanilla. Cherry, raisins and dark fruit add a good dimension once it starts to warm up a lot. A tiny hint of earthy hops as well.
MF- Thick and almost chewy feel with a very silky smooth level of carbonation. Just a bit of warmth from alcohol.
Amazingly hidden ABV and a very rich flavor make this one drink dangerously. A really nice blend of flavors come in this bottle, anyone who likes big stouts needs to try this. 1,032 characterscbutova, May 07, 2011

Pours black as black. Small brown head turns to ring eventually leaving some lacing.
Smell is rich chocolate cake and roasted malt, not much bourbon barrel. Simple but great scent, gains strength with warmth.
Tastes like fudge brownies, vanilla, oak and bourbon are on the light side but balanced excellently. Big on roasted malts, smoky almost. Has the feel of a very traditional imperial stout with a good, not overpowering bourbon taste which is awesome.
13%, wha wha? Insanely hidden, goes down so easy. Lowish carbonation, thick mouthfeel, great balance. 13% here is a magic trick.
Comparing it to other bourbon stouts, it doesn't have the complexity of The Abyss, but this is WAY less harsh and more balanced than 1-year old Bourbon County Stout. Great beer, hope to get another bomber. 981 charactersChico1985, May 07, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Beerzebub for getting me this one, some time ago.
A - It pours a deep brown-black, and is capped with a tight tan head. It looks quite a bit like a FES; more so than RIS. Nice, regardless. Not so much lace, (or retention) but the brew shows legs to atone.
S - The nose is intially very basic heavily roasted stout character, with small hints of sweetish wood impartation. As it opens up I get wildly ranging notes including soy sauce, charcoal, cocoa, vanilla, caramel-toffee, and pipe tobacco.
T - The flavor is quite deep, favoring heavily roasted barley, coffee and chicory, and dry-drying oak notes (in contrast to the woody sweetness offered in the nose.) As it airs out, notes of vanilla, burnt sugar, dried medium- and stone- fruit, and booze are increasingly evident. I am left with the impression that this is intended to be a rather traditionalist take on the style (a la Stone IRS), as opposed to brews like BT, DL, Hunahpu, BCBS, et al. which eschew preconceived notions. As such, it is a resounding success.
M - The feel is kind of like a FES; it is somewhat too easy-drinking for the style?!
O - This is a rock-solid brew. Firestone Walker has impressed me with their steadfast grip on the fundamentals. 1,236 charactersktrillionaire, Apr 24, 2011

A - Pours a midnight black, there's no way to garner anything through this opaque deluge of liquid. It actually has a good amount of chocolate highlights, dancing around the edges and offering the any visibility in this beer. There's a nice 2-fingered, dark mocha head, quite dark and thick and composed of tightly bunched bubbles. It has some of the most sporadic lacing I've seen, spattering haphazardly around the glass. Decent alcohol legs as well.
S - The nose is very robust and complex, bringing rich aromas of chocolate, anise, slight dark fruits, and alcohol. The malts play a huge part in this beer, bringing a bit of roast, a thick fudge-like chocolate characteristic, and the licorice is quite strong. There's a little alcohol astringency in the back-end.
T - The first taste brings a huge rush of flavor that it's hard to categorize everything. At first there's huge chocolate and fudge notes, mixed with bourbon and vanilla. The bourbon is a complement to the flavors here rather than driving it, which is how I prefer my bourbon-aged beers to be. The roast is here as well, but doesn't give off much coffee notes, just some bitterness and a feeling similar to tobacco. The licorice is here is well, but more subdued and melds well with some of the other dark fruit here. The alcohol astringency is back here, but serves more as a reminder that this beer is 13% rather than something that makes this unenjoyable, as that is certainly not the case.
M - Mouthfeel is moderately heavy-bodied with pretty low carbonation. Acceptable carbonation for the style and it feels a bit syrupy in the mouth. Leaves a heavy coating on the palate and keeps injecting flavors in the aftertaste well after I put the glass down.
D - Drinkability is high. This is an excellent barrel-aged beer and certainly a great introduction to Firestone Walker. I'm a sucker for the chocolate fudge taste and smooth bourbon in stouts so this is definitely a favorite for me. I will definitely be seeking out further releases and try to cellar some! 2,131 charactersnhindian, Apr 24, 2011

Poured in to my Portsmouth snifter
A: This beer pours an opaque deep brown with a one finger brown head. Head recedes quickly leaving small spots of lacing. 
S: Nose is sweet, toffee, molasses, brown sugar and a bit of roast. 
T: Taste starts with a sweet vanilla and toffee flavoring. Middle has a roastiness where a hefty dose of alcohol flavoring takes over. Helloooo bourbon! More oaked vanilla notes and bitter bakers chocolate are present in the background. 
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, a bit thin and slightly prickly. 
O: Goes down alright, somewhat tasty, somewhat filling, decent kick, ok representation of style. I was really looking forward to this beer, and although it's not undrinkable, I would opt for others of the style. Perhaps aging a bit would enhance this beer. 878 charactersJayli, Apr 22, 2011

2010 Vintage at Fridge Temp
A- Pours a viscous solid black with a real thin less than a finger khaki head that dissipates to nothing more than a small rim around the edge of the glass. Leaves sticky splotchy lacing and some really nice alcohol feet on the side of the glass. 
S- Smells really good and inviting. Up front is a strong bourbon, oak, and vanilla from the barrels. Behind that are tons of subtle chocolate, coffee, and dark fruit notes in there. Definitely some alcohol present in the nose as it warms. 
T- Wow so much going on here. Roasted burnt malts hit the front of the tongue that's followed by a nice blend of dark bittersweet chocolate, a nice array of dark fruits, and slight coffee. As it warms the bourbon heat comes out more as well as some really nice oak and vanilla flavors. Alcohol is extremely well hidden even at room temperature, the complexity of the beer makes it invisible. 
M- Full bodied with moderate carbonation and I nice dry finish 
Overall this is an extremely complex and well crafted Imperial Stout no doubt. I am really interested in tasting this vintage in a couple years and seeing how it changes.

4.18/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 422oz bottle poured into my Bruery tulip glass. this was a reserve series no 001 bottle that was brought to a recent tasting.
a - poured jet black into my glass. gave a slight tan head that dissipated fairly quickly.
s - great smelling beer that has a lot of scents given off. the use of different barrels is apparent with its aroma. scents that stand out are chocolate, oak, roasted coffee, and a hint of vanilla.
t - the number of flavors tasted are numerous just like it's scent. tastes of bitter chocolate, coffee, dry oak, vanilla, and a hint of a red wine undertone. the flavors become more detectable as the beer warms.
m - medium bodied but thinner than i was expecting for a stout. good carbonation.
d - this is a very flavorful stout from FW. the use of blended barrels is very noticeable with the smell and taste of this beer. easy to drink especially knowing that it is 13% avb. 894 charactersnightwing002, Apr 17, 2011

Maybe a touch of coconut as well. Very sweet but dry. Overall, a solid barrel aged brew 366 charactersUrbancaver, Apr 17, 2011

4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to trappistlover for this!
(A)- Thick and pitch black. Initially produced a good brown colored head, but that left pretty quickly. 
(S)- Very rich. Molasses, caramel and chocolate sweetness, with some coffee. Amazing bittersweetness. Also smells strong. 
(T)- Follows the smell to a tee. Coffee, chocolate, molasses and caramel, however I'm now catching that light vanilla that makes bourbon aged stouts so wonderful. You can taste the heat, but the heat tastes good! 
(M)- Very thick and rich. I wish it had just a bit more, or really any, carbonation. 
(O)- It's strong and rich, but I could easily throw this whole bomber back myself. 649 charactersjcnd9803, Apr 14, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: Standard pour yields a 2.5 finger dark, frothy, mocha head with fantastic retention. Beer pours thick and oily, hiding its carbonation well with a dense, pitch black color. Lacing is stringy and spotty with great stick and thick legs. 
S: Nose is vanilla, chocolate, honey, booze, fudge, dark fruit, prunes, plums, and sweet soy sauce. Very aromatic and deep.
T: Opens maple syrup and a slight bit of toasted malt. Chocolate, vanilla, prunes, and sweet soy sauce in the middle. End is a slight twinge of booze and heat miced with coarse brown sugar. Finish is fudge, chocolate, roasted malt, and sweet soy sauce with a cocoa powder aftertaste. 
M: Medium to full bodied and moderately carbonated. Oily and silky in the mouth and very smooth going down. I'd give the feel a 5 just on the finish alone. Super smooth with a pleasant yet subtle aftertaste. 
D: For a 13% ABV beer, you can barely taste the heat at all here. Deliciously full flavored with a feel that's unmatched. Do what it takes to seek this one out. It's worth it. 1,036 charactersbiggied, Apr 12, 2011
3.92/5  rDev -13.7%look: 4 | smell: 2 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Split with airohead2001. I had high expectations for this beer, as I enjoyed a sample at FoBAB and enjoyed FW13.
A: black in color with a ½ finger mocha head that fades fairly quickly into a crown and oily film. There's minor lacing.
S: There's a little bourbon and then some alcohol that comes through as a windex type smell. I don't know if my nose is just off tonight, or if this beer just doesn't have a smell anywhere near the taste. I was worried I had a bad bottle at first smell, but the taste is spot on.
T: There's a nice balance of milk chocolate, a little bit of roast, and a little bit of coffee. The bourbon comes through up front and is just the right strength, as it adds to the overall profile without being overpowering. This is an excellent beer for this style, but not quite my favorite. My only complaints are I would have liked a little more smoothness and a little more dark fruit flavors.
M: The beer has an above average viscosity for the style, which I like. The carbonation is appropriately low and the aftertaste is great.
O: Overall, an excellent beer. Not quite in my top 5 stouts, but probablyly in the top 10. The beer is balanced, tastes great, and has great drinkability for 13%. 1,219 charactersglazeman, Apr 05, 2011
4.02/5  rDev -11.5%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I distinctly remember the day when my buddy and I took a break from Step 1 studying to discuss the means by which we would procure some Parabola. I've had Firestone 13 and Firestone 14, but this is my first tasting of Parabola.
Appearance is nothing special. Black. One finger brown head that quickly fades. Not too viscous.
Smell is good - booze, dark fruits, some cinnamon, and some mild roasts that remind me of a porter. These blend together to make a nice scent, but again, nothing too special. 
Taste, on the other hand, is outstanding. Warm vanilla bourbon up front with plenty of booze. Finish is harsh, tobacco roasts that linger until the next sip. The sweetness of the vanilla mixed with the harsh roasts blend together nicely. This beer doesn't have the chocolate or coffee overtones that make many bourbon stouts special, but really it doesn't need it.
Mouthfeel is very good - sticky and thick.
Overall this beer was great and incredibly drinkable. The ABV is noticeable, but the taste is so rich that I can't keep the glass down. Well done. 1,060 charactersairohead2001, Apr 05, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Well, the lights are off so I'm not entirely sure. Most reasonably-minded people would turn the lights on at this juncture but, well, I don't put that much weight into a beer's appearance, and certainly not enough that I'm willing to allow reality back into the room.
Smell: Like a maltings. Actually, like a distinguished gent in a trilby who's enjoyed the finest of bourbons being doused on his person, and has subsequently taken to rolling about on the floor of a maltings. Also, vanilla and over-ripe bananas. In a word: divine. In two words: it's divine. 
Taste: Where to begin, where to begin. Vanilla, cherry liquor, heavily roasted malt, 80% cacao chocolate, the liquid soap you find in hospital bathrooms, exotic woods, vague hop bitterness, your mother's hugs.
Mouthfeel: Thick. When this bad momma' jamma' glugged out the bottle I half-expected it to re-form in my glass as the T1000.
Overall: A delightfully rich, chocolatey romp in the mouth. The bourbon/vanilla notes are spot on and make this beer something akin (I think) to Goose Island BCBVS. 
Thanks to alfrantzell for the beer. And to think all he made me do was tongue kiss him for a bottle. 1,179 charactersImperialStoat, Apr 03, 2011

I poured from a bomber into a snifter, the pour is jet black, thin tan head. The aroma has big notes of coffee, chocolate, oak. There are hints of vanill and some bourbon. The taste follows the nose, and all of the flavors are very well balanced. The alcohol is not real hot. It has a lingering warm finish. A full bodied beer, very creamy mouth feel. This is a homerun for BA stouts. 437 charactersbonkers, Apr 02, 2011

Pours pitch black and completely opaque with a one finger dark mocha head that quickly fades into a thick lasting ring. Sporadic spots of lacing left behind.
Complex aroma with a good balance of luscious roasted malt, dark fruit, coffee and bourbon. The barrel character is there without overpowering the other notes. Lots of earthy oak/dry wood in the nose along with sweet boozy bourbon as well as some hints of vanilla and toasted coconut. Lots of dark roasted malt giving off hints of dark chocolate, roasted coffee bean, oatmeal and tobacco. Slightly smokey but not burnt or acrid smelling. Smells like there might even be some cedar in there. Surprisingly, underneath all of this, there is some very faint light fruit and licorice as well as a good bit of earthy, piny hops. This beer has 80 IBUs and it shows in the nose, even with all of the other intense aromas. 
Chewy full body with a blast of dry, bitter hops up front that lingers thrughout the intense malt backbone into a nice warm fnish. Resinous, earthy pine flavor that holds it's own against the more intense, robust flavors. This adds another dimension to this beer that I wasn't expecting. After the initial bitterness there is a strong barrel presence with a prominent dry oak/wood flavor. The bourbon and other spirits are there but they are well integrated into the beer withut turnng it into a hot, boozy mess. The smoother vanilla/marshmallow/coconut notes that were suggested in the aroma aren't evident to my palate. 
Although there is a nice bourbon flavor, the robust, roasted malt flavors are very prominent. Lots of luscious dark chocolate, oatmeal and burnt toast as well as a very strong roasted coffee bean presence. The coffee/espresso flavor is deep and roasty but is not stale, burnt or acrid tastng at all and doesn't overpower the other flavors. Again, I'm picking up a good amount of smokiness/tobacco flavor that I'm really loving. All of these flavors are bouncing off of one another resulting in an incredibly complex, delicious beer. Each sip brings something new and although there is some nice heat and burn in the finish, the ABV at 13% is very well masked. Very quaffable and tackling the whole bomber was no problem for me. Maybe that says more about me than the beer but that's a discussion for another time. 2,387 characterscorby112, Apr 01, 2011

Appearance: Deep dark blackness with a finger and a half of smooth mocha colored head.
Smell: Great nose. Hints of bold roasted coffee, dark chocolate, fudge brownie, vanilla, oak and some booze.
Taste: Following the nose, sweet chocolate and vanilla, oak, fudge, and coffee.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and extremely creamy. Does not seem like it is over 7%.

Smell: Chocolate-brownie with a a touch of coffee; raisins and dates behind it; perhaps some toffee and a bit of vanilla also
Taste: Very chocolate-fudgey with creamy coffee on the finish; slightly hot. Touches of brandy, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla and oak. Despite the boozy heat there is not a large bourbon presence.
Mouthfeel: Silky and smooth; but a bit thinner than expected. Probably due to the high ABV
Overall: Well balanced and well done, although the high ABV makes it a bit hot and thin, keeping the score from breaking 4.5. I greatly prefer it to any of the anniversary blends. 712 characterscraytonic, Mar 27, 2011

Served in my Firestone Walker snifter because I can. Pour is pretty much black with a nice amount of creamy tan head that leaves some sticky lace.
Smell is perfect with notes of chocolate, bourbon, oak, coconut and some roasted nuttiness. Slight hint of vanilla and perhaps a flutter of bitter chocolate. Taste is much of the same and this thick beverage is not lacking in flavor, mouthfeel, or drinkability. I could drink this bitch all day long. 
One of the best BA Imperial Stouts around. Highly recommended. 574 charactersLunch, Mar 26, 2011

Bourbon is prominent in the smell, mixing with bitter roasted malts, wood, and bitter chocolate.
The taste upfront is sweet brown sugar, molasses, and bourbon. More bitterness starts coming through in the middle--bitter chocolate intermingles with the bourbon. Really good sweet/bitter mix at the end. Lingering bitterness.
Full bodied with a light chewiness. Syrupy with light carbonation--but enough to keep it drinkable. Slightly dry finish. No alcohol heat.
Really great balance of bourbon and roastyness. The aroma is heavier on bourbon than the taste, allowing for a great dynamic flavor that isn't overwhelmed by the bourbon.

A: Almost black, but with small ruby highlights around the edges. Minimal head fades to a thin rim.
A: Chocolate, vanilla, wood, and char, with bourbon. Woody notes, with an earthy hop undertone.
T: More chocolate and bourbon. Slight char with vanilla and earth. The barrel is not overpowering letting the base beer shine through. Finishes sweet with a very appearant alcohol burn.
M: Heavy body, light carbonation as expected with this brew.
D and overall impression: Couldn't have very much of this one, my 6 oz. pour was enough. Overall, I thought it was good, not great. The booziness was just a little too much for my taste. Maybe a little more age would mellow the flavors a bit. Skal. 780 charactersGtreid, Mar 15, 2011

Reserve Series No. 001
A - Pours a gorgeous ink color with some slight ruby hints on the edges. There is a nice 1 inch head that is quite tight with some nice medium bubbles scattered around. The head is nice and tan colored.
S - Sweet molases start off with some nice slight roasted espresso hints. Some burnt notes and a real nice and intense woody oak aroma. There is some nice perceived grassy hop notes also on the nose that compliment the sweetness and roasted quite well.
T & M - Starts off with sweet molasses and sweet booze. The sweetness is delicious with carmel notes and some slight chocolate notes. It is not too intense and quite enjoyable. There is dark chocolate sweetness and bitterness as well mixed in well with some mild coffee roast that is quite complimentary and balances the sweetness well. There is some Bourbon and vanilla notes in there as well as some nice dry woody oak notes. The body is nice and oily with some velvety feel to it. There is a nice slightly hopy bitter finish but there is also a nice sweet and sticky after taste. 
D - The ABV is high and a bit present. Especially as it warms but it is a delicious stout and quite a treat. I wouldn't mind having another one. 1,257 charactersJoEBoBpr, Mar 14, 2011

The appearance is beautiful. Exactly the deep rich darkness you want in a barrel ages Russian imperial stout. Typing while drinking, I termed it "Tan head thick pitch black body. Riiich. Like swimming in Africa with ebony and ivory playing on vinyl. Stevie Wonder. I see what you see." I take that to mean it's dark.
The smell is booze, coffee, chocolate and bitter. Quality aroma with complexity that defies any singular element.
The taste is sooo rich. Like a bitter chcolate cake - fudge, coffee, burnt roasty malts, no smoke, just rich rich pure cocoa. Also thick enough and sweet enough that the booze that's present is welcome, even in the finish that come with a bit of hops. The thick body is like dessert, and the only problem is that it's a lot to drink an entire bomber. Which is just what I wound up doing. 
All the same, it produced some fun quotes from notes: "will update on comp. I love parabola. Note: male a joke about having this in San Fran wheee the gills are like parabolas" 1,155 charactersafksports, Mar 13, 2011

A - Pours pitch black with a small cap of half finger tall tan head, dissipating down to almost nothing, leaving little to no lacing down the glass.
S - Plenty of dark malt, chocolate, vanilla, dulled bourbon heat, and some light charred wood. Good overall balance but nothing too over the top. Solid Stuff.
T - Flavors are similar to the nose. Lots of dark roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and charred oak. The booze is very well hidden, offering only short glimpses of the warming bourbon. Finish is a mix of sweetness and lightly warming heat. Damn, this is one good beer. I might need to get a few bottles of this for myself.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Nice full feel with some lingering sweet roast in the finish.
D - Very good. I have wanted to try this one for awhile now and now that I have I am impressed. I just wish I would have picked up a few bottles for myself. 1,037 charactersorangesol, Mar 10, 2011

bottle to NB Globe
Split with GuruDel
App- Almost black with a one finger quick receding head.
Smell- Just like a big Double Stout with some malts, chocolates and suprisingly some faint hops.
Taste- A lot more hoppy than I would have thought. It was quite good, but drinking after the BCBVS was a bad idea. The flavors of Parabola just don't compare. Nice chocolatey taste with subtle malt and more hops for a stout than normal.
Mouth- Big Medium Bodied with a medium carb level. Rich chocolate and some hops.
Drink- Overall, a really great stout. Would suggest to someone to trade/find someone who has one. 632 charactersFosterJM, Mar 10, 2011

I wanted to test out Galileo's theory that the path of a projectile follows a parabola. ***Caution Spoilers*** After finishing the beer, I aimed my Python at a 45 degree angle. Sure enough the trajectory followed his theory. Great success!!! ***End of Spoliers*** 
I reeled this one in with my trusty Heady Topper. It better be worth it. The heady topper required a long trek through the treacherous mountains of Vermont all the way to the heavily fortified hideout labeled "The Alchemist." 
I poured my 11 oz into a delirium tremens snifter. A viscous black sludge poured out with a creamy tan head. Looks at good as Christina Ricci in black snake moan. The lacing didn't coat the glass but with a little agitation a massive web covered the glass. 
Inhaling deeply brought feels of déjà vu. Opening my eyes was the only thing I could think of to bring myself back to reality and out of daydreaming about a small blond girl named Crissy that I knew in college. I would stand across the room from her expelling 98.6 degree frosting which would follow a parabola ending at her chin. Rich dark roasted malts, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, oak, mild hint of booze. 
The taste brings me back to another college experience that actually involves my tasting partner who engulfed a shooter and fell on the floor 5 minutes later. Tastes as good as making out with two chicks in the hot tub. The roasted malts are so big. There is a light licorice, bourbon presence complimenting each other nicely. Then vanilla steps up to the plate, along with oak accents, chocolate, and coffee. Complex, or multifaceted if you aren't into the whole brevity thing. 
Smooth, Creamy, Kate Perry, bold, balanced. All words I think of as I swirl this heavenly brew around my mouth. 
Bases are loaded on this one and Firestone put one over the fence with this beer. One of my favorite Imperial stouts. 13 percent beers are usually designed to be sippers. I couldn't get enough of this one. 2,038 charactersDNICE555, Mar 03, 2011

4.32/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I have had this beer as part of three separate vertical /horizontal tasting events of Firestone Walker Eleven, Twelve, Thirteen, Fourteen, & Parabola. All of which took place in the last 4 months. One was at an apartment with beers from my, and a fellow Beer Advocates cellar, the other was at a bottle share at Instant Replay in Canoga Park, CA. The third was hosted & served at Blue Palms in Hollywood, California. 
I compiled notes from all three events, before I reviewed this beer here, to be as fair as possible to something that is rare, released once (for each anniversary) sought after, aged, and to a degree hyped as well. Also, each event I had 3-4 oz of each beer, and I felt I needed to try them again to better evaluate them, (also considered storing conditions affecting the beer.) Since I have now had about 9-12 oz of each beer in totality, I feel I can post my humble opinion of them in a review. 
Poured from a 22 oz bottle into a Bruery Tulip glass (was a large Brandy at Blue Palms, but a Bruery Tulip at the other two tastings) 
The beer's appearance is a deep black with a foamy cappuccino colored head, which rose about an inch or less, and then quickly faded to a thin carbonated ring, leaving just a tinge of lacing on the sides of the glass.
The scents and aromas on the nose are well integrated, and show off the barrel more than anything. (Also makes you want to smell it for a while before actually tasting it) I get whiffs and notes of oak, caramel, bourbon, and vanilla, as well as some heat, followed by a mild cocoa. I also get some dark chocolate, burnt wood, and coffee. None of these are overpowering, but rather smooth. 
The taste was a bit surprising, given the nose. Velvet smooth, roasted chocolate malt, and dark chocolate. (glad I had this with desert) These are much more prominent in the taste; only adding to a well balanced beer if this strong of roasted chocolate flavor can be masked by other notes on the nose. After allowing the beer to warm a bit more, I found the other flavors in the middle, caramel, light oak, bourbon, and heat on the finish. The alcohol is mostly there on the back end. 
The mouth feel is full, though light to moderate carbonation. A bit creamy initially, but also viscous and smooth. 
Overall, this beer was a great way to end a flight of all these great Firestone Walker beers. Can't say there is a bad one in the bunch. It basically boils down to flavor preference, and freshness to age preference, but these beers are deserving of their recognition, as they are well crafted, complex, and balanced. Glad I still have 3 bottles of Parabola, and I am looking forward to what age does for this beer. 2,682 charactersRetsinis, Feb 22, 2011

Bottle was around $15 to $18? Pours near black, thin heady. Lots of whiskey barrel, chocolate, dark roasty malts, molasses, coffee, dark fruits and hops. Body is full, but a bit under carbonated, poor finish. But a great barrel aged stout. 343 charactersrye726, Feb 21, 2011

S - Up front you get the bourbon and a bit of brown sugar. While I think there are other smells there, all I can discern is bourbon and sweet.
T - Not my favorite of the evening, but not bad either. Its mainly bourbon on the palate with a some toffee. A bit too sweet to be honest. Borders on Batch 9000 sweetness.
M - This completely coats the palate. Quite pleasant. Just the right about of carbonation. Low, but ideal for the style.
D - Honestly, the abv is a bit high to drink multiples and the sweetness might linger after a couple of these. 666 charactersdecadance, Feb 20, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this courtesy of brdc, much thanks. Poured from a bottle into a snifter. It pours a basically thick black opaque with a 1/4 inch dark tan head that diminished to a mild over-the-top lacing.
The aroma reminded me of dark chocolate and at cooler temperatures almost bubble gum sweet. Definitely roasted malts with some booze in the nose. There seems to be just a hint of coffee.
The taste has the similar roasted malt/dark chocolate components with a bit of vanilla and some whiskey-like sweetness.
The mouthfeel was medium/full bodied with a slightly weak carbonation. It was smooth and tasty leaving a nice dryness at the finish. A nice texture sits in your throat afterwards.
Overall, this is a good beer. The ABV and mouthfeel combine to make it slightly less drinkable but incredibly good. 800 charactersSykDoc, Feb 12, 2011
4.46/5  rDev -1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a goblet.
Appearance: Pours jet black with one finger of dark head. The head goes away but leaves some lacing.
Smell: Sweet and roasty with some dark chocolate notes coming through.
Taste: This one is quite sweet and roasty with hints of dark chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. The roast is kind of bitter and you can taste the booze at the finish. The booze is a bit hot.
Mouthfeel: The body is somewhat thick and it coats the mouth completely. The finish is dry.
Drinkability: I really like this one. It is quite well balanced and I intend to drink it again some day. 598 charactersoline73, Feb 10, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Severed in a snifter 
Look - Motor oil black, a finger and a half of very dark mocha colored head. The head lingers for a while and leaves pretty nice lacing. 
Smell - Nice bourbon smell but when compared to other -bal aged stouts it is a little faint, it really allows some other subtle aromas like bitter chocolate and some coffee to really shine through. 
Taste - The aromas that you get from the nose transfer to the taste very well. I get bourbon with chocolate, dark fruits like fig, a hint of coffee and a little vanilla.
Mouthfeel - I have never had a stout like this just but looking I would think that the mouthfeel would be very think, but in fact it is a medium body with good carbonation. All the while it still has the oily slickness that you look for in stouts. 
Drinkability - The 13% alc is present so this is a slow sipper. If this was as available as regular GI BCBS, I could see myself drinking this a lot. 931 charactersphisigben, Feb 09, 2011
3.96/5  rDev -12.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 32010 vintage. 650ml black foiled and boxed bottle.
It pours a thick, viscous black with a large dark tan hea that slowly recedes.
The smell is rich and chocolatey, chocolate seems to be the main smell my nostrils are picking up. It is big and luscious with a hint of roastiness. There are notes form the barrel aging with some vanilla and oak.
The flavor is a bit boozier, but very nice. It is chocolate and caramel with a big dose of coffee, oak, vanilla, dark fruits, and alcohol. It isn't ultra-complex at first, but then as you drink more and more of it subtle flavors come out.
The mouthfeel and drinkability could be better, the alcohol is a bit cloying and sweet.
A solid imperial stout from a fantastic brewery. 724 characterscrossovert, Feb 06, 2011

s-rich whisky and chocolate up front..a little alcohol heat is detectable...some cocoa and fudge...wood and vanilla...wow
t-starts of sweet and rich with bourbon whisky notes...the hops make a very bold statement right after then the waves of oak and vanilla and fudge rush in...followed by some dry cocoa and chocolate...finishes bitter and the chocolate really lingers
m-not as chewy as i would have imagined from the pour and thats why i docked it...the bitterness from the hops really linger on this one...this beer does coat the mouth well...really sticky
d-docked it a bit due to the slight alcohol burn on the way down...however they do mask the 13% very well in this beer...had to much fun enjoying this to have more than one...
overall another superb offering from Firestone and big thanks to James for sending it my way...ill have another down the road hopefully 1,133 charactersstoutfiend27, Feb 04, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Leon for sharing this brew on 1/22/11.
Poured into a snifter, this brew appears black in color with no light shining through as it is held to the light. A thin dark coating of brown head appears across the top. Faint spotty lace clings to the glass with legs. A swirl revives the cap to a thin film.
The aroma of this brew includes the pleasant barrel indication of vanilla. I love that smell in barrel aged beers. Sweet and roasty with indications of chocolate malt overtop of a tingly presence of whiskey. As it warms, notes of coffee, licorice and citrus hops come forward.
The taste includes a vanilla flavor just like the aroma led on. It is roasty with a mild bitterness like unsweetened chocolate mixed with whiskey. There is a tangy hop influence but it is mellow and does not outshine the roasty qualities of this brew. A lingering roastiness resides in the mouth with some earthy coffee notes and a bit of astringent alcohol.
This is a medium bodied brew that is lightly carbonated and very smooth drinking. Tons of flavors to enjoy and quite a deep brew. Roasty and bitter with lots of nuances to pick up on. This is a solid example of barrel aging and something I would love to have as a staple in the cellar. 1,235 charactersstakem, Feb 01, 2011
4.46/5  rDev -1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Jeff (ipa247) for this one. Poured from a 22oz. bomber into a Darkness snifter. Shared with schen9303. 
A: Standard pour yields a 2.5 finger dark, frothy, mocha head with fantastic retention. Beer pours thick and oily, hiding its carbonation well with a dense, pitch black color. Lacing is stringy and spotty with great stick and thick legs. 
S: Nose is vanilla, chocolate, honey, booze, fudge, dark fruit, prunes, plums, and sweet soy sauce. Very aromatic and deep with a heat that complements the other flavors well. 
T: Opens maple syrup and a slight bit of toasted malt. Chocolate, vanilla, prunes, and sweet soy sauce in the middle. End is a slight twinge of booze and heat miced with coarse brown sugar. Finish is fudge, chocolate, roasted malt, and sweet soy sauce with a cocoa powder aftertaste. 
M: Medium to full bodied and moderately carbonated. Oily and silky in the mouth and very smooth going down. I'd give the feel a 5 just on the finish alone. Super smooth with a pleasant yet subtle aftertaste. 
D: For a 13% ABV beer, you can barely taste the heat at all here. Black Tuesday has a lot to learn from this barrel-aged masterpiece. Deliciously full flavored with a feel that's unmatched. Do what it takes to seek this one out. It's worth it. 1,272 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 29, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Presentation: 22 oz bomber bottle courtesy of Garron. Big thanks for getting me a huge want for a long time. Served a little under room temperature and allowed to warm while drinking. 
Appearance: Midnight black in color with a nice, one finger mocha head. Surprisiningly good retention considering teh high alcohol content here.
Aroma: Some nice layered bourbo, baker's fudge, and vanilla all pull together nicely. Some licorice and tobacoo notes are also there and round out the aroma nicely. Complex but still maintaining exquisite balance. 
Taste: The notes from the aroma really come together perfectly here. Bourobn, fudge, and vanilla really are the main flavors and each are strong but not overpower each other. I get some licorice, espresso, and a hop leaf earthiness in the background that round out what could be an overally sweet beer and bring it into perfect balance.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and velvety smooth. I alo think they really nailed the carbonation on this. Just enough to compliment the smoothness and make it perfect to sip.
Drinkability: Even at 13% ABV, I really did not find it hard to finish a bottle by myself. Perfect to sit back and enjoy by yourself or share with friends. I'm so glad I got to try this. 
Overall, this is either number one or two for me in terms of barrel aged stouts (with Bourbon County regular) that I've had. The balance is absoutely unbelievable and the parts are perfectly integrated. Definitely something I recommend anything to try. 1,496 charactersGosox8787, Jan 29, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes.
Pours black as night with a milk chocolate colored head. Lots of lacing is left as it fades and a quick swirl reveals some serious legs. This is a really nice looking beer.
Where to start with the aroma... so complex... Lots of oak and bourbon but I'm also getting notes of licorice, leather, tobacco and some charred wood. Seems like a lot going on but the aromas are all very well integrated and work perfectly together.
The taste follows the smell with tons of oak, vanilla, tobacco and roast coffee. Lots of flavors, and exactly what you'd expect from a barrel aged imperial stout.
It smells and tastes great, but the mouthfeel may be the highlight. So velvety smooth with just the right amount of carbonation. This is a big, complex sipper of a beer, but wow is it good and it goes down way to easy. Looking forward to tracking down more of this. 876 characters321jeff, Jan 29, 2011

Poured from the bottle into 3 ounce tasting glasses.
A: Very viscous, almost no head. very nice coffee colored lacing. Very typical of the style
S: This is where the fun begins. You get immediate bourbon, lots and lots of bourbon. Vanilla pokes its way through also. 
T: Matches the smell beautifully. Instantly bourbon action. Molases is also present with burnt sugar and vanilla on the close. 
M: You can feel the alcohol burn on the back, and there is fair amount of carbonation present. I think a year or more in this cellar will make this a unbeatable stout. 
D: At 13% this feels more like a 9 or 10. But again, another year or more on the shelves and this bad boy will go down like water.

Probably the best smelling Imperial Stout I have ever smelled. Abyss, Dark Lord, BCS whatever they're not as pretty smelling as this. Caramel, chocolate, coffee, anise, vanilla and so much more there. I cant think of enough words to describe. 
Holy fuck. This is fantastic. Starts with licorice and chocolate and moves into the roasty flavors. Caramel and toffee really round this beer out. Finish is lightly boozy with plenty of vanilla. World class. 
Mouthfeel is full and decadent. Man. This is a fantastic beer and I am frankly surprised how fantastic it is. I thought the pinacle of Imperial Stouts was reached with Darklord but this takes the style to a whole other level AND I found it at a liquor store across my hotel in Santa Barbara and didn't have to get a golden ticket or nothing. Game changer. Get it if you find it. 897 charactersbosco7, Jan 21, 2011

Aroma is a nice mix of bourbon and chocolate in equal parts, boozy and wood. Taste is quite enjoyable, quite chocolaty with with a nice red fruit signature and a warm boozy bourbon finish .

4.41/5  rDev -2.9%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Inky black with dark hazelnut edges. Dark cocoa colored head quickly fades to an oil slick that drifts and slides across the top. I wasn't expecting much foam for 13% abv anyway. 
Aroma is sophisticated dark fruit like a Merlot or Cab, chocolate syrup, roasty singed caramel, and charred oak barrel. I didn't detect any oak char until I saw it suggested on the bottle: I'm picking up what Firestone is laying down. 
The roast malt acts as a base from which more complex flavors meld and emerge: sugar coated raisin, black cherry, Merlot, vanilla and milk chocolate. Thick and gooey mouthfeel. 
Good stuff. 608 charactersdonkeyrunner, Jan 12, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Picked this up at a great beer store, Tops Liquor, while at a conference in Phoenix. Been saving it for almost a year so it has some nice age on it. Pitch black pour with beautiful chocolate-colored two finger head that fades quickly with minimal lacing. The bourbon and oak are huge right from the first whiff. Hints of vanilla, tobacco, espresso and dark chocolate make every sip a pleasure to the nose. This is one big beer! The taste is huge and complex. As in the nose, the bourbon and oak are the stars. The balance is perfect with just enought bitter hops to offset the sweet malts. Dark chocolate, vanilla, roasty coffee, oak and lots of bourbon only get better as this warms. The mouthfeel is thick and smooth as silk. And although this is a huge sipper of a beer, it was extremely drinkable. I had read complaints about the size of the bottle being too big for one person, but I was totally enjoying every drop and never felt overwhelmed. The alcohol is warming but not overpowering. This is one of those rare beers and I can't thank the staff at Tops Liquors enough for hooking me up with this classic! 1,113 charactersbeerdrifter, Jan 08, 2011

Pours thick and black, two fingers of dark tan head slowly forms and recedes even slower...10 minutes later, there is still a small cap of dark tan head, no lacing...
Large doses of sweet vanilla mixes with chocolate to create a very rich smelling beer. Bourbon aromas add another layer of sweetness, and there is only a mild roasted bitterness to combat all of this. Oak adds an earthy and dry aroma in the end...
Flavor is less sweet and much more dry than the aroma. Bourbon and semi-sweet, slightly bitter dark chocolate dominate the flavors. A bit of alcohol heat shows up in the middle and lingers into the finish. A dry, earthy and oaky flavor dominates the finish, lingering for, seemingly, eternity...
Full bodied, smooth and creamy with just a little bite of carbonation in the middle, otherwise, pretty still, coating. Just a bit of booze heat and bitterness that lingers for a while... 953 charactershawks10, Jan 05, 2011

Bourbon hits you in the nose and is strong, with alcohol apparent, in the taste. I am Ok with bourbon in moderation, we are not a corn distilled fan nation, but it was too much. Cocoa powder and coconut was also experienced and not integrated. This is above average body, it was finishable, I owed it to the brewers. Not as great as many other RIS I have consumed of late, it is an example of what is turned out as a big beer. 530 charactersSammy, Jan 02, 2011

4.2/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big thanks to Spdkilz and Waltonc for the bottles. Poured into FW mini snifter, again a thanks to Carleton.
Black, opaque body. Slight dark brown sugar head, limited retention. A moderate amount of lacing left clinging to the glass.
Bourbon, oak, and chocolate aromas are strong at cellar temp. With warmth, roasted malt and coffee begin to reveal themselves. Dark caramel aroma becomes more evident as you get deeper into the bottle.
The flavor is very similar to the aroma. Bourbon, chocolate and oak are present through out. Roasted flavors deepen with warmth. Hints of burnt sugars, coffee and dark caramel are intertwined. 
Medium bodied, just a smidge under what I would see as ideal for the style. Carbonation is low but appropriate. Very smooth texture with a rather long finish.
Very good beer. I was not impressed as much as I had hoped, though I do attribute this to my rather high expectations. Very drinkable, the booze is not a factor which is an accomplishment with such a big beer. I am glad I have another bottle. 1,035 characterskzoobrew, Dec 29, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 422 oz. bottle courtesy of Patchmaster - amazing extra, thanks buddy! Poured in to a tulip.
Appearance: Pours a viscous liquid coal, pretty thick and oily looking (note: I know that "liquid coal" would likely normally be referred to as oil, but then I couldn't have used the adjective "oily" without sounding repetitive). The color is nice, deep and vivid, and I'm pleased by the thick look of the body, as so often these higher abv% -bal stouts are thinned out a lot by the spirit addition and time in the barrel. The major flaw here (if you can call it that) is the head retention - it's not terrible, but it's only slightly above average, rendering the finger and a half of deep cocoa head nonexistent inside about sixty seconds, with only a frumpy, uneven, soapy collar and a few thin lines of surface lace. The lack of retention is a little surprising, given how nice the lacing on the sides of the glass is like stalactites dripping down from the initial rim where the head once was. All in all, a great start, with one minor, stylistically forgivable flaw standing between it and perfection.
Aroma: Nice, on the whole, but a little too faint for me to tell whether or not it's as complex as I'd like, though it does come out of its shell a little bit as it nears room temperature. The first thing notable about it is how well balanced the notes are. I'm getting nearly equal parts vanilla/barrel notes and chocolatey, toasty malts, and they're marrying very nicely. Spicy, bourbon macerated dark fruits aren't far behind, but on the whole, I have to say that the aroma is the weakest aspect of this beer, both in terms of score and strength. 
Taste: A thick, chewy, bracingly flavorful brew. The malts are fantastic, sweet on the top end and toasty and astringent on the bottom. Sweet, saccharine fudge and bittersweet cocoa mingle expertly with astringent, burned toast, slight smoke, and earth. Blackstrap sugar notes mingle with toffee and caramel, and the whole malt bill is definitely amplified by a nice amount of toasted wood sugars. Speaking of wood sugars, one of the things I like a lot about the flavor profile of this beer is how the barrel is strong and isn't at all overpowered by the bourbon notes it contributes (and how that whole package is in balance with the aforementioned malt bill). Toasted coconut and woody vanillins and cinnamon notes mingle with dark oak notes, and everything is wrapped up nicely by some thick black cherry, raisin, and plum notes. 
Mouthfeel: One of the best feeling stouts I've ever set my lips to - an easy 5.0, no question. A body of the perfect thickness without a single unnecessary bubble, the amount of lift, the crunch, the chewyness, the slickness ... it's all spot on, perfectly balanced, and amplifies all of the flavor components beautifully.
Drinkability: This isn't a "mature" brew - that is, it's not well-aged, mellowed, subtle, or moderate. Instead, it's young, intense, bold, and extreme ... it's just youthfully, intensely, boldly, and extremely balanced. And if this brew were as bold in the aroma as it is in the mouth, you'd have yourself an easy world class brew here. As it stands, it's excellent, and the 13% doesn't manifest itself anywhere other than the bourbon warmth and spice (where it's desired) and, well, the manner in which I'm beginning to type and collect thoughts. So I'll wrap this up by saying: 1) this beer should be released again; 2) this beer should be a component of everyone FW Anniversary beer unless and until FW puts out a better one (aside: when are we getting Abacus? Bueller? Bueller?); and 3) if you haven't tried this beer and can get ahold of it, do so. You won't be disappointed. 3,692 charactersCrellMoset, Dec 28, 2010

S: Smell was a little bit of a let down. Not as strong as I as hoping. Mostly roasted malts and a bit of vanilla. Was hoping for more.
T: Very very complex beer. Very rich, but so darn smooth. Lots of different flavors hitting the palate all in great balance. Roasted malts, chocolate, bit of coffee and suprisingly nice bitter hops bite. Very nice bourbon flavor without being overpowering or the heat. Rounds out the outstanding flavor profile.
Very well blended together with such great harmony. No one flavor outshining the other.

This one was pulled straight from his own stash. Served at cellar temperature (55F) in a snifter. Enjoyed alongside WitchesBrew and TulipSnifter.
A: For whatever reason, I expected this to look thinner. It's actually pretty thick and ominous looking. A very dark brown, I would not quite call this black. A finger of head quickly receded to a wispy cap and froth ring. 4/5
S: Tons of vanilla popping up on this. The barrel aging did wonders in helping that out no doubt. A lot of spices show up here as well. Cinnamon and a pronounced wood character give this beer warmth on the nose. 4.5/5
T: Peppery alcohol, again with the spices and cocoa powder do their parts to numb the taste buds. Layers upon layers of wood oh glorious wood create great depth. 4.5/5
M: Thick and coating, this is quite luscious.
D: I drank my 5-6 ounce snifter far too fast and my review suffered as a result. This was my first time having this beer even though I have 2 bottles of my own safely stashed away.

From a bomber into a snifter. 
Vintage: 2010
Hops: Simcoe, Bravo, Styrian Golding and East Kent Golding. 
APPEARANCE: A thicker, black pour produces a one finger, medium looking, tan head with good retention. Jet black body with lots of carbonation evident. Surprising amount of bubbles really; quite a bit for the style. Head slowly fades to a wisp and ring. A swirly wisp remains until the end, but only a few dots of lacing slide down the glass. Good pour, but average the rest of the way through. 
SMELL: Wow this is awesome. Huge, bold, aggressive nose with lots of bourbon and vanilla notes. Very present barrel. Some roasted malts and sweet milk chocolate accompany the barrel, but the bourbon and vanilla certainly take the forefront. Some molasses and a bit of port wine in there act to restrain the barrel from completely taking over. Great BA nose. 
TASTE: Lots of bourbon up front with some roasted malts as well. Bold flavors and a very present barrel as well. Vanilla flavors and some sweet, milk chocolate and molasses at the swallow. Bold and lingering aftertaste of bourbon, vanilla and milk chocolate. Lots of barrel here, but it's well measured and the base beer can still throw its weight. Roasted malts, molasses, and the milk chocolate sweetness still play a role behind the barrel flavors. Nice stuff. 
PALATE : Medium-full body and soft, medium carbonation. Very creamy smooth on the palate, velvety, goes down smooth and finishes slightly sticky on the palate. A touch of heat after the swallow. Very solid BA imperial stout palate. 
OVERALL: A top notch BA imperial stout. The barrel was very present, but still didn't dominate and overpower the base beer. It certainly played a leading role, but it played the role very well. Very drinkable and very enjoyable. I constantly had Goose Islands BCBS in my mind while drinking it, and I can safely say I enjoyed this one more. It would be great to line them up head-to-head at some point. Would love to drink this again. Thanks again for the trades gents. 2,136 charactersJeffo, Dec 22, 2010

Bottle is taken from Reserve Series No. 1
Pours a jet black hue with a fizzy bronze head that fades away to a finger's worth of head and lacing. I smell vanilla and dark fruits blended in harmony, some drier, perhaps malt notes of the roasted persuasion. The first sip has a burst of warmth from the alcohol and finished with and oily aftertaste. There's a distinct whiskey flavor, too. The malt is trying to push its way through the bigger flavors and seems to work, just enough to be noticed. There;s some dark fruit flavors that give way to the roasted malt flavors. There's some vanilla sneaking around as well. Very cream mouthfeel with just enough carbonation to keep things moving. I'm trying to decide whether or not this alcohol flavor is something from the barrel or the fact that it's 13%. Knowing the barrel aged beers that I've had from the brewery in the past I'm going to guess it's from the barrel. This is a diverse beer. Definitely a good one to spend time with. I'm not sure if aging this will do any good. It's very smooth for a beer this size. I'd give this beer some time and see how the malt character changes. Perhaps without the barrel aging this might taste a little better. 1,214 characters100floods, Dec 15, 2010
3.78/5  rDev -16.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours dark. Who would have thunk it. 
Smells are pretty typical bourbon stout smells. Baby brother GI BCS is what comes to mind. 
It tastes like a slightly watered down GI BCS. no unique flavors here. Chcolate, vanilla, tobacco, etc. With bourbon notes throughout. Flavors mush together, nothing really pops on the tongue. 
If I want a thick, high ABV bourbon barrel stout, there are other (better) options closer to home. A good beer, but I wanted (expected) something really good. 
I think this beer is likely better fresh. This one was about 10 months old. 562 characterscaskstrength, Dec 14, 2010

a - Pours a jet black color with one to two fingers of tan head and moderate carbonation evident. Head lasts for a few minutes and leaves a little bit of lacing on the glass. Looks great.
s - Smells of bourbon, oak, chocolate, dark fruits, roasted malts, and coffee. Very complex and great. I had Old Rasputin XII the night before drinking this one and I think the two of them might be the best barrel aged RIS's I've ever had.
t - Tastes of bourbon, chocolate, roasted malts, oak, dark fruits, and vanilla. Again, very complex; I loved it.
m - Wow, the mouthfeel is truly amazing. Light to medium body and low carbonation, this might be the smoothest RIS I've ever had. A perfect mouthfeel.
d - Truly an amazing barrel aged beer; this is one of my favorite RIS's. The smell and taste are both very balanced and complex, and the mouthfeel is perfect. I felt like I could drink a lot of this, even with the 13% ABV. Can't wait to have this one again. 1,060 charactersmdfb79, Dec 01, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5poured a very dark brown with maroonish brown highlights that had a very thin head and left very little lacing sticking to the glass. Upfront I detected cocoa, vanilla, chocolate, slight roastiness and bourbon for sure is coming through. it definitely has booze but faint dark fruit notes. The bourbon and the chocolate flavors mesh beautiful alongside oat grains, a little coffee roasty character, vanilla from the barrel and seems to have cocoa nib accents. I gotta say its pretty hot and probably could do well with time. The brew was full in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a sweet, boozy, silky, and chewy finish; pretty damn thick. It drank pretty good considering the ABV and was very delicious. I'm glad I have one for the cellar to compare. 765 charactersGobzilla, Nov 30, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5I've had this beer both on Tap and in the bottle and quite honestly there's not much difference IMO.
Appearance - Black as midnight, looks thick as motor oil. Looks right on point for the style and for the 13% ABV
Smell - Beautiful dark fruits, molasses, milky dark chocolate, liquorice, and the Bourbon is there but does not overpower. So much going on here. You have to enhale a few times just to make sure you pick up or pick out each different aspect of this beer. Vanilla and hints of tobacco come out as well.
Taste - Good God. For the style I can't think of a better beer. The 08 Abyss isn't entirely barrel aged so I can't compare the two. Taste follows nose 100%. I keep sipping to pick out each characteristic as each sip brings out something new. SO MUCH going on here. Creamy dark chocolate, bourbon, molasses, dark fuits, vanilla, oak and a small hint of earthiness. It takes a few sips to pick up on everything but what makes this beer so unbelieveable is how well all these flavors blend together. Bourbon does not overpower the blend at all. It's def there but mellow. Very, very smooth for 13% ABV but more shockingly so for how young this beer still is. Goes down almpost creamy with minimal alcohol burn.
Mouthfeel - What 13% ABV?? It's not hot. the beer is thick but the best way to describe that thickness is extremely silky. For the viscosity, it's as smooth as it gets. Carbonation is there but no overly so at all. Almost Perfect for the style and for a Stout this big. 
Drinkability - I'd give it a 5 but at 13% I just can't. 
Final Thoughts - I can't wait to try this beer again with more age on it. I'm having a hard time thinking it could still get better. I liked this better than the 2009 BCS, KBS, Older Viscosity, Chocolate Oak Aged Yeti, and Old Rasputin XII I've had thus far this year. Good thing I have 3 more in the cellar (Closet) 1,874 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Nov 25, 2010
3.7/5  rDev -18.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Last evening I opened a bottle of Firestone Walker's Parabola, a barrel aged imperial stout. This is a stout near and dear to my heart, as father would often sit me on his knee and tell bedtime stories while sipping it during those cold winter nights of my childhood. Last eve, at twilight, I sipped it on the veranda while watching my grandchildren play on the south lawn; and Henrietta trussed the pheasant for our Thanksgiving meal. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy it as much as I have in years past. A strong bitter (dare I say acrid!?) coffee note crowded out many of the fine qualities I recall in Parabolas of yore - a genteel balance of English toffee, Tahitian vanilla, old money bourbon, and mother's chocolate. To be sure, Firestone Walker occasionally produces tip top Parabola of the sort that can be said to resemble premium Indonesian chronic. However, this 2010 bottle reminds me instead of Black Xantus, an innoble attempt at producing a good barrel aged stout.
With my disappointment in FW13, Black Xantus, and now Parabola, I am rethinking the high pedestal upon which I place the Firestone Walker brewery and its pedigree. I may reallocate my portfolio to reduce my dependence on Firestone Walker, but will consult with Warren first for his wise counsel.
Perhaps a return to high class basics - with a strict Van Winkle aging program - would resurrect the great FW barrel aged brews I know and love? Should Mr. Brynildson wish to put this query to the test, I would be honored to place my distillery's resources at his disposal. Would that Parabola return to her glory. 1,590 characterswaltonc, Nov 25, 2010

a: Black with nice dark tan head. great lacing too.
s: slight bourbon, roasted malts, nice cocoa smell and bitter hops
t: the bourbon gives a slight flavor of vanilla and oak but well integrated. it's much more subtle than a lot of the other bourbon barrel aged beers, which is nice as it doesn't over power the base beer. great flavor in the dark chocolate + roast component. a bit of alcohol on the back end but it works.
m: decent mouthfeel although I think i'd like it a bit thicker. goes down pretty smooth with just the right amount of carbonation.
d: drinks very well but sip and savor
one of the best beers i've had as of late. lives up to hype. 698 charactersbillyshears, Nov 24, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -3.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer poured pitch black with a tan head that diminished quickly.
Smelled of dark fruits, coffee, chocolate and some alcohol.
The taste was of dark berries, chocolate, roasted malt and caramel. The chocolate flavors came out a bit more as the beer warmed up and aired out. I was expecting hints of raisin but there wasn't any. The taste was exceptionally smooth and so was the sip. The carbonation was well in effect but it didn't effect the mouthfeel.
This was a big surprise. I heard that it was very good but I thought it would be heavy and bitter like a lot of stouts but was pleasantly surprised. One of the top, best tasting imperial stouts I have ever had, and probably ever will have. 699 characterscjacobsen, Nov 23, 2010

Smell: Heavy on the roasted malts, especially chocolate but with hints of sweetness.
Mouthfeel: Was appropriate for the type of beer, a little on the heavier side for having a higher ABV, which is very nice.
Taste: Very complex. Starts with coffee/chocolate type roasted flavors, followed by hints of sweetness that compliment the initial flavors very well.
I had this beer on numerous occasions, both from bottle and draught, there were no major differences. 500 charactersHoptoss, Nov 15, 2010

A: Pours a deep black with a nice dark brown head that fades to a ring and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass.
S: The nose is full of molasses, dark fruits, dark chocolate, and vanilla. Really nice aromas that I could smell as soon as I started pouring it into my glass.
T: The taste starts with a burst of vanilla and then black strap molasses which fades to a bitter dark chocolate finish. There are dark fruits in there as well with a bit of a boozy element but what do you expect from a 13% beer.
M: The feel is very thick and coats the mouth making the finish last a lot longer than I've ever experienced. 
D: Probably one of the better barrel aged stouts I've had in a while. 13% would definitely make this hard to drink the entire bomber...good thing I split it with my fiancee.
Having had FW13 a few months prior to this I can definitely tell this was a main component of that blend and after looking it up I confirmed that it was the highest percentage beer in that blend. Great stuff and I have another to age a few years. This seems to have great aging potential like GIBCS. 1,119 charactersGregSVT, Nov 14, 2010

It pours a dark brown-black color with a thin tan head, about 1cm or less. The aroma is just about perfect, rich and complex, with all sorts of delicious bourbon throughout. Vanilla, toffee, roasted malts, bourbon and alcohol, everything is there in an inviting package.
It tastes just as I'd hoped strong and worth of attention. There's so much going on that it's best to sip this beer, plus it gives the feeling of high ABV with each sip. Brown sugar or molasses, robust roast, licorice, everything's in there. Thick and a little burning, you taste each sip for a long time. Excellent, maybe even a little overpowering.
This is absolutely worth its hype, a very good bourbon stout, I would be very happy to have it again. 895 charactersTurdFurgison, Nov 10, 2010

Thanks to the ever-generous Beerwolf77 who gets his jollies off reading these little quips I write about him when he shares his epic stash. There's a reason you're my #1 ninja Todd!
A - Did it actually get darker in the room when we poured this? It's totally black. No light comes through at all. Inky oil with a dark tan head. Lower retention isn't surprising from the alcohol. Not a whole lot of lace. Still epic looking.
S - Smooth, supple bourbon and notes of oak with a drop of vanilla kick the nose off right. A little molasses and roasted malts follow up. The alcohol is penetrating my nostrils the more I smell it though. So awesome.
T - Smooth, rich, and very coffee forward with fantastic notes of vanilla and oak. Bourbon is there but not overly powerful. Not a whole lot of raging alcohol either. Chocolate and cocoa come through in the back end. Perfection in flavor.
M - Strong, full-bodied, and rich, it's smooth and slightly boozy. Very warm on the finish and a little bit dry. Mouthfeel is near perfection.
D - So good, this is one of the best beers out there for the style I'd wager. Fantastic flavor and mouthfeel. Still highly drinkable despite the slightly noticeable, but well-balanced alcohol. Delish! Thanks Todd! 1,393 charactersBeerFMAndy, Nov 08, 2010

(A)- Pours thick and pitch black in color. Produced a good frothy brown colored head with decent retention. Some lacing present. 
(S)- A nice rich profile. Chocolate, coffee, and molasses. A nice mellow caramel sweetness at the end. This will be strong, but it sure does smell wonderful. 
(T)- Very similar to the smell. A really nice rich profile of coffee, chocolate, molasses with a nice mellowed caramel sweetness. A tiny hint of a dry vanilla-like oak. All in all, an excellent flavor profile that meshes well despite its strength/ABV. 
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. It is rich, but has a superb balance and smoothness despite the 13%. It is almost restrained and mellow due to how well balanced this is as a whole. 
(D)- Simply a fantastic Imperial Stout. A superb balance that makes this really shine for the style. Still not for the faint of heart since it is rather strong in all senses, but it just fits. Just an excellent beer. 1,115 characterssweemzander, Nov 08, 2010

4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sent by msubulldog25, to whom I give eternal gratitude, for this beer and the many others he's sent me over the years. This, my 1300th review, is for you buddy!
A marvelous coal-black liquid pours into the snifter. As it was pouring, the light revealed some deep ruby/burgundy-like highlights, but now that it's in the glass it's total black hole time. The head is a toasted brown beauty, but it gets scared away quickly by that 13% alcohol thing.
The label doesn't make clear what kind of barrels this was aged in, and from the aroma, it's hard to discern if the barrels held whiskey in their former lives or not. Such a thing is usually pretty clear, but here I get some charred wood aroma, and a peculiar boozy-plus-vanilla-plus-soggy dark fruit flare that could be showing the ghost of whiskeys past, or just be that big ABV talking. Either way, it's subtle, especially for the strength, with tiny nuances deep beneath the surface.
Mmm...mellow, mellow, mellow, with dark bittersweet chocolate, serious dark roast coffee, and alcohol-soaked wood all woven together. Plum, fig and raisin are threaded into all of this, and they become more prominent with warming. Of course this can't escape without some heat, but for the strength, the alcohol level is just right. The heat is a warming, soothing one, far from some kind of aftershave disaster. As with all other elements of Parabola, the keyword here is "balance."
As the taste is triple-mellow, so the mouthfeel is smooth, smooth, smooth. Silky, slick, and carbonated just enough to add textural brightness, this wins because it's so approachable. With the mellow, nuanced taste, and the high alcohol, something thicker would have been overkill and/or out of place.
For a barrel-aged 13% imperial stout, it really doesn't get much more drinkable, or accessible, than this. Obviously one to take slow and savor, for a variety of reasons, but mostly because it's just too good to drive down quickly. What a start to the weekend... 1,989 charactersMetalmonk, Nov 05, 2010

Pours black with a tiny tan head that fades leaving little trace. Smell is mostly oak and light hops, sweet dark malts and vanilla. A slight metallic smell as well. Taste is bourbon and carmel up front, heavily roasted malts and a bit of alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is lighter then i would have expected, medium to heavy with a light carbonation. Overall drinkability for the style is pretty good, but this one could use a little time. 501 charactersnkersten, Nov 04, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Insane intensity and full of character, this Imperial Russian Stout is one for the ages.
Dark, dark brown (nearly black) with almost complete opaqueness, only admitting light around the estreme edges. Froathy tan head formation leads to average retainage (falters underneath the thinning of 13% abv.). Light on lacing but moderate on classic brandy legging.
Deep and complex aromas start and finish with brownie-like chocolaty notes that are decorated with cherry, sherry, soy, grape, dates, figs, caramel, vanilla, and aged woods. With all that going on, the beer's aroma is all about the bittersweet chocolate and French roast coffee.
Chocolatey early, the beer morphs into Irish Coffee flavors (think whisky and cream), and fruitness that comes equally from fruity esters and alcohols. Again, aged and dehydrated fruits of cherries, apples, figs, dates, raisons all give a rum-soaked fruitcake flavor that carries through to the finish and aftertaste.
Full and rich early, the beer breaks early to finish with an alcohol thinning texture and ultimately warm, maybe hot finish. Very drinkable because it doesn't start too thick but doesn't finish thin, fusal, or abrasive.
Very well balanced throughout, Parabola demonstrates all of what is prominant about the spread of flavors that make up the Russian Imperial Stout profile. All of this manifests in a beer that reviels new flavors with each warming sip. Delicious and succulent from sip to finish, this beer drinks much more easily than it should.

The beer pours a dark brown to black color with a tan head. 
The aroma is a mix of licorice and roasted malt. The beer's aroma reminds me of Ten Fidy and is a little disappointing. 
The flavor more than makes up for the slight disappointment in the aroma. I get a ton of roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and maple. The flavor is very complex and all of the flavors meld together very well, with none of the individual flavors stomping on the others. 
Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. 
This is how you do a bourbon barrel aged beer. Excellent. 657 charactersMora2000, Nov 03, 2010
4/5  rDev -11.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A bottle shared at Al's blow-out.
A: The imperial stout sure is imperial looking, dark and black. A moderate-sized head, a tan color, stands out against the darkness.
S: The nose is nutty and roasted, plenty of malts to go around. Call me an outlier, but I wasn't impressed with the bourbon presence.
T: The roasted flavors consume the stout, burnt and bready, well toasted. Nuttiness matches the dark stouts, a sweeter flavor that puts a few dents into the roasted depth. Again, the barrel aging isn't very dominant. Instead the malt profile is left to fend for its own. Some oak comes through late, but the oomph of bourbon seems to be lost on me. Anyone wanna send me another to try?
M: The mouthfeel is that of an imperial stout, sweet and deep, burnt and full. Much more stout than bourbon, at least what was in my glass.
D: Big and bold, a mouthful of a stout. Only problem is that is like every other imperial stout, dark and warming with plenty of roasted flavors. 977 charactersakorsak, Nov 03, 2010

4.62/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Stone RIS glass. It poured pitch black with a thin tan head to it. After a few minutes the head had all but retreated to the edges of the glass, where it left just a bit of lacing. 
The aroma shows a lot of dark chocolate coming through. Oak wood with a bit of a bourbon alcohol and vanilla flavor come through as well. Very flavorful and complex aroma to it overall. 
The taste has a lot of really great flavors to it. Dark chocolate mixes with a pretty big barrel aged, vanilla and oak wood flavor. Towards the finish more of the bourbon notes come out along with some coffee and bitter chocolate. Just a bit of some cherry flavors pop up and add a nice chocolaty cherry aspect to it. Fantastic flavor overall and perfect barrel aging for my taste. It doesn't get better than this.
The mouthfeel is on the thicker side with carbonation being low. Drinkability is great for such a high alcohol beer. The flavors all came together excellently. The barrel aging really enhanced it and gave it some fantastic depth instead of overpowering it. World class beer overall and one of the top of the style for sure. 1,144 charactersbillab914, Oct 30, 2010
4.08/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottled opened and poured into a large snifter. A black hole of a beer. The pour is dark, thick; a vicious appearing beer unrelenting and uncompromising in its attempt to keep out the light. A small, one inch head arises, initially light in color but darkens into a nice mocha/caramel color as is subsides into a thin ring clinging desperately to the side of the glass. On the nose I am picking up on strong fig, lots of bourbon, vanilla and a nice oakiness that gives way to booze and more booze. Taste is right along the lines of the nose, in addition to a really pleasant presence of thick caramel; chocolate covered toffee, cane sugar and toasted grains. The mouth feel is medium to heavy, at times almost seeming to be too much at once. The moderate amount of carbonation helps the drinkability. A good beer overall. This is a beer that demands your time and attention; sip it slowly and reap the benefits. 911 charactersmjn5036, Oct 29, 2010

Typical FW anise, almost mint-like barrel notes shine in. That was part of what I loved so much about the FW13. Bitter baker's chocolate. Mouth is almost numbing, very heavy, that burned malt playing with dark fruits like dates, raisins, still that nice herbal quality. Boozy and fairly hot. Heavy and unfocused to my taste. Has good qualities but this is a bit much on its own. I much prefer it in the anniversary blends. 519 charactersJAXSON, Oct 26, 2010

Pours a dark brown/black color with a nice viscosity to it, the size of the glass makes it difficult to produce any sizable head but there is some small bubbeage to it.
Smell is a beautiful mix of dark roasted malt, chocolate and just the right amount bourbon, some dark fruit notes linger about as well, from the bourbon you can pick up that it could be a little hot.
Taste isn't as overwhelming with the bourbon that I thought it was going to be which also means that it isn't overly hot like some similar beers, in fact all the flavors meld quite well together, the dark bitter chocolate is probably my favorite part about this beer, good stickiness in the mouth as well, not overly syrupy and not cloyingly sweet which makes this beer all the more respectable.
Didn't think I would enjoy this one as much as I did, a top notch example of the style. Something I'd like to try again, hopefully from a larger sample. 1,001 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Oct 22, 2010

A: A beautiful thick deep dark pour with a 1 inch deep mocha colored head that fades quickly to a nice mocha foam atop the brew. Very good.
S: I get some nice sweet bourbon chocolate upfront quickly blended a nice dark fruit raisin scent. I get some nice coffee roast notes in the middle with some creamy dairy on the backend. Almost like a fig and molasses scent blended in there. There are a lot of different scents bouncing around. Very good.
T: It's a brew where I get some many flavors in the first sip all at once. There is not one specific pronounced flavor. I get a blend of cocao, vanilla, bitter chocolate, a perfect spot for the warm bourbon, followed by some awesome creamy milk chocolate. As I drink more, the more it tastes like a perfectly balanced milk stout. I start to get some port notes blended with some booziness and dark fruit. This is my idea of a stout. Perfect!
M: Full bodied with a very nice carbonation balance. Very good.
D: The drinkability on this one is quite good. Goes down good once you get a handle on all of the flavors bouncing around. Good.
All in all, bravo Firestone Walker! This is my idea of a fantastic stout. Definitely worth hunting if you like deep, thick, creamy, dark stouts to try and grab some to age. One of my new faves for sure!! 1,406 characterssteve8robin, Oct 16, 2010

Pours with a thick brown head... great retention and lacing... 
Nose shows more wood than bourbon but with a good roasty background that carries a subtle sweetness reminiscent of dark dark chocolate.
Flavor is immediately drier than the nose made me believe.. bits of vanilla and sweet cigar wrapper envelope waves of great complexities.. a bit boozy with warmth.. and the malts open up to be a bit sweeter as the temperature rises.
Smooth but present carbonation with a pretty full decadent mouth coating body.
Thanks Sammy.... I really need to try and score some of these before the wells run dry.

This is a very complex beer with lots of aromas and tastes. I taste dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and some hop bitterness.

A: Poured into my Firestone Walker Pint Glass (purchased for me by my beautiful girl friend) this brew pour an extremely dark black with an extremely impressive, almost 2in, chocolate milk bubble colored head that refuses to bow down and leaves some of the best lacing I've seen on a beer glass (let alone @ 13%) ever.
S: The aroma is almost perfect. Were those barrels made of chocolate? Seriously there is a heavy amount of biter sweet chocolate in this brew. Molasses and slight espresso with whims of whiskey make up the nose.
T: Upfront chocolate dominates the flavor. Vanilla is present and really does an excellent job smoothing out and combining everything present in the brew. As far as Bourbon barrel aged stouts go, this brew has note more along the lines of Whiskey, and it is a slight accent that just gives this beer more depth. Molasses and a little hop bitterness wrap up the profile of this stout. As the brew warms, whiskey becomes a more dominate flavor note and chocolate starts to take a back seat.
MF: The mouthfeel is good without being spectacular. Like many barrel aged beers (especially Bourbon) I've had, I've begun to notice the barrel aging really does a job of thinning the mouthfeel just a tad to much. Still this brew is silky smooth and excellent.
D: Drinkability at 13% is superb. This stout is a little more filling then most.
Overall, I am very grateful to coryking for a trade I thought I could not have completed with the beers available in my area. Parabola is a stout worthy of its place amongst the best. 1,599 charactersTKEbeerman, Oct 10, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5I finally broke open the case of Parabola I have sitting in my cellar. I've had this a few times before, but never reviewed. It was, at one point, my favorite beer... I'm looking forward to this.
Pitch black, viscous, but not chunky pour. Dark tan head billows up, but fairly quickly dissipates completely. A swirl coats the interior of my Bruery tulip in brown. This is a really nice-looking stout - I wish the head stuck around a bit longer, but hell, this is a 13% barrel-aged stout, I can't expect miracles.
Smell is delicious. Great balance. Huge chocolate, coffee, and roast. Touch of smoke, vanilla, brown sugar, and anise. All of this backed up by the bourbon barrel, which thankfully does not overpower the brew.
Taste follows the nose for the most part. Bourbon plays a bit bigger role here. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla. Oak. Molasses. A sweet beer, but not overly so. Alcohol is present, but very, very well hidden considering the ABV on this brew. Bittering hops in the finish balance this out nicely - I recall this on tap at the release being a bit astringent in the finish, but that's either not present in the bottled version or it's mellowed out in the time since the release. Either way, I'm happy. This beer is a flavor monster.
Mouthfeel is awesome. Thick, syrupy, but with a surprisingly dry finish. The end is as clean as you can possibly get with a stout of this magnitude.
Drinkability is tough. It's not easy to drink a ton of this stuff - I had about 3/4 of the bomber, and that was enough for me. I kinda wish this was in smaller bottles, like 2008 Bourbon County. 
Nevertheless, this beer is awesome. Highly recommended, if you can find it. 1,673 charactersdavod23, Oct 02, 2010

4.12/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed from my tasting notes of a decent sized sample I consumed at an epic tasting event held with the members of the SMBDC.
Dark brown liquid is capped with a slight skim of tiny brown bubbles. Cocoa and bourbon make up the very appealing aroma. The beer tastes chocolately, with a strong bourbon finish. Although the flavors are there, the alcohol is well-hidden. There isn't burning or a warmth to the swallow. Medium body and low carbonation. Lots of coating. The flavors stay with you a while, so you don't feel the need to grab another sip as soon as you put the glass down. A note on the bottle recommends you share, and I agree, but I would want a large pour. This is a good beer! 692 charactersToasterChef, Sep 24, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Another blind beer sent to me by AleWatcher. It calls for a snifter and it says be careful not to look at the cap when opening. Its got a very unique foil on the top, much like bottle of wine. This is making me think Firestone Walker...
A- Super black and thick looking. Not much of a head, it really takes a heavy pour. The head is wet sand colored and short lived. This is about as thick and black looking as any beer can get.
S- Imperial stout for sure, and a BIG one at that. Lots of alcohol, licorice, dark berries like currants, super rich and bitter black chocolate, port wine and some oak. Its hot 'n heavy.
T- Oh man, oh man, oh man. This is getting a 5 for taste. So complex but its not all over the place at all. It has an agenda. Loads of dark chocolate right off the rip. It then moves into a rich black currant and vinous place. Then there is molasses, brown sugar and more cocoa. A little bit of licorice and a lot of alcohol bring things to a close.
M- I would say this beer is right around the 12-13% range. Its warm, sometimes hot, but never offensive. The body is so thick and full, carbonation is low. This makes for an unstoppable creaminess. With a body like this the ABV could be 25% and it would still drink smoothly.
D- Drinkable? Uh yeah, Ive savored this for the past hour and I want more.

The appearance is, 'dark as night'. It pours with a fluffy brown head that is small and leaves fast. What a dark menacing beer I had in my glass. 
The smell is of roasted grain, lots of chocolate and Tootsie Rolls, some caramel and toffee. Awesome. 
The taste is awesome, and I picked up something that I didn't find in other reviews. I picked up loads of chocolate and espresso, toffee and caramel and some. . . spruce? I picked up a somewhat earthy spruce or light mint flavor that was awesome. It reminded me of a chocolate covered peppermint candy, a great treat. 
The mouthfeel was silky smooth and lightly carbonated. It was such a deep, dark, thick, and drinkable brew that I wish it was more available. Delicious beer.

Poured into ccb snifter
Pours a light layer of brown head. Color is an oil black.
Aroma: Oak, vanilla, whiskey, coffee, chocolate, and light cherry flavors.
Taste: I get more of a bourbon flavor here instead of the whiskey I picked up in the nose. Dark chocolate, very sweet. Roasted malts, oak, vanilla, cherries, raisins, and coffee. Just a tad boozy.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and creamy. Full bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends warm and a bit dry, but clean.
Overall, a very nice imp stout. Good -bal aging notes. Good flavors and the drinkability is nice on this one. Solid stuff. 634 charactersmothman, Aug 29, 2010

Would pair great with a cigar. 725 charactersadkirkish, Aug 29, 2010

A- Very dark with a frothy coffee colored head. Good head retention, no lacing. The beer is pretty much solid black, with some hints of red at the edges.
S- Smells of creamy bourbon, with oak notes. Definetely not as strong as most bourbon aged beers, but noticeble. I notice a good hop smell as well, but nothing crazy
T- Starts very creamy, then opens up to flavors of chocolate/coffee/caramel/bourbon and oak. I like big bourbon beers, and thats where this one fell a little short. It just didn't stack up to some others.
M- Nice, and a very good blending of flavors. I wish it was a little thicker, as it is 13%. Good, but no BCS
D- All around pretty darn good. A little tangy, and some overly lingering hop aftertaste at times. Quite light for a bourbon barrel beer at 13%
I might have hyped this one up a bit in my head, thinking it could best KBS/BCS and some of my other favorites. I'll age a couple bottles, and see what I think down the road. 1,056 charactersGfunk720, Aug 26, 2010

Have heard how good this beer is and really am trying to not be dissappointed if it doesn't reach the level of goodness I have heard so much about. Coffee, bourbon, and cream type notes in the aroma. This is a very complex beer with lots of aromas and tastes. I taste dark chocolate, coffee, bourbon, and some hop bitterness. I would say this is a very balanced and complete Imperial Stout well worth the praises I have heard. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Very rich and good.

The taste is fantastic with the booziness providing a sightly harsh overtone to the coffee and sweet malty taste.

All in all its a fantastic beer in the vein of dark lord or the other tremendous big body american stouts. 426 charactersdegerbah, Aug 23, 2010

S - Dried fruit, some malty sweetness, chocolate and a good amount of alcohol.
T - Boozy, harsh and really could use a couple years age. The malt is quite forward and slight chocolate notes, but this beer actually has an alcoholic burn to it.
M/D - Mouthfeel is very thick and harsh, it coats the tongue and cheeks and leaves a bit of burn. This is as drinkable as most extreme imperial stouts (Dark Lord, DORIS the Destroyer, etc) but could be an amazing beer with some time. 605 charactersmwa423, Aug 23, 2010

Smell is chocolate and coffee, and a few other lovely flavors I can't quite place.
Yummy! The chocolate tastes very high quality; rich and full. The coffee flavors aren't as pronounced as in the smell, which I like. The flavors resulting from the barrel conditioning are very subtle to me, but work very well to offset the sumptuous chocolate. Tastes slightly complex as I try to pick out the flavors. Well balanced and refined.
Mouthfeel is incredible, one of the smoothest beers I've had. A strong and dense texture which works exceptionally for this beer.
This is a good sipping beer. The 13% surprised me. 706 charactersptykozoon, Aug 22, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a snifter. Big thanks to piclee for this. 
4.0 A: I had to make an aggressive pour to coax one finger of creamy light brown head. Average retention and not really any lacing.
4.5 S: Aroma is just what I like from a -bal brew. The stout shines while the bourbon takes a complementary role. A decent amount of semisweet chocolate in this one. Indeed, the sweet character outweighs the roasty but not by a whole lot. Roasted barley makes an appearance next with a touch, and only a touch, of coffee. Finally, the bourbon comes in completing the very nice nose. As it warms, the bourbon comes through stronger.
4.5 T: Taste is just as good as the nose. Sweet chocolate stands out first, with roastiness next, and bourbon on the finish. There a bit of fruitiness in the taste that wasn't in the nose: plum and raisin. Alcohol is apparent, but at an acceptable rate given 13%. It's really hard to figure out how complex this is. The chocolate, roasted barley, and bourbon dominate, but it seems like there is more beneath. Bourbon, booziness, and a roasty bitterness lingers on aftertaste.
5.0 M: Thick, syruppy body. Good moderate carbonation. This is how I like my imperial stouts. Rich and creamy or bust. Relatively smooth with a warming finish.
5.0 D: Excellent brew. Great aroma, great taste, awesome mouthfeel, but the alcohol is a bit of an ass kicker and moreso than comparable brews (BCBCS, for example). Still, solid brew overall. I'm glad I have another one. I think some age will do wonders with this one.
Edit: This gets much better as it warms up. Drinkability score adjusted. 1,603 charactersDavoleBomb, Aug 21, 2010

Thanks to a generous trader for this sweet hook-up!
This one pours up black, which is more than I'd hoped for, actually. Starting out well. An easy pour produces a head of two-fingers worth of almost dark-brown colored foam. The retention is very good and the lacing is in large spots, which are fairly sticky.
There is alot going on in this nose. Big presence of dark malts, along with a good amount of roastiness. Hints of leather and tobacco, along with some mild notes of dark fruits. A nice hint of dark roasted coffee. Light traces of oak and vanilla.
Complex and completely enticing.
Very roasted malts forward. The barrel presence is more of an afterthought, actually. This one follows the nose, for the most part. Just a whole lot more focus on the malts here. A light hint of dark chocolates works its way in. More than just a hint of smoke.
Here's the strongest part of this beer. It is full-bodied and has a light-to-medium level of carbonation. It is very smooth and has a nice amount of creaminess, which is wonderful to have. Especially for this style. It helps it come off as damn-near thick.
Flavor-wise, this one is very tasty and nicely drinkable. That 13.00%abv though, does manage to make itself known, mostly in a touch of warmth, on the back-end. Overall, it is nicely drinkable, though. 1,365 characterscoldmeat23, Aug 09, 2010

A: Pours opaque black. No light gets through at all. A small tan head forms, but recedes in a minute. Light lace. Head and lacing are to be expected for the ABV, but this looks menacing.
S: An excellent aroma of toasted malt, sweet toffee, dark chocolate. Light vanilla and oak. Light dark fruits of figs, plums, and raisins. Very soft, but nuanced.
T: A great toasted malt flavor. Big dark chocolate, vanilla, and slightly woody flavors. Soft doughy and brownie like. Light dark fruits that follow the nose. Just excellent.
M/D: A full body that is low on the carbonation. Though not under carbonated at all. Soft, creamy, smooth, and velvety. So easy and smooth to drink. The alcohol is almost non existent. 
For such a huge beer, this is incredibly nuanced and subtle. I can't get enough of this. All around excellent, and highly recommend. 921 characterschamp103, Aug 09, 2010

4.23/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Just purchased a bottle of Firestone's Parabola. Never was excited about the beer until my friend recommended it to me telling me it challenged the Abyss. What a claim, we'll see how well it does...
Appearance - Pours a deep endless black with a beautiful reddish brown, caramel colored head with not the best retention and light lacing. 
Smell - Immediately I can tell this beer is going to be complex. I don't know where to begin. Levels, of tartiness, Manhattan?! I smell one of my favorite cocktails - bourbon, cherry, bitters? Interesting... coffee, deep roasty maltiness, floral?!, light hop presence? 
Taste - Holy Shit! There's an amazing whitewash of tastes in the beginning - alcohol, tart, cherry, that slowly fades into the malt - deep roasty coffee, toffee, caramel, vanilla, oak...
The beer is extremely alcoholic but for the 13 percent it is relatively smooth. Pretty sweet from what I expected as well. 
Overall - This beer far surpassed my expectations. Amazingly well done with perhaps just a little too much of a bite (so age it to perfection!). Delicious but from memory I must say I don't think it tops the Abyss. But hey you two, that I know will eventually read this - lets try it out.

Pours black with a one-finger brown head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving solid lacing.
Smells of robust roasted malt with good amounts of dark chocolate and tobacco aromas. Also present are light amounts of vanilla.
Tastes similar to how it smells. Smooth roasted malt flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by well-integrated dark chocolate and vanilla flavors. Hints of bourbon hit midway through the sip along with mild amounts of tobacco. Near the end of the sip slight amounts of coffee flavors make a brief appearance before fading into a moderately bitter ending.
Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a nice thickness with soft carbonation.
Drinkability is also very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have another.
Overall this was simply a phenomenal beer. Nothing was out of place and everything worked exceptionally well together. Well worth a shot. 936 charactersglid02, Jul 30, 2010

...REVIEW 1000!
Thanks to weibull for the trade. 22oz black-foil bomber into an unmarked snifter.
Bubbly, inky-black body with a thin rim of mahogany at the edges. The mocha head fizzles quickly, as expected for the 13% ABV, but surprisingly maintains a ring of bubbles at the edges of the glass. Heavenly aroma, rife with dark fruits such as plum, black cherry, and currant. Roasted chocolate malts, vanilla bean from the bourbon, and cookie dough add a superb malt profile that mingles with a fruity, boozy tinge of chocolate liqueur.
Oh wow, this stuff is good.
Palate is hit instantly with a sharp, carbonated, and semi-boozy bourbon note that suggests dark bread, vanilla, and cocoa. Mid-sip is when the magic of Parabola takes effect, laying down layer upon layer of decadent Baker's chocolate, oak tannins, fig & plum fruitiness, and earthen hops. The alcohol provides warmth to the palate, but never becomes too hot or solvent-like. Mouthfeel is a velvety, viscous treat. Perfect carbonation and consistency that never gets heavy or taxing to the tongue. All in all, a flat-out fantastic brew. Glad I chose this one as review Numero 1K, it was well worth it. For me, Parabola is easily in the top tier of Imperial Stouts, and, for that matter, any beer in general. 1,298 characterswagenvolks, Jul 29, 2010
4.49/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to ridglens for sharing this one a few days ago. I've been excited to give this one a shot for a while now!
A strong pour into my Dogfish Head snifter produces a mocha head that reduces quickly to a thin cap. The beer itself is damn near black. Ruby highlights around the edges, but you definitely have to put some work to notice that this thing isn't 100% opaque. Spotty lace is left inside my glass.
The smell of Parabola is all over the place. Whiskey and vanilla are the first two that jump out at me...and they are obvious! However, there is a ton of other stuff going on in there as well. Roasty malts, chocolate, caramel. Lots of sweet to balance out the bourbon kick. Very roasty with a tiny bit of coffee to round things off. Although the bourbon is obvious, the alcohol from the beer itself is not noticeable.
Very sweet beginning. With a smooth transition into the chocolate roasty whiskey. Not nearly as roasty as the nose, but still an outstanding combination of malts and chocolate goodness (which is a nice combination of both dark chocolate and sweet chocolate). A nice dark cherry taste, that I haven't picked up on the nose, is obviously present as well. The coffee that finishes the smell also runs caboose on the taste. I'm quite impressed. Parabola is creamy and silky - and thick. There is a bit of alcohol burn at the end that is a bit detracting, but come on, this beer is 13%...
This is a fantastic stout. It's a damn shame it is a bit difficult to procure, but I'll see if I can snag a couple more before they become impossible. I'm a huge fan of the big stouts and this one ranks right up there with some of the finest. Glad to see they are finally bottling it!

4.19/5  rDev -7.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I think my expectation of this beer was too high. I expected an Abyss or Hunahpu caliber stout. Parabola is excellent, but lacks in some categories.
The appearance had a good, deep color. But the was not much of a crown of glory and left little lacing. The smell and taste paralleled near perfection with bold aromas/flavors of cocoa nibbs, oak, bourbon, coffee or espresso, and some alcohol. Really, this is a great stout by what matters to me the most: taste and smell. The feel was good. It wasn't frothy, but oily. Some may prefer the oily feel in a stout. An oily feel is just not my preference, but it was still good. I opened this one for mine and my girlfriends anniversary and I could not finish it. I was too full. It is a heavy beer and would be best split over a meal or partially consumed before the meal.

Smell is mostly chocolate and a hint of sweetness; enjoyable but not the most complex. The taste is slightly sweet, but nowhere near cloying. Vanilla and maple flavors dominate. This goes down smooth; the alcohol is very hidden. Mouthfeel is decent and this is relatively drinkable for the style. It's not too thick but still has the viscosity RIS should have. Love it. 463 charactersandrewinski1, Jul 26, 2010
4.2/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5Time for another barrel aged beer. Thanks Andy for letting me drink all your beers lately. Poured this into a White Birch goblet. Big black body on this with a nice tan head. Good sticky lacing all around. I initially smell the barrel aging with dark fruits. Roasted malts and rich chocolate linger in the background. The barrel aging smells really good on this. Not overpowering, but the presence is known. The taste is really nice. Maple and bitter cocoa really dominate the pallet. This finish very nicely and lingers on the tounge. Rich and heavy and I'm digging it. The silky mouthfeel is partnered wonderfully with subtle carbonation. Great drinkability for a 13% barrel aged beer. The alcohol is hidden very well. 720 charactersBendurgin, Jul 26, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This is my first review on here and this is a beer I've been wanting to try for a long time. Seemed like the right time to start posting. I'm new at this so please forgive any shortcomings, as I am learning each day.
The beer appeared extremely dark in the glass. I couldn't see any light through it. No head or lacing at all. Looks amazing.
Not a very strong smell. Traces of coffee and chocolate. The rest of it is too subtle for me to identify. The scent is just a tease of what the beer tastes like but it smells delicious.
Chocolate and coffee immediately. Bourbon taste stood out at the back of my mouth in particular. Not overpowering but enough to kick you in the pants. I loved the taste.
Felt good to drink. Perfect amount of heat on the back end, but pretty creamy and good.
Outstanding beer. Tons of different flavors. But not overdone and a pleasure to drink. Just had one glass, but definitely was sad to down the last sip. I love Firestone and this lived up to my expectations. If it were more available I would always have some in the cellar. 1,063 charactersthatsfine, Jul 24, 2010
4.26/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 22oz bottle into my Portsmouth large snifter glass. I got a couple of these bottles from a few different BA'ers...so I don't know who to thank for this perticular one. In any case...if you sent me one...THANKS! Really looking forward to this one, since BA stouts are my favorite syle! Pours a super dark, and semi-thick black that fills the glass a murky darkness with a very, very small toffee colored creamy head that dissipates pretty quick. Not much for lacing...but who really cares!
Aroma is a slight let down...simply because it's very weak. I can pick up the chocolate, booze, and malts. Other than that, it's just so distant. 
Flavor is outstanding! Thick and creamy mouthfeel, mild carbonation, big boozy flavor! Tons of chocolate all over the palate. All the big stout characteristics are present, but the barrel aging makes this so nice! The sweet flavors are not overkill, but just enough to make you keep wanting more...making this thick beer surprisingly drinkable! A great beer from Firestone Walker...can't weait to age a couple to see how it mellows and/or changes! 1,099 charactersShadesOfGray, Jul 23, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had this one side by side with BA Yeti during our first all grain brew day celebrations. This was the clear winner, IMO. Review from tasting notes: 
Pours dark and thick, viscous, completely black in the glass but no head or lacing. 
Aroma isn't overly crazy, but there's a great balance between chocolate, char, barrel, vanilla, only a touch of whiskey, which I kind of wished was more pronounced, but it's nice.
Taste is fantastic. I like how it's not incredibly sweet like most stouts this thick. Some chocolate blends well with vanilla, ample roastiness, but not astringent, dark fruit on the finish. Would kill for just a tad more bourbon. 
Body is full, sticky yet dry, low carbonation. Alcohol is perfectly hidden. Delicious. 
Easy drinking, lovely beer. Love that it's not a sugar bomb! 799 charactersKeefD, Jul 23, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a portsmouth snifter, shared with my beer sensei. big thanks to Chazmo for this amazing extra!!
A- beautiful, super dark with no light coming through the edges. pours a thin dark brown layer of head that goes to a thick ring in about ten minutes.
S- Holy roasted everything batman! roasted wood, coffee, and a little chocolate. a little bourbon and vanilla at first (fridge temp). as it warms to proper temp, bourbon blooms, and sweet vanilla comes out more. caramel makes an appearance to. great friggin' smell!
T-really good... a cascade of like ten flavors all within about 4 seconds, then bourbon washes them all to aftertastes... freekin great! most prevelent are a smokey caramel (not over-sweet though!), with oak and vanilla hints as well! bourbon hits at the end and sticks around long after the swallow. Just a little hot (a good thing)...super compex without a sweet overload!
M- Great thickness, creamy and silky, dig this one out of your teeth 2o minutes later!
D- damn smooth and never harsh 1,022 charactersridglens, Jul 22, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to solomon420 for sending this out!
Poured into a Portsmouth tulip glass. Parabola produces a large, foamy, tan head that sits on top of an opaque, black, body. The head reduces a bit, but maintains fairly well. Patchy lacing left behind. Pretty good for a 13% stout.
Thick, sweet, roasty malts with a large wave of grassy, bitter hops attack the nose. Barrels come out nicely with a bit of alcohol heat. Traces of vanilla and a touch of bourbon.
Bitter dark malts and hops mix with smooth, almost creamy, chocolate and barrel notes. Faint coffee flavor lingers in the background alongside vanilla and a bit of alcohol. A very well balanced imperial stout with many subtle nuances.
Mouthfeel is smooth with light carbonation. Almost creamy at first, but finishes quite dry. A decent amount of bitterness with the 80 IBU, but the mouthfeel could change a bit with some age as the hops fade out. Would like to see this a bit thicker, but still pretty good. Warming alcohol on the finish.
Drinkability is pretty good. This is a big beer and definitely a sipper. Splitting a bomber with 1-2 other people is about perfect. The alcohol is noticeable on the finish, but it makes for a great stout to warm you up when it's cold out.
Overall, I'm really happy I got a chance to try this beer and I'm looking forward to seeing how the other two age in my cellar. I feel like this beer would benefit from a 2-3% knock in the ABV and a slightly thicker body, but it's quite good as it is. Firestone Walker always does a good job with their blending and this beer is no exception. Definitely worth seeking out. 1,610 characterssisuspeed, Jul 21, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I was trying not to buy into the hype when my buddy decided we would taste one of these together, but here is what i thought:
Had a nice, thin head, not like many other stouts that have a frothy thick head on pour. 
The smell was delicious, great aromas of chocolate and bourbon were there, as well as a few other things I can't quite place. (maybe vanilla, something from the barrels)
The taste of the beer is really good, it started with a smoky start and has a slight chocolate taste, and borubony flavors at the end. This beer kept changing as I drank it over time, and it had a ton of different flavors I couldn't place exactly. The vanilla? seemed to come through as i drank more and more at the beginning of the drinks.
This was a very drinkable stout, easy to put down, and didn't feel super heavy. I'm not sure how I feel about it being so thin as opposed to other stouts, but this beer was very smooth and tasty. 926 charactersrhodeska, Jul 20, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4PIB 7.17.2010, bottled version, late arrival at the festival. 
Minimal head and dissipation, resulting in a very thin layer of head around the edge of the glass. Dark dark brown body no visible carbonation due to hue. The nose is pretty winy due to barrel aging with a lot of bittersweet chocolate aromas. Taste is huge hit of chocolate upfront, with oaky and winy notes, and significant hop bitterness on back end but kept in balance by significant malt bill, caramel, and the pervasive chocolate with a wee bit of coffee present. Mouthfeel is medium full, just a bit sticky, and a surprisingly dry finish given the chocolate notes. Pretty boozy effects drinkability, a sipper to be sure, this could certainly benefit from some cellaring. This is one very tasty beer, worthy of the buzz it has generated, wish I'd had grabbed a bottle at By the Bottle in Vancouver WA, as I am sure this is harder than hell to come by now. 924 charactersjdense, Jul 19, 2010
3.82/5  rDev -15.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 2 |  overall: 3.5Parabola poured out pitch black with a very small mocha head. I was surprised not to find that this beer had some oxidized/cardboard aroma that I find in their anniversary beers. Lots of sweet roasted malt and a light soy sauce aroma lifts out of the beer. It tries really hard to hide the alcohol in the beer. Very well rounded at this point.
Flavor is deeply roasted malt, sweet, and some hoppy bitterness. Mouthfeel is nearly the same as the anniversary beers. For a stout, this is considered watery. It feels more like a porter which I find to be the major fault in the beer. Other wise this is an extremely well balanced and flavorful stout. The barrel aging does not seem to take a huge role in this though. I'd be interested to so if this could stand on it's own without the barrel aging. 796 charactersBearsOnAcid, Jul 19, 2010
4.53/5  rDev -0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5GREAT looking beer. black with a coffee colored head. I really like how the top of the head is alot larger more robust bubbles then the finely packed main part of the head. Just looks super oily on the pour, and i made sure to center pour quite a bit of this, and it turned out looking fantastic.
Aroma is fantastic too. an absolute perfect amount of roasted qualities mixed with bourbon and barrel effects. So inviting.
I've had this once before at a tasting, and it was my highlight then, and still amazes me now, i just can not believe how complex this beer is! Vanilla and smooth creamy chocolate, just melted together with caramel provide such a rich sweetness, and to brash things up a bit and provide the balance is roasted malt,and some alcohol heat, and seemingly even seperate from the heat is the bourbon. This barrel aging and heat do great things to this beer, this beer has some of the best use of barrels i've ever tasted, nothing is huge but everything is easy noticable, this is how its done.
pretty thick feel i love the viscosity its perfect, and the light carbination is just how i like them to be, slight popping accent but not overdone.
This bomber is alone, and i am enjoying every bit of it. yea its got some heat, but its so great for 13%. 1,268 charactersChadQuest, Jul 18, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a deep, viscous black, capped by a frothy two finger mocha colored head. Retention is good as the head settles down to one finger of tight carbonation and dissipates slowly from there, leaving scant lacing down the glass.
S: The most evident aromas up front are caramel, roasted malts, dark chocolate and vanilla, but none of these overpower each other, nor any the supporting smells. Moderate bourbon notes, light oak - including somewhat of a burnt wood character - some coffee, and faint notes of tobacco and leather. Amazingly complex and well integrated.
T: Starts out with caramel, dark chocolate and vanilla before moving into bourbon, light oak and light tobacco on the mid-palate. Moderate coffee and roasted malts come up and add some bitter notes before receding, revealing some dark fruits - cherries and perhaps a touch of plum. Finish maintains some of the dark fruits and brings back dark chocolate and vanilla.
M: Full bodied with low to moderate carbonation...it occupies the perfect spot between creamy and chewy, smooth and viscous.
D: The alcohol is kept firmly in check, manifesting itself only in the bourbon notes...dangerously drinkable for such a big beer. 1,194 charactersXul, Jul 16, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had on tap last night at The Library in Santa Monica.
Appearance - Comes in a 10oz sniffer. Arrives with about a finger of dark, mocha colored head that slowly dissipates. The beer itself is opaque, with literally no light showing through, even around the edges. As the beer begins to disappear, great looking lacing is left on the sides of the glass.
Smell - Wow, this smells amazing. Dark roasted malts, heavy on the dark chocolate, slight vanilla. I believe there is a hint of brown sugar and bourbon with slight burnt wood. This beer smells freaking amazing.
Taste - Wow again. Massive amounts of roasted (thought not overly bitter) malts up front. The dark chocolate is immediately made known and the other flavors just begin to make themselves known. Dark fruits such as sweet cherries and plums, vanilla, oak, and bourbon. This beer tastes just utterly amazing. Having had the Abyss on tap I was expecting it to be a bit muddled with picking the flavors out being so "fresh", however, this is not an issue whatsoever with this beer. 
Mouthfeel - Great, thick viscosity. Lower carbonation, and finishes with a slight alcohol warming of the throat. 
Drinkability - A sipper as it should be. However, let me preface that by stating at such an early and fresh age for this beer, it is more drinkable than BCS and the Abyss at the same age. I was very impressed at how this beer turned out and I wish I could have had a second glass. Good thing I have two in my cellar. Highly recommended. 1,496 charactersSpdKilz, Jul 15, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Chris sent me a couple of these. Thanks, dogg! 
Pouring jet black, this beer glugs from the bottle with an oily consistency. A dense, dark brown head, iridescent and long-lived is present, leaving little lace. The nose is just excellent. Right off the bat, I get decadent chocolate brownies, but as it breathes, the malt complexity really shines. Molasses , roast, grainy bitterness are all present, along with a little licorice. The barrel character is delicious. Toasted coconut, bourbon, vanilla are present in wonderful harmony, working well with the base stout. Sweetness is discernible with some caramel and toffee, but there's a mild charred malt bitterness to balance it out.
My oh my! What a wonderful beverage! The dark chocolate and coffee fudge character again open up the palate with the bourbon, coconut and vanilla following. Caramel sweetness, a little toffee and molasses are also present. Alcohol is wonderfully hidden, I would not guess this was 13%. However, the light spiciness that the alcohol brings pairs very well with the heavily caramelized sugars, reminding me in some ways of pumpernickel bread. The finish is long lasting, with a blend of dark chocolate, bourbon and coconut. Very, very well-balanced, this is truly wonderful stuff. Maybe some dark fruit too? The mouthfeel is incredible, with a big body that never gets tiring, moderate carbonation which, surprisingly, works. A decadent finish, I do get a little char as well. Exceptional stuff, this is going to be a fun two hours with this beer. And two hours later, I could still go fore more of this. Wonderful stuff.
In some ways, it reminds me of the FiftyFifty Imperial Eclipse Stout that was aged in Elijah Craig barrels. Paired with rum and amaretto truffles from RMCF, this is truly wondrous. The nuttiness of the amaretto works harmoniously with the coconut character from the barrel, making this one of the better pairings I've conceived.
**Edit 28 Nov 2011**
I'm drinking my last batch of batch 2. The only other time I drank this batch was earlier this summer on a very drunken night.
At cellar temperature, I'm astounded by how hoppy this beer is. There's a lot of English hop character here, with a fairly high bitterness and leafy character noticeable. In addition, this batch has a lot more licorice character than I remember the first batch having, with a mild anise-like spiciness. Dark honey, a moderate bourbon character with vanilla and toasted coconut. The stout base is pretty nice too, with unsweetened baker's chocolate, molasses and licorice. The palate has all of the flavors the nose would suggest in a nice balance. Hoppy bitterness is strong on the finish, melding with the coconut and vanilla as well as some grainy bitterness. Moderately sweet as well, this has some dark caramel and candy sweetness on the mid-palate. A little less fudge-like and with more licorice and anise than I remember the first bottled batch having, this is an excellent stout. I want to drop my scores a hair, but I can't find a fair way of doing that, so my scores will stand for now. 3,081 charactersDefenCorps, Jul 14, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared at a recent small tasting. Split between three people. Beer served in a snifter. Beer is dark black and forms a one fingered head of small brown bubbles that leaves some lacing on the glass. Nice.
Aroma is bourbony and nice. Its a little hot in the nose, much hotter in the nose than in the mouth.
This is close to the perfect tasting beer. Its creamy and smooth, mildly sweet up front, not hot in the mouth. A subtle and well balanced liquor flavors, nice bourbon character. Its mildly dry but not harsh or acrid. Good roast in the back, some almost coffee like flavors. Very wonderful beer. I would drink this again if given the opportunity. 659 charactersdrabmuh, Jul 12, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.513% ? Yah you can certainly feel the heat in the after taste of this little gem. But the sweet port like upfront taste is a good balance to the Alc. 
When I received this glass last night I noticed the very light cream colored head floating on an over powering DARK brown with highlights of black. 
The nose was pleasant notes of coffee grounds, burbon, chocolate, and a subtle oak lingering. 
Along with the smells I tasted each of those in this beer, along with a sweetness of port, which I think better described as Burbon in cherrywood casks. 
I was preparing my mouth for a more viscous beer from the color, but it was a little lighter in texture, but it made up for that in the Alc. Then having a lasting finish of an irish coffee made from sweet american burbon, without the cream. 
Quite a drinkable beer, but make it an after dinner sipper, or pair with bacon pancakes for a sunday brunch to get your day started. 
Another yummy beer from the Firestone Walker. 969 charactersMexicanSkittel, Jul 10, 2010

7/2/2010
Pours forth from the bottle with a viscosity so great that a rheologist would marvel at it. It appears ebony, with a huge light brown head, excellent retention, and scattered lacing.
The nose exhibits a great blend of caramel, roasted malt, and chocolate. The roast is of a moderate strength, and a dash of coffee is evident. There's a nice level of booze heat and a well integrated bourbon character. Do I detect cream? A wonderfully complex and balanced nose.
The taste is earthy bitterness up front with big chocolate and caramel notes, accompanied by a moderate roast and a light astringency. Again, bourbon is well integrated, and quite delicious. The beer finishes with a moderate bitterness, a touch of astringency, and just the right amount of booze heat, with a lingering bourbon-chocolate-caramel character.
The mouthfeel is incredible...full, creamy yet viscous, and sticky, with a lower moderate level of carbonation.
All around, this is an exceptional barrel aged RIS at a reasonable price for the style. 1,044 charactersHopHead84, Jul 07, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Yet another great bottle provided by Sugit - thanks! Shared this (at least a little) with the wife on a lazy 4th of July.
A - Very little head on a vigorous pour - what little there is was a deep brown that faded quickly. Dark, but appears water with no lacing.
S - Not a lot of anything at first, but as it warms there is plenty of bourbon here. Strong, but not harsh.
T&M - VERY mellow, and a ton of flavor. Just a small sip yields tons of flavor. Mostly that same mellow bourbon from the nose, but also plenty of well balanced sweetness and just a bit of alcohol heat. The mouthfeel is thin, with the bourbon component slicing through the thickness of the malts, and carbonation is low. This detracts for me a bit, but it does work for the style. It could be flat and still dance on the tongue with all of the flavor that is present.
D - This is very much a sipper as the flavors linger forever even in small quantities. However, the ABV is almost invisible, which is astounding.
Great beer that lives up to the hype! 1,025 charactersdougofthefuture, Jul 04, 2010

Pours placidly with little activity, inky black with a glassy surface. Some sticky mocha foam flecks to the edges, forming a ring with some spotty lace too. As the glass is tilted, traces of tiny carb bubbles slowly creep upwards. 
Woody tobacco and mellow roasted coffee in the aroma. Just a hint of the barrel, but it's masterfully integrated. 
Rich dark chocolate smudged with oak, with a well integrated taste of mellow bourbon that lingers in the end. Traces of vanilla and coconut blend easily with a mellow bitterness. Though there's little indication of heat, it's still a mellow sipper best shared. I'm most impressed with how seamlessly Parabola is put together, nice work from the team at Firestone Walker... 858 charactersemerge077, Jul 04, 2010

There's no light getting through this beer. The aromas from Parabola just flow up to my nostrils after opening the bottle. This smells amazing! Huge wooden(oak) scents with tons of chocolate and vanilla. When holding my nose into the glass, I get a nice amount of bourbon blended very well with chocolate, oak, and vanilla. The taste is huge on this thing! This beer is very rich and creamy with amazing complexity. I just get all sorts of flavors that make my palate very happy. The strongest flavors would be the chocolate and vanilla, followed very nearby by the wood and bourbon. I also get some great espresso notes and sweet candy sugar. Amazing taste. The mouthfeel is very rich and thick. This beer is definitely a dessert in itself. For how rich it is, I'm very surprised by the fairly high drinkability. This beer was a real treat that I think everyone should try before they die. 1,000 charactersDovaliHops, Jul 04, 2010

Smell is very woody, almost like a campfire. Looks of dark and bitter chocolate aromas as well.
Taste is unlike any other beer I have ever had, very big, rich, and woody. Lots of barrel flavors come through here with a light bourbon burn on the finish. This beer seems a little messy right now, it is very dry, it tastes like I am sucking on wood. 
Big, full, and rich mouthfeel. Medium carbonation, a little hot on the finish. Very dry, something seems off.

4.52/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Ok, so I drank half a Parabola the other night and I have to say that the alcohol was well hidden for 13% abv. It was a little chalky but it was also quite well done. I will say that I think this beer does work better as a blend for their anniversary beers but it was still cool. The barrel is not as easy to notice as in the anniversary beers.
update 11/24/10
This was a little better this time, very rich and had a strong barrel/spirit flavor going on. Nice. Its probably way to much to drink a whole bomber by yourself.

2011 vintage. Fantastic smell like coconut and cake, wonderful overall. Need more.

From Notes: Y
A -Small brown head with light beautiful lacing. Super dark brown almost black in color. Also has a moderate amount of lacing. 
S - Roasted malts, dark chocolate, dark fruits, vanilla and bourbon make up the aroma of this beer. Very complex even in smell. The smell is not strong but not light either. 
T - Similar to smell. Has a bit of bitterness in the middle and smooths out in the end. Very complex flavor and all the flavors mentioned in the smell are present and blend together very nicely with none of flavors overpowering another. 
M - Light carbonation. Super silky and smooth in the mouth and is full-bodied but not over bearing.
D - This is a big beer but it really isn't very hot for the ABV. And is quite easy to drink. 857 charactersKrevee, Jul 03, 2010

A - Inky black with minimal mocha head after vigorous pour. 
S - Bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malts, and molasses. Everything you want from a BA RIS.
T - Roasted malts, vanilla, oak, and little booze, and a lingering chocolate aftertaste.
M/D - Low carbonation and viscous means it's oily and coats your mouth. I think it works great for the beer and keeps me sipping it as it warms. I made sure to split the bottle into 3 separate servings so I could enjoy it longer. 
Move over Abyss, I have a new favorite BA RIS. 548 charactersxpimptastikx, Jun 30, 2010

A- Pours a beep black, no light passes through. Had to pour a bit more vigorous towards the end to pull out a decent head. The beer is viscous, coast teh glass after a swirl. 
S - Big a sweet, touches of bourbon and dark chocolate. On deeper inhales roasted barley comes through. 
T- Very good beer. Eminence flavor. Sweet roasted barley up front that moves quickly to a complex bourbon finish. Bitter dark chocolate notes as well as plenty of vanilla notes round out the flavor profile. 
M - A touch flat for an RIS in my opinion, the feel is silky smooth, pleasant taste on the tongue after each sip.
O- Love this beer, its a big sweet RIS with no major drawbacks and all the right flavors. 837 charactersDwnTwnBwn, Jun 28, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had at Lukafer's going away tasting. Forgot who brought this amazing bottle. Review from phone notes...
A- Pour a deep dark black color. One and a half finger tan head that has really good retention for the ABV. Some spotty lacing on the sides of the glass but nothing much other than that. 
S- Roasted malts in the front of this give way to a vanilla aroma. Bourbon-y flavors with light oak in the middle. Some alcohol hotness which tingles the nose. Brown sugar and light bitter chocolate.
T- Big roasted malts in the front end of this. Some chocolate malt undertones which also shows a good vanilla backing. Oaky notes soaked in a bourbon like alcohol take over everything for a short while before coming back with a coffee bite to it. 
M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation was good for the style but a little light for me personally. Roasted malts with vanilla backing left on the palate with a coffee bourbon aftertaste. Flavors were well blended but shined individually. Very drying for me on the palate. Clean flavors overall.
D- A wonderful beer overall by Firestone Walker. This beer I can tell will only get better with age or at least a couple more years on it. I am going to be looking for a few bottles for the cellar. Well worth the praise in every way. 1,267 charactersalleykatking, Jun 28, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4a - pours a deep, viscous-looking, black color, two-finger cappuccino colored head, great retention and lacing, especially at this high abv
s - deep toasty malt, cherry cola and dark fruit, graham cracker, bourbon boozy note along with a considerable toasty oak note
t - very well integrated flavors with no much harshness at all, big dark chocolate, brown sugar, light caramel notes up front, midpalate has a dose of cherry and plum flavors mixed in with the toasted oak and vanilla, finish is a little hot with bourbon woven in with more vanilla and oak, pretty dry finish that just lasts forever, incredibly complex overall
m - very full-bodied but not as viscous as some Imperial Stouts such as Dark Lord, moderate carbonation, very nice alcohol warming on the palate and in the throat, really coats the palate nicely and lingers
d - definitely not something you're going to take down huge quantities of, but I'm having no problem putting away the bomber currently, and no issues have a few nice sized pours when I had it on tap at the Rose & Crown a month ago, the complexity just begs you to keep on drinking to figure out all the flavors, the alcohol is certainly noticeable, but not overwhelming on the palate, even at 13%, overall, above average in this category for the style
I really liked this on-tap a month ago, and I absolutely love this stuff now out of the bottle. To my palate, I think this may eclipse the bottles of FW 12 and 13 I've had recently. Between this, Abacus and the anniversary series, FW has shown they are masters of big -bal aged beers. 1,575 charactersWeisGuy, Jun 28, 2010

Getting some vanilla, dark chocolate, and booze on the nose.
First taste on my tongue is the wood. Booze is pretty well hidden, though there is a little ting on the tongue. 
Slightly chewy, yet clean finishing.
There was a lot of hype around the bottling of this beer, and I'd say it just lives up to it. Not over, not under, but right there. Very tasty. 493 charactersandyfrancis, Jun 27, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4On-tap at Blue Palms Brewhouse - served in a generic snifter. 
Bistre/seal brown body, opaque, crowned by a finger of creamy tan foam which recedes to a thin but persistent collar and slick. Rich sticky lacing, light viscous tears. 
Brown sugar, molasses, demerara rum, and faint barrel notes in the nose. It takes some time for the aromas to develop at this chilled draught temperature. 
Super-intense but masterfully balanced array of roast malt, dark bread crust, vanilla, bourbon, hops, earth, pepper, anise, and more. The profile really blossoms as the ale warms. 
Thick, chewy, viscous, but rather sticky. Very slight astringency. 
Barrel-aged to perfection, while Firestone gives tremendous attention to their blending, the base beers (especially Parabola and Abacus) are remarkable on their own. ABV is well integrated into the whole - while the stout base isn't as remarkable as the best examples as the style, the subtleties from the barrel are unique to this brewer. Worth seeking out. 1,001 charactersaugustgarage, Jun 26, 2010
4.48/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Jet black with a half finger dark tan head that dissipates very quickly. Good lacing.
S - Malty chocolate scent. Noticeable alcohol aroma in the background. Not as strong as an aroma as I expected for this beer.
T - Very good chocolate/coffee taste working together nicely, hints of oak and vanilla. Some caramel undertones as well.
M - Very smooth rich beer. Not at all thick for an imperial stout either. Faint alcohol burn on the finish.
D - Extremely drinkable. With the chocolate/coffee dominance overpowering the alcohol burn, coupled with its fairly light body, this is an easily drinkable beer. 610 charactersGarrettMD, Jun 26, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Thanks for the chance to try this! From notes, split the bottle on 6.18.
Pours black with a small dark brown head into a wine glass. Small dark brown head, fades to ring with some dotted lace, but not much. 
Wow, initially I was surprised by how vinous this was. Big fruity cherry/berry notes combining with charred woodsiness. But after the first few sips and as the glass warmed, these flavors were better integrated. Lots of rich malts, great complexity. Good amount of booze, a definite sipper, but this is just massive with great charred wood flavor and chocolate. A bit oily, but great mouthfeel as well. Sipped on my share of the bottle for almost an hour, it is rich and the 13% is warming. Another masterful beer from the FW guys, chooo choooo. 755 charactersIneedabeerhere, Jun 24, 2010
4.83/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served on tap at Blue Palms in Hollywood. At David Walkers suggestion, I tried it with a Garrotxa Sant Gil D'ibio Spanish semi-hard goat cheese. Perfection. 
A: midnight black stout, thin kalua-coloured halo of head ringing the snifter. 
S: slightly malty, very toasty. A bit of vanillin, tobacco and coca tinged with alcohol.
T: perfect blend of the above, plus notes of chocolate, boysenberry, and anise. Not as mnd bowing as the Avery Black Tot, but damn good. 
M: substantial, milky but not thick. noticeable but light carbonation. Perfectly compliments the flavour and the alcohol.
D: glad I got this in a 10 oz. snifter, but I could easily drink three of these in a row, despite the alcohol. Definitely a sipper that gets better as it warms, but over a long session, I could keep going with this all night. 817 charactersvertigelt1, Jun 24, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to mrbubbler & my #1 West Coast dealer, cloudskipper, for two bottles of this much-anticipated brew. Firestone is one of two breweries (Founders being the other) that have magic in their barrels. 
Pours lightless into a pair of stylin' Selin's Grove goblets; quick, still, & beautiful, as long as it's not spilled in the Gulf. The smell is what the urine of Hades might smell like: divine. Sweet, barrelly, insanely deep malts, coupling with some pretty chocolates. 
The taste...Parabola doesn't disappoint. Hype? Screw hype, this is a great beer. Slap a BMC label on it & I'd buy it by the case. Honestly, I don't even know where to start describing the tastiness of this fire-breather. 93 varieties of malts, all complementing one another like a consultant at a convention? Check. Subtle, quiet, but powerful beads of bourbon coating my mouth like WD-40? Check. Blended chocolate, dry oakiness, vanilla, check. But the English language doesn't do it justice, nor would Spanish, or French. As with any superior beer, or puzzle, or good relationship, it's the way the pieces fit together that really matters. And this is a masterpiece. 
And also the rare barrel-aged beer where my first, questing sip turned into a long swallow, & I consciously had to remove my lips from glass. A serious beer, but not heavy or cloying, & the barrel aging sets up & plays off everything else. 
Masterpiece. So glad I have one more bottle, & I might need another to age down the road. Though I might need to bury this one to keep from having the other bottle tomorrow night. 1,568 charactersmaximum12, Jun 24, 2010
4.31/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Beautiful packaging for this thing with the box and nice old school label. Pours a true black with a one finger head at first that lowers to bubbles around the edge of the glass. Smell is disappointing with dark fruits and alcohol up front, and vanilla and burn taking a backseat. Flavor is goood. Great synthesis of chocolate, espresso, dark fruits, vanilla, and a tiny alcohol bite that is lower than would be expected after the nose. Pretty dry finish considering the body is medium thick. Mouthfeel is world class. EXCEPTIONALLY SMOOTH. Overall for this being young it is very good. In two years this might be a legend. 623 characterssquaremile, Jun 20, 2010

Pours a rich dark brown into my trusty snifter.
Med full body with a creamy mouth-feel, with mild carbonation.
Solid chocolate notes up front with a rich malt presence and slight alcohol bite.
Strong notes of oak, coffee bitterness, milky chocolate, with undertones of licorice. 
Finishes with a velvet like mouth-feel, milk chocolate and a tingly alcoholic bite.
Overall amazing balance, great mouth-feel, and well blended notes of wood and chocolate.
Not as impressive as the Oak Aged Espresso Yeti I had the night before, but a great Impy stout. 575 characterspixieskid, Jun 18, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Special Thanks to Abecall98 for sending me this bottle of Parabola. Abel is a great guy and BA... Trade with him if you have the chance.
Sorry, I love the bottle. Classy, just love it.
Pours with a tan head that stays just for a short visit then vanishes.
Deep dark brown, but not black. Slight light in at the edges. Not much in the lacing department.
Aroma is really nice and thick in your nostrils. Dark chocolate, like brownies... (we'll come back to that), vanilla a bit of alcohol and vanilla. Great aroma.
In the end, here's how I describe the flavor. Rich caramel sauce drizzled over a warm undercooked brownie with a touch of vanilla ice cream. I know that's weird, but those are the flavors I get in the end. Deep rich chocolate, thick caramel and then some vanilla. In fact, some vanilla extract. Only after reading the box do I think I can detect what they mean by cherry, but I would have never picked that up. Very deep and inviting... 
My God, this is a thick, full bodied beer. Lays thick on your tongue, slightly oily and with little carbonation. Wonderful and rich.
I loved this. I had a feeling I would and I did. This is the base for the Firestone Anniversary beers and those are among my favorite ever. Now I see why... Just awesome. 1,260 charactersReagan1984, Jun 18, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to mcallister (a continuing theme in my reviews) for sharing more beer than Obama shares other people's money. 
Pours a nice black with just a hint of off white head. No apparent carbonation.
Smells of mild coffee with a hint of vanilla and chocolate mixed in. Nicely sweet with wisps of dark fruit.
Taste is a mild mix of chocolate and coffee, both fighting for dominance. Not at all overpowering or viscous. The sweetness mixes well with the dark notes in the brew and the dark fruit in the nose really doesn't come through that much. 
Rich mouthfeel but not at all dense or cloying. Very nice sipper and this is its best point. Its lack of anything overpowering makes it an excellent sipping beer for those occasions when you don't want to be slammed by a great tasting beer. The alcohol is very well hidden. 818 characterskirok1999, Jun 18, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4The one and only Parabola, on-tap at 38 Degrees. The final beer of the night, on to the beer:
Oh my, another darker than black imperial stout! The lacing on this one is actually quite solid for the style. Now in this beer, the barrel qualities are noticable, but are more subtle than the Rasputin XII I had earlier. The aroma is very mellow, with a little oak, and succulent cocoa. 
While not as complex, it's still very tasty. There's chocolate, boysenberry(!), licorice, and a little touch of oak. That sounds, good, don't you think? And they're blended and balanced together with the craftsmanship of FW. It's thick and rich, yet never overbeaing or harsh on the palate. 
Do I need to say that this is delicous beer? A bomber of this may be a little much for me, but I'd certainly be happy to split one with somebody in the future...or be lucky and find Parabola on-tap again. 882 charactersDoubleJ, Jun 17, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Poured into a wine glass. Its the only glass I have that allows for enough room to breathe properly. Dark like motor oil as a caramel colored head arose. It came on slowly similar to most barrel aged beers but lingered just long enough to form that perfectly colored head that can only come from an imperial stout. Salivating already. This Monday is looking up already.
S: So many things going on here at once. Soft hints of chocolate and toffee. Soft woodsy smell. Every sniff brings out a different memory. Amazing. Should have lingered more at this stage but the dark liquid awaits.
T: Right away a subtle complexity destroying all other beers I have tasted in my recent memory. Coco -nibs, molasses, but not with that cloying sweetness that can overwhelm some beers of this type. I have been drinking a lot of Imperial stouts lately and this taste will linger in my palate for a long time. In the middle of the taste I get some whiskey and maybe even red wine flavors going on but they just blend in perfectly to the complete flavor of the entire beer. This beer tastes slightly differently with each sip as it slowly warms and you notice different elements. Vanilla, dates, on and on...This was a highly hyped bottle but one that I can not say enough about. Balance is a tough thing to do perfectly but this beer does it all. Infinite complexity and drinkability. 
M: About three-quarters of the way through I remember, oh yeah 13%. Not a hint. I could have downed two of these. So smooth and full on the palate. Thick and juicy without being overwhelming. Carbonation present adds to the presence in the mouth but prefect level for the style. Soft and almost feels as if I am chewing through some amazing flavors in my mouth. Velvety smoothness and lip smacking perfection.
D: Humm, what do you think? If I was made of money I would be quaffing these on a daily basis and always sad when another beer was offered. Each sip was swallowed with a small tinge of sadness as one of the best beers to ever cross my lips slowly and smoothly slipped down my throat. I was not sure what to expect with all of the hype but was unexpectedly blown away and came away impressed. Sometimes hype is well earned and if you are as much a fan of the infinite complexity of the imperial stout as I am this may well be your favorite beer. May my dreams tonight be filled with fresh bottles of Parabola and I may sleep the slumber of angels. 2,433 charactersmalatinodesign, Jun 15, 2010
4.66/5  rDev +2.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 22 oz. bottle into a Bruery tulip glass at approximately 55 degrees Fahrenheit.
A: Just like any good imperial stout, Parabola poured black and viscous into my glassware. Was soon followed was a dark mocha head that dissipated into thin foam layer, even after a few vigorous swirls. The lacing was on the thinker side, but did leave a trail of brown stickiness along the sides of the tulip glass.
S: Woody and subtle dark fig aromas at the front end that eventually conceded to the robust amounts of chocolate, brown sugar, and molasses. The cocoa quality really jumped in after the few seconds and was really the showcase of the overall smell. 
T: The initial flavor is mild molasses with a coffee bitterness character that was once again, backed up by huge amounts of chocolate flavor. The wood flavor crept up towards middle palate and lasted throughout the finish, which helped add some complexity to the bold cocoa flavor. The fruit flavor never seemed the surface, but there was other minute aspects to Parabola that wasn't able to determine.
M: For an imperial stout, the carbonation was on high side which may have added to a slightly dryer finish than I expected. 
D: Simply wonderful! One of the best beers I've had the pleasure of trying. Really wish I was able to acquire some bottles for myself...cause honestly, I could of polished this bomber off in 20 minutes. It's that good!
Overall: Easy to see why this is one of the most sought after beers around. A must try! Cheers! 1,508 charactersOlieIPA, Jun 12, 2010

S: First impression is tons of bourbon, vanilla, and oak. As the beer warms more dark fruits and roasted malts begin come out.
T: Bourbon blast with oak and vanilla. Nicely roasted malts. Bitter chocolate, espresso, raisins, and a red wine like character. Some charred wood and earthy bitterness. Pretty damn complex.
M: Medium-full bodied. Good, assertive carbonation. Lingering earthy bitterness. Moderate heat, but no burn. 
D: I don't know... something was a little off, and I can't put my finger on it. Despite tasting quite deliciously, I struggled to finish the bomber. 769 characterscallmemickey, Jun 11, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours pitch black into a small snifter, no head, very slight brown tint near the very edges.
Too many smells hit the nose at first; vanilla, burnt malts, bourbon, and maybe a bit of wine(?). A nice woody scent makes up the background.
Taste follows the smell with some earthy qualities (minus any wine notes I may have smelled.) The alcohol taste is there, but at 13%, they have hidden it pretty well. The mouth is hot, lightly bubbly and very smooth.
I have procured a few more of these for aging and very much look forward to enjoying them later. 548 charactersOBeerMeGreatOne, Jun 10, 2010
4.46/5  rDev -1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5650ml bottle, No1 so 2010, with black wrap that has a tag to pull on...cool idea and it works nicely. I also like the amount of info on the label re the beer.
A light hiss when I popped the cap, this straight from the fridge bottle and a slow pour still brought a good inch of tan foam. The lacing department worked overtime as there's ton of it.
Still being cold, the smell is somewhat subdued. I'll come back to it later.
The taste will, no doubt, also improve during warm up but...man...there's a ton of flavour here already. It's roasty, has some coffee and dark chocolate bitterness, a hint or 2 of a fruity sweetness, vanilla kicking in now, and a very tasty bourbon/barrel influence that kicks some major arse.
I'd say, for the abv, uncle Al it isn't too noticeable tastewise other than the obvious flavour you get from a barrel aged brew but after the swallow, it gives me a very warm and fuzzy feeling. I think I like this stuff. ;^)
The mouthfeel is close to full with a perfect(lightish) amount of carbonation. 
Drinkability? No back to backs for me ever with a brew in this abv range but the bottle in front of me is killer for one session. Marvelous.
Back to the smell, it *has* warmed up some and I do get notes of chocolate and vanilla and what barrel aging brings to the table but no way does the smell, imho, do the taste justice. This is one of the best barrel aged Stouts I have tried. Full marks to Firestone! 1,436 charactersBitterbill, Jun 10, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From a 22 oz bottle into a tulip. Parabola is an opaque obsidian color, viscous but well carbonated, topped by an inch of head that slowly recedes to a crown.
The aroma is wonderfully nuanced, roasted malt at balance with notes of dark bittersweet chocolate, spicy black licorice, mellow spirits and fruity red wine. Alcohol is noticeable, but just barely.
Bold flavors of dark chocolate, rich molasses, sweet whiskey and black licorice hit the taste buds first. There's a slight fruity, vinous quality to it as well, enhanced by a light tannic astringency. Barrel aging makes its presence known without overwhelming the complexities of the base beer, which has not always been the case in past iterations of this beer; this is clearly the most balanced batch of Parabola yet out of those I've tried. It has a hefty, chewy texture with a firm lingering roasted bitterness that clings to the tongue after a few sips and doesn't let go. Sweetness is reserved, at a perfect balance with the bitterness and tannins. The more I drink this, the more impressed I am. I've tried several batches of this beer over the years, some aged entirely in bourbon barrels, others in rye whiskey barrels, some a blend of different components. This one really nails it; the balance, nuance and delicacy make it my favorite batch yet. Thankfully, it's the one we finally got in bottles. 1,367 characterslargadeer, Jun 08, 2010

Rises about two fingers but falls pretty quickly, light lacing...The aroma is nice medium strength, dominated by lots of really nice coffee not strong just yummy roastiness with a sweet cream finish....The first sip is lots of coffee nice like the aroma. As this warms it really starts to bring out the bourbon which is sweet and warming. Light coffee on the front, sweet in the middle, light bitter coffee finish. Not 50 ibu's...The feel is nice, coats the palate nicely, very warm finsih. Pretty easy drinker. 
Overall, this is ok. Drink it quickly because as you drink it, its worse. It becomes flatter, less flavor and more alcoholic. 776 charactersjrallen34, Jun 05, 2010

S - Sweet, there is some subtle coffee and wood. Sweet cocoa and creamy milk smell, some dark char and burnt malt smell.
T - This is a very complex and nice tasting brew. Finishes with a nice and quit bitter roasty taste. Some subtle coffee. The bourbon comes out more as the beer warms up. This beer has a very creamy, milky chocolate taste which is quite nice. Becomes much less bitter and more sweet as it warms up.
M - Full bodied, very creamy, mild carbonation. All works well.

4.75/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Tasted at a release party at a local Portland pub. Served in a 8 oz snifter glass. The beer was served way too cold (likely in the lower 40's). On the bad side, the first couple tastes were not optimal. On the plus side, I was able to experience this beer as it warmed. Review from notes taken after the event.
A: Color is a very dark black with almost no head. The glass was very full.
S: Smell changed dramatically as the beer warmed. First impression was coffee and licorice. Later the chocolate and bourbon flavors started to show up. Eventually, the more subtle vanilla and oak flavors appear. THe smell is lush, complex, and big.
T: Taste is amazing. Big coffee and chocolate up front. In the middle, dark fruits, vanilla, oak, and some faint toffee. The taste is creamy and rich. The bourbon is obvious, but it's not in-your-face. Instead, you're able to pick up the vanilla and oak flavors rather than just tasting like a RIS with bourbon mixed in. Didn't notice the heat until I took a break and ran to the bathroom. THat's when it hit me - the back of my throat all the way down my neck has a warm, glowing feeling. Yeah, there's some heat there, but very comforting. Taste lingers (and lingers), leaving some light bitter, coffee and woody notes.
M: Big, lush, smooth. Full bodied with minimal carbonation (although definitely not flat). Definitely coats the tongue and stays around for a while.
D: This was excellent and will likely improve over the next year or so as the warming (which was increasingly noticable during the tasting) calms slightly. I really liked how well integrated the bourbon was with the stout. Not over the top, but just enough aging time to pick up the vanilla and oak flavors. Overall, this is excellent and I look forward to seeing this develop over the next couple years. 1,816 charactersoregonskibum, Jun 05, 2010

A - Parabola pours black as night and thick, with little carbonation. Just how I like my stouts. Very little mocha colored head that disappeared quickly with some lacing. I cant wait to try this one.
S - The first thing I smell is the bourbon, a little reminiscent of KBS, imo. But I have not had many bourbon barrel stouts. Getting some tobacco, oak, vanilla ice cream, and some dark fruits. This beer smells damn good and very complex with many subtle aromas.
T - I get chocolate and coffe upfront as I move it around a bit I get the vanilla and bourbon finished with some fruity sweetness in the finish.
M - Velvety, creamy, milky smooth. The mouthfeel is thick and voluptuous somewhat chewy. Everything a RIS should, not overly carbonated, but full bodied.
D - The drinkability on this is very high for a 13% beer. Interested in what a year would do for this beer, thankfully I got more than one. Excellent sipper to be had over a longer period of time. 1,037 characterskk73, Jun 05, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours black with a finger of head and no lacing.
Aroma is marshmallow and oak up front, with plenty of toasted malts and dark fruits adding complexity. A bit of bourbon heat, but not too much. Notes of tropical and piney hops. Pretty damn nice overall.
The flavor isn't quite as good as the nose, but it is still very very solid. Toasted malts and oak dominate. The oak is particular really puts its stamp on the flavor profile. A bit of bourbon heat in the finish. Raisins and grapes peek their head out every once in a while.
The body is on the low side of full and somewhat creamy. Pretty nice but not thick enough for a 5.
Overall this a is very nice imperial stout, and at 13% is is highly drinkable. A good desert beer for sure. If the oak mellows a bit I think it could improve even more. 799 charactersalcstradamus, Jun 04, 2010

Pours pitch black out of the bottle with light mahogany around the edges. There is a small creamy tan head that recedes quickly to a thin collar and leaves no lacing but some sticky legs along the sides.
The aroma is fantastic dark chocolate, coffee, lots of dark fruits including raisins and plums. There is also some tobacco, spicy oak and vanilla beans.
The taste is wonderful as well. There is plenty of dark chocolate and tobacco. Also lots of dark fruits, vanilla and caramel. The finish leaves a slight alcohol burn though nothing to indicate the 13% abv.
Super smooth mouthfeel, full bodied with soft carbonation. Spicy oak and tobacco in the finish.
Decadent, complex, outstanding. There's so much going on in this one and it all comes together in one fairly drinkable package. 835 charactersgford217, Jun 04, 2010

"This particular lot was aged in a combination of barrels for 9 months. . .Chocolate, charred oak, vanilla, dark cherry and coffee are just some of the complex aromas and flavors you will find in this beer."
Had this beer on two occasions: 22oz bottle poured into specialty glass (almost a snifter) & 22 oz bottle poured into pint glass
A: This beer is beautifully packaged and pours like a dream. Bomber comes in a box that provides a venue to describe the beer in detail and makes you feel like a kid on Christmas. Pour is dark, very dark, with some head, but not enough to last you through you sampling. Not a big deal, your brain will be busy later with the flavors.
S: Coffee, vanilla and a nice aroma from the barrels used hit you first. Go back and take a second, third and fourth smell before you taste it. Complex and enticing.
T: This beer is 13%, and that comes out a little in the smell (those barrels again) but when you finally taste it, the broad swath of flavors overpower the alcohol taste. You still know you're drinking a strong beer, but the rich sweetness, coffee, chocolate & variety of barrel-aged flavors keeps your palette busy. Too bad I couldn't find enough to age one of these bad boys.
M: This is a beer you'll sip and smell and hold in your mouth for an hour or more. A pleasant experience on the tongue.
D: Wonderful beer for a relaxing afternoon/early evening. I'd be careful, hesitant even, pairing it with food. You won't want to miss out on or distract from the myriad flavors in this beer. 1,590 charactersmelliott2811, Jun 01, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Review #100!
Poured at 50 degrees into a snifter. Boy, I am really excited they decided to bottle this beer as I have had it on tap and loved it two other times.
Pours slick and oily into my glass. I used a pretty quick pour without a glass tilt to achieve a two finger widths dark tan head. The body is an impenetrable midnight black with not even a smidge of redness near the edges. The head looks creamy and inviting, comprised of small bubbles. Unfortunately, the only thing holding this back is that the head mellows out rather quickly, and leaves a thin ring around the glass which achieves some slight lacing.
The aroma of this beer is very complex, and reminds me a lot of FW12. There's a huge tobacco component that hits hard initially, accentuated by a good bit of vanilla, followed by chocolate, and slight roast. The hops are here too, which is something I don't recall in the tap version. Perhaps this had to do with the new more potent hop bill employed for the bottle release version. The hop character is kind of a zingy spicyness, likely from the Hallertau hops used late in the boil. 
A good bit of sweet vanilla sits up front on my tongue and plays with chocolate, much akin to vanilla ice cream with chocolate syrup. As I begin to move the beer around my palate I get a whirlwind of other flavors, cutting through the sweetness. Some of the flavors in this whirlwind include deep french roast coffee, tobacco leaf, slight citrus zing, and cherry liqueur chocolates. Fantastic, fantastic stuff. No off flavors or anything unwanted here.
The best way to describe the mouthfeel is velvety. It's quite thick and has a nice chewyness. I couldn't find any flaws here at all.
Drinkability is hindered a bit at the present time due to a considerable amount of warming on the swallow, but overall it's just a fantastic beer to consume over the period of an entire evening as I am doing now. Who wants to share a beer this good, anyway? With that said, the alcohol heat doesn't detract from the flavor one bit. I'm guessing the alcohol heat will mellow with some more time, but I'm curious to see if that will hurt the taste, since it might start missing some of the alcoholic cherry flavor that I love so dearly. 2,229 charactersBubba83, Jun 01, 2010
4.05/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 22oz bottle into a brandy snifter:
A: Opaque black with a small dark brown head. Fades quickly to pretty much nothing, which is unfortunate.
S: Cocoa, vanilla, bourbon. Very sweet, but not getting the caramel other describe.
T: Huge chocolate, with a bourbon alcohol burn and cocoa finish. More subtle flavors of dark fruits and an underlying malty sweetness throughout.
MF: Full bodied, but highly carbonated, which breaks up the heaviness.
D: Quite drinkable for a 13% ABV imperial stout, but still too heavy for anything but sipping. 
A very tasty brew but I think this will be much better after a bit of age. I'll be re-reviewing this beer later. 670 characterssrroos, Jun 01, 2010

Nice chocolate and roasted aroma.
Taste is wonderful. Balanced with nice roasted malt flavors, chocolate and dark fruits. The alcohol is not upfront making this a very smooth beer.
Mouthfeel is great. Velvety and smooth, its almost thick. Very full bodied.
For a big stout with 13% abv this is a very drinkable beer. The mouthfeel is great and the beer is an excellent stout. 431 characterstjsprague, May 31, 2010

Smells sweet with a strong chocolate and coconut aroma. Lots of vanilla here and a whiff of whiskey. There is a faint orange aroma here like a Cadbury Chocolate Orange.
Starts out strong vanilla and chocolate, with some coconut and caramel. Strong vanilla and a bitter chocolate aftertaste, this is very much a vanilla and chocolate beer. Slightly hot in the mouth still not bad at all for 13% ABV. Tasty but still a little young, let it age a year.
Mouthfeel seems a bit thin; alcohol seems to have everything well dissolved.
Very good drinkability for a young high-test beer. This needs to be aged for a year. 679 charactersZorro, May 31, 2010

4.53/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Purchased several bottles at a local bevmo.
I have been wanting to try this for 2 years now and i will say it has been worth the wait. I have had most of the big RIS and i would put this up with the best of them. I am not a fan of bourbon bombs which i had heard this would be, not the case at all. I guess the original version had a 2 year barrel age and this bottled version had been aged 9 months in several different types of barrels. PERFECT!!!
A- The body is death black with a very viscous oily pour. One thing i noticed first off was the deep brown head that i have only seen on 2 other beers (dark lord and Bourbon county) much darker than beers light Darkness or Abyss.
S- Smell was ok, raisin and dark chocolate, for me personally this is a good thing as it reminded me of that sweetness of DL.
T & M - I absolutly loved it causing me to purchase additional bottles to save for later when the heat dies down a little. It has a very velvetly texture and coating to the tongue. 
D- I that it was very good considering how fresh it is, I think it will continue to improve as the heat mellows.
Overall this exceeded my expectations. 1,145 charactersJWD, May 29, 2010

 Pours opaque black with long lasting tan brown head, nice legs filming the glass.
 Aromas of chocolate, molasses, nutty toffee caramel. The booziness burns the inside of the nose. 
Taste is very rich of cocoa, very complex, dark chocolate, not overly roasty, quite a bit of booze. Toffee, nutty.
Mouthfeel is big bodied with moderate carbonation. Still quite hot at 13% and young.
This beer young is fantastic and aged will only be even better. Glad I got some to hold on to. Yummy!!! 513 charactersalexgrahamlv, May 29, 2010

Pours a deep black with a very nice dark tan head. The head dissapated to a ring but is leaving ok lacing. It looked amazing at first.
Aroma is awesome. So much going on. Dark chocolates and caramels. Roasted grains and bourbon. Smells like man hood.
Taste is amazing. One of the best beers to grace my lips. Taste of chocolates at first, then some sweet caramels into some bourbon and dark fruits/roasted grains then leaves your mouth with a roasted grain flavor with bourbon and I taste the dark chocolate covered cherry that I imagined from the discription on the box. Such a great beer.
Mouthfeel is so smooth and creamy. Perfect carbonation for the beer. So nice in my mouth.
Overall I'm glad I busted open a bottle by myself and not sharing because I'm lovin this. I'll be sippin in this all night. Glad I have 5 more to put away and age. Amazing beer. 1,019 charactersPeprSprYoFace, May 29, 2010

I have been staring at it on my wants list for 3 years, dying to get a taste, but with no luck. Then they bottle it and I go into full on rage mode to get some. A kind BA sent me a bottle and I am in heaven. My son graduated yesterday, what better way to celebrate I could not think of one.
Served chilled and poured into a snifter, this one was consumed on 05/26/2010.
Deep and dark, black as night this one poured with a tremendous fury. Evil looking and thick as oil it came at me . Small two finger head settled down and coated the sides with sticky chocolate colored lacing that let me know I was in for it.
As I reach in and take a whiff it hits me like a ton of bricks. Deep aroma of roasted malts, huge bourbon notes , vanilla, molasses, tons of rich oak and lots of sugary and boozy touches. Hard to explain, just soo complex I dont know where to begin. Warming just confuses me more as the profile seems neverending. Each sip is like liquid god for me. Deep roasted notes, coffee, light licorice, bourbon, boozy flavor that seems to dominate early on but fade as it starts to warm. Vanilla, and oak, chocolate, rich decadent notes of toffee and never ending complexity welcome me and wont let me go. Smooth carbonation, full, complex body, delicous, perfect nightcap.
Overall everything I wanted it to be and then some. One of the best BA beers I have ever had. It works on every level possible. So worth seeking out. 1,515 charactersmikesgroove, May 28, 2010

Pitch black with with a nice thin mocha colored head. Smells like chocolate and burnt marshmallows, thick caramel malt fudge, cocoa nibs, and a roasted malt characteristic reminiscent of espresso. There is also caramel, vanilla, and bourbon. Whiffs of alcohol.
The taste pretty mostly follows smell. Layers and more layers of bourbon with dark chocolate, chocolate fudge, pralines, caramel, vanilla. Roasted expresso and milk chocolate, some roasted cocoa, a ton of vanilla raisin, vanilla and bourbon flavor lingers. Wonderfully complex everything you would expect from a barrel aged imperial stout.
The drinkability is pretty unreal for 13% abv. Simple delicious! 740 characters2ndloveofmylife, May 27, 2010

A - Pitch Black, impossible to notice any other color other than black. Head is a dark rich mahogany color that fades away very slowly. But leave a nice lace around the glass. 
S - Oak, Bourbon, Molasses, very complex but inviting. 
T - The first taste is an explosion of chocolate that doesn't overpower, but invites the taste buds in for more and more. The next flavor that is present is a hint of coffee with some oakyness to the party, followed closely by a hint of bourbon with some molasses and vanilla. Every taste gets better and better. 
M - Balanced and even, never to think or to flat, constant happiness from the front to the back all around the palette. This gets a 5 without a doubt. As described below velvet is spot on. 
D - One of the smoothest Imperial Stouts on the market, easily! 855 charactersMrTopher, May 24, 2010

A- Body is big, thick, opaque and black. Pours with a soapy light brown head, which fades quickly, to a thin collar and leaves behind little lacing in the glass.
S- Nose is all about the bourbon barrel. Very woody, quite boozy, with a mild cocoa and bourbon sweetness.
T- Upfront is a big dose of roasted chocolate malt-which isn't present in the nose really at all and a pleasant surprise in the flavor. There is also a lot of oak and some bourbon. The alcohol becomes prominent for the finish in both flavor and heat.
M- Body is fairly heavy with a moderate weight and a lot of astringent alcohol consistency.
D- This brew, much like the full sail BBL stout, showcases the aspects of the barrel rather than the stout itself. Nothing wrong with that-but I prefer more balance. Its a decent, above average brew overall. 855 charactersPittBeerGirl, May 24, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured in a big wine glass at 57F.
Almost a true black, and quite opaque. Small tan head quickly subsides to a ring of froth. Delicate smattering of lace.
Aroma like molasses cookie dough, floating in some red wine and vanilla-y oaky bourbon. Deep, dark, sweet, chewy, heady. Quite alluring.
Huge molasses-chocolate flavor up front, very tasty, with some complex coffee notes coming in, and underlying bourbon that gradually grows but never dominates. Flashes of red wine, more subtle than in the aroma. Long finish, coffee-chocolate-bourbon-molasses, with some slight burnt bitterness. Cohesive and very tasty.
Smooth medium-full body, with the extreme tininess of the bubbles ratcheting up the richness. A pleasure to drink. 730 charactersBeerzebub, May 24, 2010

Fairly hard pour yields an almost 2 finger mocha head that fades to a soapy looking cap of foam. Nice lacing left behind, and some oily legs.
The nose on this evokes raisin pudding, chocolate fudge, cocoa nibs, a bit of plumb, and a roasted malt characteristic reminiscent of espresso. There is also caramel, vanilla, and bourbon. Whiffs of alcohol.
The taste is of raisins/raisin pudding, bitter dark chocolate, chocolate fudge, pecan or praline nuttiness, caramel, and english toffee. Some peat, roasted espresso, vanilla and bourbon flavor finish and linger. Wonderfully complex without being too sweet, and sporting a nice bitterness to balance things out. Everything you would want from a barrel aged imperial stout.
Thick and full bodied. A bit syrupy, and sticky. Coats the mouth. On the lower end of medium carbonation, but still quite creamy. Very smooth, and almost no trace of heat. A tiny bite on the end.
The drinkability is pretty unreal for 13% abv. Ridiculous how little heat this beer has. Definitely alcohol present, but well hidden. 
Firestone Walker knocked this one out of the park. You can tell the influence this beer had on Firestone Walker 13. 1,256 charactersbillshmeinke, May 24, 2010

Parabola pours a wall-to-wall black with a great brown head, thick and creamy. The aroma is complex and wonderful. Bourbon and oak are probably the strongest notes, but they don't dominate quite as much as in Parabola. There's a ton of dark chocolate, a healthy dose of roasted malt and a touch of vanilla. Brown sugar, molasses and caramel round it out. The flavor is all barrel-aged imperial stout goodness. All of those roasty sugars did their magic in the barrel, changing and blending with the barrel notes. It's not exactly sweet, but there are plenty of sugars present. There's definitely no unpleasant cloying sensation, despite its viscous feel. The finish gives a mild hop bite. This is a wonderful imperial stout. 834 characterspopery, May 23, 2010

M-the body is huge, thick, soft and and velvety. carbonation holds the body, a little chalky in the feel with a good bitey finish.

4.53/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap near me. Finally. 
Pours black. Completely opaque. Sucks light from the surrounding area. Dark brown crust and foam that quickly dies down to edging. Just light swirls of foam coats the brew's top. 
Smells, oddly enough, somewhat muted. Hmm.. Some roasted malt, a bit of dark chocolate, more roastiness ... not exactly an aroma bomb.
Taste is much more robust. Superlative, in fact. Layered bourbon with dark and milk chocolate, some roasted cocoa, a ton of vanilla (yum), some bitter aftertaste that's almost like burnt coffee or maybe some sort of hops. 
Mouthfeel is awesome. Just pure viscous velvet. One of the best I can recall. 645 charactersOverlord, May 21, 2010
3.95/5  rDev -13%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5On-tap for the bottle release (kind of ironic) at the Goat. 
Appearance- Black. About a quarter inch of dark brown, mocha head. Settles into a ring. No lacing to speak of. 
Smell- Subdued. Roast. Coffee grounds. Some burnt char. As well as some bittersweet chocolate. Toffee.
Taste- Roastiness. It's pretty hot, could certainly use some time to mellow out. Hint of sweet cherry but it's lost behind that roast. Oak and lots of char, like the barrel it was aged in was burned. Similar to the 13th Anniversary, for obvious reasons, but it's less sweet/balanced. There's a reason that beer is blended, because by itself the Parabola is a little intense. Bitter chocolate lingers. 
Mouthfeel- Silky smooth. Coats the tongue beautifully. The best part of this beer for sure. 
Drinkability- The first third of the pour was very pleasant, but it became a chore to finish. Probably took about 45 minutes. It was quite intense. It tasted like burning. The alcohol really kicks you in the teeth.
This beer needs some time to mellow out. It's pretty hot right now, and the roast is intense. I'd love some more bourbon or vanilla or something to even things out. Basically, I want it to be 13, which it isn't. On it's own it's a good beer, but I just know how much better it could be. 1,278 characterscallmescraps, May 20, 2010

A: Pours near-black with a nice tan head that sticks around with a bit of lacing. 
S: Very, very nice. The first thing I notice is quite a bit of oak alongside some vanilla and bits of char. In the background there are notes of chocolate and roasted coffee.
T: Much the same as the nose, but the roasted malt and oak take over a little bit, not allowing many of the subtle complexities to come through. It is very clear that this played a big role in the final FW13 blend.
M: Nice and creamy. Medium to full body.
D: Quite drinkable, although I really wish that the flavor profile was as well-integrated and complex as the nose. I'm definitely looking forward to trying this with a bit of age on it. 753 charactersThorpe429, May 18, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the Firestone taproom in Paso Robles, May, 2010. 4oz tasting snifter (several of them).
A - Good two finger head, mocha in color, medium bubbles. The folks at the taproom know how to pour a beer. Very dark, as expected. Just a bit of light around the edges, coffee colored, of course. Decent lacing down the glass -- patchy, no rings. Nice looking beer.
S - Oh my! This is why I drove all the way down here. Strong french roast coffee and dark chocolate in the aroma. More of the coffee as you go along, with the bitterness fading toward the end. Excellent.
T - WOW. This is hard to drink slowly. The coffee is more forward, just how I like it. The sweetness is there in decent amounts, like a chocolate dessert, but the dryness keeps it from being overbearing the some stouts are. I didn't get a whole lot of barrel or bourbon in this, only hints of them, but that didn't hurt it at all. Everything seemed just right. I would have loved to try this with a food pairing, but no luck. Delicious. 
M - Velvety. Definitely full bodied, and coats the mouth but then gets out of the way. Carbonation seems just right. 
D - Unbelievable that this is 13%. I had four 4oz snifters, and while I definitely felt it, it was all I could do to not just sit and keep ordering more. If I hadn't had to drive two hours to get home, I probably would have. (Edit: just read some of the other reviews, and realized that others said almost the same thing. Nice to know I wasn't the only one.)
Overall -- I want to go back to try it again to be sure, but right now I'm about ready to say that this is the best stout that I've tried to date. Absolutely fantastic. 1,657 charactersdjmichaelk, May 16, 2010
3.97/5  rDev -12.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A fine stout, a good showing from the boys in cali. The roast is big, the fruits present, it feels lacking though. I want more vanilla, more licorice, more fire. Stupidly smooth for such a virginal imperial stout, take that as a positive or negative or moot point from whatever your vantage. 
I think my hesitation with this beer is the lack of identity. Its like so many other RISs, its just a fairly smooth one. A fine showing, but not one I would put in a fancy box and charge too much for. 
I like it, I like it a lot in fact, I just would rather have an abyss. 567 charactersolympuszymurgus, May 11, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Following review (written by Nick) based on notes from Saturday, April 3, 2010. Sampled at the Firestone Walker Brewery in Paso Robles, CA.
Served in a 5oz. snifter.
Appearance: A tall, brown, foamy, head emerges from a syrupy, pitch black body (looked like chocolate syrup coming out of the tap). Absolutely no light penetrates the thick, oily, body. Head retains nicely, but loses some of its color with time. Light, sudsy lacing. (4.5)
Smell: Huge toffee, chocolate cake/fudge, and bourbon. Wow! Charred oak, dark chocolate, and loads of malt add to the mix. Absolutely massive! The bourbon burn grows stronger as the beer warms, but never to a point where it's offensive. This would pair fantastically with a rich desert or cigar. I love it! (5.0)
Taste: Lots of dark chocolate, accompanied by bourbon, chocolate mousse, vanilla, and roasted malt. The bourbon is really assertive, and the roasted malt produces some solid bitterness, too. Extremely rich and cake-y. (4.5)
Mouthfeel: I struggled scoring this one; if allowable, I'd give it a 4.25. I love the robust, malty body, but the bourbon burn is pretty harsh. Not as syrupy as expected. Very heavy, warm, and dry. (4.25)
Drinkability: Addictive. I ordered three snifters back-to-back-to-back, and would have kept it going if my ride didn't have to leave. The burn is completely tolerable with all of the other flavors and aromas coming out of this beer. What a beauty! Can't wait til it's bottled! (4.5)
Overall Score from Wiseman Nick: A+ (4.58)
///
The following review is written by Wiseman Justin. He (I) sampled it earlier today (04-14-2010) Following review written from notes. It was hard to average these two reviews due to the disparity however I know Wiseman Nick wouldn't give out a 5 on smell haphazardly as such I did not average out the scores for smell.
Served in a snifter.
Appearance: Dark with a tight head. Looks like an exemplar of it's style. Nothing flashy going on. Very light lacing and very little head. 4.0
Smell: I get bourbon and some slight ash/smoke. Slight chocolate. Somewhat boring actually. 3.5
Taste: Taste a lot like a barleywine. The alcohol is very prevalent; chocolate is there along with bourbon and a slight burnt aftertaste. 3.75
Mouthfeel: Slick and slimy. I guess it 'feels' more like a barleywine then it 'tastes' like one. Although this is not necessarily a bad thing at all. 4.0

A: I really shouldn't even rate (I mean review) the appearance because the lighting is dim in Spuyten. Poured black with a beige head with big bubbles and swirls throughout. Good lacing too.
S: Wow! Vanilla, oak, maple leaf, faint rum aroma, and most of all ooey gooey caramel - sort of like a Caramello bar.
T: Bittersweet chocolate layered with oaky and vanilla flavors, a caramel filling, and a coffee finish. The taste gets dramatically better as the beers warms up.
M: Silky smooth. I would even go as far to say this was luxurious or elegant.
D: There's no way this is 13%! Not a hint of booze until its already down warming your chest.
What a treat! Thanks to the guys at Spuyten Duyvil! 753 charactershoppymcgee, Mar 24, 2010
4.75/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at The Stone Brewing Bistro & World Gardens on 11/13/09 during their Firestone Walker 13th on the 13th event. Served in a snifter.
Pours an inpenetrable dense black, with a 1/2 finger mix of reddish burnt and chocolately brown head. The retention on this is VERY rich, on the edges, with some thinner wisps in the center, leaving a strong latticework of heavy spotty lacing and brown gooey residue behind. Bourbon, vanilla, and oaky tannins jump out of the aroma at me first. This in no way overruns the nose, as a velvety smooth layer dwells underneath the barrel character, just dripping notes of chocolate syrup, molasses, roasted coffee, flaked oats, licorice, and coconut. Some alcohol hangs heavy with a pang of warmth in the nose, but it never does get overly intrusive or stinging. 
The taste starts out with a rich & thick base of dark gooey chocolate, which the other flavors then seem to quickly gather around. Roast, coffee, vanilla, chewy oats, licorice, dark cherries, and finally shredded roasted coconut (which really puts this over the top), all wrap around that big chocolate sweetness, making for about as decadent of a flavor profile as I could hope for or want from this. Bourbon is flavorful (char and molasses are poking out at me) yet it is still fairly restrained in the finish, along with that every present slick woody character. It is just so WELL balanced in here with the other flavors, with the majority of the barrel coming out with a dry flush in the backend of the profile. The mouthfeel is full bodied, with a huge creaminess to it from the oats. That powerful ABV is present (you can literally feel it raging underneath each sip) but the flavors are so equally mammouth here, it just perfectly masks any actual alcohol taste. It pretty much just leaves a slight haze on the breath, with much of any alcohol flavor coming from the bourbon and not the ABV. 
Wow, the flavor and complexity of this was just outrageous and it's no wonder that the Anniversary blends are always so awesome with this being a big part of each one. This is one of the finest barrel-aged Stouts I've that I've had this year and I personally think that this is a bit underrated on here. Just fantastic stuff all around! 2,238 charactersKegatron, Dec 14, 2009

The colour was black with some caramel coloured edges. The aroma was brimming with toffee, dark chocolate and burnt caramel. On the palate, there was little CO2, but no matter as there was such a viscous character that CO2 seemed trivial. Loads of dark chocolate, coffee, treacle, toffee, caramel, molasses and I think a hint of lust and greed just for good measure. 440 charactersslaintemhor, Dec 01, 2009

A - Pitch black and viscous with no head to speak of.
S - Aroma is roast, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and wood. Not too much bourbon.
T - Flavor is intense, awesome, and fairly sweet, with roasted malt, coffee, rich chocolate cake, hints of dark fruit, bourbon, oak, and vanilla. Nicely balanced. This is, as I would have said 10 years ago in my awkward youth, "the bomb diggity."
M - Mouthfeel is smooth, slick, and viscous with low carbonation.
D - Good for a -bal aged imperial stout. 573 charactersnickd717, Oct 19, 2009

A: Dark as night and wonderful viscosity to it. No head and no visible carbonation.
S: Vanilla, chocolate, licorice, some graham cracker, and slight booze.
T: A truly amazing beer. Very smooth vanilla flavor from the barrel, lots of chocolate, and some graham cracker. The booze is very well hidden in this monster, as well.
M: Huge body, velvety smooth.
D: I was expecting this one to be really overwhelming, but it wasn't at all. A fantastic beer, one that I wish I could have more often, and I actually ended up buying two glasses of it today. 592 characterswomencantsail, Aug 09, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Recently enjoyed this on tap at Tornado with abfraser.
A: A great looking stout with a small mocha colored head which recedes to lacing that lasts to the bottom of the glass. Pretty much black - no light getting through this one.
S: Fantastic smell - getting a load of candied sugar, chocolate, actually smells somewhat like an almond joy bar put into a blender and mixed with coffee and bourbon. The alcohol smacks you in the face with this one - you can tell it's a bit hot.
T: Taste follows the smell and the alcohol is again very apparent. Has a strong kick at the beginning followed by a rich, chocolaty mocha aftermath. There is a bit of a bite on the tail end with the higher abv warming its way into your stomach. Given that this is the base beer for the 12th anniversary blend the two are very similar.
M: Great creamy texture with good level of carbonation - not too thick but coats the mouth and leaves a bit of coffee aftertaste on the palate.
D: I'd love to put back this stuff all day but with the high octane it will put you on your ass. The only detriment and one thing that could improve it just a bit is to dial back some of the heat. One of the best imperial stouts out there.
Overall an awesome brew that I'm glad to have had the chance to try. 1,273 charactersJoeySchlitz, Jul 18, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Draught at The Blue Palms. Black with a small tan head. Smooth deeply roasted malt and bourbon aroma. The flavor is an integrated blend of dark chocolate cake, caramel, vanilla, and light bourbon. The wood shows lightly but the overall barrel character is very integrated into the whole presentation of the beer, and the heat from the bourbon doesn't approach the richness of the malt. Thick with a silky texture. Probably the best bourbon-aged stout that I've had. The aging adds lots of complexity without drowning out the base beer. Firestone Walker needs to quite wasting all of this in the anniversary blends and bottle it as a separate release. 650 charactersbulletrain76, Jun 10, 2009

Poured black with a light brown head that dissipated quickly, but expected given the ABV. Aromas were rich with hints of roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, coffee, bourbon, booze, vanilla, oak. Tastes were full and rich also - bold roasted malts, dark chocolate sweetness that lingers with notes of coffee, anise, bourbon, vanilla, oak, toasty grain. Mouth-feel was thick, smooth, and creamy - excellent! Finished with a hint of pepper as the dark chocolate lingers on the palate with the bourbon and vanilla. I had no clue this was 13% ABV while drinking it, and would recommend this to anyone who can get their hands on it! Excellent treat to have this one on tap! 800 charactersbarnzy78, Jun 06, 2009

The beer was a dark coal black with a dense brown head.
The aroma of the beer was of roated coffee, intense malt, licorice, chocolate, vanilla, and alcohol.
The flavor of the beer was intesely malty. Chocolate, coffee, chewy malt, and notes of licorice made up the bulk of the flavor. The bourbon notes peaked through with some vanilla and oak accents. The hops hit towards the finish and helped balance out some of the sweetness of the beer.
The carbonation was soft and complimented the flavors well. The slightly viscous mouthfeel was not quite as heavy as I would have expected for a beer this beer. This beer coated your mouth with intense flavors that seamlessly cascaded from one to the other. The 13% alcohol was very well hidden.
This is a wonderful beer with tremendous complexity. Enjoyed best over an hour's period to allow it to warm and transition through a myriad of rich flavors. Very drinkable for such a big beer. I had no trouble enjoying a full-sized glass. 1,007 charactersSacoDeToro, Jan 21, 2009

Presentation- Via the tap into small taster glasses.
Appearance- Pitch black in color. Drity white slight creamy head. Left behind sticky patches of lace.
Smell- Rich in roasted caramel, bittersweet chocolate and mild coffee notes. Light fusel alcohol notes.
Taste- A mixture of everything. Mild bitter hops, medium dark chocolate with a nice dash of sweetness, slight grain flavor noted...vanilla oaky barrel taste, nice bourbon barrel base. Coffee is there, but toward the back because of all the other flavors. Even some booze soaked dates.
Mouthfeel- Thick, viscous, creamy, but with all that a higher rate of carbonation. 
Drinkability- I could easliy buy this if it came out in bottles. A 12oz bottle would be sufficient. 824 charactersGClarkage, Nov 17, 2008

Pours deadly black with tan head. Aroma is initially very bourbon dominated, with some roasty quality breaking through. Flavor is more roasty than the aroma, but still takes a back seat to the bourbon and vanilla notes. Hints of chocolate and oak and a slight tannic bite in the finish.
Very good, though a bit more harsh than expected, but it was very cool tasting another component of the anniversary ales as a stand alone offering. 494 charactersBrewMonkey, Nov 16, 2008
4.82/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5"Sampled" this at the Sixth Annual Festival of Wood and Barrel Aged Beers. I say sampled because I used 3-4 tickets on this stuff. Was "Best of Show" for me. Drank out of my mini little pint glass.
Appearance- Pours a super dark brownish black with some really dark brown hues around the edges of the glass where light is able to faintly penetrate. Fairly nice half finger tan head forms but recedes pretty quickly leaving almost no cap and ultra thin collar. Negative on much lacing.
Smell- Powerful stuff. Loads of spicy whiskey and vanilla that reminds me a lot of Bourbon County Stout from the start. Very roasted with intensely sweet fumes of molasses, caramel, dark brown sugar and even some black licorice for good measure. The usual suspects of dark chocolate and French roasted coffee are present as well as some alcohol vapors.
Taste- Just as intense! Starts with an intense oaky vanilla kick before it slowly melds to a very chocolaty tootsie roll like middle. Lightly sweet with a bit of caramel and burnt sugars. A bit of bitterness does sneak in toward the finish though and I'm assuming that's more from the roasted grains than any real hop presence. Woody and almost spicy at times, overall the bourbon is king in here. A dark fruitiness creeps in as the beer warms but nothing to over-the-top.
Mouthfeel- Fairly heavy body with very low carbonation that adds a very slick, creamy feel. Spicy and fairly warming from the alcohol.
Drinkability- This was my favorite beer of the show. It was the first beer I tried when I walked in. After trying Erik's Ale next, I went straight back to Parabola. The whole thing really reminds me of BCS with how intense the bourbon is but with a spicy kick. Fantastic beer that I kicked myself in the ass for not trying at DLD and am really glad I got to try it now. 1,816 charactersyounger35, Nov 11, 2008

A - Pitch black, with a healthy amount of head and light carbonation. Very ominous looking brew.
S - This one took a while to warm up - but when it did, wow! Molasses, rye & bourbon whiskey, marzipan, toffee, and oak. A really distinct and unusual collection of flavors.
T - Really hits you with the wood & whiskey on the front palate, then rewards you with a little sweetness at the back. Pretty potent.
M - Creamy, but not as viscous a I expected. I couldn't think of much else to say - a little generic.
D - The strong whiskey aftertaste would pretty much limit me to one of these in an evening.

4.75/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A snifter of the very first pour from a freshly tapped keg. On-tap at the brewery in Paso Robles, August 2008. 
What I couldn't be sure was the darkest shade of black I'd ever seen in a beer, could still certainly be considered among them. Although opaque and certainly dark it could not conceal its sleek luster. Its head - remarkably in good standing for a beer this strength - was mocha late brown. The streamlining of lace was exceptional.
Your mind can be swayed just about any which way with an aroma like this. The smell was paradoxically sweet and bitter with forcible notes of anise, oak, vanilla, tannins, and dark berries. It offers every enticement for you to just keep your nose fixed right there. 
Its very initial impressions on the palate are boozy and sweet and have the mark of a port or sherry. It is robust with fruity esters and flavours of red grapes, dark berries, and the remnants of rich fortified wine. But this is not even half the story. 
Once settled into the back of the mouth, your tongue will pick up on an entirely different cast of flavours. Here anise spice, black licorice, bittersweet chocolate, dark caramel, and soft fudge set in. The oak becomes buttery and vanilla is introduced. 
With swallowing, the whole package - tannic red wine, aged sherry, chocolate fudge and vanilla scented oak - coat the palate with a bittersweet glaze and then gracefully pass down the throat as one. It may be hard to believe but the texture is almost creamy, like a freshly whipped mousse. 
There's really no way around the high gravity. Thirteen is a lot of percentage to hide even for a beer with this much taste. To get around it, however, the blending and barrel aging have integrated the alcohol amongst the flavours and proportioned just the right amount of heat to each mouthful. Besides, sipping is only appropriate for a beer this rich. 
What can be said of this creation? It was outstanding. Like the Firestone 10 and 11, it is the result of skilled blending and masterful craftsmanship. Consider brewing and blending as an art - this is certainly one of its masterpieces. 2,111 charactersbiegaman, Oct 09, 2008

Thanks to Beechwood for providing this stellar beer! 
A- Black as night with a two finger tan head. I don't normally comment on lacing, but this was unusually relevant to this beer. In fact, the beer itself clung to the glass like a swirlled cognac. 
S- Bourbon, some licorice and dark carmel.
T- Same as smell, only much sweeter. Had with a bread pudding with cherry's and chocolate and was almost overwhelmed by it all in my mouth at one time.
M- Unbelievable. If every beer had a mouth feel like this, I would not need solid foods!
D- As odd as this may sound after my mouthfeel notes, this took a while just to drink through my 8 oz glass. Maybe it was the level of alchohol or maybe the overall richness, but there is no way that I could have had a second one of these on the same night. 828 charactersopwog, Sep 20, 2008

S: Get a lot of bourbon notes mixed with some coffee and booze, ethanol volatiles are there that you can feel in the nose.
T: Reminds me of Firestone 11 right of the bat with its initial taste which was full of vanilla. But then the beer changes and shows that it was only a small part of that beer. Major chocolate and coffee notes, definite espresso with a soothing alcohol presence, very tasty stout.
M: Velvety smooth and thick, what you'd expect from a 13% stout, pretty much picture perfect, very full-bodied.
D: This is an outstanding beer from Firestone and I was suprised how fast I finished the glass. Not as good as the blend of Firestone 11, but this is great in its own right, glad I finally got to try it; I definitely want to have it again while it is still out. 930 charactersHalcyondays, Sep 19, 2008

Pours an insanely dark and evil looking black, very inky, no light gets through this one, very thick brown head forms, drops an insane amount of lacing, perfect retention, thick layer and ring until the glass is empty. This is about as perfect as a stout looks. Smell is insane as well, oak, toffee, chocolate, lots of licorice, molasses, vanilla, brown sugar, very caramelized, alcohol, big hit of roast, very complex and layered, dark fruits up the ass, figs, it goes on and on. Taste is oaky vanilla up front, nice wood character, brown sugar, chocolate milk, roast, alcohol, licorice, molasses, some fruit, more roast, nice balanced roasty bitterness in the finish, this stuff is dangerous.

In the subdued light of the bar, this beer looks utterly black. A substantial three-finger tan head forms during the pour, but it reduces to a foam skin with clingy lacing soon enough.
Aroma is an outstanding, mouth-watering mixture of bourbon, dark roasted malts and sweet chocolate.
Smoooth as it enters the mouth, caressing the tongue with a complex mixture of red wine, bourbon, chocolate, dark malts, restrained alcohol and mild bitterness on the finish. It's a big beer, but the ABV is several percentage points higher than it drinks.

Thick and creamy with a wonderful hop punch in the middle that leaves things spicey. Jesus this beer is delicious.

Thick with black fruits, mollasess, dark chocolates, black cherry, earthy hops, toasty vanilla oak, hints of bourbon, and a bit of dried dates. Delicious. 761 charactersmcallister, Apr 28, 2008
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On draft at O'Brien's for the CBC/WBC
Appearance is a dense and dark brown hue, thick brown pillowy head, thick lacing on the glass
Smell is a delicious and complex range of aromas: bourbon whiskey, oak, vanilla, cherries, chocolate and coffee malts, sweet milk, brown sugar/molasses
Taste is initially smooth milk chocolate malts that transition quickly to boozy whiskey and wood, tones of vanilla and dark fruits, opens up to grainy oatmeal malts, finishes sweet and dry
Mouthfeel is full-bodied, creamy smooth texture is very pleasing and well-crafted, moderate carbonation
Drinkability is high, delicious and well-balanced barrel-aged stout, great malt profile and creamy texture, good oak presence that accents without dominating, sweetness fluctuates between milk chocolate and dark fruits, absolutely a wonderful beer and a must-try for any beer fan! 862 charactersStoneman78, Apr 19, 2008
