Aroma is an intense concentration of lactic acid, funk, shoe leather, and rubber. Very acidic smelling. I couldn’t say specifically that I get cherries, but a pleasant tart berry character does come into the aroma. It is masked by the intense funk, which is to be expected after two years barrel aging and three years bottle conditioning. I do get a touch of oak and a bourbon-like sweetness that transitions into a bit of alcohol on the finish. 
Taste is a delicious and forward sour. High levels of lactic acid, but the sourness is not so extreme it ruins the beer. The sourness is akin to that of pure lemon juice; it dries the mouth out. Red wine and oak notes are more prevalent than the bourbon in regards to the barrel character as the beer warms. Bourbon is more identifiable when the beer is a bit chilled. More of the leather and rubber character. Tart cherries and sour raspberries are identifiable in the fruited spectrum. Mid-sip a sweetness does emerge, which could be the Bing cherries or perhaps the bourbon. Truthfully, each sip is unique. 
Colder, the beer has many flavor profiles that remind me of Russian River consecration but with a more intense flavor and more bourbon influence. However, as the beer warms, it transitions into something totally different, making it hard to review. I must address price. This beer is expensive (33$), so I must review it as such. I think the beer is overpriced by about 10$; I value it in the low 20 dollar range. I understand the time and cost associated, but this is just my opinion on overall value. It is an excellent sour without a doubt. This beer should be paired with food due to its potency. However, the food should be an accompaniment not something that overshadows the beer. A simple pan seared filet or even oven roasted pork chop would work excellent. It gets a 93/100. 1,984 charactersDaverCS, Apr 19, 2017

4.38/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25759 ml bottle into a tulip glass.  2014 edition, had 11/12/16, a few days after purchasing.
Pours a deep ruby, somewhat opaque, with a half inch head and some loose lacing.  A thin ring of foam follows down the glass.  The smell is sour, tart, cherries, some wine, some malt and yeast. light plums.  The taste has a good amount of tartness, some sourness, cherries, malt, wine- more as it warms, oak, light bourbon, plums, purple grapes.  Smooth, pretty full bodied for the style, well carbonated.
Great flavor, deep and layered.  The cherries are prominent, there's a good amount of wine barrel, but not much bourbon barrel.  Loved this, but was not as blown away as I expected.  It has a really high price point, so, alas, this will probably be my only purchase.  You should definitely try this one, though. 811 charactersstortore, Feb 19, 2017
4.41/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52014 project.  I think I got this as a gift from my brother in law. This is the first higher-strength beer I've ever had from Cascade, whose brews are always good but never quite so good as to warrant their price.
Cork comes out very easily and the beer pours with precious little carbonation.   Pours very dark and still, resembling a flat oud bruin. 
Smells tart and bourbony, with bacterial sour cherry nodes smoothed out by oaky vanilla.  Not picking up anything vinous, but overall it's a nice aroma with great balance and decent complexity.
The flavor is more complex, and rather more tart.  Bracingly acidic yeast starts things out, which is still a bit of a kick in the teeth even after 2+ years of aging.  The middle is fruitier, with strong notes of sour fruit and lively red wine.  The vanilla oakiness of the aroma is only present here at  the very end of the sip and in the aftertaste, with the finish serving as a firm, if indirect, balance to the bracing start.
Overall, a beer of high character and complexity.  One of the better truly puckerking sours I've come across in quite some time. 1,109 charactersmynie, Feb 17, 2017

No bottling date, but bought in late 2016
Appearance- Pours a deep dark mahogany color, ruby red highlights, fairly transparent when held to light. Finger thick, soapy, off-white colored head. Small amount of spotty head lacing on glass.
Aroma- Tart cherries, blackberries, grapeskins, mildly sour fruit notes. Soft oak, earthy and funky, vinous wine notes. Very mild bourbon notes and some hints of vanilla. 
Taste- Juicy, tart cherries, berries, sour fruits. Rich malty and fruity sweetness balances tartness. Vinous, red wine notes, oaky, earthy. Soft, sweet bourbon, vanilla. Finishes w/ slight acidity and crisp tart fruitiness.
Feel- Medium bodied, crisp tartness but not overly sour, has a balancing sweetness throughout. Crisp, clean carbonation, palate cleansing.
Overall- Beer shows such a bold tartness and sweetness, yet excellently balanced and restrained. Wine and bourbon barrels come through with such a soft touch, neither overpowering eachother or the beer, but adding such depth and complexity. An excellently crafted beer. 1,060 charactersOrangeMen, Dec 03, 2016

A: The beer is hazy dark mahogany red in color.  It poured with a dense off white collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Light aromas of wine, bourbon, and cherries are present in the nose.
T: The taste has favors of Bing cherries along with notes of white wine and hints of bourbon.
M: It feels light- to medium-bodied and a little tart on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This isn't nearly as sour and tart compared to most of the other beers from the brewery and has more of a balance between all of the flavors. It hides its alcohol very well.
Note: 2015 vintage

4/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle: Poured a deep red color ale with a nice large pink foamy head with OK retention and minimal lacing. Aroma of intense cherry notes with plenty of oak and tart/acidic notes are also discernable. Taste is also a mix of oak and tart cherry notes with very little residual sugar notes, some acidic flavours are also perceptible. Body si full for style with good carbonation. Very enjoyable take of the style but I would prefer a bit less acidity. 449 charactersPhyl21ca, Aug 29, 2016

S: Lots of cherry and oak initially. I got hints of the bourbon and vinous wine notes with some lighter tart notes. Very lightly sweet as well, most likely from the vanilla notes from the bourbon barrels
T: Starts off with some moderate tartness that is balanced out by the oak bourbon and cherries. This is absolutely magnificent to drink. Each sip left me wanting more. 
M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation
O: A very complex and intricate beer that touches on everything the label states. Subtle bourbon and oaky notes finish with cherries and tartness. Absolutely fantastic and one of those beer that I'll remember the experience for quite some time. 742 charactersRAlmeida77, Aug 02, 2016

Deep vinous red color, with purple and brown hues. Nose has a strong fruit bouquet with soft oaky back notes. Dark fruits abound. Blackberry, black currant, plenty of sour cherries. No booziness left at all. Oak has softened into a slight undercurrent, adding a bit of complexity and just a hair of tannic dryness. Red wine vinegar. Fat malt body is substantial and chewy. A real wonder with age. 484 charactersryan1788a5, Jul 31, 2016
4.3/5  rDev -2.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Quite dark for a wild ale. Smells fairly strongly of booziness. The taste is quite sour but has a nice blend of the bourbon and wine, although too much bourbon for my taste. The feel is a bit too thick and even sticky. The main problem is the taste is quite overwhelming so a bottle should be split among several people - very much a sipper. Still, an interesting wild ale, especially if you really like the style. 414 characters_RL_, Jul 29, 2016

4.52/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52012 Project bottle into a big red wine glass.
Appearance is reddish brown with a light head that quickly dissipates.  The aroma is cherry, sour, and a bit of the whiskey barrel.
The taste is amazing, and I doubt I'm up to fully describing it.  It's tart and it's got the cherries.  Both the wine barrel and the bourbon barrel come through, neither one dominating.  It's not sweet, but there's just enough sweetness to keep this from being a pucker-fest.  The bourbon influence is there, like a bass line in a rock song ... it makes its presence felt, but in the background, not the foreground.  The pinot noir barrels keep this from being a bourbon heavy brew.  Great blend of flavors, and a remarkable beer.
I can't remember what I paid for this (at the brewery, several months ago), but this is totally worth it.  Next time I'm in Portland, I'm looking for more. 868 charactersVashonGuy, Jul 18, 2016

A- Auburn liquid with a light khaki head. Streaks of film and lace. 4.75
S- Smells like tart cherries with hints of dark malt. Bold cherry is cool. 4.25
T- Sour/tart pulpy cherries. Caramelized sugar and bready, almost chocolatey malts. Hints of vanilla and truly an orchard type of funk. 4.25
M- Tart approaching aggressively sour, but never hits that enamel-peeling quality. Some prickliness and almost vinegar qualities before a dry and vinous finish. 4
Something I've wanted to try for ages. A $13 pour still seems better than a $40 bottle. Good stuff. 593 charactersONovoMexicano, Jul 09, 2016
4.1/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4On tap at the Cascade brewpub: 2014 version at 9.8% ABV in July 2016. 
Sour aroma with sour cherries and vague dark dried fruits. Nice complexity. 
Lovely dark ruby body with a lasting off-white head that leaves a draping of sticky lacing on the snifter. 
Moderate tartness. More cherry in the taste than the aroma.
 Overall: excellent version of the style. 358 characterschinchill, Jul 06, 2016

4.46/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a nice and interestingly colored head that dissipates quickly. The head seems to have a tan with purple hue, which is pretty interesting and unique. The beer itself is beautiful and strongly resembles a nice pinot with its brown and purple hues. The beer is obviously hard to see through because of the coloring but the texture is pretty nice.
The smell and taste are both fantastic. The smell and taste both contain a nice dose of dark cherry tart, pinot noir berry fruitiness, and a bit of whiskey. The pinot noir note seems to come out more in the smell while sacrificing the whiskey; unlike the taste, where the whiskey is a bit stronger but still gets lost in the dark cherry notes. The dark cherry notes dominate the taste along with the tartness and is supplemented by the barrel aging.
The feel is pretty good. It's a lighter bodied beer but it has a bit of heft to it that gives it a nice smooth body and keeps it from being watery. The strong tingling carbonation is nice and actually makes the tartness easier to tolerate.
Overall, this is a pretty good beer worth getting even if it is a little pricey. While the tart notes are a bit stronger than the other beers from this brewery, it is still an easy to drink beer. Go for it. 1,258 charactersHattedClassic, Jul 04, 2016

S: Lots of cherry and oak up front, with hints of the bourbon and vinous wine notes. Some lighter tart notes. Very lightly sweet as well, most likely from the vanilla notes from the bourbon barrels
T: Starts off with some moderate tart notes that are held in check by the firm oaky notes and sweet cherries. Some bourbon, vanilla, and grape notes pop up shortly after the tartness. Tannins and vinous notes show up next, followed by moderate alcoholic esters. Finishes with lingering tartness and oak notes
M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation
O: An extremely complex and intricate beer that really touches on all aspects. Cherries, bourbon, vinous wine notes, and oak really all stand out and show off in their own ways. This is a beer you need to check out, even with the price tag, especially if you're into sours 912 charactersBEERMILER12, Jul 04, 2016

A well-balanced and enjoyable sipper that lived up to the hype and was a pleasure to imbibe by this admittedly not "much of a sour guy" guy. 442 charactersclayrock81, Jun 22, 2016

Pours a rich, dark garnet. One finger of head immediately dissipates to just a light ring.
Aroma has a bit of horsey funk, straw, dank wood and cherry
Flavor is amazing cherry, earth, old oak, plum and tartness. Barrel does not over power the fruit and yeast notes, wine more noticeable than bourbon. The fairly high abv entirely masked.
Moderate body with slight astringency.
I've liked every thing I've tried from Cascade, but Sang Noir is a cut above the rest. Complex and subtle barrel elements light up the wonderful tartness and cherry. Color is exquisite. Drinks a per cent or two lower than the abv actually is, so be careful. 674 charactersryannosaurus, Apr 23, 2016

Although there is no head, the beer aged in wine and bourbon barrels for two years with cherries is utterly amazing. Please grab a bottle if available in your area. It is a dark red-purple, plum color that tastes of a general cherry pie tartness and sourness. Give it a shot. 343 charactersTrevor11, Feb 26, 2016

Taste leans more towards their fruitier beers.  More sour and fruit than bourbon and oak.  Its still there, its a complex beer even though Cascade's sours have all had that similar lacto clean sour profile.  This is a real good beer and one of the best in the Cascade profile, if you liked vlad but want it less boozy and more fruity and sour, this is your jam. 508 charactersrodbeermunch, Jan 09, 2016

Complex and appealing from the beginning as a dark Belgian like sour...but then it begins to open up in the glass as the air hits it...and explodes as it warms a bit to release all the buried flavors temporarily hidden by the chill. There are so many flavors here that both leap away from the whole but also never fail to compliment the whole. This beer really needs to sit a bit in a big snifter or chalice style glass to really reveal itself. The experience is way more than worth the wait. 583 charactersBillRoth, Jan 01, 2016

Pours a muddy cherrywood tinged dull brown. Opaque other than some rosey highlights at the edges when viewed under the light. The finger and a half frothy, khaki head gradually fades to a milky haze and full collar that leaves a couple huge clouds of lace. Muddy as hell but strangely attractive. 
Vibrant, robustly sour aroma. Sour cherry, barrel funk, wine, strong vinegar, earthy, caramel, wood shavings and some vague tart fruit. I can tell this will be quite a ride. 
Flavors are an intense mixture of sweet and sour. Tart cherries, barrel funk, wine, raisin bread, soft bourbon, lemonade, near puckering lacto, earthy, funky, caramel and brown sugar. I think there's a bit of alcohol but the sour is so potent that it is difficult to tell. This is a boldly tasty flavor trip with tart cherries and funky barrel notes in the drivers seat. 
Full, creamy feel with pleasingly faint carbonation. Funky notes of wine barrel and sour cherries linger in the long aftertaste. 
Welcome to Georgia, Cascade! Sang Noir is a rather beastly sour and I dig it. It is so much fuller than most wild ales I've had and has a sweetness that may not balance the sourness but sure gives it a nice counterpoint. Arguably a bit pricey but I enjoyed the experience and will be trying more from Cascade. 1,413 charactersThickNStout, Nov 08, 2015

Pleasantly tart in the flavor. Taste mirrors the aroma, with a hint of vanilla, I’m assuming from the whiskey barrels. 208 characterspfcorsar, Oct 27, 2015

A: Malts mixed with vinous qualities and slightly oaky make for an almost woody vinegar aroma. 
A: Deep brown and totally opaque with just a touch of head.
T: Lots of vinous flavors from the wine barrel, a tad woody mixed with cherries. Slight soy sauce presence as from autolyzed yeast.
M: Medium bodied with light carbonation. No noticeable alcoholic warmth, which is impressive for such a strong beer.
O: Solid, but the 2012 batch has a slight soy sauce note is already present and will (most likely) become more pervasive as the beer ages. 581 charactersPhil-Fresh, Oct 11, 2015

A: Pours a deep dark mahogany color with barely any light brown fizzy active head. Just the faintest collar stuck around the edge of the glass after the head disappeared. No or almost no lace. 
S: Very musty and oak-dominate nose, but there is a nice amount of “red” fruits and tannic cherry pits. The nose is rich and complex, with layers of greasy oak, faint whisky, musty attic, vinous red wine, caramel, juicy cherry, and a hint of powdery chocolate. 
T: Exceptionally smooth and rich flavors of greasy oak and sweet cherry, damp musty basement, slightly tart red berries, red wine barrel and greasy caramel. The finish has hints of spicy, and the aftertaste is drying with gritty, cleaning tannins. 
M: Full bodied with a smooth and greasy mouthfeel overall, but the finish is drying and tannic. The tartness is also very prominent but not overly acidic, vinegary or harsh at all. Very easy to drink as the tartness gives away to sweet sugariness and dryness in the finish. 
O: One of the better sours I’ve had in recent memory. This is exceptionally smooth and easy to drink for being so complex and tart. The greasy oak and slick, sweet, cherry flavors come through perfectly. 1,237 charactersscottfrie, May 02, 2015

4.1/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5750ml brown glass bottle with appealing label design and unbranded hood-and-wire cap over a cork purchased from Cascade and served cold into a tulip in high altitude Castle Rock, Colorado. 
Reviewed live as a sour ale per the label. Expectations are sky high; this is currently #91 on the Top 250 and Cascade is a wonderful brewery. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.
No bubble show forms as it's poured.
HEAD: 2 fingers wide. Has one of the richest complexions I've ever seen. Bubbly. Fairly creamy. Decently thick. Retains very well - for ~10 minutes. Leaves no lacing on the sides as it recedes.
BODY: Dark rich sanguine red. Exquisite.
Appears well-carbonated. Looks exactly as it should.
AROMA: Subtle hints of vanilla and oak. Pie crust. Cherry pie. Sour cherries. I could use more tartness from the cherry, but it's nice as-is. Dampened oak. Cream.
A pleasant aroma of average strength. Sourness is mild - at best a 4/10 in terms of intensity. Seems sterile and clinical, and evokes only pure lactobacillus - no true wild or spontaneous bacteria (i.e. lambicus).
TASTE: Sour cherries dominate - and boy is the sourness and tartness ramped up compared to the aroma - easily a 7-8/10, with plenty of lactobacillus bacterial pucker. Oak is present throughout, lending it a guiding cohesion. A bit of subtle vanilla does come through, but no bourbon; I'd never pick up on any bourbon character if I tried this blind. Some vinegary characteristics. Toastiness. Barrel sugars.
The base beers were well-selected; I get some nice acetic character  reminiscent of Rodenbach and rich red malt characteristics.
The cherry pie flavour is wonderful, and is the highlight of the beer for me.
Impeccably balanced. This tastes like a gestalt whole, but it's not without room for improvement: more sourness and tartness, richer white oak, and more of a true wild taste would help.
No alcohol or off-notes come through. A minority of drinkers may find the cherry slightly medicinal, but I love it.
TEXTURE: Full-bodied, surprisingly thick for a sour - evoking pie crust, smooth, wet, slightly overcarbonated, damp, oddly refreshing, and rich. It's smacky and acidic on the palate. To its credit, this is one of the few truly puckering beers I've had.
Not oily, gushed, hot, astringent, boozy, harsh, rough, or scratchy.
OVERALL: 9.5% ABV is high for a sour, but it's hardly noticeable here. I get too lost in the flavours to notice it. Great as this beer is, it isn't worth its high pricetag more than once. I'd recommend that every beer enthusiast try this once, but while excellent it isn't world-class, and it isn't substantially better than something like New Belgium's La Folie or Rodenbach's Grand Cru (offerings which are half the price of this one and much more widely available). The pie crust and sour cherry work together brilliantly, lending this fantastic brew some incredible harmony. But there's room for improvement still.

Aromas of rich dark cherries, red wine and bourbon. Smells like a mouthful. Taste is quite sour.  The sourness overpowers the flavors present. I get cherries and some woody bourbon but the sour acetic/citric acid notes overpower the rest. This takes away from my enjoyment. Mouthfeel is dry and and thin with a sour aftertaste.overall a sour buddy with a nice aroma that is overshadowed with sour. 501 charactersdeebo, Oct 31, 2014

Pours a cloudy dark red beer. Forms very little foam at the top. Smell is yeasty, funky, sour. Taste is typical of Cascade Brewing: very sour and a bit over the top. This beer has to be shared, as all other Cascade beers. Body is medium thickness, and even though a couple glasses can be enjoyed, it is better to share this one. Keep anti-acid close by. 396 charactersJulioH, Sep 12, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.1%An 8 oz pour at the Cascade Barrel house on 8/19/2014. As close to perfect as possible. It starts brown with a copious head, producing a good amount of lace. Aroma: sour fruit and oak, very Flemish red. Nicely complex flavor: cherries, prunes, oak, bourbon. Dry with a light to medium light body and low carbonation. Lower acidity and more dried fruit than the usual Flanders red. A must have. 393 charactersLittleDon, Aug 20, 2014

3.75/5  rDev -15.2%Poured into a tulip.  2011 vintage.
3.75 A:  Pours a deep plum color.  Some yeasties hanging out at the bottom of the glass.  One finger of frothy beige head.  Retention is about average and a half finger of lacing is left.
3.75 S:  Well, this definitely has some cherries in it.  Big, bold, beautiful cherries.  Tart and delicious.  I'm not detecting much bourbon at this point, but the barrel itself is quite present lending a soft tannic woodiness.  Not much funk as this more showcases tartness and sour punches.  Nice acetic acidity.  Toastiness, mixed berries, sour plum, and a touch of lemon.  
3.75 T:  This pretty much mirrors the nose.  Big, bold cherry.  Moderate sour tanginess with plenty of tartness.  Lemon, plum, black and blueberries.  Toastiness, touch of neutral maltiness.  Bit of earthy funk.
3.75 M:  Medium body.  Good moderate carbonation with a light spritziness.  Super smooth with a tart finish.
4.00 D:  Very good beer.  Didn't get much bourbon, but that's probably a good thing since it didn't need any other flavors. 1,054 charactersDavoleBomb, Aug 15, 2014

The smell was bourbon and wood.
The taste was tart cherries. Wood and vanilla. Some brown sugar notes. Not harsh in any way. Not boozy but plenty of bourbon character. Well constructed. 
The mouthfeel was medium bodied with plenty of carbonation. 371 charactersCresant, Aug 05, 2014

4.34/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed out of a 750 mL brown bottle with a cork & cage top. The label is clearly marked as being from the 2012 vintage. Enjoyed out of a small Belgian tulip glass.
Appearance - Pours a deep, dark garnet red with black cherry highlights and an overall hue that reminds me of the burgundy label as I get near the bottom and can't avoid turning the otherwise mostly clear liquid into murky mess from the sediment in the bottle. With the right angle, the light reflects off the glass and makes it look almost black. Atop the body sits a one finger head of effervescent looking foam that is a pinkish khaki tint to it. 
Smell - A wonderful mix of aromas here--I get distinct tartness and a twinge of sour to come from the cherries, but also plenty of vinous notes of wine must as well as a nice tannic vanilla that I can only assume comes from the bourbon barrels. There is a pretty good showing from the wood itself, making for a super funky, musty aroma that is again held in check by the sweetness that is just enough to provide a balance.
Taste - Picking up right where the excellent aroma left off, there are obvious elements of acidity with the cherries and wild bacteria, but those are balanced quite well with sweeter vanilla and barrel flavors. Here, the characteristic of the wine barrels is much more at play than in the aroma, with those pinot notes evoking impressions of light cinnamon. There are also notes of persimmon and red plum adding to the depth of the taste. The bourbon is slightly lost in all this, but you can tell that it's presence is definitely enhancing the rest of the the same way a properly-salted meal will invoke all sorts of flavors without actually tasting directly like salt.
Mouthfeel - Light-bodied with moderate to high carbonation and a gentle pucker on the tastebuds that finishes with a semi-dry feeling on the tongue.
Overall, just an awesome beer. It's hard not to say that it's my favorite from Cascade, but it's been awhile since I had the Apricot. Regardless, this is a fantastic beer that manages to be aggressively sour without being a tooth enamel-peeling chore to get through. An excellent balance of the acidity and sweetness. 2,181 charactersLambicPentameter, Jul 02, 2014

A: Pours a rust brown. Nice deep red pinot character. Lovely frothy head. As far as sours go this is tits. This is exactly what a sour should look like.
S: Nice deep cherry character. Sweet but subtle tannin character. Little bit of chared barrels from the whiskey but so subtle.
T: What can I say? Deep cherry, tart raspberry, sweet booze from the bourbon but not a bourbon burn. The lactic component comes in during the finish with a lingering wood stickiness that just coats the roof of your mouth. Lovely. Not overly sour just the perfect amount.
M: Perfection. Start to finish. Goes down buttery. The carbonation is a little explosive at first but it really enhances the flavor profile. Just frothy clean finish. Some of Cascades can come off overly acidic and this blend is so enjoyable.
Overall: Cascade.. probably the most consistent sour producing brewery out there. I've had this in the past and prior I got more of a sour bomb with heavier lactic component. This is still amazing, hasn't changed much. This goes in the top 5 Flanders Reds I've ever had. Pairs amazingly with a cave aged gruyere. 1,229 charactersputonyourwalkingshoes, Jun 08, 2014

Pours a murky burgundy-tinged mahogany capped by a light beige one and half finger head. Excellent retention and significant lacing. Oak, light lactic sour, wisps of general dark fruitiness and berry-like accents. Opens with both sour and sweet cherries, plums, and cranberries. Very light brown sugar and molasses join in. Pleasant oaky accents throughout. Finishes with juicy cherry tart and sour, continued pleasant oak, and just a tiny hint of underlying bourbon notes. Lighter side of medium bodied; smooth with moderate carbonation. It's hard to find a brewery in the U.S. putting out better sours than Cascade and Sang Noir is one of their best. Truly exceptional. 798 characterschanokokoro, Apr 08, 2014

Pours a brownish body which sounds plain but is anything but. Strong blackberries, currants and cherries are accentuated in the flavor and the aroma very nicely. Body is quite lively and tartness isn't overdone but felt. First time trying these guys and i will come back for sure. 302 characterspapat444, Mar 24, 2014

Rich mahogany in color, almost cola like, this Sang Noir gives off a rich, complex and unique aroma, given the style. The typical lactic punch in the nose is toned down, replaced by notes of ripe berries and grapes.  Red wine-like nose.
The flavors are even more complex with deep notes of oak and cherries and an almost chocolaty/carob-y aspect.   A little more sour than the nose, this is still more complex and oaky than puckering-ly sour.  Booze is noted, but not overwhelming given the 10% ABV.    Medium finish that closes a lot like red wine, with tannins and oaky residuals lingering between sips.
Probably the best beer from Cascade.  I had this a year ago or so, and did a quick rating - relaxing with my own bottle seems to be an even more satisfying experience. 812 charactersrand, Mar 22, 2014

Leathery brown-ruby with pink film that trails. 
Big sour woody nose with balsamic and pomegranate hits. 
Deep red fruit - currant, sour raspberry - with hints of chocolate, wood, vanilla, bourbon, and cherry stone. 
Tart finish and lean linger. 
Lt-medium, dry, a bit of cream, no trace of heat. 
Lots of complexity. Wood and cherry are down in the mix, making it that much more harmonious. Well-integrated sour - if not quite magical. 470 charactersStJamesGate, Mar 10, 2014

Very pleasant aroma and for the first half of the bottle could not stop from enjoying it before every taste. Loved the sweetness and sour cherries. Very easy to drink and the 9.8% snuck up on me. I'm so glad I had ordered more than one. Can't wait to try this brew again after some aging on my other bottles. Enjoyed it so much I burnt my dinner. 438 charactersJayPeso, Mar 03, 2014

Mini snifter
A: Dirty burnt amber red color. Faint layer of head. No lacing. Looks fairly still in the glass, but that might also have to do with the tiny glass.
S: Big dark sour cherry. Some of that red ale character. Hints of vanilla. Some of that dry oak. Tannic notes. Love that lactic sour coming through.
T: This is probably my favorite Cascade ever. Big tart Cherry sourness on the tip if the tongue. Mouth puckering for sure. Then you get some of that tannic oak dryness. Some of the red ale character: nuttiness and vanilla. Prickly carbonation. Dry finish with lingering sour.

Sang is more restrained sour-wise than the other Cascades I've tried -- and all the better for it. No need to grab for the Tums. The cherry and oak interlace perfectly and the bite of sour cherries is rounded out nicely by the malt. I had a Supplication last night, so it's interesting to compare the two. Supplication is more complex, but Sang is an excellent beer. 444 charactersjjdc, Jan 26, 2014

A-The beer arrives with a thin cap of foam. It is very dark underneath, and sort of a purplish ruby hue. The beer is still looking in the glass. The head leaves a stray chunk of lacing on the glass.
S-The smell is a fantastic vinous mixture of sour cherry, oak, vanilla, raisin, and earthy soil. It is very tart, but not acidic or overwhelming. Alcohol is not apparent at all. Very oud bruin like in character.
T-The taste, like the smell, is fantastic. The brew balances earthy, funky oak flavors with sweet, dried fruit (cherries, raisins, prunes), and a big dose or tart cherry sourness. No one flavor is overdone. This is also one of the more vinous beers I have tasted recently. 
M-The feel is medium body with a crisp, chunky carbonation that fades quickly on the palate.
O-This is a great beer and easily the best wild/sour beer I have tried in a while. It is complex with a great balance of earthy, sweet, and sour flavors. The cherry character here is really well done. as it permeates the beer, but never overwhelms it. The mouthfeel comes closest of almost any American sour beer I have tried to matching the feel of the best Belgian sours. 1,211 charactersspoony, Jan 13, 2014

Surprised by the dark marroon pour with lots of brownish head that leaves a bit of a ring around the edges.
Smells of tart cherry, grape must, bit of wood and the taste lines up in a similar way with a great complexity that is well balanced and non-puckering. Definitely some cherry and grape notes and a subdued oak backbone. Great carb . 
Will happily drink this any time 428 charactersalaimoa, Jan 06, 2014

Aroma is of tart funk, lots of tart and sweet cherries, oak barrel and light vinegar. Taste is complex, sweet cherries, tart cherries, light lactic acid, funk, sourness, some oaky wood, and not much of a sign of the alcohol. Very complex sour, very well done. 317 charactersjbaker67, Jan 05, 2014

Flavor is wonderful, slight sweetness, malt, cherries, red fruits. Nice sour and smooth finish.
Medium in body.

Cork pops off very easily. Pours a dark ruby with two fingers of slightly burgundy foam. pretty high carbonation, ridiculous retention rate with great lacing. A little fizzy, but this is a really good looking beer 
Smells of vinegar, tart cherries, sour apples and grape, wine, oak, leather, a tiny bit of bourbon and a ouch of alcohol. Really fun to smell 
Taste is right with the nose, sour cherries and an assortment of other fruits- apple, peach, and grape with strong vinegar, oak, bourbon, wine, and alcohol. The taste sort of evolves as it goes over the palate
Feel is initial face puckering sour that neutralizes and turns a little sweet on the finish. Medium sticky body. Really easy to sip on
Overall one of the better Cascades I've had. Really great beer, glad I got another of last years vintage 963 characterslordofstarside, Dec 26, 2013
3.9/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5A-Pours very dark. Light really struggles to make its way through. Medium sized, bubbly, tan head. Webby lacing.
S-A substantial aroma of sour cherries. Hints of chocolate. Lots of oak. More wine barrel than bourbon barrel but both are noticeable. The cherries dominate.
T-The base blend of red ales in more prominent that I would have expected or wanted. It obviously funky and sour and such but it's finish is a bit too generic. Cherries are both sweet and sour. Not picking up much bourbon barrel, rather far more vinous character. Lacks complexity surprisingly. Just a bunch of cherries and sweetness.
M-Plenty of body. It's creamy but the bubbles are fairly aggressive. Dry, slightly tannic. A bit boozy.
O/D-It's tasty but it's not worth the cost and doesn't live up to the hype. 789 charactersVelvetExtract, Dec 25, 2013

4.08/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Review from notes a year ago. 750ml bottle poured into a snifter. The brew appears brown in color with a tan finger of head. The lacing is creamy with a full wall painted on the glass. Some lighter brown almost yellowish clarity is seen around the edges.
The brew smells fruity. Somewhat funky and earthy with plenty of cherry. So much earth that it almost covers up the minor medicinal cherry alcohol note that emerges more as it warms.
The flavor includes a medicinal sort of tart cherry mixed with earth. The barrel aging brings out a minor amount of vanilla that pairs very well with the cherry fruit character. Some raw and woody aftertaste is noticed when big sips are taken.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is somewhat effervescent yet meets everything expected of a fruited sour. I really enjoy tasting the barrel character in sours blended with the fruit addition. I would drink this again. 939 charactersstakem, Dec 20, 2013

4.29/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance- Only a sliver of head which seems as if it would have been a light beige or off-white. The body is a muddy brown which has hints of purple. Light bourbon color when held up to the light. Some sheeting is left behind.
Nose- Lots of bourbon with hints of Pinot Noir. Fairly subdued when it comes to any sour notes. There is a little bit of grape, some cherry. The bourbon, however, is complex enough to make up for the lack of presence from the esters and lactic acid.
Taste- Kicks in where the nose fails. There are very dominant sour notes: cherry, strawberry, and tart apple are in the forefront. Linger includes bourbon (by far the non-sour note with the most presence), straw, slight funk that suggest ripe, stinky cheese, some grass, and light notes of Pinot Noir grapes. As it opens up, the funk of the flavor profile shows more and more presence. The bourbon begins to fade and the lactic acid and the Brett begin to take over. Lots of stone fruits- peach, apricot, and cherry. Very nice dry finish that is almost crisp.
Mouthfeel- Light bodied with a large amount of syrup to the texture. Nice amount of carbonation which fits the style. If it were effervescent in the vein of a Russian River or Cantillon, this would be incredible. There is a slight tingle.
Drinkability- Very easygoing. Aging has made this a very accessible at this point in time. Four bucks for a 3 ounce pour is kind of steep but still reasonable for a one time taste.
Overall- Very good to almost great. Solid sour that is a must for sour fans 1,539 charactersartoolemomo, Oct 20, 2013

A - Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights and a 2 finger sandy head. Fair retention that fades into a thin ring and leaves behind some lacing. 
S - Bold sour Bing cherry with some sweet jam notes. I also pick up notes of the wine from the barrels it was aged in, but almost no oak. 
T - Stats off very tart Bing cherry and moves into a slighter jam sweetness. It will make you pucker as there tends to be small amounts of acid and vinegar. Again I can pick up some of the wine from the barrel aging, but detect almost no oak or wood. It's had to believe that this is 9.5% ABV as there is no alcohol. 
M - Medium to light bodied with ample carbonation. Mouth puckering at the start and finish. 
O - A great sour that I received in a trade. If you have a chance to acquire it, I recommend it to sour lovers. Thank you Bill. 857 charactersRi0, Oct 19, 2013

4.51/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5The inside of a barrel isn't a very nice place. It's dark and musty, full of nauseating fumes, and houses rogue bacteria and microscopic critters in every crevasse. In many cases, you're stuck in there with rotting, festering fruits. Despite all this, Sang Noir came out more than a year later looking pretty good; its tone is dark but not muddied and impressively maintains a bit of its garnet highlighting. Even some head too. 
The aroma combines epic proportions of sweetness and tartness to create a bouquet of unparalleled complexity; it's rare to find this much of either, let alone both together in the same beer. Immediate impressions of berry gummies and candied cherries quickly turn tart and gradually evolve into a unique convolution of fruit, oak, bourbon, and pinot noir. 
Saying that Sang Noir is like a candy factory crossed with a fruit orchard crossed with a winery is a huge injustice to an incredibly elaborate beer. But it's a good place to start when embarking on the near impossible task of describing the multiplicity of flavours that comprise this rich and mesmerizing offering. 
I'm first impressed by just how mellow the beer drinks. High-alcohol, barrel-aged offerings tend to fall prey to one or the other of nauseating booziness, acidity that singes your throat, a woodiness that leaves splinters in your gums, or a tartness so severe in turns your lips inside out (assuming the whole thing comes together well enough so as to be palatable in the first place). But Sang Noir has all the intricacy without any of the intensity. 
What's in the glass is mysterious and distinctive, the result of a very long and difficult process - it makes the Coca-Cola recipe seem easy to crack by comparison. Notes of maddeningly red cherries, vanilla cola, caramel, sarsaparilla, acidic lemon, purple plum, heavy wood and spices are melodiously woven together. Notably absent are any harsh alcohol notes (an impressive feat considering the whiskey barrels and the 9.5% of the beer itself). 
Cascade Sang Noir ("black blood") indeed drinks like some kind of dark, mystical gospel. A beer this intricate and transcendental is the stuff of folkloric legends. Of course, given how difficult it is to find (and expensive to buy) it may only ever be fantasy for most people. For those of you fortunate enough to come across this dream beer, be sure to enjoy it with someone you really want to impress (i.e, your favourite person in the world). 2,457 charactersbiegaman, Jul 31, 2013

A: Pours a dark ruby color with a light tan head forming on the pour. It recedes to at thin ring that leaves some soapy lace behind.
S: Tart cherries with some light hints of bourbon. Sharp vinegar aspect to it with a oak barrel as well. Medium sweetness from malts run across the nose.
T: Cherry pie filling with tart cherry skins. Lactic sourness with some zingy vinegar notes. Sweet barrel finish with a combination of oak, vanilla and light bourbon.
M: Medium to light bodied, alcohol is well hidden with a zingy finish.
O: Sort of like a black cherry warhead in a sense with a less intense sour pucker. Zingy and tart with some sweetness from the barrel. Nice beer. 722 charactersTreebs, May 11, 2013
4.37/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared thanks to Darrell (durwoodx), thanks for sharing! 2011 vintage.
The look is nice, it has a deep crimson look to it, very small ring of white head. Inviting look. 
Smell is good, but not great to me. I get the cherries, a bit of oak, and then a hefty amount of funky cheese. For me it really has a ton of blue cheese/Camembert cheese to me, doesn't pop with lambic or wild smells but not bad.
The taste has a huge rush of sour cherry and vanilla/chocolate swirl ice cream, huge vinegar rush a t the back of the flavor that opens to a sweet corn type flavor. A ni mid flavor spiciness evolves with each sip which is nice, the flavor doesn't linger other than a vinegar type tartness that is palate numbing in some ways, feel is carbonated and decently bodied, I dig it. 
This beer is good, had next to other beers in the style and it was better in many ways. Nice. 880 charactersDreadnaught33, May 11, 2013

A- Pours a dark brown with ruby hues and a small off-white head.
S- The aroma is funky and sour. White grapes, tart cherries, fresh apple cider, and tart granny smith apples are all prevalent in the aroma. (My buddy who was drinking this with me jokingly said after smelling this "It smells like Jesus after he bathed in the Jordan."! Possibly the funniest thing I've ever heard in reference to the aroma of a beer!)
T- The flavor is nearly identical to the aroma with the super tart cherry and granny smith coming through as the primary flavors, and finishing with the apple cider and a dry, super sour finish.
M- The mouthfeel is near perfect for a sour, being light to medium bodied and moderate to high carbonation.
O- This is probably a top 2 sour for me to date! Absolutely superb, and hard to find flaws in unless you can't handle really tart/sour beers! 899 charactersSadMachine, May 09, 2013

(A)- Pours a deep deep burgundy red color with slight purple plum edges. Some good white froth formed but dissipated quickly.
(S)- Very ripe and vibrant acidic oak with ripe berry-like fruits. Quite jam-like with cherry, berries, and cassis fruits with some very subtle vanilla graham cracker oak on the finish as it opens up.
(T)- Quite the sour bomb! Very sour and acidic oak dryness but is balanced out very well with some serious jam-like dark fruits: blackberry, boysenberry, cherry, and cassis.
(M)- A great carbonation level amidst a very hefty sourness level. I love how juicy the fruits get in this with in combination with the nice presence of the dry oak really makes this so enjoyable.
(O)- A superb showing of what fruit, oak, and sourness can do together when blended expertly. So very sour, but so very good and welcomed with the incoming of warmer weather. Very easily my favorite Cascade to date! 1,000 characterssweemzander, May 06, 2013

Appearance: Pours a deep red/amber brown color with about a finger of a very light tan head. When held up to light you can see lots of champagne like carbonation streaming from the bottom of the glass. Head retention was strong with quite a bit of lacing.
Smell: Lots of sour cherries, balsamic vinegar, stone fruits, oak, red wine. Some bourbon is present in the nose, but just barely. 
Taste: Sour cherries, oak, vanilla, tobacco, red wine, black licorice. Aftertaste is a really interesting mix of bourbon, cherries and vanilla with some red wine character as well. Really complex. Sourness is on the lower end of high.
Mouthfeel: On the lighter side of medium bodied. Despite the amount of visible carbonation in the glass, it feels much less noticeable in the mouth. Finishes dry with a slight gentle warming as it goes down.
Overall: One of the best sours (and best beers for that matter) I've had the pleasure of trying. This is an example of the art of barrel aging at it's finest. Despite the high price tag, I'll definitely seek this out again. 1,128 charactersJonada, May 04, 2013

It definitely leaned towards the sour side, but was well-balanced and not too puckery. The appearance and taste were both outstanding. Poured a dark red/brown color, with a decent amount of head.

Deep blood red, light tan head with good lace and nice retention. Nose is bourbon cherry pie, sharp acidity, oak and cherry pits. Harsh acidity, but the bourbon smooths things out. Taste has light bourbon, oak, an intense sour cherry blast, tart, acidic, and more cherry pits. Finishes sweetish, but tartness prevails. Rich, intense cherry character, and a lovely malt profile. Medium full feel, lasting finish. Awesome. 463 charactersliamt07, Mar 12, 2013

3.98/5  rDev -10%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Poured from the bottle into a snifter glass at Smoke & Barrel DC, for the dc bottle share. From notes.
An amber to deep orange body, quite cloudy without much head presented.
Nose has a nice sense of mild fruit, that really goes to crab-apple territory. Highly dominating crab apples with a good tart sense. Not much else, but it's at least a good nose.
The crab-apple tartness does come off quite big in the palate but not overboard. There's some nice mild buttery mixing in the mid palate with the apple which hits really nicely. Some subtle funk notes come off on the finish also. Feel is about par for the course just a hint of wet but easy drinkability.
Overall it reminds me of a bit of apple butter character and a toned down Weyerbacher Riserva. Still decent even for a one tricky pony like sense. 809 characterssmakawhat, Mar 10, 2013

4.17/5  rDev -5.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Pours a pretty ruby color that turns brown around the edges. The tan colored head is short and airy, settles into a light ring.
The aroma starts off tart from the oak wine barrel. The bourbon barrel then comes through to mellow out the sharp acidic notes. All the while, the cherries provide a nice fruitiness to the brew and another layer of sourness. Complex and enjoyable.
The taste is of super tart cherries and lemon sourness. The wine barrel is strong providing a healthy oak flavor as well as some white grape. Some earthy caramel and vanilla notes from the bourbon but that doesn't hold a candle to the sourness. Not a huge sour fan but I can drink this as a change up.
The feel is light with fairly soft carbonation. Sweet, sour, and tart on the palate with a big dry finish. I am good for a glass but the dryness might get to me.
A very well made sour, just wish I was more of a fan of the style so you can probably bump my grade up a notch. 955 charactersGmann, Mar 10, 2013

The taste of it is also sour, some sharp cherry notes in the fading aftertaste. The mouthfeel of the beer is clean and tart, nice high level of carbonation that dries the beer out.

Head is thick khaki and looks silky, with some sticking on the glass. Cherries, strawberries, and vinegar dominate the nose with hints of oak and dark chocolate. This smells rich. Vinegar dominates the palate from start to finish. Cherry, red currant, and pomegranate make an appearance as well. The sourness doesn't make you pucker much and the bitterness is lasting and warm, fading slowly. There is some oak in there that is apparent to anyone drinking, but its not overpowering like many oak aged beers tend to be. Feel is slightly watery with a balance finish tending towards dry. 
This beer is really balanced in flavors with the vinegar sourness and lasting bitterness sticking their necks out among the other flavors. The oakiness is there but not over the top. In addition, I can't detect the high ABV at all and the buzz comes slowly, as this is a sipper. I was strangely underwhelmed, but then I realized it's because there is no one stand out feature due to the balance nature. I wouldn't age this too long, as the oak will fade completely. 1,128 charactersPhilousa, Feb 12, 2013

A- Tiny white head, fades to a ringed one. Red-brown color with nice clarity.
S- Bourbon notes with heavy cherry influence. Sour, but not strong and acrid. Nice smelling beer. 
T- Very sour and some bourbon, barrel-aged notes. Strong beer. Tasty. 
M- Fizzy carbonation, dry finish. 
O- Lovely beer. But not as amazing as the score would make it seem. Maybe I just need more. 442 charactersMurrhey, Jan 26, 2013

4.5/5  rDev +1.8%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a reddish cola color with a reasonable brownish head. Not gonna lie, this looks like Dr. Pepper.
Smells fruity and tart--red wine, sour apples, berries, some oud bruin type ketchupy sweetness, whiskey on the finish. Predictably complex and enticing.
Flavor is lots of sour green apple, cherries and blackberries and other fruit, tart red wine. Whiskey is lighter than in the nose but still present. Extremely complex and pretty darn sour, also a decent sweetness to balance it out. Biggest single flavor I get is green apple. A beer with this much going on could easily be a big mess, and other Cascade experiments have been a little sloppier than this, but this beer is delicious and the complexity just makes me want more.
Mouthfeel is good, nice carbonation but not over carbonated like Cascade beers sometimes are. Very drinkable, the complexity of the flavor just makes it more drinkable too.
Awesome beer overall, definitely the best beer that Cascade has bottled so far. I'd drink this all the damn time if I could.

Smelled great, lots of cherries and some minor bourbon notes. Tasted amazing, slight sourness and bourbon on the front with a more distinct sour and cherry notes rounding out the finish. Cherries throughout. Amazing, for sure the best American sour ive ever had. 323 characterscodysjb, Jan 18, 2013
4.19/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Bottle shared at John Laffler's last day at GI. Thanks to ChrisPro for ordering this for me. Served in a small pint glass.
A - Big tan foam settles to a thick collar and thin cap, leaving behind spots of lace. Hazy milk chocolate colored body.
S - Surprising balsamic note, considering Cascade is supposed to be an all-lacto souring program. Vinous, oaky, with light cherries, and a bit vegetal character as well. Some flavors from the base beer include caramel, nuts, chocolate, and licorice. Don't get a ton of whiskey to be honest.
T - The taste delivers a bit more of what I expected, with tart cherry, lactic sourness, and lots of oak. There's a mild dill and herb flavor that I sometimes get from beers with extended barrel-aging times. Again, red wine and balsamic vinegar and some of the sweet base malts round out the flavor profile. No alcohol presence at all.
M - Medium body, lower carbonation, and moderate and gradually intensifying acidity. No alcohol heat that I can perceive, and unsurprisingly quite dry and tannin heavy.
D - A solid dark sour that's sufficiently complex, but doesn't really blow me away. I'd certainly have this again if offered, but I'd take Russian River's dark sours over this pretty much every time. 1,244 charactersMasterSki, Jan 18, 2013

A: Somewhat "dirty" looking browish/ruby red with a pillowy 2 finger head from a moderately vigorous pour. Head recedes but leaves a nice frothy ring around the glass that sticks around.
S: Smells tart and slightly sweet. Definitely picking up the cherries in the nose, as well as some apple and vinegar aromas. It is very subtle, but I'm picking up light hints of bourbon as well.
T: Sweet up front with a great cherry presence. The initial cherry sweetness gives way to a tart, dry finish. Slight vinegar. This one leans more to the tart and acidic side as opposed to the funky side, although some minor funk is present. Again, picking up some slight bourbon character in the form of toffee/caramel mid swallow.
M: Moderate carbonation. Given the sweetness and overall "size" of this beer, it is unsurprising that it feels a bit thicker in the mouth than some other sours. 
O: Great sour. Certainly among the better I've had the pleasure of enjoying. There are some interesting complexities to it that aren't found in many other wilds. 1,097 charactersdbc5, Dec 30, 2012

M: Medium bodied, lower carbonation. Tart, but balanced.

Poured into a tulip glass from a 750ml bottle.
Pours a very nice dark copper color with some amber notes. There is a 0.5 inch light ecru head that forms that is dense to medium dense that recedes quickly down to a thin film. The brew is nice. (4.5)
Aroma starts off with some nice tart notes. Slight vinegar notes with more of a tart fruitiness. There are some awesome cherry notes in the nose mixed in with the vinegar. Slightly sweet but also tart. Definitely some nice funk notes and some notes of oak. The Bourbon notes are slightly less noticeable than I would like. But the brew is still top notch in the nose department. (4.5)
Taste starts off with a sharp sharp tartness. It is mostly fruity but there is some slight vinegary notes to it. There are some nice woody notes and there is also some slight Bourbon notes. The bourbon notes offer some slight caramel notes and some vanilla on the background of the brew. The tartness definitely dominates the palette though with some nice cherry tartness and some slight sweetness. Nice wine notes as well with some slight acidity. Mouthfeel is light and refreshing. Very flavorful brew. (5.0)(4.5)
Overall this brew is a very good wild ale. The Cascade crew knows how to do them. There are some nice slight bourbon notes mixed in with intense tart notes. Great sour fruit with some slight vinegar and some nice cherry notes. There is a nice woody and tart finish with some nice wine acidity and tannin.(5.0) 1,495 charactersJoEBoBpr, Nov 22, 2012

Pours a deep garnet brown with a huge tan head that slowly dissipates and leaves much lace on the way down. Smells of balsamic, cherries, lemon and funk. Light alcohol note and a touch of wood. The flavor is complex and varied. Up front I get some sweet cherries and a light sweet maltiness. Tart cherries, a bit of lactic acid and lemons destroy the sweetness in short order. Woody oak come in next with a bit of funk and vinegar and an ever increasing lactic tartness. The finish leaves a lingering sweet tart candy feel on my taste buds. Medium body with a moderate to high level of carbonation and a tart chalky puckering mouthfeel. Very nice Flanders style ale very complex.

2011 Project
Served in a tulip
The beer poured a deep, dark, slightly hazed, crimson-mahogany color. A super dense and creamy, tan colored head capped the liquid. Excellent retention. The head slowly faded to a resilient film. Streaks of drippy lacing cascaded down the glass.
The aroma was outstanding. Sour cherry notes leapt out of the glass. The tartness was well matched by a stiff caramel malt backbone and a hefty dose of brown sugar sweetness. Fantastically well balanced. The nose was also quite oaky and vinous. A touch of bourbon-like booziness came through as well. Overall, remarkably deep, rich and robust.
The flavor profile was solid but a bit of a letdown compared to the aroma. Unlike the nose which displayed tremendous balance between the tart and sweet elements, the beer was incredibly sour and acidic on the palate and seemed to lack some complexity. Tannic, dry and very oaky in the center. A touch of bready malts were detectible. The beer finished super tart and dry with strong red wine, vinegar and acetic acid notes. As the liquid warmed, the vinegar aspect intensified.
For a 9.5% ABV beer, this beer kid its alcohol prowess remarkably well. The mouthfeel however was a touch thinner than I anticipated. Creamy and smooth with a slick, frothy effervescence.
This is a solid beer, but I felt that the aroma was far superior to the flavor. Because the cherry aspect was so fantastic and the tart/acidic quality seemed a bit overwhelming, I would strongly recommend drinking this sooner than later. 1,620 charactersDamian, Oct 27, 2012

Appearance: The beer pours a very dark reddish brown color with a half finger of creamy off white head. The head fades to a ring around the glass.
Smell: The smell is dominated by tart red wine notes. I'm getting some cherries and oak as well, along with some soft vanilla notes. 
Taste: This beer is rather complex, lots going on here. Quite tart on the tip of the tongue. MIld vinegar notes, but I'm getting more red wine and tart cherries. Mild notes from the bourbon and oak. The finish has more cherry than wine and is still quite tart.
Mouthfeel: The body is just on the thick side of medium with aggressively tingly carbonation and a very dry finish.
Overall: This is an incredibly deep beer. I really enjoyed the wine notes along with the sourness. I'd definitely have more in the future. 847 charactersoline73, Oct 07, 2012

T: A nice lactic sourness upfront that's chock full of sour cherries, cherry pit and vanilla. A touch of bourbon before a finish that's long and ever changing. Pinot noir barrel, red delicious apple and some tannins on the finish. So freakin good. 616 charactersnotchucknorris, Oct 04, 2012

M: pitch perfect. The active carbonation pops the firmly placed cork. The prickly carbonation carries the flavors.
O: Great. Worth the Hype. It would have been all 5s if the individual flavors had been more distinguishable. I am a fan of this. 677 charactersDonerik, Sep 25, 2012

A: Dark red/purple/almost black. Foamy white head that lingered for a while. 
S: Classic Cascade acidity. Tons of lactic acid, tart cherries, sweet malts and a slight bourbon finish. Smells amazing and very inviting. 
T: Lots of lactic sourness with a bit of vinegary/vinous notes. Sweet and tart cherries, apples, followed by oak dryness and a bit of bourbon sweetness. Tastes almost like raspberries/blackberries as well. Super sour.
M: Great carbonation with a medium body. Finishes dry. 
O: This is possibly my favorite from Cascade so far. Glad I shared it though, I think the sourness could get overwhelming if you drink the whole bottle. Excellent beer though, I enjoyed it very much. 711 charactersstandardcherry, Sep 23, 2012
4.54/5  rDev +2.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle poured into a teku glass.
Pour: Completely hazy deep, deep red with some murky brown aspects mixed in. A finger of light tan head appears and dissipates quickly. 
Smell: Wow. I get tart cherries, tobacco, leather, vanilla, a light bourbon, and a hint of funk. What a combination - and it's incredible.
Taste: Even better than the nose. Tart cherry with no hint of sweetness. Instead, sweetness is provides by a nice tobacco caramel, mixed with some vanilla and leather. A lactic acidity provides an amazing bite without being cloying. An oakiness rounds out the flavors and incorporates them together. This is exquisite.
Mouthfeel: I know some people say Cascades can be overly sour, but I love how tart this is. Carbonation is on point. The barrel aging provides a buttery smoothness. 
Overall: The merging of bourbon barrel and pinot barrels in the aging process of this beer produced a whole new kind of beast. I will absolutely seek this out again. 964 characterscfrances33, Sep 22, 2012

Appearance: rich, dark amber hue with a big haze and a finger of frothy tan foam. Not much lace or retention on the head, but overall quite attractive indeed.
Smell: an intoxicating combination of sweet malt, tart acid, tannic wood and unctuous cherries. Damn, I almost don't want to drink it. Simply wonderful.
Taste: a similar collection of flavors as in the aroma, but balanced in an entirely different and equally wonderful way. Tartness and greenish fruit flavor off the bat, subsiding into the sweeter malt and a big, roaming fresh cherry flavor underpinning it all. This beer is just stupendous. Hot damn tamale.
Mouthfeel: medium-light body with a good level of carbonation and a nice creaminess. 
Overall: for the sake of my wallet, I almost wish I'd never encountered this beer. I usually like cherry beers, but this manages to create a big and interesting natural cherry flavor without being candy-like at all. I'm gushing. This beer is great. 1,049 charactersflagmantho, Sep 22, 2012

Consumed 9/16/12
Appearance: Dark amber with some brown, deep red, and purple - moderate size tan head, kind of creamy - keeps a nice ring, leaves some nice streaks and lacing
Smell: This is weird, of course - tons of wood - some red wine, some dry whiskey, some cherries, dark fruits - sour, tart, funky - a funky, medicine-like phenolic character - some cooked malts, but they are quite hidden under the barrel assault - booze
Taste: There's a lot that went into this beer, and it shows - amber malts as a base - tons of woody flavor, with red wine and a whiskey aftertaste - fruity, with mostly dark fruits, grapes, and some hints of cherries - very tart, moderately sour, acidic with some musty funk -booze and phenols
Mouthfeel: Full body, sticky with a residual dry tartness and a wet sourness, nice carbonation
Overall: A pretty intense sipper
There is so much going on in this beer, and I think this may actually be a flaw. This could use some simplicity. It's very sour, and very tasty, but a little crazy. 1,068 charactersangrybabboon, Sep 17, 2012

Smell: Bourbon, cherry juice, and some oak. Cherry flesh, skin, and some pit. Worn leather, mild touches of vinegar, vanilla, toffee, and an alcohol back. Big malts as well. Some hints of chocolate buried in the back. Mild spiciness and something that comes across like sweet cinnamon. Almost aspirin edge of bitterness. Big red wine.
Taste: Black cherry Warhead. Legit. Tart cherry flesh. Candy sweetness. Citric and mild acetic tartness. Tart builds as the beer warms. Big cherry push. Flesh and pits with some minor bourbon like qualities. Vanilla and toffee play well with the dark cherry. Some plum as well. Leathered fruit. Throwback to childhood and delicious Warheads. Tartness is aggressively drying, which is its own flavor. Nice layers of oak. Clean wood. So much acid and cherry goodness. Pinot adds a more complex layer of fruit. Some plum and blackberry.
Mouthfeel: Medium body pushes toward full with minimal carbonation. Puckering dryness.
Overall: Crazy fruit tart madness. Ballsy and complex. Nice. 
One of the better wilds from Cascade. Lots going on. My mouth is a desert. Moisture is gone. 1,257 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Sep 17, 2012

Smells of different fruits, however cherry jumps out and is the most potent. Tastes like a cherry blowpop, with the dry back end of a cherry blowpop as well. Very tart and sour and well put together. Fantastic taste. My only knock, is the carbonation. To me, this is over carbonated and would've been much nicer with a less carbonated, creamier mouthfeel. Still nice, but not what it could be. That being said, this is fantastic. Kind of one sided as far as the cherry goes, but I think that was the point. I'd trade for this again in a heartbeat. 597 characters1Adam12, Sep 07, 2012
3.88/5  rDev -12.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Presentation: Corked and caged bottle from the latest release. Chilled before opening. Split with a friend and served in a tulip glass.
Appearance: Pours a pretty nice, one and a half to two finger beige with decent retention. Medium brown in color with some hints of amber and ruby throughout.
Aroma: First impression is really boozy. Sharp booze and bright cherry notes stand out. Definitely a touch of balsamic vinegar and some caramel and bourbon undertones. Pretty complex once the initial blast of alcohol wears off.
Taste: Big sweet and sour cherry notes upfront. Definitely very fruit forward. A touch of lactic sourness, but I think most of the tartness is directly from the cherry notes. Some underlying caramel and bourbon notes offer a nice counter. Unique and enjoyable. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and carbonated perfectly for the style. Easy to drink for the most part.
Overall, a really nice fruit forward American wild and one of the better Cascade beers I've had, although I find their sours unbalanced a lot of the time. This was definitely enjoyable, refreshing and complex, but the aroma was a bit much upfront. I like this, but I think there are more enjoyable sours for the price. 1,206 charactersGosox8787, Sep 06, 2012

4.42/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Sang Noir is one of Cascade's best brews -- a blend of red ales aged in oak and bourbon barrels for a year before sitting on fresh Bing and sour pie cherries for six months. The beer's name translates to "black blood" -- an appropriate moniker when the brew's deep, almost-opaque maroon hue is taken into account.
Poured into a tulip, burnt orange edges lead into a quarter-inch head the color of brown sugar. Sweet stuff hits the nose first: Caramel, cola, cherry syrup. Tart cherries, sour green apple and lesser amounts of balsamic and oak mingle in the background.
Sang Noir's flavor hits like a sour slap to the dome, blending complex tartness with disparate food characters. At once, brown sugar, green apple, balsamic vinegar and milk chocolate can be detected. Swirling the medium-bodied brew about the mouth activates both moderate fizziness and high acidity, with the sharp bacteria gripping the tongue like tiny rock climbers. The swallow brings the oak -- a huge, vinous blast peppered with sour cherry, lemon and vinegar. Granny Smith apple peel and Bing cherries blend in the finish. 1,099 charactersPhelps, Aug 27, 2012

Slightly hazy, deep brown with medium head. Soft cherries in the aroma, oak-y for sure. Quite sour and acetic-ally so, but fortunately not enough to deter me. Hint of bourbon and oak most definitely, with some sweetness as well.
Finishes dry and tannic, reminds me quite a bit of Rodenbach Grand Cru.
A quite good beer overall but seems likes it's not my type.

I have been waiting some time to try this one. 750 ml bottle from the 2011 project poured into a red wine glass...
A - Pours a dark reddish-brown, ruby color that is more deep than a burgundy color. A very slight head forms about half of a finger thick and slightly off white in color. Slightly muddled in color but is clear around the edges of the glass.
S - Tart cherries and lactic acid come out first. There are some nice vinous qualities coming forth as well. A nice funk and some wet oak come through as well. The bourbon is hard to detect, but the pinot barrels come through strongly.
T - Tart, sweet cherries and other fruits come first. There's some slight vinegar and balsamic qualities, but the cherry and vinous flavors slightly overpower it. Brett, dry oak and some lactic funk come next. The warmer the beer gets, the more the bourbon flavors come out and give a subtle warmth to the flavor profile. The sour and sweet are very well balanced here and make for a really first class wild ale.
M - Medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Puckers the mouth and is a bit prickly on the tongue. Slight dryness on the finish. 
O - I really enjoyed this one. It easily is one of the better Wild Ales I have had. The sweetnees and the sourness balance very well given everything that is going on in the beer. Can't wait to have some more! 1,462 charactersKAP1356, Aug 23, 2012

Sour cherry, tart but sweet fruit, red wine vinegar, light caramel sugar, vanilla and earthy wood funk. A bit of almond nutty as it warms. Smells like a great dessert with the fruit and sugar and nutty aromas.
Sharp acetic acid sourness upfront, mellowing to tart cherries, sweet red fruit and vanilla. Sweeter mid tongue, caramel and molasses mingling with red berry and cherry. Earthy funk and almond on the very dry finish, with lingering sweet cherry.

4.3/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a ruddy brown color with gorgeous ruby red highlights and a decent size off-white head that recedes at a normal pace; moderate carbonation bubbles continue to rise with sticky khaki lacing along the edges as it recedes.
Aromas begin with tart dark fruits, vinous red wine, tart cherries and oak. As it warms you get some of the base beer with a toasted bready almost caramel maltiness and some granny smith apples. Really smells like a caramel covered apple more and more as it warms. 
The tastes begin with lightly sour dark fruits, light vinous berries, oaky wood and ever emerging earthy notes. While there is no real bourbon flavor you get some vanilla and butterscotch flavors associated with the toasted bourbon barrel.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium high carbonation to it. Finish is slightly acedic and dry overall.
Overall this was a super surprise for me in a good way. I was intially hesitant on this beer because I am not a fan of cherries in beer, but I think more and more that it is that artifical cherry flavor associated with some Krieks or beers like Mad Elf. This has real dark sour cherry fruit flavors, mixed with the oak induced bourbon and vinous flavors which complement each other quite well. Not as stellar as Sang Royal but a slouch my no means. 1,290 charactersclaspada, Aug 15, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750ml 2011 bottle.
Sang Noir has a great dark red color, more burgundy to dark brown, but lots of red hues, fairly opaque with a great offwhite head that rises about a finger high, lingers momentarily and then recedes into a solid layer of film atop the beer, just a touch of lacing is apparent. The aroma is rather subdued, but all the elements are wonderful, lots of dark tart fruit, plums, red apples, cherries and dark grapes lead to wood, just a hint of bourbon and even some chocolate notes, but I wish it popped more. The flavor is where this beer shines, perfect balance of tart fruit, acidic sourness, and smooth rich flavors. Tart cherries, apples and red grapes lead the way, not overly acidic but there is some vinegar, subtle bourbon, a nice hint of charred wood and it has a nice earthiness to it, almost like the pits or stems from the fruits are in there as well, such a great complex balance of flavors. Spot on body, nice a lively, but still being rather big and on the lower end of the carbonation spectrum that gives it a nice sipping quality.
Verdict: One of the best sours from Cascade, who is arguable the United State's premier sour maker. Such a great blend of rich deep flavors from the bourbon and tart fruit from the wine barrels. 1,260 characterskevanb, Aug 11, 2012

1 finger fine light brown head with good retention. Beer is a clear but dark reddish-brown clay. Lacing is patchy and spotty with good stick. Oily legs. Near perfect. 
Nose is bright red fruit, wet wood, some light tartness, and a Brett/cobweb funkiness. Real light, crisp, and lively. Nice.
Opens red fruit tartness. Some vinegar and alcohol but its quickly overtaken by cherry sweetness. Smooths out nicely towards the middle with some creaminess. More red fruit tartness at the end giving way to Brett and a woody funkiness at the end. Great complexity and balance with the flavors. Finish is red fruit sweetness with a tart aftertaste. Very very good.
Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth with some small bubbles in the mouth and goes down oily and slick. Messy finish with a lingering aftertaste. Good body given what it is. Complements the flavors well.
I didn't know what to expect from this though Cascade has had a long history of making very solid fruit sours. This is no exception and in fact, may be the best of the bunch I've had yet. An incredible beer all around. 1,172 charactersSpeedwayJim, Aug 10, 2012

Appearance- Dark red with brown hues sit below a bone colored head that stuck around for quite a while. Nice looking beer!
Smell- Cold, as requested by the bottle (40* F), I get lots of tart cherries and a lactic tartness, with a nice vinous quality behind it all. But as it warms up, the complexities come out. The sweetness of the bourbon comes in to play and the tartness is turned down just one notch. The cherries still come through to play with the oak notes. Awesome nose once warmed up, I wish I hadn't split this bottle so I could enjoy another glass!
Taste- Very tart up front, with a touch of 'pixie stick' candy sweetness. Cherries are present and are accented nicely by the very subtle bourbon notes. The bourbon and vanilla oak qualities bring this beer to the next level. It's barely there, lurking in the background, and just plays so well with the tart cherry note. Vinous notes seem to fade just a touch once it's warmed up. There's also a very mild funk present throughout the entire palate.
Mouthfeel- Fairly light and nicely carbonated
Overall- This one didn't come cheap, but I'd like to pick up another bottle. If you can get this one, I highly recommend doing so! 1,243 charactersmahak213, Aug 09, 2012

Tart, vinous aroma with lots of dark fruit, funky bugs and earthy oak.  Whiskey is subtle but the red wine notes are huge.  Toasted oak and vanilla with grape, tart cherry and other dark berries.  Funky brett is prominent but not too strong because of the sweetness and barrel character. 
Tart, puckering medium body with a strong red wine barrel presence. Dry toasted oak with subtle lactic funk and a ton of vinous sweet fruit.  Hints of grape, tart cherry and other dark berries provide the perfect amount of sweetness to counter the sourness.  Slight acidity but not harsh or solvent like.  Tart and dry with lingering acetic vinegar presence that leaves me drooling formore.  Decent amount of sourness but very well balanced and easy to drink. 897 characterscorby112, Aug 08, 2012

Sang Noir goes out pretty dark red almost faded black but more of a badly burnt brown color shifting towards red. An off white head that is short lived with no stick. Smell is pretty promising. A nice amount of oak underlined with some bourbon tomes and wet wood. Some small berry scent with some lactic funk rising up. Taste is tart, leading in with big wood, oak, small bourbon, dark cherry and a lot of lactic sourness in the end, perhaps too much. The beer pretty much stays neutral from cold to room temp. The feel is medium and has some bubbles. The lactic blast is felt when getting this down the gullet though. It causes heartburn, quite unsettling. This is tasty beer, yet a bit too bitey for me. a 3rd of the bottle was plenty. 785 charactersBARFLYB, Aug 07, 2012

Pretty purple ale with some light pink surface bubbles. Up front in the nose for me are the bing cherries and pinot notes. Nice and full bodied with a hint of ink and cassis. Some hints of alcohol and oak alongside leather and sweat. I like the already. The flavor carries more of the grape than I'd anticipated - refined, plummy and juicy. A bit of booze (maybe whiskey..) comes through just in the back end, but as an accent and overture - really nice. Medium bodied with moderate on hi carb. I like this beer - just ordered four bottles. 577 charactersharrymel, Aug 07, 2012

O: excellent, would have again. I'm still not a huge fan of very dark sours, but this one didn't display any roasted notes to me. Only real downside was it may be more delicious if it were 7% ABV instead of nearly 10%. $22 per 750ml from the brewery. 690 charactersHolland, Aug 06, 2012

A: Pours a reddish/brown/burgundy color with a foamy off-white head, about 1-2 inches in height. Nice head retention with some foamy lacing forming on the glass. 
S: A nice acetic/vinegar aroma right away with some tannin aromas, cherries, oak, and a hint of vanilla. There is a slight hint of bourbon, but it is very faint compared to the tart/cherry aromas. 
T: A much brighter explosion of cherries on the flavor profile. There is also some grape and a bit of plum. Slight oak and a bit of bourbon comes through. Nice tartness. 
M: Medium bodied with medium to high carbonation. Nice tartness. 
O: The first beer I have had from Cascade and I am a big fan. I look forward to trying their other beers in the future. Kinda dig the bourbon coming through underneath the sour/cherry flavor. 830 charactersmdaschaf, Aug 06, 2012

The pour is a deep mahogany color with an off-white head. Smells of red wine, oak, and red wine vinegar, with a light balsamic character. Some dark fruit aromas are also present such as raisin, plum, and black cherry. Quite tart on the palate with good fruit notes of cherry and plum. The red wine character is strong and there is lots of tannic oak to it. Lactic tartness, a hint of red wine vinegar, and a mild leather note. Another good one from Cascade. 484 characterswomencantsail, Aug 05, 2012

4.77/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52011 vintage, picked up at a bottle shop in Seattle. Tasted 26 June 2012, reviewed from notes.
Pours a deep nutty brown color, fairly clear but with a faint yeast haze, even with a gentle pour. A more vigorous pour yields a yeast-clouded glass (and a slightly different taste). One finger of yellowish head, good retention and very nice lacing.
Smell is full of lovely tart cherries. It has a very pleasant fruity sour aroma, not acrid at at all. Full, balanced, and potent.
Taste is fantastic. A wonderful blend of sour cherries, with a touch of sweetness for balance, that gently flows into a slightly mouth-puckering straight-up sour. I love the transitions, as the cherries and light sweetness fade away, leaving the acidity and sour to come to the fore. A very, very tasty sour, and one of the best I've had the pleasure of tasting.
Mouthfeel is just as it should be. Solid but delicate, with the high alcohol providing some lift. Carbonation is medium-high, as it should be for a sour (IMO), and keeps things dancing on the palate.
This is simply an outstanding fruit sour. It has a hefty dose of sour, but it's not enamel-stripping, and the real highlight is the balance. One of the best that I've had, and I really can't think of how I would improve on it. Delicious. 1,280 characterszeledonia, Aug 02, 2012

S- astringent sour raspberries assault me the second the cork is launched to the ceiling. Light wood notes but mostly raspberry, cherry, red wine and a lactic sour aroma.
T- the foretaste is all sour berry and cherry, while after that a very light wood flavor comes through which brings in a very subtle smokiness followed by a red wine vinegar finish. Very sour, maybe the most sour wild I've had. Medium body.
O- I tried but failed to pick up bourbon but what I did get out of this beer was stunning and I might start touting this as the best sour I've ever had. 788 charactersTschnab, Jul 31, 2012

A: Deep copper with red highlights. Very cloudy appearance. Has two fingers of head that dissipates quickly.
N: Sour cherry, must, barnyard, lactic acid, toasted pie crust, concord grape and raspberry.
T: Lactic sourness, warheads and musty book upfront. A lot of flavors kick in mid-palate. Tart pie cherries, raspberry, a light breadiness, some barnyard and loads of Pinot Noir personality. Finishes with cherry Jolly Ranchers and Lemonheads along with big lactic notes.
M: Light bodied, tart and puckering.
O: Moderate-heavy sourness. Big cherry, raspberry, concord grape and lactic characteristics. Unfortunately there isn’t very much oak apparent and barely any bourbon. Just a hint in the throat if you’re really searching for it. Pinot Noir characteristics are there. A phenomenal Wild Ale and holds up with the best of them! 862 charactersjustintcoons, Jul 31, 2012

Pours a deep, deep red hue with a gorgeous gradient of haze through the glass. Head is a fine, bubbly ring of white. Body is solid, as you'd expect for a beer of this size. I just love the colour and the partial hazing. It looks amazing.
Complex aroma: big oak characters, mingled with true acidity, pinot noir and cherries. Lactic bite comes through to brighten it: despite all of the oak and vinous characters, it feels light overall. Lovely stuff.
Light acidity on the entry gets smoothed by a creamy sweetness, although the acid keeps popping up throughout the palate. Mid-palate has some more vinous and oak notes along with true fresh cherry characters, before a move to rubbed spices and cinnamon on the finish. Wow. Such complexity. The feel is suitably light and crisp.
The only down side is that this is a powerfully acidic brew after a while, and you feel it: you couldn't drink more than one without it starting to hurt. But oh god, is this good. It's so damn good. 1,032 characterslacqueredmouse, Jul 25, 2012

A - Pours deep garnet with one and a half fingers of creamy looking tan head. More head than I expect from the style, with pretty good retention before fading to a collar. Some decent lacing.
S - Big tart cherry aroma with a pretty substantial bourbon presence as well. Vanilla and oak, with some balsamic vinegar. Works surprisingly well. A bit of funk, but much more tartness.
T - Whoa, puckeringly sour initially, with a huge tart cherry presence and some balsamic vinegar. Bourbon notes come in after the initial sour punch fades a bit. The vanilla and oaky bourbon notes are somewhat subtle, but I think that is a good thing here. Some more oak on the finish, but not overly dry.
M - Medium mouthfeel, a little heavier than usual for the style but the flavor profile goes well with a bit of heft. Dry, but not overly so.
O - This is really tasty. The bourbon notes are very subtle, more apparent in the aroma than the taste, and the huge tart cherry aspect is great. Not much funk, but still quite complex. 1,030 characterswarnerry, Jul 24, 2012

A - Dark red body that is pretty damn murky. Two finger high dirty tan head formed and settled down to a thin cap with nice edging. Really thick lacing with crazy retention. Really gorgeous looking beer.
S - I don't mean this in a bad way whatsoever but the aroma reminds me of a cherry infused bourbon, only much much better and milder. Fresh and natural tart cherries lead into warming oak tannins and vanilla. A bit of cinnamon and nutmeg on the finish. Its so complex, layered, and delicious while remaining mild and light. The whisky barrels are noticeable and the pinot barrels seem to just accent and calm down the sourness of the cherries with a bit of vinous red wine notes. Seriously one of the best aromas I have found in a wild ale.
T - Tart and vibrant cherries, oak, vanilla, and cinnamon. A light sour finish with some acetic and vinegar notes that you'll find in a flanders oud bruin. Not as complex or amazing as the nose, but extremely delicious and refreshing. Mouth feel is medium and coating with light carbonation. Alcohol well hidden.
O - I found their Kriek too be enjoyable, but a bit simple. This just puts that beer to absolute shame. What an amazing use of cherries. I think I prefer this to any Belgian kriek or even fruit lambic that I have tried as the whiskey and pinot barrel notes are just so smooth and seem to compliment the bing cherries. World class beer for sure! 1,481 charactersdavey101, Jul 17, 2012

A - Pours a nice rich dark deep ruby/garnet with a nice almost two finger wood tannin hue that fades to leave a thick, dense blanket and nice side lacing.
S - BIG aromas of grapeskin and wood followed by wonderful bing cherries. Tons of great cherry notes, nice and sour with some light funk.
T - Burst of sour cherries up front followed by tart vinegary wine notes (cause after all, vinegar is wine). That wood comes through great, the alcohol isnt too noticeable and the finish is a light flemmy throat type deal. Stuff is tasty. What brings it over the top is that light subtle bourbon notes. Absolutely wonderful.
M - Mouthfeel is really nice, the tart and sourness really pop with the lower carbonation. Very nice.
O - Overall this is a stellar wild ale/sour. The whiskey really adds something nice to this. The only downfall is how damn expensive this bottle is. That all said, its delicious, absolutely delicious. 992 charactersrudzud, Jul 15, 2012

A- Deep ruby red that borders on brown. High carbonation leaves a creamy off-white head that hangs around for the duration of my drinking. Leaves awesome lacing for a sour.
S- Explosive. Tart cherry notes pop immediately upon ripping the cork out, and continue to abuse my olfactory on my first sniff. Besides the delicious cherry bomb, I'm greeted with sweet malt (almost toasty), a bit of barrel (vanilla, slight oak...maybe that's where the toast comes from), and more tartness. Fantastic.
T- Again, big bright cherries pop on the front of the mouth followed by some acidic sourness. Tastes of sweet malt, oak, and vanilla lead to an almost buttery red wine-like finish. Insanely good.
M- Medium bodied with high carbonation that really helps the flavors (especially the cherries) to jump out of the beer. I really can't overemphasize the way this brew "pops" on my palate.
O- One of the best sours (forget American wilds) that I've had. Takes the top spot for me in the Consecration category. Seek and destroy this beer. 1,115 charactersstxSS07, Jul 15, 2012
4.25/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4The beer pours a murky brown with a thin tan head that halos around the glass perimeter. There is some streaky, sparse lacing and an easily regenerable head. The nose is of strong cherries, oak, and acetone. The beer's sweet aroma is balanced by the beer's intense tartness. Also, knowing that the beer sat in bourbon barrels helps you detect the deep, caramelized wood sugars behind the sour cherries. 
The taste is sour and sweet with a hint of cherries and bourbon. It's very drinkable and has a rich, malty backbone to balance out the beer's initially tart mouthfeel. The aftertaste is strictly tart cherries. Overall, this beer is excellent and worth trying...However, it's tough to justify $27 for any beer that you would consume regularly. 746 charactersThePorterSorter, Jul 15, 2012

A: Dark red / mahogany colored murky body. Bubbly head that turns thin quickly. Tons of carbonation raising to top. Very lively and inviting.
S: Funky yeast to start turns to a hefty woody oak aroma with intense notes of dark wine underneath. With all these complex smells I still detect a big sweet malt body. Smells as if a cherry is right in front me. Well-balanced.
T/M: Tangy sour taste jumps out the glass mixed with a tingling bubbly sensation from the carbonation. Sweet&sour juice mouthfeel like bitting a lemon&lime. Just enough sour burn to satisfy my wild yeast craving. Only knock is the overbearing sweetness takes away from enjoying more oak. 
O: Well worth the money at $22/bottle. Well-balanced is an understatement. The huge sour presence is complimented by a strong oak taste and subdued by a subtle cherry sweetness. As far as style similar to Pays Du Soleil from Saint Somewhere, expect a bit more malt body in this one. 981 charactersOne2Remeber, Jul 01, 2012

A: An interesting mixture of dark ruby red and brown. Decent head with considerable lacing.
S: Woah. Lots of sour lactic aromas going on here with a nice malty, fruity background. Just by the smell you can tell this is going to be a sipper.
T: At first you're hit with a puckering sourness that tickles the back of your tongue. The first two or three sips all I really got was lactic sour. After my palette got accustomed to the sourness, I was welcomed by gushing sour cherry flavors with an interesting malty background. Very nice.
M: Sour?!
O: A little pricey, but well worth it. I'm just getting into sours, and this one gave a nice interesting twist on how I perceive them. I've basically only had fruit lambics from Cantillon before this, and it was nice to see an almost brown ale aspect built into the sourness. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on it. I look forward to trying other stuff from Cascade. 1,003 charactersLordquackingstic, Jun 27, 2012
4.42/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750 mL bottle poured into a snifter.
Appearance - Deep red brown with a small head. Residual bubbles persist. From the name Sang Noir, I expected this to be darker. It's really even more red than a a Flanders Red.
Smell - Awesome. Cherries all over initially. Great cherry aroma. As it warms, I get a lot of green apples, which normally wouldn't be appealing, but somehow works here. Bourbon around the edges of the aroma, but it's faint. The vanilla is more prominent. I don't get a lot of the wine in the nose.
Taste - Less exciting, but still quite good. The cherry flavor is still solid and it comes through as a nice lactic sourness. The sour apples don't come through in the flavor as much. The wine is present, especially in the finish, and it lends a creamy smooth feel to the finish, diminishing the acidity just a little bit. The barrel adds a nice dimension to it that I didn't get the first time I had it. There is enough malt presence to carry lighter notes of bourbon and vanilla, to a greater extent.
Mouthfeel - The sour fruit flavors is very clean up front with the wine cutting it at the end to cut the intensity of the sourness. After a bit, the pucker gets a shade too strong. The red wine flavors help.
Overall - This got much better as it warmed. When it's cold, it's all cherry flavor. As it warms, the wine comes out and the body becomes more appealing. Upon a second drink of this beer, I'm more an more impressed by its complexity. The barrels each add separate dimensions and the fruits are dynamic. Superb sour. 1,544 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 26, 2012

Appearance. Pours a murky brown with a little orangy-red and a finger of light kakhi head that leaves some great lacing.
Smell. WOW!!! Big juicy tart cherries, some malt vinegar and honeydew mellon, a little lemon and spice with some earthy funk and fresh hardwood. This stuff smells really, really good.
Taste. Sour and tart cherries and blackberries with some tanic wood, there's just a bit of caramel vanilla and some great tannic woodyness, especially in the finish. EDIT: 9.2%, are you fucking kidding me?? Dangerous stuff here.
Mouthfeel. Medium+ body with lively medium+ carbonation. 
Overall. Very tasty beer that I found more complex than other Cascade offerings, but still (a little too) easy to drink. I need to get more of this! 783 charactersRutager, Jun 25, 2012

Very tart aromas strike right off the bat backed up by notes of sour cherries, funk, dark red fruits and a touch of leather. Very aromatic and sour at the same time.
Wonderful medium bodied feel that is extremely tart and sour. This is mouth puckering with flavors of sour cherries, leather and loads of dark red fruits.
This is one of the best flemish styled reds that I've had. A wonderful beer that encapsulates what a sour is all about. 542 charactersKDawg, Jun 22, 2012

A- Dark cranberry red body with a foamy light pink cap. Retention compares to most Wild Ales, quick fizz out. A good web of lace from the ring.
S- Somewhat like raspberries somehow but that seems to be the case with a lot of fruit lambics, even if they are cherry. Cherry comes too with wood and sour notes as well.
T- Cherry fruits and acetic/vinegar up front. This acetic flavor builds with each sip adding a characteristic I like. Oak can be felt but I am left searching for Bourbon.
MF- Silky moderate and acidic oily body. Pretty heavy sourness in the finish with a smooth feel overall.
Big sour cherry fruit bomb with a barrel but not Bourbon backing. Comparable to Cantillon or Russian River. 817 characterscbutova, Jun 20, 2012

 - Courtesy of random guys that brought in the bottle, on 15-Jun-12. 
Sourness = High / Vinegar = Low
Only a taster, but I definitely got the bing cherries and the Pinot barrel. I believe it was more crisp and sour, but less vinegary than Supplication.
 - 2012 vintage, 750 mL bottle poured into Hangar 24 Barrelroll snifter glass on 6-Apr-14. 
Very old bruin-like in both aroma and flavor. Deep oak tannins with both the red wine and bourbon influences up front. Nice bing cherry flavors, but surprisingly the high sourness mellowed out and overtaken by the mellow acetone increase, which some might find off putting but it's all good to me. This reminds me of a mixture of Supplication and Cuvee de Tomme. Overall, another Cascade sour you can't go wrong with. Below is a list of the Cascade sours I've tried ranked in order of preference.

4.15/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A solid pour yields a dense two finger head of tan head. Receiding it leaves some lacing. Murky deep reddish brown, but more brown. Very complex aroma brings cherries and vanilla along with light vinegar and damp woody must. Strangley cocoa too. The flavor is equally as complex if not more. Sweet vanilla and cherry open this up, followed by two distinct layers of sour. 1st a more lactic sour and 2nd a more acetic vinegar sour. There is alot going on here, I also get plenty of wet, woody barrel. The whiskey barrel is more prominent then the pinot, but maybe I am mistaking some cherry flavor for pinot barrel? Medium in body, but drying in the finish with a lingering cherry quality.
Overall sometimes less is more, this beer may be a bit much and could use a little less. The marrage of all the flavors is not seamless, but still works well. In any event I have really been wanting to try this for a long time, can't believe it made it to my market. Really, really enjoyed this. 984 characterspmlondrigan, Jun 19, 2012

Pours hazy maroon, tan head. Retains well as a thick cap and leaves good lace.
Nice scent, pretty good strength, good mix of cherries and sourness, some caramelly notes, not getting any bourbon.
Big fresh, tart cherries, oak, vinegar, very solid balance of fruit sour and here. Some caramel malt and yeast coming through. Very fruit forward but a decent acidic/sour kick as well, Really no bourbon but pretty great nonetheless.
A little spritzy on the mouthfeel but overall it's good, nice balance/sourness is not overbearing, drinks extremely easy for the alcohol content, probably wouldn't guess this was over 6%.
Really, really good, but I do wish there was more bourbon presence as I was intrigued to see how that would blend with a big fruity sour. But great, intense cherries and nice sour kick here, not sure I'd want to pay for another bottle however.
** 10/12/14 - Tried another bottle of the same vintage at a tasting. Definitely nice bourbon presence coming through now. Adds some alcohol heat but mellows the sourness a bit and melds well. 1,215 charactersChico1985, Jun 18, 2012

Thanks to Corregidore for sharing
App- Looking at this beer was like looking at a flowing bloodshot. Deep deep crimson and auburn colors with only a quick receding off white head. Maybe a few bubbles around the edges
Smell- The vinegar and oak gets me at first. As it settles and warms a little bit the other cherry notes come out with a certain tart vs. sour note and a bit more of a sweet note vs. malty as well. The red ale seems really hidden.
Taste- A very nice sour. The cherries are incredible layered and textured with only traces of the booze coming into play. The malts from the red ale tend to amp up the flavor of the oak a bit. 
Mouth- A bit of a thicker body than I was hoping for with a solid medium body and a medium carbonation. Residual vinegar and cherry wine like notes.
Drink- It was very tasty. Glad I have a bottle to sit on for a bit to let flavors meld a little bit. 963 charactersFosterJM, Jun 17, 2012

The sour cherries stand out in the aroma although it continuously changed as warmed. Lots of oak character as well along with just a kiss of bourbon and vanilla. As it warmed, more tannins came into play too
Flavors starts out with a big heaping of sour cherries. The bourbon is present throughout, but stays well in the background. Some oak, tannins and vanilla characteristics came out more as it warmed. The warmer it got the more the pinot and bourbon barrels asserted themselves.
Medium mouthfeel with good carbonation levels. Alcohol is very well hidden. Had I not known different, I would've pegged this at 6-7%
Been looking forward to trying this one for a while and it definitely lived up to expectations. One of the more complex sours I've had, every sip was something new and delicious. The evolution of it from slightly chilled to room temperature was also good as different elements shone through more at various temps. Absolutely phenomenal beer. 1,050 charactersjmarsh123, Jun 16, 2012

It pours a murky rusty colour, started off with over a finger head of foam but that quickly dissipated. Very little lacing left behind.
You can certainly smell the sour cherries and the oak barrel. Some slight note of vanilla there. My nose is happy.
Tart cherries up front in the taste, oak flavours not so much. Alcohol extremely well hidden when it comes to what sits and swirls in my mouth, some definite warming during and after the swallow. Sour, yeah, but not overly so. Very slight hint of a vinegar sourness so I don't *think* that heartburn will be an issue.
Very tasty from the get go; I opened it at near room temp to get all of the flavours rather than opening after pulling from the fridge.
A delightfully delicious Wild Ale that I wish had a bit less alcohol to make it even more drinkable; as is, it's still and an easy drop to tip back.
I'm very impressed with what Cascade has made here. They sure do know their s*it. 994 charactersBitterbill, Jun 12, 2012

Poured out with a lot more pink than I thought, small formation of head on it. Aroma, nice, cherry, wine, less barrel aroma than I was expecting originally.
Same with the taste, this had more in common with sang royal than it did vlad the impaler or bourbonic plague. A lot more red fruit and tangy sourness than barrel character. Would never even know that it had anywhere near 9% alcohol, thankfully they print it. 
Found it to be much fruitier, lighter, more vibrant than Consecration. Consecration seems like so much darker, darker fruit. Currants v. cherries you know? Carbonation seemed perfect on this beer to deliver all its high points. 
This is a pretty easy beer for me to really get into. Cherries, sourness, mild barrel character that is way in the background. 895 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jun 11, 2012

Pours dark crimson with a brownish tinge and a quarter inch head of bone. Erratic, short strands of lacing throughout the glass with a partial skim coat on the surface.
Aromatics lead off with red wine and cherries with hints of bourbon, chocolate, and light roast following through. Quite vineous and fruity with plenty of complex barrel character.
Medium bodied with a sharp-as-tacks mouthfeel. Slightly waxy but does not detract.
Sour stone fruit and red wine start the palate with a fairly intense lactic sourness attack quickly following through. The jowels do water with plenty of puckering tartness, but the beer falls short of throat burn. Hints of roast, chocolate, cherries, and bourbon linger.
Finishes with plenty of lactic sourness, soured fruit, and vineousity.
Wowza, what a beer. A real sour lovers specimen with plenty of intensity and complexity. Highly cellerable, for sure. 913 charactersbrewandbbq, Jun 02, 2012

Clear crimson body with a head that crackles away quickly. Smells strongly of bourbon and acetic acid, with an unpleasant metallic note that dissipates as the beer warms up. Vinegar seems dominant over the typical Cascade lacto character. Cherries are barely present on the nose. The palate is similar, very bourbon-heavy and rather sweet, with milder vinous notes and a hint of cherry. Stomach-churning acidity is pervasive and makes this beer a chore to drink after 2 or 3 oz. Pretty harsh and unrefined stuff, but not bad. 541 characterslargadeer, Jun 01, 2012

Pours a hazed, dark brown ruby with a transient, thin head of tan bubbles; not much lace or retention. Nose as dominated by vinegar and tannins, cherry, vanilla and light acetic notes. Red wine and cherry are forefront in flavor with an underlying acidity and oak with mild vanilla sweetness.

Amazingly bright and lively nose of bing and sour cherries, pinot noir, slight hint of bourbon, horse blanket, Brett funk, and a vague but pleasant spiciness.
The flavor is intensely sour cherry and pinot, with subtle, and beautifully integrated support from the bourbon barrel aging. More dark fruits emerge as this nectar is sipped, and there is the same delicate spiciness that was in the aroma. There is a gluhkriek quality to this wild beauty that is softer, and more complex than any spiced kriek I've ever tasted, and an immediacy to the flavor that few beers can emulate.
I'm off to my gourmet beer shop tomorrow to buy them out on this happy birthday weekend. 762 charactersImpfan, May 26, 2012

A - Pours a deep dark crimson red with a thin lacing. One could get lost in the dark red colors.
S - Smells of dark fruits, sweet cherries and acetic tartness. Pinot and bourbon are present but faint. 
T - Oh yeah. This is where it really takes off. Tastes of dark fruits, cherry and red wine are the major players here. The bourbon notes offer the perfect accompaniment. There is the standard cascade lactic sour bite. Possibly more subdued that some of their others, however. The bourbon and pinot barrels really tie this one together.
M - Medium body with a decent carbonation. Sour.
O - This beer will not disappoint. Absolutely fantastic sour ale. Similar to the RR consecration but better. The pinot and bourbon barrels add a unique and charming character to this beer. I have had the pleasure of tasting a 4 year vertical and this one really changes with age. Word is that they will be bottling later this spring. You will want to get several bottles - some for now and some for a few years down the road. One of, if not the, best sour ale made in America today. 1,108 charactersstaggerlee024, Mar 30, 2012

3.97/5  rDev -10.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Many thanks to Drabmuh for sharing at a tasting.
Appearance: ruby-mahogany pour, decent head and lacing.
Smell: Cherries, oak, touch of vinegar. Very vinous and tannic.
Taste: Again, very vinous. Cherries and tons of oak with some nice tart/sourness. Everyone seemed to compare it to consecration but I would not put it on the same pedestal as I found the flavors slightly muddled.
Mouthfeel: full body, light carbonation
Overall: tasty but I was expecting much more from this one. 486 characterscraytonic, Feb 15, 2012
4.37/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4At the time of this review, this is the #4 top beer on the "Top Beers - American Wild Ale" list, top 5 beer on a competitive list, awesome.
Growler shared at a local tasting, this beer is very reminiscent of Consecration from Russian River, perhaps not as heavy but my first and last thought was very consecrtation like.
Beer is dark brown / amber hazy with a thin lazy head of tan small bubbles, no lacing, some carbonation. Looks fine.
Aroma is cherry, sweet, no bourbon, oak, some wine. Lactic, tannic, mild vanillic, and mild acetic acid nose.
Strong beer, thin to medium in body, sweet mildly up front with a winy, oaky, finish, decent throughout. Great beer but not Earth shattering. 693 charactersdrabmuh, Feb 14, 2012
4.35/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to barleywinefiend for snagging this longtime want and getting it to drabmuh and I, thus setting up the Cascade sour tasting. Served in a Cascade Barrel House goblet.
Pours a mostly-clear crimson color with a short off-white head and a bit of lacing as it goes down. Thin collar throughout. Really a nice color.
The nose starts out with plenty of red-wine notes and lactic acid on the first pour when it's quite cold. As it warms, the cherry starts to come out along with a touch of oak. I'm not sure if whiskey-barrel portions are still used in the blend, as I don't get much of that. (Side note: I wish that were stronger, as adding a bit of Bourbonic to a shot glass of this made it even better.)
The flavor takes the components to the next level, creating a more-complete beer. The red-wine notes are still strong and work really well with the acidity from the lacto. The cherries complement those characteristics perfectly. A bit of oak in the background rounds things out. The Pinot and light oak tannins combine beautifully with the acidity to produce a fantastic mouthfeel. Light with good carbonation and a brisk, acidic finish.
Overall, a really solid beer. I had waited a long time to be able to grab this one, and it delivered. At the same time, I think it could have been a truly great beer with a bit more whiskey character in the blend, sort of a Cherry Adam from the Wood with red wine and acidity. Still, a very nice beer that I would love to have again. 1,487 charactersThorpe429, Feb 12, 2012

Smells tart. The flavor carries more oak and is tannic in nature. The bourbon is there, but cherries and a tart sourness are the primary flavors. Acetic finish with some alcohol presence. Similar to Russian River Consecration, a beer of which I am very fond. Very tasty. Overall, I am very glad to have tried this. 433 charactersHuhzubendah, Feb 11, 2012

Pours a reddish brown with a thin white head. Smell is a great mix of red wine and oak. Flavor follows the nose, great mix of sour and red wine flavors, pretty similar to Consecration. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice beer from Cascade, but not quite worthy of the high praise it has received. 396 charactersstarrdogg, Feb 11, 2012

Blended gets a bad vibe, but this ruby lady puts that notion to rest. Cab / Oak / Whiskey / Beer / Sour / Cherries ; these are all nice things delivered into one single glass. Who would complain ?
Delicious beverage - cannot really be called a beer anymore as it has taken on the characteristics of much more than just that.
Rock on Cascade - thanks Biscuit for the great barrel bevs ! 551 characterskitty66, Apr 03, 2011

On tap at the barrel house.
A: Deep crimson tinged brown with a mountainous light brown head, great retention and lacing.
S: Huge lactic sour cherry presence with vinous notes of dark grape and plum. Oak is evident, as is a light acetic quality. Light whisky notes and a touch of chocolate.
T: A moderate lactic sourness accompanies cherries, grapes, plums, and oak. Piquant and delicious. Light notes of chocolate are short lived. Great fruit presence, especially the cherries. I detect a touch of oak and whiskey. Excellent.
M: Upper medium body, upper moderate carbonation. Silky mouthfeel.
Overall: Awesome beer. Killer fruit presence combined with the wine and whiskey barrels. Drinks like a beer half its ABV. Highly recommended. 752 charactersHopHead84, Dec 17, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5On tap at the barrel house today.
The beer pours a darkish red amber color with fairly decent head retention and minimal lacing. One really gets a considerable amount of wine on the aroma profile, with some dark fruits and vanilla as well. On the palate, this beer is just delicious. I get a considerable amount of pinot noir, with very light sour, sweet grapes, chocolate and juniper berries. Mouthfeel is medium to full, with a long, soft, mouthfilling finish. Drinkability is amazing in this beer, and frankly flat out dangerous. Where is the 9.5% alcohol? It's completely undetectable in this excellent beer.
I'm not a big sour fan, but after sampling this stunner, I found myself saying something I've never said before with a sour beer... "may I please have another?" This is an amazingly good, complex and extremely well made beer. Impressive!
Edit from 12/13/10 visit to the barrel room. Was told that they are now out of the 2009 edition, but had just put on the 2010 version. While fairly comparable to the 2009 version, the fresh 2010 version comes across as a bit more acidic and sour. There's still more than enough going on for me to enjoy this excellent beer, but as I'm not a huge sour fan, I found myself longing for the 2009 version (which I thought showed a bit more fruit and vanilla, and was not quite as sour). Regardless, there's no doubting that this is one fine beer from the folks at Cascade. 1,421 charactersJohn_M, Oct 12, 2010
4.83/5  rDev +9.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served on-tap in a snifter at the Cascade Brewing Barrel House
A- Deep red mahogany colour with a hint of chestnut around the edges. Light cream coloured head which dissipated almost immediately.
S- A strong aroma of cherries hits the nose initially. A sharp hint of whiskey rounds out the scent.
T- The taste opens with sour cherries, accompanied by rich grape flavours, likely from the pinot noir barrels. Alcohol presents itself lightly in the finish in the form of whiskey. A yeasty twinge indicative of a sour Belgian continues throughout.
M- Lightly carbonated, light body - lighter than the colour indicates.
D- I could drink this over and over and would still want more. It would be especially excellent on a hot day...with the sound of a mandolin being gently strummed and the slow, steady creak of a well-used rocking chair on a hot summer day. 859 charactersShanonbanana, Oct 05, 2010

a - dark brown color with a violet hue, half-inch ivory head with light retention and lacing, fairly cloudy
s - big tart dark fruit aroma, black cherry, blackberry, current, light oak and tannic hints
t - as with the aroma, the taste is dominated by multiple levels of intensely tart dark fruit, black cherry and current flavors are prominent, light sweetness from the fruit balances out the tartness a bit, as does a light dirty sock funkiness, lactic acid permeates the entire taste with oak notes rounding out the flavor nicely, a little heat is detectable on the finish, but the 9.5% abv is remarkably absent in the taste
m - medium-bodied, with carbonation on the lower side, fairly tart and dry finish but there is a light sweetness to make the beer a little easier on the palate
d - incredibly drinkable for a 9.5% sour ale, flavors are very complex and interesting, the booze is very well hidden and the tartness is prominent but balanced out relatively well with the light sweetness
Awesome stuff that I feel quite lucky to have tried a couple snifters of at Belmont Station. I'm more and more impressed with Cascade every beer I have. This was the standout of the evening with the other two beers at the event, Noyeaux and the Manhattan Transfer, also showing very, very well. 1,356 charactersWeisGuy, Jul 16, 2010

A. Darkness, far darker than I had expected. Real deep ruby with a brown and gold hue in there at certain times. Wasn't expecting this color. Pretty cool looking sour. Nice lacing off-white head.
N. The nose is strong of Brett, oak and dark malty sugars. A lot going on here. Sour cherry and tartness really dominates here in addition to other dark berries.
T. Wow! This one is tart in the most perfect way. Full flavors of sour cherries, currants, yeast and some barnyard funk. Oak barrels, a little chocolate and bitterness on the back end. Amazingly complex all the way through. I'm sure that I am missing something here... Oh yeah, I don't notice the high ABV at all.
M. A perfect amount of carbonation. Sour, sweet, and highly refreshing. A medium bodied beer that was well enjoyed. Wait, this beer was 10%?! One of the easiest to drink beers of that high of ABV ever.
D. I was sad when it was all over. Wish this one was bottled. One of the best wilds I have ever had. And one of the best beers I have ever had for that matter. Fantastic beer from a great brewery! 1,108 characterselliot23, Jul 15, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Draft at Sourfest 2009 at Brouwer's. 
Pours a nice black/dark burgundy with a solid tan head and nice lacing. At first, cherry and grapes dominate the sweet aroma with hints of blackberry. But as it warmed, a great wood began to dominate. This was a nice sweet beer balanced incredibly well with the sourness. This had a little wild carbonation but a nice long sour finish. As this got warmer, the beer became more and more complex as various flavors came out. This was the highlight of Sourfest for me (and I sampled it three times throughout the day to make sure) and one of the best beers I've ever had. 607 charactersChrisPro, Jul 12, 2010

1/2 finger tan head, good retention, reddish brown opaque body, trails of carbonation rising up side of glass, Nose is huge frickin' cherry hit up front, more sour than sweet, little if any hops, with oak notes becoming more prominent as the beer warmed. Taste is cherry domination, tart, funky, sweet, some oakiness, all in balance an incredibly complex tasting beer. Mouthfeel is fairly full, not a lot of effervescence, not sticky despite the sweetness. Drinkability is high despite the ABV, just a crazy tasty beer. Thirty months of barrel aging, along with the sublime blending of Ron Gansberg, one of America's best Wile Ale brewers results in this truly amazing beer. An absolute must for aficionados of the style. Very highly recommended. 800 charactersjdense, Jul 03, 2010

Sang Noir by Cascade Brewing is a barrel aged sour brewed with cherries and 8% abv. It poured a pitch red dark brown with a hint of black. It smelled of cherries, Brett and sweet malts. It tasted sweet and sour with cherry goodness, malt and oak notes. It was my favorite of the bunch, but I am a fan of Cascade and any sours, so I'm partial. 382 charactersfemALEist, Mar 25, 2010

Smells heavy of dark fruits. The Taste is delicious, very tart. It has lots of chery, fig and raisin flavors but is not sweet at all, mixes in well with the wood flavor from the barrels. The mouth feel is very pleasant, with just enough carbonation to make this go down smoothly. It's crazy how smooth this beer is for 10% abv 436 characterssomabeer, Mar 14, 2010
4.89/5  rDev +10.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On draught at the lodge, served in a cervoise, Sang Noir with a small tan collar. 
Smell is gorgeous. Bright lacto and dark malts bring a very nice sweet tarts aroma that is just amazing. 
Taste is great as well, very complex and a pleasant different from many of their other wild ales due to the dark malts. Big sourness, cherries, chocolate and lime tonic water. 
Mouthfeel is oily and slick, sliding down like an oyster but with nice carbonation with swished. Medium bodied. 
Drinkability is insanely good. This is their best beer I've had yet. I'm a big fan of sour darks, and this one really kills it. The intense flavor hides the strong ABV, making this one potentially very dangerous. 703 charactersccrida, Feb 20, 2010
