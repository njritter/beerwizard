4.28/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25appearance- Golden amber color, cloudy with some visibility, and pours a one inch head.
aroma- Grapefruit, pine, berries, and a sweet bready malt.
taste- Noticeable taste of berries up front followed by grapefruit and orange citrus flavors. Finish has a combo of sweet citrusy hops and little bit of bread malt.  There's some bitterness in the middle, but its mild.
feel- Medium carbonation and medium feel. Finish is mostly clean with minimal residual sweetness.
overall- Great ipa and deserving of the acclaim. The mosaic hops are showcased very well with berries and sweet citrus flavors, and a clean malt that makes for a easy drinker. Can't think of much that would improve this; maybe a little more bitterness but that's minor. 737 charactersCTbrew32, May 05, 2017

A: Pours a slightly hazy, golden orange in color with a one inch, frothy, paper white head with good retention. Thick, billowy white lacing throughout.
S: Mostly aromas of citrus including orange, grapefruit, and tangerine with lighter notes of caramel malts and piney hops.
T: Citrus forward SMASH IPA with notes of grapefruit, orange, pineapple, and mixed berries. Light piney hop bitterness.
F: Light to medium bodied. Velvety smooth, pillowy mouthfeel. Slight dryness on the finish. Light carbonation.
O: Overall, this is a great SMASH IPA. Citrusy and super crushable. Mouthfeel is light and pillowy, on point. Great stuff. Would definitely try this again and would like to try it fresh. 751 charactersBeerGuy8315, May 02, 2017

4.08/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a Duvel tulip.  Label says 03/27/17.
A- Pours a semi-hazy medium amber color with a 3/4 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a large side patch of bubbly surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves large clots behind.
S- Great classic mosaic hop nose with a nice cereal grain malt sweetness to support it.  
T- Flavor doesn't quite live up to the nose.  The hop character is decent but a bit limp and overshadowed by the malt presence.  Bitterness is on the lower end of the spectrum.  Very easy to drink, just not super vibrant.
M- Somewhat dry and a bit sharp from the hops.  Medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- A solid IPA but not one that I would actively seek out again. 779 charactersImmortale25, Apr 29, 2017

Many other IPAs from closer breweries haven't held up nearly so well. It was clean, light, and refreshing with bright hop flavors.

Still, I really enjoyed my pour and look forward to trying another. 372 characterskool-aid, Apr 12, 2017

Beautiful packaging - from the bottle shape to the artwork to the varied cap and the cardboard holder. Incredible presentation. Yellow gold pour with slight haze and a fluffy white cap. Aroma is papaya, nectarine and melon. Inviting. The taste is a cascade of citrus hops to smooth malt and a balanced bitterness. Orange rind, guava, tangerine, melon and a faint floral and honey note that surfaces late in the sip. Wow. Very complex flow of flavors. Nothing heavy handed about the hopping - a balanced beer that exhibits grace from start to finish. 619 charactersManapuaMan, Apr 03, 2017

Light golden, transparent body with a white, soapy head. The aroma is unique. Sweet breads, malt, hops, honey, flowers. A hoppy beer for sure. Yet, the malt presence can not be ignored. Normally, I find this as a deterrent. However, the malty sweetness, floral notes, and hoppy character complement one another so well. A terrifically balanced, highly drinkable, intriguing beer. Great stuff. 430 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 24, 2017

L: Not much carbonation, light lacing, and has some kind of sediment floating in it.
S: The smell is just out of this world... it just throws off an immense hoppy aroma.
T:  It has a great taste with significant hop flavor, but it lacks any of the usual bitter leave of a hoppy brew and seems unusually sweet.  The malt seems subtle in spite of its obvious presence making things quite sweet.  Besides the grapefruit taste, it seems almost like there might be a little honey in this.  
Personally, I think this one is worthy of the hype surrounding it, a really fine beer. 733 characterstprinzing, Jan 22, 2017

Citrus, but not too bitter. somewhat mellow, but it works very well together. The feel isn't watery at all. Solid beer from this brewery, and gad I was able to get a bottle of this to enjoy, because I am. 454 charactersVictory_Sabre1973, Dec 11, 2016

Served in a tulip glass
This beer pours an orangish shade of yellow and is hazy. It is topped with two inches of off white head that leaves a little lacing.
It's dank, and it's citrusy.
The taste is full of tropical and citrus flavors with out a lot of bitterness. It is also dank and delicious. 
Medium mouthfeel
A regular trading partner kept asking if I wanted this beer, and I kept blowing it off because I had no idea what it was. He finally sent a couple bottles. I am very impressed. It is delicious and is right in my flavor wheelhouse. Drink it if you see it, and if you don't see it, seek it out. 631 charactersbuschbeer, Nov 23, 2016

A slightly hazy golden-color with about a finger o head. Nice lacing down the glass as I drank this one. 
Lots of citrus smell with tropical fruits, lemon, and some grapefruit. A hint of pine in there with the malts coming out as it breathed. 
Definitely the Mosiac hops come through. The bitterness was moderate with the hops lasting throughout. 
Feel is light with slight carbonation. Was refreshing and a little bitter. 
Good IPA with a refreshing hoppy taste. Would definitely have this one again. 560 charactersKdouble, Oct 30, 2016

The beer pours a fairly hazy copper color, orange and gold hues with a big foamy white head, about two or three fingers high that has great retention and yields plenty of soapy lace. The aroma is nice, earthy mosaic hops, herbal, floral dank properties with nice tropical fruit and some bready malt. Pretty straightforward expression of mosaic. The flavors are nice, again, ample hoppiness, plenty of expected mosaic character, herbal, bitter bitter pine, plenty of tropical fruits, pineapple and guava, citrus peel, dank floral flavors with some stiff breadiness to balance this beer out. The mouthfeel is creamy, coating, medium body with lower carbonation that's smooth with an easy finish that is lightly dry.
Verdict: A nice IPA from Lone Pint, really good SMaSH beer at that. Mosaic is not my favorite hop, but this beer expresses it well with a nice balance of flavors. The bitterness is a bit up there, but all in all, this is a nice beer that will satisfy any hop head. 1,094 characterskevanb, Oct 16, 2016

We went to the Hoppy Monk for after dinner drinks with a crew of mostly non-geeks that ordered amaretto sours all night. The bubbly waitress gushed all over YR when I asked for a great local IPA and she wasn't kidding. Beautiful nose on this one, very reminiscent of some of the more tropical IPA's out there but with a breadier malt bill. Taste follows the nose with hints of blueberry and maybe peach? A totally unexpected surprise that I wish I could have hauled home! 573 charactersHalluxone, Oct 14, 2016

YR had never failed to deliver a top 3 Texas IPA product. That changed this week,  as I bought the new 4 pack of pints. The born date was 9/19, and the purchase was made 9/21, oh yeah-things are looking up already!
The immediate impression of the nose was "wtf" this is world class. The front and back end of a few quaffs confirm that YR has emerged as a true contender for national IPA recognition. 
Well done Lone Pint, this beer is getting better which is hard to do! 548 characterskaidasz, Sep 24, 2016

Aroma is pleasantly fruity with hops. Slightly tropical and grassy. The taste has that previously mentioned grassy fruit hop feel with lowkey bitterness and mild green yeasty bite. The grain essence feels like straw/hay without any residual sweetness.
This is light in body with modest carbonation. It is crisp, easy drinking and quite a decent SMASH recipe from a brewery I never heard of before. Thank you mymrnngjckt for hooking me up with this. 582 charactersstakem, Aug 10, 2016

4.22/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Traded for this a few months ago and also had a sip of this on the Other Half line fairly recently. The ratings for this were really high on here and I'm pretty sure that I'm spoiled by all of the outstanding IPA's that have risen out of nowhere the last few years here in the northeast as I didn't think that this beer was amazing, like so many others on here. This was great and balance but it felt just a bit too light to come across as an IPA...
Great pour to this as the beer had a cloudy, goldenrod hue to it, a massive head full of life, and tons of soapy lacing that slid down the side of my pint glass. Lots of grapefruit and Mosaic sweetness in the nose with a hint of elderflower, as the juice from the blueberry and pineapple tang came through in the taste. Lots of sweet malt, dank resin, and a light carbonation all worked together to give this good depth as the citrus, stone fruit, and berry fruit all melded together quite nicely. 
The alcohol was just right as this almost felt like a Pale Ale rather than an IPA. Plenty of balance here thanks to the generous amount of malt with hardly any bitterness or burn from the hop. This was juicy, slick, and left just a hint of resin once it was all down. A solid IPA that's neither East nor West coast - hopheads and fans of fruit beers would be wise to get their hands on this. Just like Texas, this is an IPA not worth messing with! 1,398 charactersJerzDevl2000, Jul 29, 2016

Was on beer safari in Houston, and was told that I should grab a Yellow Rose before I headed out of town. Had some free time so I drove out to Magnolia and had a fresh pint.  Learned it was a SMASH brew using whole cone Mosaic and toped with heavy dry hopping as well. Went great with the Pilsner malt. Beautiful pour and laced down the glass top to bottom. Best mosaic taste I've had yet. Smooth easy sipper. So simple and so amazing. 475 charactersBillRoth, Jul 18, 2016

4.48/5  rDev +1.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.564 oz growler was poured into a pint glass.
Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a slightly hazy golden yellow color withgood clarity and vision of tiny bubbles coming up through the glass.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank.
Smell:  Lemony, piney, tropical, citrus, stone fruit, pale, and bready malts.
Taste:  I love mosaic hop flavor.  It's that simple.  Simple malt bill with light chewy and bitterness notes in there too.  Lasting hop flavor throughout the sip.  
Mouthfeel:  Light, crisp, refreshing, light bitterness, a little chewy, medium carbonation, and somewhat crushable.
Overall:  I had a sample, then bought a growler, and now that growler is down.  Looks like I'm coming back to TX in the near future. 781 charactersFlounder57, Jun 27, 2016

Smells fresh and clean in terms of mildly dank and full of grapefruit/ fresh blueberry-melon citrus aroma. 
Tastes very smooth with malts and underlying noted of grapefruit and pineapple. 
So smooth. The blueberry note really comes through in aftertaste just right. Citrus, tang, tasty malt backbone. It's all there, just right. 
In other words a successful yet unique IPA. 
And quaffable yes. Reputation I was unaware of until I spotted the bottle and got feedback from a clerk, but reputation deserved. One of the best ipas I've had in recent memory. 681 charactersTBoneJones, Jun 25, 2016

Now there are not enough bottles on the shelves to keep me satisfied.   Smells of grapefruit and a little pineapple.  I dont get the blueberry in the smell, or in the taste.  Taste follows the nose with a perfect bitterness and a slightly dry finish leaving me wanting another sip immediately after.   In love! 535 charactersWRhino272, Jun 16, 2016

L-slightly hazy golden, thin white head.  Beautiful

F-coats the mouth, juicy but also kinda dry, very refreshing and drinkable, medium body

4.39/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed out of a 32 oz swingtop howler on 5/16. I'm almost certain it was filled on 5/6, so it's almost a week and a half old. Amazingly, this is not the freshest I've ever had it. Poured into a Speigelau IPA-specific glass. 
Appearance (4.25) - Pours a mix of light orange and golden amber hues, with the color giving the appearance of a gradient as you move from the darker tones just under the massive three-finger head, down towards the brighter, light-struck yellows and golds at the bottom of the glass. There seems to be some faint haze, but you can still see a certain amount of translucency to the body. The foam is big and tight, with a smattering of slightly larger bubbles that slowly begin to expand throughout the cream-colored head. Retention is excellent, leaving light swaths of lace along the sides of the glass as it recedes and as I drink it down.
Smell (4.5) - A fantastically pungent blend of citrus, melon and herbs just explodes out of the glass--it's that kind of aroma that feels like it sticks up inside your nose even after you're done smelling it. It's one of those beers that makes me sit and bury my nose in the glass until I tire out my olfactory nerves and it doesn't have quite the same punch... until my next drink. But this isn't all hops--there is some light, bready sweetness that is reminiscent of King's Hawaiian. The sweet is fleeting, almost like it's trying to escape your detection.
Taste (4.25) - Alas, the taste isn't quite as full-force as the wonderful aroma, but all of the same players are still at the party. Orange zest, cantaloupe, honeydew, herbs and again, that light bread characteristic is here, but in a bit more proportion to the other elements than it was the nose. I will say that on my initial drink, I was a little disappointed by the tameness of the flavor relative to the smell, but as I power through this howler, that tameness allows for much more enjoyment over the course of my drinking session, as my palate doesn't get blown out and I'm able to continually pick up subtle nuances in the depth of citrus flavor and malt base over time.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - Just about the ideal body for an American IPA--medium and moderately full, with a low-moderate amount of carbonation that gives the feel some texture and interest on the tongue while allowing the flavors of the beer to remain front and center. Finish is semi-dry and leaves my mouth ready for the next drink.
Overall (4.5), a fantastic IPA and one that demonstrates how you can simultaneously have big hop flavors and balance in a non-double/imperial IPA. I've never had anything else from The Lone Pint, but if you can do an IPA this deftly, your work probably warrants a try. 2,706 charactersLambicPentameter, May 20, 2016

Nose expresses light citrus, floral notes and chamomile.  Taste consistent with nose; however, there's also a spicy quality most likely attributable to the mosaic.  Mouthfeel is light in body with a mild, even carbonation.  Overall, a decent beer with a nice complexity which seems more consistent with a farmhouse than an IPA in my opinion. 437 charactersJwale73, May 15, 2016

I had just had a Firestone Walker Union Jack and told my server we might as well shift gears and try a stout or something because I knew he wouldn't be able to bring me an IPA that I liked better.  He asked me if I had had a Yellow Rose  and when I said "no", he twisted my arm a little and I said "bring it on", though I doubted it would be as good as he said. Beautiful color and head and a nose that is amazing.  The hops flavors explode in my mouth like fireworks.  Now THAT is an IPA.  Very pine-y but grapefruit as well. Definitely some dank, earthy notes around the edges. Perfect balance, perfect carbonation...this is just about perfection for me.  Never rated a beer a perfect 5 but what part of this masterpiece isn't perfect?  And it's all from one malt and one hop... amazing! 825 charactersPhilsPils, May 04, 2016

It brings out all the character of the hop - tropical fruits, apricot, mango, and some pine.  Perfectly balanced malt backbone with a huge hop aroma, bitterness, and flavor (many "well balanced" IPA's don't satisfy one's hop craving; this one does just fine). 300 charactersgman1602, Apr 30, 2016

A: Pours a hazed golden color with a one finger bone white head that leaves tons of lace spackled on the glass after each sip.
S: Jesus. Such a great smell to this. Just ridiculously clean and fresh pineapple, mango, blueberry and soft malt notes. I could smell this all day.
T: Way way up there. A nice amount of mango and light grapefruit with just a hint of pine. Closes with smooth honey malt and light pink grapefruit pith. Just an insanely clean beer. One of the best IPAs I've ever come across. 565 charactersnotchucknorris, Apr 19, 2016

Pours a faded orange color with moderate amount of haze.  Nose is mild for mosaic.....hints of citrus and pine.  Taste is amazing.....bitterness up front and tons of citrus and fruit on the back.  Big mango and apricot notes.  Super balanced.  Feel is medium with moderate carbonation.  Excellent representation of the mosaic hop. 381 characterslemmy187, Apr 15, 2016

This one pours a lightly hazy honey yellow, with a small head, and a good amount of lacing.
Smells like pineapple, grapefruit, honey, biscuit malt, and lemon rind. Smells great.
Simplicity is sometimes the best with beers. This is drinking wonderfully hoppy honey. It's got orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and blueberry- it's a Mosaic showcase, and I love it. I don't usually love Mosaic single hopped beers, but this definitely rings my bell. There's just a light smattering of malt, honey and biscuity. 
This is medium bodied, super crisp and light, with no hint of alcohol at all.
This is one of the best IPAs on the market. Holy shit, it's good. 696 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 26, 2016

4.08/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Beautifully sculpted from the mosaic hop and from a short malt underpinning, the masterful brewers at The Lone Pint get the most out of the hops with copious amounts of the lupulin-filled cones and a bright and fruity ester boquet for a taste that falls between that of creamsickle and IPA.
Lightly golden and firmly hazed, the beer's frothy white lather rests just underneath an aromatic matrix that redolent of pineapple and mango, with mouthwatering proportions. Its follow up of citrus, herb and berry gives a tangy scent going into the first taste of supple sweetness. Bready and sweet like angel-food cake, its early taste is succulent and succinct.
Drying softly on the middle palate, the hops begin to dominate more so- pink grapefruit, lemon and gooseberry join the tropical flavors and garner comparisons to sherbet, fruit punch and radiant citrus juices. As the sweetness dissolves, its breadiness remains and supports the malt with a creamy honeycomb of taste and texture. Smoothly bitter to finish, an earthy aura wafts over the session with fresh grass clippings, chive and hints of cannabis oil.
Medium-bodied but still crisp, clean and refreshing- the beer's ripe and tantalizing fruit impressions seems to retain a fructose simplicity that keeps the ale registering fuller than usual. Creamy and dry, the alcohol assists the drying texture while a tart gin and white wine character soon trails. Overall, it's a seriously tropical fruit-filled taste. 1,469 charactersBEERchitect, Mar 24, 2016

Pours an amber pretty hazy body with a white 3 finger head that reduces slowly to leave good lacing and retention.
Aromas seem muted, earthy, peppery, dank, but old hops, makes me wondering how old the bottle was. On the tongue is light citrus, earthy hops, peppercorn, with caramel maltyness and a light bitterness on the finish. Medium body with light carbonation, slightly flat.

Great aroma.  Pineapple, peach, and strawberry(?).  Bright, sweet, and intoxicating.  Biscuit-y malt and some straw.  
Very smooth on the tongue.  Pineapple, sweet grapefruit, peach, mango, and blueberry.  Caramel and dough.  Undercurrents of earthiness.  Floral at the end.
Medium bodied with medium+ carbonation.  Noticeable whoosh when I cracked the cap.  So incredibly smooth, completely crushable.  Lingering tropical flavors.  Dry on the aftertaste.
Whoa.  Tremendous beer.  Maybe the best IPA I've ever had.  Smooth, fruity, tropical, almost perfect.  Need to build a pipeline from the brewery to my house. 791 charactersleroybrown10, Feb 20, 2016

Served in a pint glass
Solid appearance. The super hazy, golden-amber liquid was topped by a tight, creamy, inch-tall crown of off-white froth. The head fell to a thin a thin, foamy cap. Thick, drippy rings of sticky lacing trickled down the glass.
The nose was really hoppy and fragrant. Super fruity. Citrus and tropical notes dominated. Loads of juicy orange. Mango and passionfruit came through strong. Peach and apricot were also noticeable. Sweet and slightly floral. Bit of jasmine tea. There was an interesting fresh, ripe pear note as well.
The flavor profile was just as impressive as the aroma. Super fruity and complex. Juicy orange and tangerine notes came through big time. Loads of peach and apricot. Intense tropical notes. Mango and passionfruit were most apparent. Touch of honey-like sweetness. A bit floral. The beer finished with notes of candied grapefruit and orange peel, and just a touch of pithy bitterness for balance.
Super soft and creamy mouthfeel. Amazingly smooth. The liquid contained an ultra fine, subtle effervescence that frothed up beautifully on the palate.
Some reviewers have noted that Yellow Rose reminds them of a juicy, fruity, Northeast-style hoppy beer, and I have to agree with them. This is an incredibly flavorful, tropical-forward IPA that is amazingly complex yet dangerously drinkable. 1,379 charactersDamian, Feb 15, 2016

3.89/5  rDev -12%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.5Shimmering golden yellow with a massive white foamy head that leaves exceptionally enormous amounts of lacing no matter how many times you sweep over it with liquid.
As others have said, this has pleasant aromas. Refreshing, bright fruits in abundance. Slightly sticky dank with a large mango candy, apple and honey presence.
Sweet with a very slight bite of bitter, hops are incorporated very nicely into the malt, with honey and blueberry elements. Some grassy notes from the pilsner malt, sometimes stronger than I would like. I'm finding more and more that I'm a big fan of the simple mosaic hop--it is showcased here very well in all its herbal, floral and fruity glory, all without needing to tantalize with any of the typical full on tropical expression found in many IPAs.
Smooth and a little sweet but I like the balance. Not a face melting hop bomb, but I don't lean that way anyway. 896 charactersSabtos, Feb 08, 2016

Taste certainly followed...citrus deliciousness and just a bit of pine. I especially love the dry aftertaste...makes me want to take another sip immediately. This was uber fresh and uber refreshing.

Pours a hazy yellow-orange with a one-finger foamy white head that retains nicely.  Smells of citrus & tropical hops; grapefruit zest, mango, papaya & orange.  Taste follows the aromas with lots of citrus and tropical notes, while contributing just a bit of hop bitterness and remaining remarkably drinkable.  Medium body and carbonation leads to a  foamy mouthfeel and crisp finish.

So, here comes Yellow Rose, the pride of Texas IPAs, and I'm feeling as defensive as ever for another hyped brew. Then, it hits your lips -- egad, this is a tremendous brew! The fact that it's a SMASH pils malt + mosaic combo makes this even more incredible. Not just big flavor, but a nice diversity of flavors, which you'd otherwise expect only from a brew with a variety of hops/malts. Glowing orange hues in the glass, nice little enduring layer of foam, hazy, not opaque, though there was some debris in the glass even after a careful pour. Nose isn't ginormous but it's extremely pleasant, light tropical notes, a touch of something herbaceous. I know this is all Mosaic, but something about it reminds me of the better batches of Alpine Nelson. Anyway, the palate is where this shines, those notes from the nose coming out in full bloom, ever so light dankness, excellent bitterness levels, tropical notes, and that great high fruitiness you get from these new waves hops. This is a homerun of a beer and absolutely deserving of the hype. Well done, Lone Pint. 1,171 charactersbreadwinner, Jan 04, 2016

Part of me wants a little more bitter edge to it, but that's a personal shortcoming I think.  Mouth feel is very soft, and the carbonation creates a great viscosity, perfect for the style.  Nailed it all around. 508 charactersaggiearcher13, Jan 03, 2016

4.17/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Many thanks to Cherryadam (Andy) for the chance to try this IPA.
The beer pours a peachy orange color with good head retention and considerable lacing.  The nose is attractive as well, as I pick up considerable orange citrus and tropical fruit.  The flavor profile replicates the nose, and while delicious, the beer struck me as just a bit sweeter/maltier than I would prefer.  Still delicious, but a bit more bitterness and a drier finish would make this beer even better (IMHO).  The beer seemed to be medium bodied for an IPA, with a fairly long, lightly sweet and bitter finish.  Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, and was barely noticeable in this beer.
Very nice IPA.  Would love to be able to try this on a regular basis.
Thanks Andy! 766 charactersJohn_M, Nov 30, 2015

Appearance is hazy golden brown with one finger thick head. Good lacing around the glass.
Smell is floral hops,  grapefruit pith, and onion.
Taste is juicy following the nose with grapefruit pith prominent. There is moderate to low sweetness throughout with good balance added from the bitterness.
Mouthfeel is medium-full in body with fairly low carbonation.
Overall this is an exceptional and juicy IPA, especially when fresh. I enjoy trying SMaSH beers, and this beer is a great representation of Mosaic hops. I will definitely buy again. 587 charactersthatche2, Nov 15, 2015

pours a straw like color with some orange/brown hues in there, a nice white head fills the top of the glass.  The smell is not overwhelming.  Slight tropic flavors, and some sweet malt come through.  The taste is so very well balanced.  Its is not the overly tropic east coast IPA, but also not the piney west coast IPA.  This sits right in the middle of the two.  Nice carbonation, you could drink this beer all day long.  Very happy to have tried it! 480 characters-Rick, Nov 09, 2015

Just enough clean, lightly sweet malt for balance, then a fully dry finish with a medium level of bitterness. Just very tasty. Smooth and extremely drinkable, with a fairly low level of carbonation which works well - almost creamy texture. Quite nice. 450 charactersBeerzebub, Nov 01, 2015

Smell is fresh citrusy and fruity mosiac with hints of pineapple, blueberry and pear. Taste follows the nose, maybe not quite as full, but it packs a lot of flavor for being incredibly light, smooth and easy drinking at nearly 7%. An amazing and almost perfect example of a SMaSH-mosaic IPA. 417 charactersmig100, Oct 31, 2015

Paint brush strokes of pace are left behind.  Nose is so lovely and unique for an IPA.  Lemon bars and banana esters play to make a smoothie like feel. Like nothing I have ever smeed and so inviting.  With first sip I actually get chills at how good this brew is.  The initial balance is of floral hope and bready Belgian like malts.  Sweet and electric mouthfeel is carried so well. A very nice finish to this brew with a classy dryness and distinct hop bitterness that is a pleasant surprise to the end of this beer. This is a very special IPA. 655 charactersSPLITGRIN, Oct 30, 2015

Solid IPA, a little subdued compared to the hop bombs from the east coast, but a very balanced IPA.  A little darker orange pour, cloudy with a nice citrus aroma.  Very good taste, again a step back from hop bombs but its not a bad thing.  Very happy to have tried it. 327 charactersJGLittle, Oct 30, 2015

4.26/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Appearance - The beer presented a darker yellow color with a snowy white head. 
Smell - The nose was lightly lemon and grassy. The nose makes its point, but is far from overwhelming. 
Taste - The lemony notes immediately jump out with medium grassy notes. The malts leave a clean backbone. The lemon is not overly bitter, but seems perfectly placed. There is a slight hint of pineapple, before the dry lemony hops continue in the aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel - The carbonation seems really aggressive, but it does sweep the taste away too quickly. 
Overall - This is a nice impression of the style, but is not my favorite example. 628 charactersJohnnyHopps, Oct 24, 2015

Aroma: Fruity, tropical and citric with a hint of malty base giving a light candy note.
Taste: Bright and citric hops really shine in a clean simple base, very West Coast which is to my preference. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body, sudsy texture.
Overall: Nice display of yummy hops with enough base to keep it from being acidic but not so much as to make the package heavy and chewy. Seems like they are using good ingredients and staying out of the way, cheers to The Lone Pint Brewery; make more, so much more. 600 charactersHardTarget, Sep 27, 2015

A= Pale straw color, hazy, creamy white head, thin, settles to ring to glass.  Lacing is clingy.
S= Grapefruit, citrus juice, rind, zest.
T= Flavor is similar to the aroma, but with a bit more tropical notes including mango/papaya.  Bit of easy going bitterness holds it together.
M= Medium body with a bit of syrupy feel with low side of moderate carbonation. 
O= Great, smooth, balanced, easy going IPA.  Nothing negative, bitterness is clean and suits the level of hop flavor perfectly. 544 charactersjhavs, Sep 15, 2015

The pour is light orange, & holding it up to the TV, I can see no hint of Miguel Sano’s lovely swing through the liquid. The nose is grapefruit to the nth degree, infiltrating everything nasal & really making me look forward to the taste. 
Every (Yellow) Rose has it’s thorn…right? This one could charge admission as an Aruba cruise. Bursting with tropical flavor, with big grapefruit, papaya, citrus, & other assorted before the taste charges into a moderate bitterness. The other side of the slide brings an odd grain character, light dankness, & finishes with a honey-like sweetness from the malts. Very smooth & easy to sip while the Twins spank the White Sox. 
Very good beer? Absolutely. Top 250 beer? No way. Me complain? Heck no. This is an easy drinker with a lovely fruit punch. Best IPA I’ve had today. 1,004 charactersmaximum12, Sep 12, 2015

Light fizzy bubbly head, little fluffy 1 finger, fades semi quickly light lacing, murky pale yellow pear color. 
Nose nice dank tropical fruit, mild resin, mango papaya, big time pineapple and mango, great tropical and some citrus, juicy fruit, little tangerine, orange, faint malt. Little earthy resin grassy thing late. 
Taste starts with a mild creamy malt, little chewy lush malt profile. Then hops, nice tropical again, papaya mango, pineapple, nice juicy papaya mango, little guava, dank resin notes, little citrus creamy orange tangerine, grapefruit pith, touch of rind bitterness. Little earthy grassy almost spicy piney hop way in the back. Finish brings tons of orange cream tangerine and grapefruit pith, little rind and just a touch spicy earthy, mild bitterness. 
Mouth is med bod, nice creamy lush oat or wheat like fluffy feel, nice carb fluffed in there. 
Overall this surprised me, much better than I expected, great tropical and citrus, very little of the earthy grassy part. 1,028 charactersjlindros, Sep 05, 2015

Have trade for Yellow Rose multiple times, and every one of those, it's a winner. Hazy yellow and a sizable head upon pouring, it possesses an incredibly balanced floral aroma that's far from overpowering. Taste-wise, you're getting a light mix of citrus notes, plus a piney finish too. Mouthfeel is not too bitter, but rather, smooth and mild. Great stuff. 427 charactersJohnCassillo, Sep 01, 2015

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice hazy golden hue with a fat one finger head that fades to leave thin wisps and a light halo.
S - Aromas of big tropical notes, pineapple and mango with nice papaya. Good grapefruit, oranges, nice lightly spicy earthy pine on the finish too. 
T - Taste is similar to the nose, loads of tropical fruits, tons of pineapple and mango, earthy spicy notes that fade over time. The oranges are great, creamy with very faint bitterness. Really good tropical notes that typically aren't found in most mosaic based ipas. Woah. 
M - Mouthfeel is really nicely carbonated, creamy, fluffy. 
O - Overall this beer was really nice. Loads of tropical notes, tons of pineapple. Doesn't have the usual crazy pine first notes mosaic tends to have. A delicious beer.

The smell is magical and the taste is full of surprises, the after taste seems to change with each sip as well. I have found the bottles to be just as good and buy at least 1 whenever I see it, at $9 a bottle it is something to savor. I don't care for the murky color and high amount of sediment in the appearance, but i detect none in the mouth feel. Very smooth and versatile SMaSH IPA, fruity and hoppy. Nectar of the gods.

LOOK: Pours with a glorious 4 finger's worth of white foam that dissipates into half a finger's worth after three minutes. What can I say? This is yellow in color. Not gold or straw yellow, just yellow. Cloudiness is moderate along with the rising bubbles. Lacing is thin, but high. 
SMELL: FRUIT BOMB! Very strong aromas of pineapple, grapefruit, orange, pear, mango, peach, apricot, and papaya that entangle with mild aromas of sweet and bready pilsner malts.
TASTE: Incredibly strong and pure delicious fruit flavors come on very strong up front. Those awesome sweet and bready pilsner malt flavors enter strongly immediately after to balance out the fruit flavors coming from the hops. Alas, mild bitterness from hops finishes off this spectacular symphony as all other flavors push on.
FEEL: Medium-bodied with subtle carbonation. Goes down smooth, but not creamy (unfortunately). And of course, the finish is overly dry. 
NOTE: Holy crud. What liquid gold have I just tasted? But on a serious note, as the beer warms, fruit flavors become less apparent and bitter hop flavors begin to quickly take their place. 1,171 charactersMyotus, Aug 13, 2015

Aroma hits you initially with so much tropical fruits- pineapple, mango, papaya. Some dank qualities to this one, along with some citrus zest (orange maybe?).  Taste is much the same, but maybe toned down a bit.  The bitterness is is spot on though.   It keeps it dry and refreshing.  I would have loved for the flavors to be a little brighter and the body to be a touch lighter, but it's a small complaint.  This is damn good. 506 charactersBosoxfan20, Aug 06, 2015

Foamy mouthfeel that immediately gives way to dank hoppy goodness. Due to the manageable ABV the hops are allowed to do their thing without any alcohol burn. The taste and appearance remind me a lot of vintage Alpine offerings. One of the best single hop offerings out there. 339 charactersMackseven, Aug 04, 2015

Pours a hazy yellow-orange with a foamy white head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, and tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, grapefruit juice, and tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is super tasty and easy to drink.

Try it, you won't be disappointed.  Light sweet malt, with tropical slightly bitter IPA taste.  This is one of the few IPA's that is totally unique.  I would say that it's better than Pliny The Elder, but it tastes really different  maybe because they use Whole Cone Hops.  I'll have to visit this brewery soon on the way to Houston! 430 charactersDrogon, Jul 26, 2015

The citrus and tropical fruits notes are rendered beautifully in both aroma and flavor. The malt doesn't disappear, but it's not the star. It definitely balances the hops wonderfully smooth bitterness. I also get some honey on the nose. This is a world class IPA and I'm so happy it a local. It's as good as any of the fabled northeastern APA/IPA's that I've tried. 484 charactersChuckHardslab, Jul 19, 2015

I don't know if my palate is completely compromised by the juicy East Coast DIPAs  I've been consuming as of late but I wasn't blown away by this.  Granted, it's a single hop, single malt IPA which gets credit right away but I found an underlying mustiness present throughout.  It has a more delicate floral sweetness than I was expecting from the mosaic hop, and there is no denying the malty, bready backbone.  Didn't live up to the hype in my opinion. 470 charactersKword55, Jul 05, 2015

S: Balanced interplay of citrus and pine, with just a hint of mango as well. All hoppiness, and enjoyable in its straightforward intensity.
T: Follows the nose, with grapefruit and mango hoppiness up front, followed by resinous piney bitterness and just enough malt body to keep everything in balance. Medium-length herbal finish. Very tasty.
M: Soft, smooth, velvety.
O: Great IPA! I hadn't heard a thing about this one before the bartender recommended it, and I was blown away. Top-notch brew.

4.18/5  rDev -5.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Been looking forward to trying this for some time. Much love to Nick for sending one along, pretty excited!
Pours much paler yellow than I was expecting. Definitely lives up to its name there! Pale pastel, opaque yellow. Big white head that settles in to about half its original size (leaving it at about 3/4 of a finger... Great lacing as well.
Man I can't even type any more about appearance because the aroma is pulling me in and telling me to quite ignoring it. Massive fruity juicy deliciousness. Originally more floral sweet, but now as it's sitting it gets more tropical fruit juicy. Evolves through some juicy citrus as well and even a hint of apple juice and orange juice, breakfast style. On the second pour (big bottle!) I do get some of the blueberry mentioned on the label. Wow. Gotta bump that smell score up another notch...
As with many of the single hop beers I've tried that feature mosaic, the promise of the nose is not entirely fulfilled on the tongue. While the aroma was bursting at the seams with juicy fruits, flowers, and citrus, the flavour is a little more subdued. Tasty- but more... subtle. Orange and floral hops still play a big part, and the pilsner malts come more into play here as well. Finish starts by bringing the malts to the forefront before sliding into a lasting twining with the floral and citrus hops.
This one is an example of a seemingly simple concept executed masterfully. SMaSH beers strip down the complexity by offering single strains of the two main* ingredients, but this beer helps show how using just a single example of each of these components need not constrain creativity, quality or complexity. 
Thank you thank you @bulldoza for sending this one along and fulfilling another big want off my list! 1,761 characterskemoarps, Jun 28, 2015

The taste follows the aroma with huge hop flavor, but the hops are very smooth with a nice malt base. No harshness. Medium bodied, smooth, with great carbonation. Overall, this beer lives up to the hype!!! 319 charactersbeeragent, Jun 19, 2015

A - A hazy, golden straw color. 
S - Very floral with some citrus notes
T - Floral hops and citrus mingle on the palate. I'm getting pineapple, lemon, grapefruit with a slight hoppy bitterness. Honestly,  I tastes alot like Heady except for the wave after wave of citrus. 
M - Slightly dry with a smooth creamyness to it.
O - This is a stellar beer that deserves the hype. It's a great ipa. 442 charactersSpaten454, Jun 07, 2015

Paired with the warriors championship game one. Taste follows how the warriors are playing right now, mediocre.
Not really sure what the hype is all about this beer is average at best
Overall gets some plus points as the packaging and design is pretty nice, dunno if I like my IPAs in 750s tho
Thanks to wtc11 for the chance! Really appreciate your generosity!

Taste is of grapefruit/tangerine and very hop forward, but not that bitter. Not a lot of malt there, but not a lot needed.  The hops are the star of the show and this was a tasty beverage for a hot day in the sun working the grill. 338 charactershardysf, May 26, 2015

5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've had Pliney at the brewery, I've sampled Dorado and Pliney side by side at Toronado in SF been to Portland, been to Seattle, my friend from Boston sent me cans of Heady Topper this winter, we drank the Albuquerque IPAs last summer.  Yellow Rose is right up there with all of the best hoppy American ales I've ever tried. Although I do believe this is the best IPA in Texas, this beer is not overrated just because it's from Texas. Because I live in Texas I can get it reasonably fresh which means the fresh hop aroma is there - citrus; grapefruit and orange.  The appearance is cloudy golden, which is expected given the bottle conditioning and pilsner malt.  The up-front taste is reflective of the aroma combined with a sweet, cleanly fermented, malt backbone that serves to balance the lingering hop finish. The carbonation is slightly high, which makes for a beer with extremely good head retention.  Your last sip will have foam on top. Yes, this is indeed a world class beer. 985 charactersdmar, May 25, 2015

Pours a hazy yellow-orange color with two fingers of off white head and moderate to high carbonation evident. Floral hops, pine hops, grapefruit, resin, yeast, bready malts, and earthy notes. Medium body and high carbonation.
Overall very good; almost reminds me of a Belgian style beer due to the yeast. Lots of grapefruit and floral hops, worth checking out. 417 charactersmdfb79, May 20, 2015

Nose is quite floral with a bit of juniper and rosemary.  Tastes starts with pleasant malt up front quickly followed by piney and floral hops flavors.  Highly drinkable and the best IPA I've sampled out of TX by a long shot. 291 charactersmschantz, May 04, 2015

A: Bright yellow, cloudy. Nice finger of white head on the top that laced the glass throughout. The beer is unfiltered and that is very apparent in the appearance.
S: Mango, peaches, Tropical fruit. The Mosaic hops really shine through. Little bit of sweetness in the background and a little grapefruit.
T: Taste follows the nose really well. Lots of mango, peaches and orange in the flavor and finishes up with a tiny bit of bitterness.
M: Medium bodied, medium to high carbonation. Finishes dry and keeps you sipping. 
O: Excellent IPA, mosaic hops are one of my favorites and they're really well showcased in the beer. 708 characterschrisjws, Apr 13, 2015

4.41/5  rDev -0.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750mL into a tulip. Pours a cloudy dirty golden color w/ a sudsy white head.
Aroma is a big burst of orange citrus, juicy and clean. After that, grapefruit rind. In a word, mouth-watering. 
Taste follows nose. The Mosaic hops really shine here. A big bowl of fresh-sliced orange and grapefruit on a canvas of pale neutral malt. Lively alpha acid bitterness washes the palate clean.
Mouthfeel is crisp and medium-bodied, satisfying. This beer vaguely reminds me in some ways of what I remember Zombie Dust tasting like (except with Mosaic standing in for Citra), but this one has more body and thus seems like a more complete beer.
Overall, a great beer especially where it counts most. Great showcase of the Mosaic hops. At first I admit I was a little skeptical about a world-class IPA out of Texas (not sure why), but I am convinced. Would drink this regularly if I could. 878 charactersdraheim, Apr 07, 2015

3.81/5  rDev -13.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75I don't understand the hype behind this one.  It is a solid ipa, especially for a single hop single malt offering, but just didn't hold up to the vermont hops consumed later that night.  Yellow rose poured very pale in color with a pure white, bubbly head.  The smell was very clean, citrusy, melon, and a strong herbal note, thyme maybe?  The taste was much the same, begging for more body, biscuity malts, somenice fruity, tropical hop aromas, and again, finishes very herbal in a way I just can't put my finger on.  Mouthfeel was crisp but lingers dry and herbal on the palate for quite a while.  Really needs a more substantial malt backbone.  There is nothing wrong with yellow rose, it's a solid ipa, but I think there is some truth to the beer being so hyped solely for being a decent beer from a region not known for them. 830 charactersadapt313, Apr 06, 2015

Sticky pungent melon and something faintly citrus but succulent like mango, passionfruit or even papaya. It's just a juicy, thick fruit smell. Sweet but mellow maltiness and a floral aroma that adds some potency to this already robust nose. 4.5
All the fruitiness from the nose continues. Mango, honeydew passionfruit and papaya. A bit more piney spice here. Light caramel notes that add to the smoothie-like blend of fruitiness. 4.5
Juicy, sweet, creamy... Could be a smoothie or fruit juice if not for the semi-bitter, semi-dry finish. 4.5
This beer's legit. The fruitiness had lingered with me since I first had it a few days back and I've been desperate to find more. Glad I did. An excellent brew. 868 charactersONovoMexicano, Apr 03, 2015

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news.  There's not too much reason to venture outside of New England for hoppy stuff these days. 235 charactersfacesnorth, Mar 30, 2015

4.38/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Gunch52 for this.
Look- Clear yellow orange with a white bubbly head.  Looks a bit light in the malt character.
Smell- big tropical fruit bouquet, huge guava and passionfruit notes, mango, kiwi, sweet eucalyptus honey, apricot.
Taste- a bit grassy and grainy at first as the Pilsner malts stand up, but the honey sweetness amplifies the floral hop character.  More fruity than bitter.
Feel- a bit fizzy, smooth and refreshing.
Overall- a great beer.  One of the best single IPAs I've had.  Great single hop/single malt brew.  Beauty in the simplicity. 566 charactersSaisonRichBiere, Mar 23, 2015

A medium strength aroma, full of lemon zest, mango, neutral sweet, hints of tart yeast, and even lighter hints of pine and herbal bitter.
All the  flavors of the aroma are here, balanced perfectly, with additional notes of mango, pear, pineapple, floral, and other fruity notes that appear as the beer warms.  Just delicious beer.
Low carb, medium viscosity, excellent finish, clean flavor profile, excellent frame for a delicious flavor profile.
Great beer, highly recommended, if you see this one grab it, you won't be disappointed! 609 characterscavedave, Mar 23, 2015

L: Now this is what I want my IPAs to look like, the color of honey & tangerines, with a ginormous white head and lots and lots of sticky lacing. I'll assume this is unfiltered because it's murky as hell, can't wait to dive in.
S: Bright, juicy pineapple, hint of honey sweetness, not a huge nose but very clean.
T: Yahtzee! Sweet stone fruit balanced impeccably by toasted grains and bitter grapefruit hops. The transition from sweet to bitter is so well-executed, and the finish lingers 'til *smack* it's gone.
M: Just damned near perfect. Slightly heavier body in the form of a nice syrupy texture until an avalanche of tight carbonation clears the path for the hops to crush your tongue.
O: Frickin' great, end of story. Normally hate hoppy beer in bomber format, but I could drink gallons of this stuff. Top notch, well worth its world-class rating. Get you some. 933 charactersmarkgugs, Mar 20, 2015

4.04/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4A very simple and very good IPA.  The hop aroma is huge and flowery with notes of pine and blueberry.  The only fault I can really find with this beer is that the malt character is a little to one-dimensional and the sweetness overtakes the hops a little to much.  However, these are minor complaints, I think it is very soft, hugely flavorful and certainly very unique in the Texas beer market.  I recommend this beer to anyone who likes IPAs. 444 charactersSiriusfisherman, Mar 18, 2015

A- golden, slight haze, fluffy 1 1/2 finger off white head, nice lacing, head slowly dissipates to leave a ring around the glass and some remains in the middle.
S- fruity, hoppy, blueberries, tropical fruit, very light notes of malt
T- perfect balance between hops and malt, definitely taste the blueberry, grapefruit, pineapple. So smooth and very drinkable
M- soft, smooth, slightly creamy?
O- very good beer, smooth, drinkable and extremely tasty, color is almost perfect and the taste has a slight malt note that I can detect every now and again that I'm not a fan of. Those are the only things keeping from giving this a perfect 5. Trillium has ruined most other ipas for me. 727 charactersIpaguy516, Mar 17, 2015

The mosaic do give a very mixed fruity flavor profile, but there's little in the way of sharp bitterness.  It's quite smooth, yet flavorfully hopped.  The malt backbone is solid and gives this beer an overall balance not usually found in IPAs.  
Body is medium with a slightly slick finish and fruity afternotes.  Certainly worth a try. 382 charactersAlCaponeJunior, Mar 09, 2015

Much hyped and highly anticipated brew, but as always, the proof is in the suds.
Hazy yellow-orange with a quilted tan froth.  Smells of lemon, grapefruit and meringue.  A mountain of resinous hops are followed with notes of orange, grapefruit and lemon on the back of the tongue.  Has a grainy backbone.  The bitterness really starts to take over later in game, but this one stays mostly balanced all the way through.  
High style IPA drinking and bold and balanced to boot. 500 charactersstephens101, Mar 04, 2015

Smell:  A fruit basket aroma, with melon, pineapple, berry, grapefruit and a powdered sugar coating
Taste:  Just a touch of caramel malt, up front, and then the bright fruit flavors take over, bringing the basket of flavors detected in the aroma; the bitterness never builds to excess and the finish is somewhat sweet
Mouthfeel:  Medium body with moderate carbonation
Overall:  A quaffable IPA - love the bright fruit tones but would like to see just a touch more bitterness and slightly less sweetness in the finish; still quite good 642 charactersbrentk56, Feb 25, 2015

Appearance is murky with a golden, caramelized orange tinge. 
Aroma is very citrusy. As it warmed, a weird prune/fig aroma came through and threw me off. Still good.
Flavor was great. Bitter with a nice malty sweetness. 
This was good. Not in my top IPAs. I've had, but still delicious and refreshing. 355 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Feb 21, 2015

A:  poured into an IPA glass to a slightly hazed dark yellow with a three finger dense white head that retains well and leaves excellent lacing
S:  smells of tropical fruits, citrus and some pineapple with a little underlying malt sweetness
T:  taste is tropical fruits, citrus, mango and papaya with a little bit of sweet malt flavor.  slightly floral as well.  swallow is grapefruit rind, more tropical fruit and a little earthy.
M:  fairly light without being watery with slightly prickly carbonation and a refreshing and slightly hop oily finish
O:  This is a fantastic IPA.  Big and bright hop flavors with just enough malt to provide some balance makes this one a pleasure to drink. 728 charactersSHODriver, Feb 17, 2015

S: Grapefruit is the most prominent aroma with hints of pine, citrus rind, and fresh-cut hay from my in-laws'. Sharp earthy notes come through as it warms a bit. 
T: Although it starts with some forward hop bitterness, it sluices nicely into a creamy malt finish; the pilsner malt gives it a smooth finish to round out the Mosaic. This is not overly complicated, but it has beautiful, clean notes. The bottle mentions some blueberry, and I'm seeing it now. 
M: Light and clean, YR drinks incredibly easily. It's a good thing this only rocks in at 6.8%. 
O: For a $9 750mL at my local Whole Foods, this is probably dollar-for-dollar the best IPA I've had. 786 charactersRanz, Feb 16, 2015

Score: 85
Unconfirmed bottling date, but presumed fresh (less than a month old) based on the representations of the trader. Served in a Hopslam snifter and enjoyed on 02/11/15.
Appearance: Pours a translucent, murky orange color with two fingers of seafoam head that settle to clusters of clumps atop the glass. Very good lacing and retention. 4.5/5
Smell: Grapefruit, melon, and berry. A touch of grassy/earthy tones too. Lovely, fruity mix without a bitter-apparent nose. 4.25/5
Taste: Grapefruit flavor, bready malt and a little fruitiness upfront with spicy, earthy tones on the finish and a hint of onion that lingers long past the finish on the very back of the palate. Very mild bitterness. 3.5/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, appropriately carbonated (on the higher end for an IPA, though). Has a mild bitter bite upfront palliated by a maltiness that quickly counterbalances. Has a foamy mouthfeel as it sits on the tongue. 4/5
Overall: A solid, but unspectacular IPA offering (though Mosaic is admittedly not my hop of choice). Definitely worth a pint, but not a must-seek brew for my preferences.
Cost: $10 for a 750 ml bottle. 1,247 charactersjegross2, Feb 12, 2015
4.7/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Appearance: hazy golden color with a murky body. Massive head on a solid pour which retained throughout. Sticky rings of lacing left behind.
Smell: tropical fruit godliness jumps out at you immediately. Slyly underneath is a pleasant bitterness which peaks mid body. But my favorite part is a sweet, bready malt bill which plays so perfectly off the bright hops. Wonderful layers and perfect execution of what is found on the aroma. 
Taste: a soft pillow of tropical fruits lays on the palate and is in no hurry to leave. Another dimension of the hops jump on mid palate with a perfect twinge of bitterness. But like the aroma, a truly masterful malt bill makes this one for the ages. Touches of sweet caramel, fresh bread, and some maple syrup dance on the back end. Truly exquisite. 
Mouthfeel: soft bright hops with a necessary layer of malt heaviness and a lingering bitterness. Carbonation is perfect.
Overall: not sure what else you could ask for out of a single IPA. A masterful malt bill and a celebration of the wonderful Mosaic hop, Lone Pint has put together a classic here. 1,089 charactersKFBR392, Feb 12, 2015

(drank 2/7/15 during brewery's Saturday tour day)
L:  yellow/gold ... no red; white head, nothing remarkable; no major lacing and little-to-no stick; not 100% clear but clear around edges and clearing up
S:  grapefruit, onion ... sweet but with a hint of a bitter bit lurking in there; the grapefruit holds true; the onion might be a personal thing, but it's definitely there for me, perhaps green onions
T:  grapefruit/onion and grass ... the combination is almost salty with the onion being a real sweet yellow onion, balancing things out by the end, so it's never very bitter; there must be plenty of malt in here, for it's sweet at times, but there's no malt flavor/taste you can detect other than a very generic "sweet" -- and that's perfect, because the mosaic hops are so perfectly used here that you get a ton of hop flavor in grapefruit and grass with relatively little bitterness
F:  drinkably light and full ... man, *this* is good ... it's what every American pale ale should strive for IMO.  plenty of carbonation.
O:  I've had this on-tap a few times, but finally took some notes at the brewery Saturday -- it has held up each time I've tried it, and the thing that really stands out is how it's not crazy bitter yet still chock full of hop flavor, and it pulls that off without getting overly mushy caramely/mango sweet like many hop salads.  if the bottled version of this holds up, man ... it's worth every penny. 1,492 charactersPremo88, Feb 10, 2015

4.85/5  rDev +9.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A near perfect example of the style. It poured a deep clear amber color with a two finger head and a good amount of sticky lacing. The smell was wonderful with citrus notes and mild pine. The taste was just as good as it follows the nose. Citrus upfront and mild bitterness in the finish. Clean mouth feel and medium carbonation. This might be my favorite IPA. Just wish it was easier to get in North Texas. When I see it I jump on it. 435 characterspnelting, Jan 28, 2015

A- Hazy darker orange body, one finger white head with nice retention, thin-medium collar, nice lacing overall. 
S- Clean caramel, grapefruit, oranges, tropical fruit. Not very much graininess in the nose. Smells quite juicy, but with a solid malt backbone.
F- Grainy sweet caramel and toffee from the pale malt, tropical fruits, grapefruit, citrus. Much more of a balanced IPA than it smells like. The sweet malt backbone complements the hop flavours well, making for a nice sweet juiciness that finishes off with a reasonably bitter pine kick. Very nice.
M- Medium bodied, nice carbonation, dry and resinous with a pine-citrus combination bitter kick at the end. Nice bitterness overall that punches at its weight.
O- Very nice IPA, very tasty and balanced. The mosaic brings its nice juiciness but with a nice balance from the bittering hops and the sweet pale malt. Would definitely drink again. 958 charactersStevedore, Jan 26, 2015

A near perfect example of what an IPA should be. Hazy, slightly amber, it has plenty of head and lace. Tropical fruit and pine resin in both the taste and aroma. Despite the big hop presence, it's plenty dry, with a clean, slightly bitter finish. Medium body and medium to low carbonation give it an appealing mouthfeel. 417 charactersLittleDon, Jan 25, 2015

750ml into a Lagunitas pint glass.
Moderate pour produces an enormous head, leaving a generous amount of lacing. Head.
Smells sweet, tropical fruit. Quite pungent. I like.
Taste is clean and crisp. Tropical fruit as well. Not extremely complex, as expected but very well balanced and extremely drinkable.
Perfect mouthfeel and carb for an IPA in my opinion
Overall, a really outstanding IPA and this would be a go to summer drinker if it was available in my parts. Not mind blowingly world class though but of those there are only a handful. Well done. 586 charactersZaximus, Jan 15, 2015

3.75/5  rDev -15.2%Fortunately, this beer is readily available from my office in downtown Houston (Flying Saucer for those who are wondering). However, I've had very mixed reviews about it.
Last Friday (12/6/14): Amazing. The nose? Indescribable, fruity, unique, awesome. It was smooth going down and just an all-around great beer. Give me a 6-er and I'll love you forever. I would rate it a 4.75+, or 5! It was that good. 
Today (12/12/14): I'm thinking maybe not too many people know about this watering hole... I felt like it was a stale keg and maybe even leftovers from the week before. The nose? I could still smell the fruitiness and hops from two feet away. But, unfortunately, the taste was flat out skunk. Not great at all. It was unfortunate as I settled for another local microbrew for my second serving (DIPA). Not sure what happened from last week to now but the consistency just wasn't there. Does this stuff lack the shelf life?
I hope to try it again with better results. 972 charactersdeltacoog, Dec 12, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +1.8%I'm gonna have to give this brew a two thumbs up. Not only because it's a Texas brew, or an outstanding beer for a SMASH, but because of the smoothness and complexity of this brew. This honestly makes me change my mind about mosaic hops. Looks golden and clear as Pilsner malt should. The smell is of fruity, citrusy heaven. This beer taste makes you feel as if you were on an island drinking a juice from the gods. All the right hop tastes at all the right time. A great hop forward brew, but balanced in every way. I'm so glad this brewery is in the town of a few family members. Overall, this beer stands with the best IPAs out there. So completely impressed for a SMASH beer. Makes me somewhat jealous I haven't tried brewing this myself. Only reason it's not rated a five, is so I have room to work with when my own brews hit the shelf one day. 849 charactersbhoss9235, Dec 09, 2014
4.71/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Got this one in on a trade from what I hope to be a more frequent trading partner. I had read some about this one but I had to try it for myself as I have been burning through the big boys lately. 
Appearance: Very light straw color. Maybe attribute this to the pilsner malts they use. It has a bit of haziness to it and a fluffy white head that lingers just about the entire drinking process.
Nose: Resinous, floral hops, I have not had a single hop mosaic before as far as I know but i will definitely seek this style out again. Very dank and earthy on the nose. It has some fruitiness going on as well, maybe some pineapple and mango.
Taste: This is where I drop it just a bit. It is a nice IPA, but it is a bit assertive, which is fine. Its not a huge bruiser and is well balanced. But I would like just a bit more in the malts to round it out a bit. Otherwise this is a nice beer. Very nice resinous dank, hop forward beer. Its got a lot of pine or spruce going on there. Maybe its a grapefruit rind flavor. Anyway there is a bitterness there. Which I do like in my IPA's. 
Overall: Solid beer, I will drink this again and thanks to my friend in TX to get me this one with such care! I might be after him again to get some more of this beer to share with other IPA loving friends around here! 1,301 charactershumuloner22, Dec 07, 2014

3.81/5  rDev -13.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.751 pint 9.4 fl oz brown glass bottle with appealing label art and green unbranded pry-off cap bought in Austin, TX and served cold into a pilsner glass. Reviewed live as an IPA per the label.
Expectations are high; this is #125 in the Top 250 and #6 in the Southwest region. 6.8% ABV. OG: 1.063. FG: 1.012. 62 IBUs.
HEAD: Two fingers wide. Off-white colour. Nice frothiness, thickness, and creaminess, with a good even soft-looking consistency. There's a sheen to the complexion. Retention is good - about 9 minutes. A light uneven layer of lacing sticks to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.
BODY: Surprisingly hazy, and clearly unfiltered. It's a pale copper with orange hues. Vibrance is average. A bit of yeasty sediment is visible towards the bottom of the glass.
Appears aptly carbonated. It's a good looking unfiltered IPA, and seems more alive than most offerings in the style. But it's not a unique appearance.
AROMA: Blueberry, subtle pineapple, zesty citrus (especially on the back end), clean pale malt, clean fresh barley, and mild touches of mango and tangerine. I usually despise pineapple in beer (especially IPAs), but this is handled subtly enough (at least in the aroma), that it doesn't bother me. The blueberry note is an unexpected treat, and has me salivating. It's dank and resinous, with a fragrant and above all else pleasant aromatic expression.
Mild in strength overall. No yeast, alcohol, or off-notes are detectable.
TASTE: Blueberry is there, but gets tangled up in a weird tropical pineapple bitterness & overripe zest that I don't like. Pineapple in beer always makes the taste more boozy, and this is no exception - even at its scant 6.80% I can detect the alcohol. The subtle herbal and resinous hop aromatics don't manifest in the flavour profile, to its detriment. I'm not finding the grapefruit promised by the label, but I do get an indistinct citrusy character - from the tangerine? There's a hint of lime in the third act, which is odd here. Some fairly insipid peach. A kiss of pith.
The pale malt foundation is lovely, lending it a clean crisp taste that tames the hops. Still, it ventures too far onto the bitter side, leaving it imbalanced. I really crave more of the blueberry, but it's ultimately quite reticent, and frankly more prominent in the aroma than in the taste. Too bad. Honey and bready malts fill out the body.
With only one hop utilized, it's unsurprising that this is a bit lacking in terms of intricacy; it's far from one-note, but it's not the complex multidimensional brew that you hope for. I'd like some resins, hop oils...maybe even some pine.
Nice depth of flavour. Average flavour duration and intensity.
TEXTURE: Smooth, wet, crisp, aptly medium-bodied, and aptly thick. It does suffer from overcarbonation, lending it unwelcome sharpness. Could be softer and more approachable; Overall well executed. This texture doesn't elevate the beer, but it complements the taste nicely enough.
Overall presence on the palate is nice.
OVERALL: Boozier than it should be, restricting drinkability. But it's downable and I quite enjoy it. Why has it earned the acclaim it has? The taste doesn't live up to the aroma. At its high price, I wouldn't buy it again unless a trade partner really wanted it. Chalk it up to my personal disdain for pineapple in beer, but I don't consider this world-class by any means. The blueberry does make it unique - and that note is impressively subtle, but at the same time it's too closed-off. Worth trying, but don't expect an amazing brew. I love the blueberry, but hate the pineapple. Think about it - is blueberry mixed with pineapple really all that appealing just in general?
This is easily Texas' best IPA. But does that say that much?
Low B

02.12.15:
I revisited this in a second bottle (and, in all honesty, not a particularly fresh one), and I have to say I initially was incorrect. This is better than I first noticed; the creamy soft feel coupled with the unique yet subtle berry character is nothing short of fantastic. It tastes like a gestalt whole, and I find it obscenely drinkable. There's a rare marriage of texture to taste, and it sets this beer apart from most other IPAs.
As an aside (and at heavy risk of coming off pretentious): there are Japanese tourists in Europe who spend their whole trips gazing through the viewfinders of their cameras. The joke is that they never see the places they're in because they're too focused on capturing the experience of seeing them (ostensibly, I believe, so they can later show their friends and family the concomitant images). In the case of this beer specifically, I too may have been too busy looking through my viewfinder.
What a great brew. I find myself inhaling my glass. The BGCP might refer to intangibles. In this case, I must make mention of the ineffable.
High B+

5/5  rDev +13.1%I love you Texas!
Pours a brilliant clear golden/yellow with a ton of carbonation upon the first pour.
The smell is reminescent of a fruit salad; oranges, pineapples, blueberries, with a slight alcohol presence on the backend.
The taste follows with a fresh hit of hops, followed by a crispy, carbonated body that fizzles out over time but zero alcohol noticeability. 
This beer is great. Texas is becoming a hot bed of great, sought after brews.
There is certainly something in the water; I just hope it doesn't come from Barton Sprangs! *Though that may be the secret ingredient)

IPA
6.8% ABV
62 IBU
APPEARANCE: Poured a gorgeous yellow rose petal steeped tea. As the pint glass fills it starts showing some dark straw color, with a nice amount of haziness. A big billowy cloud white head that's made up of tightly packed small bubbles. Great retention, this beer looks awesome. 
AROMA: As I'm pouring the aroma of this ipa is jumping out of the glass at me. Such a great nose, like Violet Beauregard laying on a bed of flower petals eating fresh cut pineapple. Very sweet, juicy and inviting. Not much of a malt presence as of yet. 
TASTE: First sip, mind blown Kaboom! Fresh picked perfectly ripe fruits, juicy pineapple, succulent peaches, plump blueberries, some nice melon notes swirling around. Small amount of pine that brings along with it some very subtle bitterness. Biscuity, toast maltiness that really takes a back seat to the delicious hop flavors. No alcohol detected at all, scary easy to drink. I wish this came in super big gulp cups. 
MOUTHFEEL: Light plus body with medium carbonation. Clean, crisp with a dry lingering finish. 
OVERALL: As of right now, this is my favorite single IPA. It was amazing, every aspect hit for me. I could drink this all day every day big thanks to @grantotx for this bottle even though I'll be begging him for more now! If you can find this or trade for it, do it.  I'm really trying to not throw 5's out as easy but this one is damn close.

I'm gonna keep this brief. This is an incredible IPA brewed the way I like IPAs. The hop presence is fruity and juicy. Tropical fruit flavors and citrus dominate. Grapefruit pith on the back end but not too bitter. Light yet slightly sweet malt presence. Easy to drink yet powerful. Carbonation is on the lighter side but works well. This beer reminds me of zombie dust but is softer and more complex. Outstanding and one of the best beers I've had this year. 482 charactersbrianmandell, Nov 06, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +7.5%My favorite beer that comes out of Houston. So glad it comes in bottles now. The smell is tremendous with light pine and strong blueberry and grapefruit. The taste follows the same way with a lingering bitterness at the end. Haven't gotten enough of this beer yet. Highly recommended. 284 charactersblakebinford, Oct 28, 2014
4.8/5  rDev +8.6%Have had this brew at various locations within the Houston loop and recently a bottle from their first run:
Golden yellow, hazy pour with a clean white head that lingers through the glass.  Small white lacing that sticks to the glass.
Smells of citrus and grapefruit.  Grapefruit dominates.  Smells amazing when it is fresh.
Taste follows the nose.  Aroma dominates the flavor as well.  Balanced malt backbone with just the slightest hint of alcohol to let you know it's there.
This has become my go-to pint whenever I'm out and it's available.  Usually very fresh and very awesome.  Recommend to try whenever you find it. 626 charactersBluestar, Oct 27, 2014

Bright golden hazy in the glass.  Smells biscuit malt, tropical citrus more to the grapefruit side and some underlying line.  Taste is initially a little malt sweetness followed immediately by grapefruit/pine bitterness ending with a citrus/floral semi dry finish.  Great mouthfeel, no alcohol detected.

4.51/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.51L growler poured into a HF wine glass. Served at 42F.Major thanks to porter0209. Mike indicates the growler was filled six days ago.
A: Yellow-gold translucent body topped by a thick white 1" head tdhat recovers nicely with gentle swirling. Highly carbonated with fine effervescent bubbles in the body that rise over and over through the head. Thick lacing coats the glass as I drainthos beer.
S: Massive citrus and grapefruit nose. Tropical fruits abound with subtle floal notes fading into the background. I know this is Mosaic single hop, but its Simcoe geneology shines through as well. Fine biscuity malt backbone is present, but not dominating...that's left for the hops. High carbonation ensures hat the nose is refreshed over and over.
T: Consisent with the nose, hop forward juiciness crushes the palate on this beer. Piney and resinous without being overly dank, this is a full on hop monster. Tropical and refreshing, this is more like the east coast (think Vermont) single IPA than a west coast style. Malt is not lost in the background, leaving a nicely balanced finish.
F: Slightly oily, this coats the palate, but finishes surprisngly clean for the amount of juicy pine flavor. Hints of soft bitterness linger but they are pleasant and not overpowering. The light balance of the malt keeps a medium mouthfeel. As noted above, carbonation is high, but that could be related to the draught line used to fill the growler.
O: Highly enjoyble and surely one of the best Texas IPAs I've had the good fortune to taste. This stacks up well against some of the very best out there. I'd love to try it bottled (or canned) with the carbonation dialed in for consistency. If you have the chance, give The Yellow Rose a whirl. 1,734 charactersF2brewers, Oct 02, 2014

Drops to a small cap and collar with big sheets of lacing down the glass. A hazy gold with some bright yellows when held to direct light. Pours with a moderate carbonation. 
Smell: Sweet fruit. Loaded with pineapple, grapefruit, and peach. Tropical and then some. Mosaic and then some. Malts are more than a balance to the aggressive hop schedule. Pushes a bunch of bread crust and a mildly toasted malt coupled with some mild caramelized sweetness. A touch of pear and some mild floral elements. Some other fruit creeps in and it's some kind of berry. A touch of tart tannic fruit skin as well. Some powdery yeast.
Taste: A touch of bitter flower petal thrown in the mix. A touch woody as well. Tropical fruit is in abundance. Mango, loads of pineapple, peach, lemon and lime. Deeply fruity. Malt backbone is deeply bready with some solid toasted notes. Pushes bread and undercooked biscuit. Powdery yeast adds another element. A touch of aspirin and bitter wood. Some floral elements as well. Mildly herbal with some solid earth undertones - almost dirty. Lingering bitterness . Slight sweetness - a touch of caramelization.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Juicy initial sip gives way to a mostly clean finish. Runs a bit lighter as it warms, but it never falls apart. 
Overall: Good thing I have 2 pints.
I'm not a huge mosaic fan most of the time, but this manages to balance it with a big malt presence. Not aggressive or big in any way. It's worth a try and easy to kill the 32oz growler. 1,564 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Sep 27, 2014

Nose is straight up mosaic. take a handful of buds, cruch em up and there you have it. So juicy, so tropical. Malts are super-light - Id be surprised if any specialty grains were used.
Taste focuses way more on hop flavor than bitterness and the malt might as well not exist. West Coast style done well in the lone star state. I actually wouldnt mind a little heftier bitterness and malt bill though and the single hop aspect only adds to the one-dimensional profile of the beer. But oooh, that one dimension is pretty fucking righteous. It goes down so smooth and easy.  I cant see myself ever passing this up on tap for at least a pint or two, but I could see it getting a little borish beyond that. 821 characterstwiggamortis420, Sep 23, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +7.5%Bright golden yellow pour from the draft at Rodeo Goat in Fort Worth. Moderate to slight white head that settles with some lacing. Citrus (esp. grapefruit) nose with a bit of sweet. Taste is huge and moderately sweet grapefruit with some nice maltiness. Very crisp with hoppy bitterness lingering. Really surprised with how good this IPA is. As good as Deep Ellum's IPA. Truly delicious. 388 charactersTxBrewser, Sep 12, 2014

Smell is huge grapefruit and citrus. In one word. Amazing. Very enticing.
Taste is very light and crisp at first with a huge grapefruit flavor. Mellows from an almost grapefruit juice taste to a nice, very crisp hop bitterness, which lingers on the finish.
Mouthfeel is extremely light.
Lives up to the hype. 381 charactersBigRedDog, Aug 26, 2014
5/5  rDev +13.1%I was super excited to be able to try this SMaSH (Single Malt and Single Hop) IPA. Heard good things about it from a few people and the brewers. Unfortunately, I'm drinking the last bit from my growler (about 5 days old, opened a couple of times) and it's a little bit flat. Fortunately, I have drank over a gallon of it fresh within the past week so my memory shouldn't be too shabby. I'll review what I'm drinking but add on to it with notes I took previously and pictures I took.
Poured into a pint glass, this beer is almost the embodiment of it's name: deep golden yellow, slight haze, and a tight 1/2 inch head (from before). The smell was exquisite, with notes of orange juice, papaya, mango, slight grapefruit. I seriously could've drank the smell.
Taste wise, the beer was phenomenal. Very floral, with grapefruit tastes, though the beginning notes are on the tropical side, which I loved. Very well balanced IPA. Mouthfeel, from what I remember, was quite light. Not too much bitterness that you had a resin-like tongue feel, but enough bitterness there to remind that this was a IPA that deserves another sip to refresh that lovely bitter flowery yet piney taste in the mouth.
Overall? The best IPA I have ever had. I have not yet had the pleasure to enjoy Pliny nor Heady Topper, but I have enjoyed Sculpin and Odell IPA and would always choose the Yellow Rose if given the chance. This beer demands to be drank fresh, and even on the flat side in a growler, it still holds its own against other IPAs. Though if you've tried it both fresh and flat, you'll notice it loses a lot of it's amazing aroma from the Mosaic hop and bit of the taste. If you growl it, drink within 12 hours. Please. You are doing yourself a disservice otherwise. If you live in Texas and want an IPA that is up and coming to be big player, visit Lone Pint for the Yellow Rose. You won't be disappointed. 1,892 charactersOliOxenFree, Aug 25, 2014

5/5  rDev +13.1%It's got a great golden hay color.
Huge sweet grapefruit, big peach, orange peel, and a slight basil flower on the nose.
Big burst of mosaic hops up front, but submits to the malt on the finish.  It finishes dry, but it's not bitter like most IPA's.  
I love the big, bold, massive IPA's and DIPA's, but this is probably one of the most enjoyable IPA's I've ever had.  I simply want to drink as much of it as possible.
Really a phenomenal beer all around.  It's amazing this brewery that just started is making something superior.  A tremendous achievement for Lone Pint.  I hope they start entering this in the big competitions to bring it the awards it deserves. 668 charactersmindswoop, Aug 22, 2014

I have traveled the West Coast, the Pacific Northwest and Alaska for the past 15 years searching out great craft beer. In recent years more craft breweries have popped up and while some have gone and others simply are mediocre at best there are some keeping it simple and putting focus on the beer not the money they can make. lone Pint is one such brewery and they have made an IPA, Yellow Rose, that to me stands up there with the IPAs made in the places I mentioned before. 
Yellow Rose is a bold hoppy IPA that smells of citrus, floral and and has a sweetness to it. Mosaic hops, something Texas craft brewers are just discovering) are what makes this IPA remind me of the West Coast IPAs I feel in love with a couple years ago. It has a nice citrus/floral taste to it and there is no doubt about the hops. You taste them! Like the smell there is a hint of sweetness but only slight.
If you can find this one try it! I fancy myself a Hop Head (or IPA Freak) and this is in my top three! 1,052 charactersMickeyp2814, Jul 22, 2014

T- Very balanced and drinkable. I could order multiple pints of this and not have my pallet wrecked. It pairs well with food too. The hops come out very nicely, as well as the alpha acids. Absolutely wonderful.
M- It is not dry, sticky or resiny...it's just very smooth and easy to drink. The carbonation is great.  The simple Pilsner malt add to its drinkability.
O- This single hop IPA is the best IPA in Texas. It is an absolutely fantastic showcase of the mosaic hop. The beer is very beautiful to look at and has some hauntingly beautiful flavors. I crave this beer and order it pretty much whenever I see it on tap. 864 charactersCan_has_beer, Jan 21, 2014

Perfect clarity out of the growler into a tulip. Big sea foam white head on top of a straw gold body showing abundant carbonation. Excellent lacing as well!
The aroma is amazing. Herbal hops abound, with hints of sage, pineapple, and dough.
The taste is equally delicious, filled with notes of peaches (especially in the finish), sage, and a bready malt background flavor. The bitterness is very even, and not harsh at all. The beer is extremely well-balanced. I get only a glancing bitterness in the finish that lingers. Extremely smooth body, with a great amount of carbonation, and a soft texture.
It's an incredible beer for sure. I could drink this all the time, and if I lived close to the brewery, this might be a staple in my fridge. 806 charactersMusicaleMike, Nov 04, 2013

5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've gotten to a point where I walk into a bar that has Yellow Rose and 50 other taps and ask for the Yellow Rose before even looking to see what else is available. After having YR for the first time, I started seeking out other Mosaic beers and while I think there are many that are quite delicious, at best I've found things that are "95% of yellow rose." 
A: Color is pale yellow. Clear. Good lacing. 
S: The nose has a lot of tropical fruit and a sweetness that the Mosaic brings.
T: The taste is phenomenal. There's grapefruit. A hint of pineapple, but not too much to make it cloying. It's really best described as "pure mosaic" since that's what it is. This takes the essence of a pretty awesome hop and distills it into a sessionable, delicious drink.
M: Crisp, a little sweet. Not as dry as could be expected considering the format. Quite good.
O: What I said above is true. Yellow Rose is my session beer, it's my "perusing the rest of the menu" beer, and it's the beer I want most when I go out. If Lone Pint ever bottles, it'll be my fridge beer as well.
Update: After being away from Yellow Rose for a full month now, I've had growlers shipped to me and can again drink it. No matter how much ticking I do, searching for that perfect beer, I keep coming back to YR. If this isn't my ideal beer, then I doubt I'll ever find it. If any beer can be rated a 5/5, then for me, this is it. 1,402 charactersnathanmiller, Oct 23, 2013

I'm not going to waste much time with appearance and mouthfeel--it looks and feels fine.
More importantly, it smells and tastes awesome. The smell gives some of the pine/citrus associated with most IPAs, but those more common notes take a back seat. Instead, the nose is dominated by tropical fruit and almost something like rancid blueberry...but rancid in a very pleasant sense of the word.
The taste follows: tropical fruit and something vaguely berry-like. Yeah, there's some pine/citrus, but if that's what your into, there are a lof of IPAs and DIPAs that will go further toward satisfying. Likewise, if you want explosive IBUs and double digit ABV, this beer isn't for you.
Instead, this beer offers an exceedingly unique hop profile, in a very sessionable form. My understanding is that the only hops that go into it are whole cone Mosaic. I don't know of any other beers that give you nothing but Mosaic, which is an utter shame because this beer is awesome. I love the pure hop bombs as much as the next guy, but the hop profile on this IPA is so delicate and unique, it's alone on an island of deliciousness. This is the type of IPA that will delight IPA lovers because of it's uniqueness, but that even non-IPA lovers can get behind because it is not a palate wrecker.
If you can get your hands on it (it's not in bottles/cans), waste no time in doing so. 1,451 charactersrugsi, Sep 18, 2013

This beer is so simple, but at the same time the flavors are very complex. 
The hops give it a characteristic of grapefruit combined with blueberry and pineapple. This is what makes this beer really intriguing to the pallet.
What makes this beer though, is the delicate balance of hops and malt.
Great job on this one. 366 charactersYellowRoseBrewing, Aug 22, 2013

5/5  rDev +13.1%It is not often that I think a beer is perfect, but this is one of those times. I have nothing new to say that has not already been written by other reviews. Big citrus / grapefruit nose and flavor that is as drinkable as it comes. One can only hope that one day I will be able to pick this up in cans. 302 characterstpgraham, Jul 29, 2013

4.18/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 32 oz growler.
Clear yellow color with slight orange hue. Two finger, marshmallow head that recedes to thin coating. Small amount of lacing.
Peach and crackers in the nose.
Taste is light and very clean malt. Big peach and pineapple dominate on the front end. First time tasting the mosaic hop. Mild pine bitterness and a bit of rind rounds out the sip. Dry at the end.
Smooth with moderate carbonation.
Listed here as an IPA but straddles the line of an APA. Lucky to have more delicious, session-ish beers around. Another new brewery in the Houston area doing good things. 593 charactersdarocny, Jul 11, 2013

5/5  rDev +13.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5As part of a trade I recived a HF growler fill of this, the tag said Lone Pint - Yellow Rose Single hopped Mosaic IPA so I'm guessing this is the correct place for the review.
A: Pale straw colored pour with a moderate amount of puffy white foam (even from a shipped growler). Very little haze with a lacing that shows you each sip (always my favorite).
S: Huge juicy citrus, tropical, pine aroma. strawberry, blueberry, melons mixed with kiwi and sweet orange. So aromatic I wanted to use it as an air freshener. A hint of bready malt character peeks through, but not much more.
T: The first sip is exactly like the aroma. Juicy, tropical and sublte pine with a moderate bitterness that cuts the sweetness. There is a sweetness that comes through but It seems to be coming from the flavor of the HBC 369. No alcohol, and the bready, doughy malt comes through more when your pallet adjusts to the texas sized flavor of the hops.
M: Zero astringancy, just clean and crisp. moderate body which compliments the hops nicey, if this was a dry finish (ala West Coast) I don't think it would be quite as enjoyable. Carbonation held up well on the trip from TX to WI.
O: Lone Pint says Yellow Rose is slang for Texas heroine, I don't know much about that, but after sharing this will a pretty girl... I wanted to drive the 1000+ miles to get a refil. There are some great beers coming from Texas and this hit my palet preferences to a T. 1,434 charactersguityler83, Jun 06, 2013

Tropical fruit aroma with juicy citrus notes, mango, light crackery malt. Tastes of tropical fruits and bright citrus. Citra definitely seems the culprit here. Light balancing maltiness, and a medium bitterness that finishes clean. Lighter In body, somewhat crisp, definitely refreshing and super easy drinking.

4.18/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25On tap at Downhouse in Houston.
A: Pours a clear yellow/orange color. A two finger white head forms with good retention, and patchy lace is left behind.
S: Big hops up front. Juicy and tropical fruity aromas. Peach, mango, pineapple. Resinous pine and citrus aromas. Not a lot of malt balance, but enough hop character to make up for that. Not just bitterness.
T: Follows the nose with a tropical juicy flavor. Mango and pineapple are strong. A resinous, piny, citrus, and grapefruit bitterness lingers on a bit to much for me. A small hit, and still very enjoyable. Again, not much balance with the malts, but the hops have lots of character.
M/D: A medium body with moderate carbonation. Crisp, and dry as a bone. Easy and enjoyable to drink. I have had several since this started popping up around Houston.
A big hop bomb, but one with lots of character. Which are the IPA's I like. Without a doubt the best thing Lone Pint has done so far. Recommended. 958 characterschamp103, Apr 30, 2013
