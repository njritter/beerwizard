4.46/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.
A: Dark brown to black, and opaque. A thin tan head fades fairly quickly atop a low level of visible carbonation.
S: Really nice on the nose. Whiskey and chilis, chocolate and coffee. Sweet malts mixed with vanilla and oak. Notes of drying tobacco and toffee and Bit-o-Honeys. Awfully good.
T: Chocolate, chilis and coffee up front. The whiskey heat comes next, with significant oak and vanilla flavors. Caramel, more vanilla, and cacao nibs. Tobacco and some roasted malts add some bitterness. More chocolate and coffee with mild but definite chili heat in the hang.
M: The body is heavy, though not as thick and glass-staining as Hunahpu. Low carbonation sensation but fine for style. Alcohol presence is actually pretty restrained for style, but it remains warming as it goes down.
O: This was really, really good. The barrel complimented this beer more than I expected. This all really works well. Nice chili flavor without a ton of heat. Definite barrel presence without overwhelming the multiple adjuncts. Excellent.
NOTE: I knocked down my "Overall" rating a little. I had a second bottle that I reviewed, forgetting that I had already done so. I didn't care for the second bottle nearly as much, with an estimated BA Rating of 3.95. I decided to enter in the tasting notes from the "better" bottle, and left the given scores alone. But the Overall is decreased as there may be some bottle variation here. 1,505 charactersmacrosmatic, May 15, 2017

4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a snifter. Like most other big Prairie stouts, a black pour with a minimal tan head which fades to a ring. There is a pretty strong aroma- the Ancho chiles jump out at me, but chocolate and whiskey are there in the background. The taste is complex: there is a hint of coffee present, but whiskey and chocolate are most prominent, with caramel malt, vanilla, oak notes, and a touch of cinnamon following. The whiskey is extremely well-melded with the rest of the beer, and is present mid-palate through the finish. The chiles are somewhat muted, compared to the standard Bomb!, but provide a nice warming heat at the finish. The beer is full bodied, incredibly smooth the entire way through, and a touch boozy on the finish. Pretty incredible. Huge fan of Prairie's stouts, but this one surpassed my expectations and blew me away. 841 charactersmattflippin, Apr 24, 2017

Prominent chiles and spices on the nose, with faint whiskey and cocoa. Not much coffee. The taste followed closely. Very similar to Bomb! but with an added dimension with the whiskey barrel. To their credit, this did not overwhelm the beer. Full-bodied and smooth on the finish. A nice improvement (hard to believe) to the base beer. 381 charactersBuck89, Apr 24, 2017

4.24/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Bottle:
Pours thick from the bottle, like many Bomb! beers I've had.  It looks almost too thick to generate much head, which it doesn't.  A thin brown veil of bubbles fizzes away quickly.  A thin rim does resuscitate and fade easily.
Molasses early, chocolate espresso beans with a hint of whiskey later.  At times there's also a little cherrywood like tang.
Taste also has a little tang to it.  The main flavors in this version lean a lot more towards chocolate than others.  Maybe it's the notes from the barrel aging that bring it out a little more.  There is actually a candy bar aspect to this with marshmallow and light undertones of toffee. 
Chewy, full bodied feel.  A little alcohol burn more than chile pepper bite.
Comes across as a nice after dinner drink.  It could easily replace a coffee or light liqueur mixed beverage after dinner. 852 characterscjgiant, Apr 03, 2017

The palate threatens palate-wrecking spice at the outset, but it is beautifully cut by the bourbon.  The pairing of sweet bourbon with hot chile works magically.  This is, unquestionably, the best chile imperial stout I've tried to date.  The chile's cutting of the bourbon also brings out the chocolate undertones of the base beer - tastes strikingly similar to Taza Cacao Crunch Stone Ground chocolate - the interplay of spice and dark chocolate is outstanding.  Medium thick. 590 charactersLAp, Mar 20, 2017

A: About half a finger of cocoa cereal colored head. Black in the glass. Very dark brown in the dimple; with a reddish edge. Solid sheeting; no lacing. Very faint inkiness.
S: Rich chocolate cake on opening the bottle. Light coffee. Just a touch of char. Dark toffee, oak, and leather in the back. Very much like a less sweet Birthday Bomb!
T/MF: Much more dark toffee and oak and... Ooh. Lost focus on that transition. A touch of char, as well, but then a nice hit of caramel steps up, with an almost floral sweetness. Followed immediately by a rich chocolate, just shy of bittersweet. A touch of spice comes through on further sips. Kind of between cinnamon and nutmeg. Slight tobacco note. Body is soft and smooth. Just the right amount of carbonation (that is to say, almost none, but not flat, with just a hint of tingle).
Overall, not quite as good as the Birthday Bomb!, but a very nice beer for slow, calm, contemplative drinking.
Poured from a 12 oz. bottle, into a Belgian tulip glass. 1,121 charactersTruePerception, Jan 23, 2017
4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Poured from single-serve bottle....
Initially flat and oily pour, but the head "pops" at the last minute to a two-finger tan.  This may be the blackest most-opaque beer I've ever sampled.  Impressive to say the least.
Aromas of coffee, cocoa, and vanilla notes followed by the bourbon notes.  The alcohol is noticeable on the nose, but not offputting.  Very "stout" aroma and lots of it.  
The flavors are complex and play well with each other.  Very malty sweet up front, but ample background bitter coffee and chocolate flavors balance this perfectly.  Clean solvent alcohol "bite" but not burn.  The chilis are not present as an aroma, or a true flavor, but in addition to the boozy bite on the tongue, there is the unmistakable chili heat on the back of the throat.  I'm not completely sold that the barrel aging is a big "add" here because....
As is often the case, this barrel aged offering seems a little "thin" for the style.  It also lacks a bit on the carbonation side.
Overall, this is a truly unique, well-balanced, and outstanding offering that is at once experimental while also remaining pretty faithful to the style. 1,137 charactersMindcrime1000, Jan 22, 2017

Pour was disappointing, beautiful black stout but absolutely zero head.Smelling in the snifter, I get the same aromas as when I opened the bottle along with caramelized sugar. Tastes like fudge just lightly dusted with dried chilies with whiskey and coffee both prominent but playing very nicely all together. Finishes with vanilla, coffee, and just a hint of spice. Creamy, low carbonation.
Lots of hype for a pricey bottle, but I'll pay for it again. This is a delight. 555 charactersjds16, Jan 21, 2017

Rich, black pour with no head. Agitation yields a sliver of foamy beige head. 
Aroma of vanilla, chiles, barrel, hot fudge sundae, bourbon, and roast malt. 
Flavor is much of the same, tons of barrel, fudge, vanilla, chiles, hot caramel, and bourbon. 
Feel on this one is thinner than I'd like, but well within medium-heavy spec. Mild, perhaps even under, carbonation.

Brown sugar & milk chocolate flavors up front; sweet cream notes on the finish. Faint booze heat emerged as this warmed. Super sweet; enjoyable but over-the-top. I think the "regular" Bomb! might be better. 514 charactersGuyFawkes, Jan 17, 2017

Finishes with pleasant,c smooth bourbon.  As it warms, it imparts cognac notes.  Nice legs on the glass.  Fullish body.  Low carbonation.  Finish is flat.  Ends clean- an undesirable trait for a stout.  Very disappointed with this one.  Was expecting a lot more flavor and body. 374 charactersbnes09, Jan 09, 2017

~ 2 months from bottling date
Appearance- Pours a black color, oily body, opaque. Very thin layer of dark tan colored head, soapy bubbles. Alcohol legs coat and stain glass w/ a dark film. Tons of streaking spotty head lacing.
Aroma- Dark fudgy chocolates, brownie batter, syrupy caramel, molasses, tons of creamy vanilla. Dry cocoa, espresso beans, sweet nuttiness, and coconut. Light barrel char and oak, sweet bourbon heat. 
Taste- Gourmet chocolates, dark fudge, tons of vanilla, and caramel. Crème brulee, macadamia nuttiness, roasted coffee beans, mocha sweetness. Touches of charred oak, sweet bourbon, and a dash of peppers. 
Feel- Medium bodied, velvety and creamy, dessert-like creamy fluffiness. Lower carbonation, very smooth.
Overall- So much dessert-like sweetness, caramel and vanilla comes through in waves. Barrel aging seems to add a ton of the decadent sweetness, not an overagressive amount of oak or bourbon, but there is still some on the finish. Takes on a lot more sweetness than the base beer offers. Peppers are very faint but just add a spicy character on the finish. Just an incredible barrel aged stout. 1,151 charactersOrangeMen, Jan 08, 2017

Pour looks thin. Big bubbles dissipate immediately.
Aroma of figs with some booze
I pick up some dark chocolate and whiskey on the palate, but there's a budding tartness. This is definitely in the early throes of infection. Bugs getting at the mouthfeel already, as I would struggle to call it medium.
Huge disappointment, as I made a trip to my bottle shop just to nab this. 452 charactersbennyman12, Jan 08, 2017

It opened with no head at all. Black and thinly oily. It has a great, sweet, barrel boozy smell.
The taste similarly is sweet and barrel boozy, only it doesn't seem like most of the booze is home. 
Since it is a bad bottle, there isn't much to redeem itself here. Let's call it the way it is - the emperor has no ... head. I will talk to my vendor. I can't recommend this. 455 charactersschoolboy, Dec 30, 2016

poured into Speigelau Bourbon County snifter.
Appearance: dark black body with medium brown head that pours two fingers tall and quickly drops down to thick cap. Thick booze legs on the glass after each sip. About halfway through drinking the beer only a thin ring of head remains.
Smell: Lots of wet oak barrel character and top shelf bourbon. This smells very chocolatey and there is a hint of vanilla as well. Hint of lightly roasty coffee.  Hint of earthy and smokey peppers. Barrel and adjuncts are all present in the nose.  I really like the intense aroma of the whiskey in this beer, but this definitely trumps the adjuncts of prairie bomb. 
Taste: Bakers cocoa, lots of wet oak, and top shelf bourbon are the biggest flavors in this beer. Hints of smoke and charred oak barrel; vanilla, stale coffee, caramel, rootbeer, and cola are present in small proportions. Finishes with a lightly earthy and smokey bitterness from the peppers and a splash of vanilla beans.   
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low carbonation. This seems substantially thinner than prairie bomb, but still feels slightly oily. Not a hint of booze from this beer.
Overall: Really awesome barrel notes in this beer, but the adjuncts seem to be substantially faded when comparing the aroma to the flavor profile of this beer. I would have liked to taste more of the peppers and get that heat from them, but barrel aging must take the sting of the peppers away. 1,488 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Dec 29, 2016

4.7/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Picked up a bottle today at Beermongers for $8.20 a pop.  Definitely worth the price of admission for this delicious beer.
The beer pours a thick blackish brown color, looking more like motor oil than a well crafted RIS.  Head retention is pretty good, and lacing is light and sticky.  This beer has the look of one that has seen some considerable barrel aging.  The nose is the first give away that this is going to be something special.  There's a huge aroma of coffee, green chili's, Mexican chocolate, nestles quick, vanilla and dark chocolate.  There's a hint of coconut as well, if that isn't sufficient.  The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this rich, sweet, decadent impy stout, with the green chili's imparting just enough spice and heat to lightly counter the sweetness in this rich beer.  There's some noticeable whiskey on the nose and on the palate, but it's really blended in pretty nicely with the other components in this beer.  Mouthfeel is soft and very full, and the finish just goes on and on.  Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, with no sense of heat or heaviness on the palate.  You can certainly tell that the abv. is up there a bit, but even so, this is a pretty easy beer to take. 
Another excellent beer from Prairie.  These bomb and noir barrel aged beers are really where this brewery seems to shine.  Another impressive effort from the folks at Prairie. 1,422 charactersJohn_M, Dec 17, 2016
4.34/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.2512oz bottle purchased from Bedford, OH Lizardville for $12 American dollars. Julian dated 11/18/2016.
Vigorous pour into snifter yields a 2 finger tan head which quickly dissipates to a thin collar. No lacing but legs as the tasting proceeds. 
There was a huge pepper aroma as the cap was popped and as the brew was swirled in the vessel the pepper and spice was mellowed by a nice chocolate, roasted malt and caramel fragrance.  The barrel and whiskey were faintly present.
Now here is where this brew excels: pepper, spice co-mingle with a nice whiskey, barrel, caramel and char.  The heat is a bit too mellowed for my taste but does does blend nicely.
Full body, slick and sticky, peppered.
A nice RIS but I was hoping for a bit more whisky and pepper to balance the base. 780 charactersCaptCleveland, Dec 17, 2016

Mouthfeel was decent, had carbonation in this one unlike other reviews.  Overall excellent, will have to pick up more while still on the shelves here.

The smell is excellent. Chocolate, whiskey, vanilla, caramel, and a hint of heat all blend together to make a wonderfully complex scent.
The taste is similar, but to be honest the whiskey sort of muddles the original bomb flavors instead of enhancing them. Not exactly a mess, but I prefer the original.
Feel is not good. There was basically no carbonation at all which was extremely unenjoyable. It was also full bodied and slick.
Overall a decent beer. It has so much going for it and I hate to knock down the overall score so far just because of a carbonation issue, but it really ruined my overall drinking experience. 714 charactersCNoj012, Nov 22, 2016

The nose has a lot of warm whiskey notes, some vanilla, caramel, and salt. The flavor is full of barrel smoothed out very well by chocolate, caramel, vanilla, and a slight bit of spice from the chili. The feel is viscous and fits the style. This is just amazing! The barrel aging adds some more depth to an already outstanding stout. 426 charactersMeyers1023, Nov 05, 2016

Nose is heavy on the coffee and espresso. Other hints of molasses, roasted malt, chocolate, cocoa powder and fudge. The booze is present but not overwhelming. Chewy and aromatic. Beer opens chocolate, fudge, molasses and cocoa powder. Like a sweet mocha, chocolate cake. Some oak and booze mixes in towards the end but this one's super smooth throughout. Unbelievably good. Body is full with low carbonation. Smooth, slick and heavy in the mouth and goes down rich and thick with an oily aftertaste that clings to the inside of my cheeks. 
The best of the Bomb! series for sure. This one's pretty unreal. 705 charactersSpeedwayJim, Oct 26, 2016

L:  Beer pours black with a very thin ring of lacing.
S:  Aromas of BIG chocolate, cola, caramel, vanilla, with a touch of whiskey. 
T:  Taste follows the nose, chocolate brownie, some bitterness from the coffee, sweet vanilla, whiskey is subtle.
F:  Creamy, smooth mouthfeel.
O:  Excellent offering.  I think it could use more aggressive barrel aging to really set it apart, but it is fantastic none the less. 439 charactersNic1985Ace, Oct 18, 2016

4.68/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Brew is quite dark, as expected; head is dark brown, with better size and retention than many standard Bomb!s I've had.
Aroma is like Bomb!, but laced with bourbon, as expected. Sweet coconut, vanilla, and bourbon give way to the waves of chocolate, coffee, and chilies.
Flavor follows: what is already a fantastically complex (yet flawlessly integrated) brew gets an extra dose of complexity. The sweet (and strong!) bourbon and slightly dull oak complement the standard chocolate and coffee notes from Bomb!, while the chilies, more subdued than in the regular version (no doubt due to the time spent aging), add more flavor than heat (of which there isn't much of note). The bourbon really is quite noticeable, yet is very smoothly integrated.
Other flavors of note: grape soda, caramel syrup, and toffee.
Mouthfeel is incredibly full; probably the chewiest BA stout I've ever had. The ABV is even more well hidden than in the regular Bomb! (which clocks in higher, but still).
It's truly remarkable how well everything comes together here. This is really like drinking a beer that is masquerading as a White Russian. Man, if you could drink this every day: why wouldn't you? 1,183 charactersRoguer, Sep 30, 2016

A: Pours very dark brown with a whisper of medium brown head, evaporating quickly to a persistent ring. No lacing, poor retention. 
S: Vanilla bean, cinnamon, and milk chocolate up front and in nice balance. Light toasted oak and hot cocoa, a wisp of barbecue smoke and coffee. 
T: Vanilla, a bit of an alcohol taste/burn, oak, all supported by cinnamon and very light roast and dark chocolate. Touch of smoke and coffee. 
M: Full bodied with medium-light carbonation, moderate alcohol burn. 
O: A tasty, well balanced Mexican chocolate stout. The only knock on this is the moderate, though not overwhelming or sharp, alcohol heat. An improvement on the base beer. 683 characterspmarlowe, Sep 25, 2016

Not quite as smooth as I had hoped, i think i could have kept sitting on this.
Look is awesome, basically no head, pitch black. 
smells almost like pirate bomb, lots of barrel but w/o the distinct rum of course.
taste is great. silky smooth chocolate, some vanilla, barrel on barrel.
feel is good, but a little thinner than id hoped.
A great version of Bomb, still prefer Pirate, and i think apple Brandy noir is a better stout as well. 
would look for again though. 488 charactersJkolls, Sep 22, 2016

The smell is tons of chocolate and coffee with little, if any, barrel. The taste is pretty similar to Pirate Bomb!.  For some reason, barreling Bomb! seems to simply enhance the already amazing flavors.  Not because of the whiskey flavor, but because it seems to act like salt; a flavor enhancer.  I wish the flavor was more obvious. but because of everything that goes into the base beer, it would be tough to impart a forward whiskey flavor.  
All in all, it is pretty much the same as Pirate Bomb! for me.  Which is to say, it is an amazing beer that is better than the base, but just barely. 689 charactersnawpnawp, Aug 15, 2016

Aromas of heavily roasted coffee, rich vanilla and chocolate, subtle wood char and whiskey character, and subtle pepper spice. Flavors are chocolate and vanilla forward, with a quick follow of pepper heat. Very balanced, with notes of whiskey spice and warmth coming in, as well as some bitter roasted coffee in the backbone. Amazingly balanced on a smooth, creamy, chewy body. The beer has a solid aftertaste of chocolate, vanilla, and whiskey, with some of the chili heat amplifying the booze warmth starting to build. Layered and velvety smooth finish, with a rich chocolate, vanilla, and coffee linger. Really amazing beer! 753 charactersGarthDanielson, Aug 14, 2016

aromas of brown sugar, molasses, caramel, licorice, raisins, vanilla, whiskey, oak ... pretty complex on the nose, really nice stuff. light cherry, spice, and aggressive alcohol as it warms.
taste follows perfectly, sweet fudgey chocolate and sticky caramel up front, followed by dark chocolate, burnt malts and slightly bitter coffee. vanilla and oak flavors showing up as well, finishes on a beautifully roasty note that is slightly spicy. perfect amount of heat from the booze and a bit of spicy bite from the chillies coming through. 614 charactersHyptochrons, Aug 11, 2016

4.46/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer comes in a black color with almost no head.
The aroma offers sticky caramel, milk chocolate, intense woodiness, whiskey, twigs, oak, burnt wood, vanilla, cacao nib.
The flavor follows with an intense sweetness of brown sugar, caramel, almost like maple syrup, a light medicinal woody bitterness, oak, whiskey onto milk chocolate, dark fruits of plums and dates, vanilla sweetness, onto a semi dry tannic oaky finish. 
The heat is very light with a gentle tingle on the back of the palate. The beer is medium plus in mouthfeel and just pushes being a bit too sweet. 576 charactersdar482, Jun 14, 2016

Taste is rich, decadent chocolate, a hint of heat, caramelized sugar, and whiskey - which combines to be sweeter than expected.

Overall, an absolutely incredible barrel-aged stout. 377 charactersOmahaKF, Jun 14, 2016

Aroma of whiskey and vanilla notes with light pepper notes. Taste is a superb mix of whiskey notes with some vanilla and light spicy pepper notes. Some black chocolate notes are also noticeable and some residual sugar notes. Body is full with good creamy texture and good carbonation with no apparent alcohol notes. I love how the barrel-aged notes cut through the spicy character of this beer. 504 charactersPhyl21ca, Jun 11, 2016

Nose is coffee and bourbon with sweetness and oak.
Taste is sugary sweetness, roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla, with coffee and oak on the finish.
Mouthful is medium and smooth with low carbonation.  Finish lingers and is a touch warming.
A very solid stout.  More reminiscent of a sweet stout than a imperial stout.  The biggest drawback (for me) was the mouthful - I felt it could be heartier.  All other aspects were very solid especially if you prefer sweeter stouts.  I would definitely give this a try against the original. 587 charactersSlack, Jun 11, 2016

Pours a pitch black body with a khaki colored head. Head retention and lacing were pretty good.
Smell is of cinnamon, vanilla, vegetal peppers, and sweet bourbon/oak. Hops are non existent and alcohol is prominent. Disappointed to not get a lot of coffee. 
Taste is of sweet chocolate syrup followed by hot vegetal peppers. Toasted oak and spice like nutmeg or cinnamon come through next. As in nose, I dont get any coffee, bummer. Alcohol is moderate for a barrel aged imperial stout. 
Mouthfeel is full with a nice creamy head. Carbonation is lively and peppers add a slight numbing tingle to the tongue. 
Overall this beer was nowhere near the original Bomb! Whisky muddled everything and peppers didnt taste as good as in the regular bomb. Coffee also was lacking in this version unfortunately. 839 charactersangelmonster, Jun 09, 2016

4.43/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5I picked up a bottle of Prairie;s Barrel Aged Bomb! for $11.39 at The Lager Mill.  I've been wanting to try this ever since I first had Bomb!, so lets see how it goes.  2016 Vintage.  Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.
A-  The label looks good, it's weird and eye catching.  It poured a nice dark black color that took on just a slight bit of a brown hue when held to the light with just a thin ring worth of darker tan head that eventually faded away to nothing and it didn't really leave any lacing behind.  This is a pretty nice looking beer, but I wish the head and lacing were better.  
S=  The aroma starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with the bourbon barrels being the first to show up and they impart a nice noticeable bourbon barrel aroma with some wood and bourbon notes coming through and it's followed by a big chocolate aroma with some cocoa and it makes for a chocolate syrup like aroma.  Up next comes the spices which impart a mixture of the typical bomb spices showing up with just a little bit of a noticeable chili pepper like aroma with a little more dark roasted malts and sweet malts showing up towards the end.  This beer has a very good aroma, it's just what I would expect from a barrel aged version of Bomb.  
T-  The taste seems to be very similar to the aroma and it starts off with a lower amount of high sweetness with the bourbon barrels still being the first to show up and it's a good amount lighter than it was in the aroma, but it imparts all the same aspects and it's followed by some vanilla.  Up next comes the chocolate which imparts those same big chocolate syrup aspects that it did in the aroma and it's followed by the spices which impart the same aspects that they did in the aroma, but this time they are just a little lighter.  Towards the end comes a little bit of noticeable alcohol with a slight bit of that chili pepper coming through and on the finish there's hardly any bitterness with some sweetness taking it's place and it had a little bit of a lingering burn from the alcohol and chili and in the aftertaste there's some big chocolate syrup flavors with some spices and bourbon barrel flavors showing up.  This is a very good tasting beer, all the different aspect work very well together.  
M-  Pretty smooth, creamy, pretty velvety, a little warming,  on the lighter side of being full bodied with a slightly higher amount of medium carbonation.  The mouthfeel is very nice and it works well with this beer.
Overall I thought this was a very good beer and a very good example of the style, it had all those great flavors that bomb has and the addition of bourbon barrel really takes this beer to the next level and it makes for lots of complexity.  This beer has nice drinkability, one is the perfect amount for me.  What I like the most about this beer is how well all the different aspects worked together, it was very nice.  What I like the least about this beer is the appearance, I wish it had better head, retention and lacing.  I would for sure buy this beer again if I see it again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes big and complex barrel aged beers.  All in all I was very happy with this beer and I was impressed, sometimes beers can get to complex and the flavors start to clash, but that wasn't the case with this beer and I thought it was executed  very well.  It;s now my new favorite beer from Prairie and it's one of the better barrel aged Stouts I've had.  Great job guys, this is a really tasty and complex beer, keep up the hard work. 3,554 charactersStoutHunter, Jun 01, 2016

A: pitch black with no clarity very very little head but what flashed in the glass was mocha in color

T: big sweetness, lots of chocolate and vanilla, a little very little coffee and maybe some pepper heat on the finish 
M: a touch thin the carbonation is almost non existent 
O: wow what a tastey bomb beer but absolutely no purpose in being barrel aged it basically just tastes like the orginal with a touch thinner mouthfeel and almost no carbonation. I would not even have come close to guessing this was barrel aged. 622 charactersSomethingClever, Jun 01, 2016

3.85/5  rDev -13.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.75Pours almost black, with a small, immediately disappearing dark brown head, leaving back a small, bubbly ring of lacing.
Smells of roasted coffee, which gets  a smoky quality, resulting from the chilies, blending beautifully into a fragile, less pronounced barrel spiciness. Rich toffee malts and a hint of molasses create the foundation in this, with all the adjuncts blending in on top, crowned by a whiff of flowery sweet vanilla.
Drinks very silk, with a nice interplay of oaken spices and the chilies dialing in for a hot, still pleasant finish. Drinks fairly easy for its higher abv, very well composed, while the beer's barrel addition is almost a bit subdued.
Begins with whipped cream, toffee, milk chocolate, a hint of molasses and bakers chocolate, from which the chilies evolve. They add a short, hot bite to the beer, with the chocolaty maltiness cutting through, which invites spicy and pleasantly dry Bourbon to the palate, adding to the chili warmth after the swallow. Finishes with a great mix of toffee, licorice and a faint Bourbon dryness, leaving earthen coffee on the palate.
Comes very well together, with all adjuncts blending perfectly well into the malty foundation of the beer. Its barrel treatment is a bit of a let down since it is a bit subdued. 1,279 charactersaleigator, May 21, 2016

4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle from the most recent release poured into a snifter
A- pours black in color with just a hint of light seeping through the edges, small foamy khaki head eventually reduces to just a ring around the edge
S- aroma opens up with fresh espresso, dark chocolate, vanilla cream, charred malt, caramel, toffee, chocolate syrup, earthy oak and spicy whisky. 
T- bold sweet notes of molasses, caramel and toffee up front eventually give way to rich dark chocolate, almost chocolate syrup-like, along with some nuttiness & charred malt.  The mid-palate brings out notes of cinnamon and whiskey barrel popping through, along with some earthy notes from the wood.  The finish brings out a hint of vanilla sweetness and closes out with a vinous note, with just enough pepper heat lingering after consuming 
M- medium-thick body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a velvety finish, slight pepper burn on the linger
O- this one stands on the same level as the others of the style that people pay hundreds of dollars for. Another world class barrel aged beer from Prairie 1,112 charactersTreyliff, May 14, 2016

Smell is initially a musty boron barrel aroma. As you continue to smell it you get notes of vanilla and caramel coming though as well as undertones of milk chocolate.
Taste is initially a slightly musty bourbon flavor surrounding notes of caramel, vanilla, milk chocolate, and cocoa. The cocoa is most pronounced on the back of the taste and swallow when you get this slightly powdery dry coating on the back of your throat. pretty sweet for a stout, but not cloying - it works for this stout. There is certainly no hiding the bourbon here - there is a nice warming sensation from the bourbon as you sip the beer, but its not what I'd consider a "boozy" barrel aged beer. The bourbon characteristics are complimentary, not overpowering. Not a ton of chili character to this beer, although there is a spiciness that certainly comes from the chills. The flavor is just not very pronounced. 
Feel is thick, luscious, smooth and buttery. Just an incredible thickness to this beer, like brownie batter. To me, Bomb! and its variants have mastered the feel of an imperial stout. This is the standard. Mild carbonation, but decently carbonated for a barrel aged beer. Uh, its a sipper, for sure, but a drinkable sipper? If that makes sense. 
Overall I can see where people are coming from with the comparison of this to regular Bomb!. This is really good, but is it better than Bomb!? I don't know - to me they are two different animals. the bourbon adds a really nice depth and warmth to the beer that I enjoy, but you certainly don't get any of the chili notes coming through on this one (to be fair I didn't get a ton of chili notes on Bomb! either). We can quibble over whether Bomb! or BA Bomb! is better, but what I can tell you is that both are incredible stouts and must haves. 1,964 charactersFBarber, May 11, 2016

3.96/5  rDev -11.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4From a 355 ml bottle to a tulip. Reviewed from notes dated March 9, 2016. 
A-The beer looks somewhat flat coming out of the bottle. A short, mocha colored head fades almost immediately and leaves no lacing. The beer is pitch black and still. Uninspiring, but not ugly to look at.
S-The aroma is well spiced with clearly identifiable chili notes, as well as vanilla, cocoa, and brewed coffee. The barrel is there, and it gives off some caramel and a certain boozy sweetness, but it doesn't overwhelm. Its not bad, but I don't like it as much as regular Bomb! Too much going on?
T-The taste is similar to the smell. The beer is quite sweet from start to finish with layers upon layers of adjuncts coming across my palate. Like normal Bomb! this is kind of a mess, but it is mostly enjoyable and the flavors play well. I'm not sure that this beer needs the addition of barrel aging.
M-My bottle was a touch under-carbonated. What little carbonation there was was creamy. Medium heft for the style.
O-I like regular Bomb! a lot. There is so much going on in the normal version and the flavors work together well, so I was excited to try this one (although I have had a few bottles that tasted overly vegetal, as if the chilis went bad or something). With my expectations set high, this beer was a bit of letdown. It is a GOOD beer, but the addition of barrel aging doesn't help make a better Bomb! 1,398 charactersspoony, Apr 30, 2016

Look: Thick stout pour with very little head that just fizzled out.
Smell: Initially got a metal or tin like smell but as it sat faded away. Whole lot of chocolate and coffee after that.
Taste: Was expecting more after really enjoying the regular Bomb. Barrel seems to have sweetened it up but overall the flavor is really balanced. There is nothing overpowering unlike the regular bomb that has some overpowering characteristics.
Feel: Light-bodied and smooth.
Overall: I think I had higher expectations for this one but it is still great. Just much different than the original version which I really enjoyed. Also was thrown off by the metal/tin aroma that I got on the pour. 702 charactersbranddetroit, Apr 19, 2016

Smooth chocolate, sherry, coffee, coconut and dark overly ripe dark fruit all play in the flavor.  This is a very well rounded version. Super smooth and velvety. 369 charactersSPLITGRIN, Apr 09, 2016

Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa powder, chocolate syrup, vanilla bean, caramel, toffee, coffee bean, brewed coffee, earth, char, whisky, and wood aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa powder, chocolate syrup, vanilla bean, caramel, toffee, coconut, brewed coffee, earth, chili, whisky, wood flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of bitterness and heat on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a perfect smell and super tasty flavors from the whisky barrel aging that works super well and improves on the base beer.

Booze, spice and vanilla with coffee undertones on the nose
Wafts of sweet malt, booze, a hint of coffee, and warming spice on the palate - amazeballs. This stuff is just perfect. 
Lighter bodied, but still good. Sweet coating the lips. 
Overall a stunner. Staggeringly good - the barrel has melowed the spice and the heat is just a warming glow, not hot like in the base beer. All the flavors meld and work together in this one 497 characterspagriley, Apr 07, 2016

It is a fairly thin stout with mild barrel characteristic and a raisin sweetness that pops in the front, followed by chocolate notes. The chilies and coffee that make Bomb! a great beer are noticeably absent. 330 charactersrodmanfor3, Apr 06, 2016
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Barrel aged bomb was hard to find but not quite worth the effort.
Looks like bomb, a chocolatey stout with a smaller head and nice lacing.
Smells is chocolate, coffee, but hardly any barrel and the pepper isn't there like regular bomb.
Taste is good, but not great.  I imagined bomb with a nice bourbon taste on the finish, but the barreling is weak and it's not as good as the regular version. 
Mouth feel is medium, and smooth.
Overall I was disapointed because I like bomb a lot and thought this would be better.  It's not.  The heat isn't there, maybe because of the barrel, and there isn't anything that makes you believe they put it in the barrel.  It's just a regular good stout. 691 charactersJay_P22, Apr 06, 2016

I was a huge fan of the base beer butt the time spent in the barrel pushes this one to a completely different atmosphere.
Absolutely loaded with caramel and toffee and vanilla notes, it's creamy and rich and thick and decadent....  The Diesel Unlimited I'm having with this does not hold up to the sheer amazingness of this beer...  
This would be my desert island beer.
It easily surpasses all others.

There was no head whatsoever.  There is no lacing on the glass with low to medium carbonation on the mouthfeel.  The color is very dark brown/black, with no light coming through, even held right up to a bulb.  The smell is immediate, strong bourbon with the classic stout/chocolate underneath.  I'm also picking up some alcohol and chilis.  The taste is first and foremost bourbon.  The flavor is strong but not overpowering.  Under that is a strong chocolate taste.  I'm picking up a little vanilla and booze.  There is also a chili burn on the backbend.  Overall, this is a phenomenal beer.  I rated it slightly higher than the base beer, but I'd like to do a head-to-head to compare.  I feel the base beer may have more discernable flavors, only because the whiskey is so prevalent. 900 charactersjvgoor3786, Mar 29, 2016

4.51/5  rDev +0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Looks on point. Smells on point. Smells more than on point. Fudgey brownie meets oaken, bourbon spice with a little extra spice on top. The smell is thick and sticky and sweet. It smells like some boozy dessert treat. Pretty phenomenal. 
A bit of tartness in the taste though. I hadn't heard that in others descriptions to me. It doesn't harm the beer really and I keep sipping along. Continue to get a huge brownie, baker's chocolate profile. Faint lingering spicy chile notes are the only remnants of what I recall from the base beer, which I've gone a while without drinking. 
There's an excellent interaction between the gooey chocolatey flavors and a clean whiskey/bourbon flavor and this is complemented further by some thick caramel, tobacco, oak and raisin. The initial tartness has all but disappeared, so maybe I imagined it. 
As for how this drinks, it's big, full in the mouth, gooey, and booze present, though there's no offensive or overwhelming heat here. A tinge of tartness does occasionally sneak in. 
This is highly enjoyable. Full-flavored, rich-drinking and, again, dessert-like. 1,104 charactersONovoMexicano, Mar 24, 2016

Poured into a snifter.
A - Pours very dark with a small head that disappears completely quickly.
S - You get a lot of barrel on the nose.  Would lead you to believe it will be a bit hot.
T - But it is not hot!  The flavor is awesome - lots of chocolate, vanilla and a bit of coffee. The alcohol is buried underneath. I get no chilli flavor or heat.  But this tastes so good I would not touch the recipe.
M - Thick and creamy.  Low carbonation.  Warming.
O - This is a great beer.  Better than Bomb!, and I love Bomb!.  Buy some if you can find it. 623 charactersspacecake9, Mar 23, 2016

It can handle, and would be improved by, a bit more of the spirit influencing the beer. Without that oomph, you're left with extra layers of caramel and slight vanilla, but not enough to really underline the flavors of the stout itself, just slightly embellish them. 354 charactersGeorgiabeer, Mar 22, 2016

Smell: you smell the chillies up front than oak and chocolate hints. 
Taste: you get a chocolate front with vanilla, followed by the smooth oak from the aging. It finishes with the spice from the chillies. The chillies arnt as present as they are in the regular bomb. 
Feel: medium bodied, insanely smooth with a slight heat as it finishes.
Overall: an excellent beer which lives up to the reputation. 476 charactersFutbolmanby, Mar 20, 2016

It's quite chocolatey upon first tasting, and then everything really comes out.  The peppers aren't diminished at all, which is 100% fine by me.  I really get a lot of the barrel in this, and the spice and heat from the barrel play really well with the adjuncts in this.  While you don't get every single defined flavor come across in sequence like you do with the regular, I get a ton of the bourbon barrel, chocolate, pepper, caramel, a slight hint of coffee, vanilla.  Overall:  Really excellent beer, highly recommended. 603 charactersChcshammonde, Mar 12, 2016

S - big vanilla, toffee, molasses, chocolate, light coffee, bourbon, very light on the chili peppers in the smell, wholesome, just amazing
T - more bourbon, oak, chili pepper, coffee, with vanilla, toffee, molasses, dark and milk chocolate, cocoa, burnt marshmallow, caramel all backing it up. After the smell I almost wish the vanilla/toffee/caramel/molasses was more up front, but that wouldn't make it better, it would just be different
M - super heavy. Alcohol covered at 11.2% abv. Aftertaste is bourbon, dark roasts malts, some vanilla/caramel. Just great. 
O - God damn. This is an amazing beer. This is basically right on part with BCBS,  Parabola, KBS, Black Note, etc. It's a different beer but that just adds to the awesomeness. 822 charactersHopHunter19, Mar 11, 2016

Review #1150
Prairie Artisan Ales always have some incredible graphics on their bottles and this one might just be their most insane looking label to date. With an aggressive pour, a barely there, khaki colored film topped the thick, oily and nearly still, absolute pitch black liquid. The head morphed into a bubbly collar. Droplets of lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was outstanding. Super rich and fragrant. Freshly brewed coffee and chocolate fudge notes dominated. Perhaps some chocolate syrup as well. Sweet but not cloying. Loads of smooth bourbon. Vanilla also came through strong. Intense coconut notes. This reminded me a lot of Bourbon County Brand Coffee Stout.
The flavor profile was terrific but not quite as smooth or as intense as the aroma. Roasted malts were noticeable on the front end. Bit of chocolate fudge. Espresso came through in the center. Good dose of vanilla. More roast and char on the back end. Some whiskey. Very subtle spice notes appeared in the finish. I probably would not peg this for chillies though. There was a good amount of alcohol heat and a subtle, lingering bitterness as well.
The mouthfeel was rich and creamy but a bit undercarbonated. Fuller bodied for the style. The liquid contained a very fine and mellow effervescence. After each sip, the beer left a sticky film on my lips.
Barrel Aged Bomb! is a big and flavorful yet smooth and rounded imperial stout that demonstrates a subtle yet notable use of whiskey barrels. This beer is definitely more interesting and complex than regular BOMB! 1,654 charactersDamian, Mar 05, 2016

Smell: Similar to regular Bomb but with more of a slightly wood oak. Slight slight chilli, chocolate, and more chocolate. Hints of vanilla.
Taste: Chocolate and vanilla up front, slight chilli throughout. Little boozy at finish. Nice leathery after taste.
Overall, tastes similar to regular Bomb. The BB almost masks some of the sweetness of regular Bomb however. Just as great, if not better. Fantastic beer. 523 charactersMateo2699, Mar 03, 2016

S: Whiskey with dark chocolate and coffee joining the boozy party, touch of cinnamon.
M: Starts off like a piece of caramel is melting in your mouth, slightly syrupy, and then smooths out at the end
T: Vanilla and caramel hit first, definitely has some sweetness. Some spicy pepper and cinnamon. Not as much dark chocolate as the nose would give. Whiskey  burn is smooth with a little of a leathery bite.  
O: Pretty tasty,great aromas, and enjoyed that initial mouth feel. Only negative is it tends to thin out, and needs just a little more balance to sweetness. Overall will get again! 675 charactersRStaff4, Mar 03, 2016

Nose is a blend coffee, dark chocolate/ nibs and some burn. 
Taste is like the nose, with mostly chocolate/ dark characteristics, malt, molasses, anise hints. There's barrel flavor and a spicy hit of chile just like their non-barrel-aged version.  
So tasty. 
Feels sticky and thick. 
I forgot how much I liked Bomb! I think I like BABomb! even more. 457 charactersTBoneJones, Mar 03, 2016

4.66/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a Delirium Tremens snifter.  No readable freshness date.
A- Pours a 99% opaque black color with a 1/4 inch light brown head that doesn't retain long before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a few tiny patches of sheer surface foam.  Not-so-resilient lacing leaves tiny clots behind.
S- Sweet coffee aroma with a big dose of vanilla.  Also some chocolate and caramel.
T- Lovely interplay of coffee, vanilla and bourbon barrel.  So smooth and balanced with no one element sticking out too far.  The chili starts showing itself with a vegetal green pepper flavor.  Chocolate show up more as the drink progresses and the bitterness of the coffee helps offset the big sweetness.
M- Silky smooth and creamy with low carbonation and a full body.
O- A great variation on the Bomb! concept (because the base beer is different from actual Bomb!).  The flavors are so well integrated and the beer as a whole is so insanely smooth.  The barrel character is also not over-the-top which I rather like. 1,024 charactersImmortale25, Feb 26, 2016

4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Serving: 12 oz. bottle poured into a Cigar City snifter. Bottled on 1/7/16, making this about 1.5 months old.
A: Pours a medium body, pitch black. Some soft bubbles coming up along the edges leaving a faint, tan head.
S: Vanilla, cinnamon, spice, nutmeg, pepper skin. All of it wrapped in a subtle layer of whiskey and rye. 
T: Cocoa, nutmeg, cayenne, vanilla, cinnamon, rum, whiskey, oak, char. 
M: A bit on the thin side, but not watery. Decent carbonation. Alcohol well-hidden. Most of the kick and spice is buried in the barrel-aging.
O: Been wanting to try this one for a while. Haven't been all too much impressed with Prairie's output as of late, but figured one of their most well-known beers could redeem that. Bomb! is a good beer, but maybe not a great beer. I think it falls short because it's a bit muted and doesn't quite pop like it's competitors in the style. Barrel-aging an already muted beer doesn't sound like a good idea, but I think they pull it off here. This one is very balanced, drinkable, smooth, and somehow the flavors pop just a little more in the base beer. I think that's mostly because a lot of the rough edges get smoothed out over time. This is a great beer, and one of the best offerings from Prairie.
Recommendation: Not as hard to find as you might think, so definitely grab this if you can, it's well worth it. 1,355 charactersSparty1224, Feb 25, 2016

I was a little hestitant to buy this as a I was underwhelmed by Bomb! but this was well worth my money. Typical black color, not much head.

The flavor was real nice, transitioning from chocolate to vanilla then mild notes of chilies all with a touch of the whiskey barrel in the back.

4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle poured into a Prairie Artisan Ales Prairie Dog teku glass. Enjoyed on 2.10.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal. 
The beer pours a jet black color, thick, oily, viscous and inky with a thin finger of khaki head, low retention and no lace. The aroma is wonderful, loads of coffee, strong but layered barrel character, light spice, tons of chocolate, chewy oak, char and hints of vanilla. The flavors are impeccable, bursting with coffee, spice is there but integrated really well, vanilla bean and semi sweet chocolate pop out well with bourbon and charred oak. Brown sugar and caramel richness linger well offering a very decadent total package that has a nice liveliness from the heat. The mouthfeel is great, chewy and thick, full bodied, very smooth with lower carbonation with a silky finish that has some light warmth.
Verdict: A stellar barrel aged stout from Prairie Artisan Ales. Great complexity, nice balance and excellent coffee character. The base beer is already great, but this elevates it to a completely different level. Outstanding beer. 1,065 characterskevanb, Feb 20, 2016

4/5  rDev -10.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Pours a soul devouring black, which is attenuated by the lack of head to offset the darkness of this beer. I poured at a 45 degree angle for about half the bottle and then turned the glass perpendicular, and still didn't get much of any fizz. No lacing sprouted out either. Bourbon and oak come out first in the nose, a sweet, complex sampling of malt and vanilla aromas come out in the background. A sip opens up a smooth blast of vanilla and sweet malt, with a little bourbon booze burn on the back end. The booze taste is well balanced, and doesn't make it difficult to drink at all. Mouth feel doesn't make it super fun to drink, although it isn't bad. It isn't as thick or creamy as a regular Bomb! or other imperial stouts on the market. It feels a bit thin overall. Overall, it's still a great beer. Plenty is happening, it's all just very subdued. I do fancy the artwork though.
As per how it compares with a regular Bomb! It adds a little complexity over the regular Bomb! while pulling out some of the big, bold flavors of the Bomb! Mouth feel is better with the regular Bomb. Both are great beers, but I really think Bomb trumps the BA version in most ways. I prefer the artwork on this one.

My bottle pours a flat black with little head that went away immediately. No lacing as the glass goes down. The smell is almost identical to regular Bomb, faint chocolate and heavy chilies, no barrel. Under carbed and a bit thin, unlike regular Bomb that has a thick mouthfeel. Tastes like flat cola. I'm super disappointed in this one and I am once again kicking myself for buying another over priced bullshit beer from Prairie that costs a dollar per oz. I'm seriously done with these guys. Don't follow the hype, save your money. 584 charactersStArnoldFan, Feb 19, 2016

Dark pour, with no foam head generation at all.  Smell is of bourbon, although not overly aggressive.  Taste is primarily cocoa and bourbon upfront, with some vanilla and coffee towards back end.  Definitely not as much coffee as I was expecting based on how much is present in regular non-BA BOMB!  Having said that this is still a very tasty and smooth tasting IS. Not a very full-body mouth feel, but pleasant. Would gladly grab and drink this again when if I saw it. 502 characterseifster82, Feb 18, 2016

It has absolutely no head/carbonation even after an aggressive pour. As a result, the beer is silky smooth, almost water-like. There is coffee in the nose, but the taste has sweet beginnings and a hot bourbon and chile notes at the end. This dark stout despite being high abv tastes a bit more like a porter since it is not nearly as as thick as other beers in the category. 505 charactersTrevor11, Feb 17, 2016

Had no expectations of receiving this bottle and no expectations of this beer. I did pop it open about 15 minutes after unpacking...thanks to Wisconsin's "great" Winter season, the beer was at perfect drinking temp. Poured a solid, thick black with a lovely tan head. Smelled of roasty deliciousness, and quite a bit of barrel. Taste followed the smell, barrel flavor was dead on for me. The Feel....man, this is where the beer killed it for me. Most barrel aged beers get too thin and they come across soda-ish. This beer does not disappoint, thick as F&$k. Overall, I will be searching for this beer. I NEED MORE!!! 695 charactersatone315, Feb 17, 2016

I felt like the barrel character was minimal and the mouthfeel was pretty thin compared to a normal Bomb!. I think this is a good beer because the base is so fire, but the barrel didn't help this one at all. Honestly I would rather have a regular Bomb! any day of the week so I can taste those adjuncts. 375 charactersBeerSamurai34, Feb 16, 2016

O: This is a well executed variant on one of my go-to favorite stouts. To me there was less of a lingering alcohol flavor that sometimes burdens BA stouts, but with the aging I thought the stout took on a smoother and more luxurious flavor depth vs. regular Bomb! Overall I immensely enjoyed the refined taste. My only fault is that the vanilla and chilies were slightly muted - however this lends itself to a smoother experience all around. At the end of the day this was a great variation of the base beer and one worth seeking out. 1,087 charactersFireman_RK, Feb 16, 2016

Though I'm still not sure how the barrel aged version has a lower abv than the standard Bomb... 291 charactersLochnessmonster, Feb 16, 2016

Poured a nice deep dark color with a head that slowly made its way to the top of the pour.
Unfortunately that's where it went south for me.
What I like about regular Bomb is the spice, which seemed to have been highly diminished by the barrel, which was only faint itself.
This also seemed more like a porter in the mouthfeel than an imperial stout.
Overall it was decent. Knowing I could pay a few bucks more for a great ba stout in a 22oz format, I'll opt for the bomber route going forward but worth a try once. 564 charactersSanFranJake, Feb 14, 2016

Pours near black, with almost no head.  Aroma has big notes of chocolate, vanilla, slight barrel, caramel.  For taste, you need to ask when? as it continues to change throughout the glass. Initially its big chocolate and vanilla.  As you get into the glass, the barrel comes out and i get the chiles on the finish, just like regular bomb.  Very complex stout, lots of flavors, evolves during the tasting, just great. 507 charactersdrew42e, Feb 14, 2016

4.69/5  rDev +4.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Right off the bat... 11.2% vs 14%... I don't think this actually Prairie Bomb thrown in barrels. And from the initial pour, with its dark brown color, It seems very likely now. 
Dark, dark brown in color, Pretty much black. No head to speak of. Some alcohol legs coming down. Looks OK. 
The smell is off the charts, however. It smells like a kahlua coffee and vanilla ice cream. Or like a spiked Affogatto (espresso shot with ice cream). The barrel is bringing large amounts of vanilla, coconut, vanilla and oak to the table. 
TONS of vanilla on the flavor. As if there were not enough vanilla in regular bomb. The vanilla bean is lingering and lingering. That kahlua coffee flavor backs it up and it goes down silky smooth and sweet. Nothing overpowering, just awesome. 
I am coming to the conclusion that they made a lighter version of the beer sans the adjuncts. Then aged it whiskey barrels, then added the coffee beans, the vanilla, etc. into the barrels with it for the last month or so or perhaps just into a bright tank all together; because the vanilla and coffee are shining through really nicely. 
Nearly flawless, similar in character to the recent Vanilla Noir. I am just missing some complexity. Some smoke, earthiness, tobacco, etc. would take this beer into the stratosphere (thank you, leo). Prairie seems to have their spice additions dialed down now. Lets see them make a beer like Parabola and add these spices for boost. 
Regardless, awesome beer. 1,474 charactersraynmoon, Feb 13, 2016

I am building this review off of the standard Bomb! Sorry if i that is considered improper, but oh well...
BA Bomb! has an excellent aroma, peppers, chocolates still readily noticeable. To my surprise i did not get a great whiff of bourbon. 
Taste wise, this is less an upgrade to the Bomb! and more a variant of it. Here's where the bourbon kicks in, really nicely balanced with the body and the deep earthly choco-flavors. On the plus side, the bourbon doesn't hit you as overly boozy as it does in some other BA stouts... but rather just adds a nice complexity with the oaky-firey goodness.
Body - Awesome, feels really big and full. I dont know how else to describe it.
Overall - A+, killer, though that blasted price tag.... 783 charactersalexpcat13, Feb 12, 2016

A: Pours a rich, dark brown with a slight tan head that quickly dissipates into a ring that still manages a little lacing.
S: Whiskey and roast notes are met with some chili and vanilla tones.  Boozey.  A little intimidating, but not enough to give up a barrel aged version of a fantastic beer.
T: An amazing concert of chocolate, caramel, coffee and vanilla with a little whiskey and chili notes on the back end.  The flavors are big and bold, but not overwhelming and riff on one another perfectly.  There is a little alcohol warming on the back end, but isn't too hot.  The lively chili flavor settles on the palate.
M: Like the big flavors, this beer has some heft to it but it's one you want to wade through.  Not much carbonation to it, but enough to keep it lively.  
O: I love BOMB! and this is on another level.  A fantastic beer, a must have and one you should keep in your closet.  With the barrel aging and impressive ABV, it'll be just fine in your Bat Cave for a while until you get around to drinking it. 1,078 charactersFBGordon, Feb 12, 2016

4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Look - Pitch black with virtually no head.  Color is good, just wish for a little more head.
Smell - Chocolate, coffee, cinnamon, chile peppers, and whiskey.  Everything the bottle says is included, you smell.  All blends together very well.
Taste - Follows the nose in that it is a perfect blend of a great stout, flavorful chile peppers, and a mellowing whiskey.  The chiles taste very fresh and give the effect that has on the taste and the lack of cinnamon are my only knocks on the rating.  The taste has a little too much of a vegetable flavor IMO.
Feel - Creamy, but the peppers don't go down as smoothly as I remember regular Bomb! being.  Whiskey doesn't do much to smooth the feel.
Overall - Excellent BA beer.  Worth seeking out. 744 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Feb 08, 2016

My top beer of the evening at EBF.  LOVED IT 296 charactersjcflorian, Feb 07, 2016

4.71/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Awesome beer. Chocolate, coffee, vanilla, with a bit of spice and whisky. I drank some bourbon before this so I'm not coming in fresh, but the booze is not playing a lead role, might be better if it were. The only things this lost points on were for minimal card and not being chewy af.
EDIT: I let it warm up to room+ temp and the whisky came out. Unfortunately it is not a whisky flavor I'm digging (reminiscent of JD). I'm taking off a few points, but this is still a great beer. I'd love to try a bourbon, rum, or apple brandy BA version. 543 charactersmctizzz, Feb 07, 2016

Very nice in all aspects. This was a little thin, but otherwise exceptional. Odd thing is that I can't really say I tasted the base beer much in here. No spicy heat or dark chocolate bitterness that you can taste in BOMB!, but more of a subtle and smooth amalgam of mellow barrel and fudge. Crazy how easy it is to drink! 351 charactersLloydDobler, Feb 01, 2016

Aromas of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toffee, molasses, whiskey, toasted oak, dark bread, light chili pepper/dark fruit, and roast/oaky earthiness.

Taste of huge dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toffee, molasses, whiskey, toasted oak, dark bread, light chili pepper/dark fruit, and oak/roasted earthiness. Light-moderate roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, vanilla, toffee, molasses, whiskey, toasted oak, dark bread, light chili pepper/dark fruit, and oak/roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Insane complexity, robustness, and perfect balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee/spice, and whiskey barrel flavors; with an amazing roasted bitter/sweet balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light carbonation and full body; with a very smooth, creamy/silky, and lightly slick/chalky balanced mouthfeel that is insane. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a slight warmth lingering after the finish. Overall this is a mind blowing barrel aged spiced stout! All around insane complexity, robustness, and perfect balance of dark/roast/bready malt, coffee/spice, and whiskey barrel flavors; and very smooth and easy to sip on for the big ABV. A top tier world class offering for sure. 1,644 characterssuperspak, Jan 31, 2016

4.09/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Pours black, with almost non-existent head that dissipates as quickly as it appears. Smells of molé sauce, with cocoa powder, chili oil, smoked woodchips, and undertones of a nutty, light-roasted coffee. Full-bodied and emollient in texture, but with a mild pang of capsaicin on the finish. The flavors are predominantly chocolate and pepper, with a solid malt backbone--good, but unremarkable. 
If you enjoy chiles in your stouts, you'll be satisfied with this one, but the barrel-ageing isn't adding much here other than hype and rare. I'm glad the markup isn't much beyond the regular Bomb price, because I don't feel like it's worth chasing feverishly to try it if you're unable to find it locally. 704 charactersdarktronica, Jan 30, 2016

Smell is chocolate, vanilla, oak, bourbon, coffee, slight alcohol, very little chili. Taste is somewhat like the regular. I get a lot of whiskey, coffee, cocoa, chocolate, vanilla, slight almond. Its all very nice, but I find the nice subtle chili of regular bomb to be masked here--so much so that its barely detectable or differentiated from the slight alcohol bite you get. Feel is smooth, creamy, but almost no carbonation. 531 charactersAppaZappa, Jan 29, 2016

S: Robust like regular bomb with a hint of the Pappy Barrels it was stored in. There is also a beautiful vanilla fragrance looming on the back end
T: As  with the smell, the chocolate and coffee are strong up front and on the aftertaste the whiskey barrels and vanilla tantalize your taste-buds for many minutes later.
F: Creamy, vanilla-y, indulgent and warm. Perfect beer for cold weather
O: Absolutely one of the best Prairie has ever done. The price is well worth the admission...over and over. The only qualm is that the whiskey barrels seem to mute the chilies inside the stout, aside from that this beer is near perfect. 821 charactersLightnerLiquorKS, Jan 29, 2016
4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4.75Bottle purchased at AJ's Beer Warehouse in Henrietta, NY.
Holy crap, this was good.
This one pours a dark black, with very little head or lacing.
Smells like bourbon soaked cookie dough studded brownies- really. The aroma just jumps out of the glass. Silky sweet bourbon, chocolate fudge brownies, cookie dough, vanilla, and oak. This is insane.
This doesn't really feel a whole lot like Bomb- I don't actually get any peppers in the taste, or coffee, but the barrel-aging has ramped up the fudgy chocolate flavors to the max, just decadent and rich, with lots of vanilla, some molasses, oak, and a sort of cookie dough type thing. The bourbon is integrated well, it's not bourbon-forward- it's clear that this was in the barrels the exact right amount of time.
This is medium bodied- possibly a little bit thin for an imperial stout, but certainly not a thin beer overall, just not super super thick. There's a lower level of carbonation, which detracts slightly, but not overly so.
This is absolutely delicious, and shows Prairie's deft hand with beers. Awesome stuff. 1,076 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jan 29, 2016

This time enveloped in whisky accented attire, the flavors of the base imperial stout are brought to like with the added sweetness, spiciness and smoothness of the added booze and the barrel.
Like tar, the stout layers in the glass with a patient swirl of coffee-like creme. Ominously dark and carrying an onyx-like sheen, the deep and deviant perfume overcomes the nose with espresso, dark chocolate, grilled fruit, vanilla and cream. Its lavish taste slathers the early palate with caramel, vanilla and molasses before the chocolate and char follows closely behind.
The stout develops more earthy character on the middle palate with those fresh aroma flavors, its decadent bittersweet chocolates and roasting walnut bitterness. Its lightly syrupy chocolate taste and texture is matched with the spiciness of sharp cinnamon and smooth vanilla as the barrel's taste of oak, caramel and toasted cherry and grape give a soft vinous tone in the end.
Remaining rich, viscous and off-chewy, the beer's full and creamy body weighs on the tongue with the low-lying carbonation that ensures full saturation of the tastebuds. Trailing with a long, heated warmth of whisky, its the chocolate and vanilla that provide balance with a mildly chalky texture to finish. 1,320 charactersBEERchitect, Jan 28, 2016

The peppers become obvious at the very back.    So smooth and a touch more syrup than Bomb!, but sticky sweet in a good way.
A great way to get a Bomb! fix with just a few added extras that might not necessarily make for a better beer, but surely don't detract that much either. 503 charactersstephens101, Jan 23, 2016

Tasted side by side with regular Bomb. Pours a tad bit darker than regular and you can see the difference in body. Aroma is devastatingly enticing. Lots of vanilla and cocoa nibs come though. Flavor is smooth as can be, smoother than reg bomb. Some coffee, but mostly vanilla, oak, chocolate, and barrel notes. Body is rich and creamy...more so than regular bomb, but I would love to see how it compares to original batches of Bomb as I feel this beer has thinned over its production life. The only thing reg bomb has on this is that the barrel seems to mask some of the spice from the peppers. Minor complaint. Outstanding beer.

Aroma is sweet with vanilla and chocolate, coffee, oak, slight heat and whiskey. 
Thick and smooth with a lower level of carbonation. Chocolate, coffee, heat and ends with some vanilla. Whiskey peaks towards the front dissipating throughout but sticks around in the aftertaste with some chocolate and caramel. Ends a little dry.
Pretty nice showing barrel and the accompanying Bomb adjuncts. 464 charactersMattSweatshirt, May 21, 2015

Smell is strong vanilla and some brown sugar.  Taste starts off with a smoky, oak character, some coffee flavor, with a dry baker's chocolate finish.  As it warms the vanilla begins to really dominate, and the peppers begin to come through in the aftertaste.  While it is a little thin for a stout, it still has a chewiness to it like normal Bomb!  All in all, this was  a very enjoyable beer, though I am not sure it is an improvement on base Bomb! 549 charactersOneEye78, Apr 05, 2015

An oily, opaque dark brown/black, with a small beige head that diminishes into a cluster of bubbles after only a moment. Spotty lacing (close to a red wine in that regard). Nose is classic Bomb! with a bit more "oomph" on the vanilla and cacao front, presumably from the barrel. Flavor profile brings a lot more cinnamon to the forefront, delicious rich mocha, and that classic Bomb! subtle chile heat in the finish. Feel is nice, somewhere between moderate and thick, not quite as viscous as I would like from a BA stout, but a bit chewier than regular Bomb! I'm an unabashed Bomb! fanboy, admittedly, but this is spectacular. I need more. 688 charactersmarkgugs, Jan 26, 2015

A- Right on par with the other Bombs as far as the sludgey midnight black body and dark tan frothy cap. Medium ring remains after decent retention leaving only spotty lacing.
S- Whiskey barrel is smoothed out but brings more strength than the rum one in Pirate. Heavy tannic oak has me worried for the flavor but nice Bourbon vanilla. Roasty and dark but overall rather tame when compared to other Bombs.
T- Heavy vanilla and cocoa but also a huge amount of woody tannic blackened oak. This wood overshadows an absolute beast of a base beer as only hints of cocoa, peppers, dark coffee and charred grain can make it through. Coca cola and spicy whiskey notes.
MF- Thick body perhaps a bit thinned out by the aging and Bourbon. Medium carbonation gives off just a bit of frothy and slick oily texture. Oaky dark roast bitter finish. Slight chile and alcohol heat.
Probably my least favorite variant of this monstrous beer. The barrel just takes away from the great dessert like base and the wood is too much. Good idea but needs better execution. 1,162 characterscbutova, Jan 16, 2015

S:  Pretty simple.  Up front is milk chocolate and vanilla beans.  A bit of peppery heat in the background.
T:  Like the nose, all milk chocolate and vanilla beans.  Really sweet.  A hint of some pepper spice and heat in the background.  Maybe a mix of peppers and alcohol.  Any barrel presents is nowhere to be seen.
M/D:  A full, viscous and thick body.  Low carbonation, but not under carbonated at all.  With as big of a body that is here, it is never overwhelming, which is impressive.  Enjoyable to sip on.  A good warmer.
I do like this.  The chocolate/vanilla/sweetness works really well, and the peppers from Bomb, like always are subtle but add just a bit of heat.  Though the barrel character is almost nonexistent.  A barrel presents can certainly be done at overwhelming levels, but here it is almost nothing.  That disappoints me a bit.  Maybe not worth the cost, but enjoyable for what it is. 1,045 characterschamp103, Nov 20, 2014
