L - Portion of a bomber partially poured hard into a snifter. Thick, heavy dark brown with dark khaki head.
S - bourbon, raisens, roast. Smells like barrel aged ten fidy. Very sweet. Very decadent.
T - Cream. Sweetness. Alcohol. Milk chocolate... and a common descriptor that I've never used before - tobacco. Very rich and decadent. Very sweet, and very potent. Great taste. Love EMJ and this is definitely a worthy barrel aged rendition.
M - hugely soft and frothy. Very big, foaming, and sticking to the palate. Think a touch thinner to bcbs but more carbonation.
O - Awesome. Stands behind bcbs and parabola but might be my third favorite BA stout. Price however is terrible. I was a little torqued about ba ten fidy being $13 but this at $25 will he a tough revisit anything but a long time again. 875 charactersrypkr, Apr 14, 2017

Dark fudge and whiskey feature primarily on the nose, with some vanilla, oak, and a touch of caramel also there. Taste follows, in a sense- heavy chocolate fudge with a huge, but not overpowering, amount of whiskey. Mouthfeel is pretty thick, full bodied, with a lower carb appropriate to style. Better than the non-BA Even More Jesus IMO. An huge beer, and a good one. 470 charactersmattflippin, Apr 14, 2017

Whiskey, vanilla, oak, cocoa, and roasted coffee on the nose. Not boozy-smelling. Tasted like rich fudge dipped in bourbon. The flavors played very well together. The whiskey predominated, and there was a tinge of sour on the finish, but overall it was balanced. Full-bodied but not overly sweet. Better than the non BA version. 443 charactersBuck89, Apr 14, 2017

Leathery, Bourbon finish with some more fudge. Heavy mouthfeel with low carbonation. Lots of alcohol heat. It's like drinking Bourbon soaked chocolate syrup.

Double Barrel Jesus pours with an oily layering into the glass. Like syrups, a patient swirl releases a short statured but densely packed froth. Aromas of caramel, chocolate, coffee and sherry all align on the nose with a sultry sweet and savory scent. Rich with malts, the early palate accepts a lush taste of those promised chocolates, cake, caramel, cream and vanilla that sat in anticipation of flavor.
As the stout opens up, its high sweetness only recedes slighlty. Chocolate fudge, espresso, heavy cream, vanilla, molasses and brown sugar register soundly on the middle palate. Moderately bitter, the internal woodsiness of the beer trends oaken, spicy and awaiting a boozy kick of sherry, bourbon and peaten scotch whisky.
Decadent in taste and texture, the absolute fullness of the stout becomes marshmallowy, milkshake-like, and trailing with a long, savory and woodsy nuttiness. 1,066 charactersBEERchitect, Mar 25, 2017

The nose is pure chocolate fudge - in fact, it smells identical to a chocolate ganache I made last week.  The palate and mouthfeel are what really propel this beer to greatness.  Chocolate ganache blends perfectly with appropriately subtle barrel aging, and darker fruits start to emerge only as the beer warms.  In terms of mouthfeel, this is perhaps the thickest beer I've tasted.  It's an incredible tour-de-force of the style, and one that does the chocolate side of Imp Stouts in an appreciably fresh way.  Excellent. 618 charactersLAp, Mar 19, 2017

This beer pours a thick, darker than midnight, jet black with a late forming, dense, dark brown with a tinge of maroon colored head. It recedes quickly to a sliver of a ring around the edge of the glass, and there are just a few spots of lacing.
Smell is chocolate fudge, bourbon, vanilla, toffee, brown sugar and sweet dark fruit.
Taste is the same. Starts of sweet but definitely not cloying, with a nice mix of chocolate, vanilla, raisins and figs. That transitions nicely into brown sugar and toffee mid sip and finishes with a wonderful blend of bourbon and oak.
Feel is thick, decadent, rich and velvety smooth with a slightly sticky finish. Very low carbonation which makes the body feel that much more full.
Overall an excellent beer. The bourbon compliments the other flavors wonderfully and is not hot at all. My one complaint is that the subtle, smokey char that I love so much in EMJ is not present in the BA version. Still an awesome beer, but I slightly prefer the original. 1,163 charactersCNoj012, Feb 21, 2017

4.84/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours pitch black color with a 1 finger brown foamy head that was packed with tiny bubbles, dissipating around average time but on the faster side for an imperial stout. It settles into a layer on top and leaves minimal spotty lacing.
Smells of dark chocolate, hot fudge, soy sauce, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, light oaky or charred wood notes, cocoa powder, molasses, dark fruit like raisins and dates, vanilla, piney hops, black coffee, milk chocolate and then booze like a dark rum or smoky bourbon. It's sweet but not cloying or over the top, allowing the bourbon notes and hops to straighten it out for a degree of balance - a beer this big is supposed to be roasted malt and booze dominant and it is, but the fruit and chocolate nuances make it wonderful to inhale.
Tastes simple, rich and maIty yet at the same time very complex with dark chocolate, hot fudge, soy sauce, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, light oaky or charred wood notes, cocoa powder, molasses, pumpernickel bread with raisins, dark fruit including figs, raisins and dates, burnt coffee grinds, vanilla, black licorice, espresso, tobacco and some herbal/earthy notes. Fair amount of bitterness which blends well with the general malty and barrel influenced sweetness, char and rich boozy flavors. The bourbon is not dominant like Founders KBS or Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout, but it is involved with every aspect of this beer and adds a positive bourbon barrel influence across the board. 
Mouthfeel is super smooth and velvety, with mild carbonation, a heavy body and feel that is almost thick and viscous. A meal in a glass if you will, this has a very mild bourbon burn, a kiss of bitterness and then a ton of fruity, roasted malt and chocolate sweetness which fades with woody bourbon notes. To me it's perfect for such a big beer at 12% ABV. 
I had been seeking this out for a year or two and finally got my hands on a few bottles, and this bottle lived up to the hype even at this early stage of it's BBA stout life. I wish it had some more in your face bourbon, but the subtleness of the bourbon as is now is a wonderful accent which keeps jumping out like a ninja. A fantastic imperial stout, I loved it. 2,201 charactersCHickman, Feb 18, 2017

A- pours almost motor oil thick, jet black in color with one if the darkest brown heads that I've ever seen that eventually reduces to just a ring around the edge of the glass
S- aroma opens with a pleasant mixture of mocha fudge brownie, artisan dark chocolate, espresso, dried fig & prune, black strap molasses, burnt sugar, black licorice & toasted walnut.  Underlying notes of wet oak & bourbon provide highlights of vanilla, caramel, earthy wood & coconut 
T- flavor opens up with intense notes of rich mocha espresso with a sharp molasses/brown sugar sweetness, immediately followed by sweetness of raisin, fig & date. Mid-palate gives some barrel notes, providing bourbon and oak, along with vanilla, caramel, a bit of peppery rye & tobacco.  The finish gives a hint of alcohol with lingers of chocolate, bourbon, molasses and dark fruit
M- thick and viscous body with moderate carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that turns into a velvety silky finish, a hint of alcohol warmth on the linger 
O- complexity in every aspect of this beer leaves me finding new nuances as it warms, incredibly thick, sweet and bourbony, delicious 1,177 charactersTreyliff, Dec 05, 2016

L-deep dark brown, tan head, decently carbonated, thick
S and T - boozy whiskey bourbon fudge brownie.  really amazing
F-pretty creamy, medium to slightly thicker feel
O-first thought that came to mind was whiskey fudge bomb!  Ends up being the same phrasing as the review below, but this was really amazing how the flavors meddled together.  Really incredible beer and definitely exceeded my expectations. 440 charactersrabbott2, Nov 28, 2016

The alcohol heat is exacerbated by a mouthfeel that's a bit thinner than optimal. Nice flavors -- char, roast, caramel, bourbon...but I didn't experience the "fudge like body" as described, and most flavors were drowned out by the booze. Didn't finish my glass. Just not my thing. 345 charactersPDXAmbassador, Aug 24, 2016

4.38/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Pours a thicker, motor oil black color with an immediately disappating small, dark brown head.
Very Bourbon forward on the nose, with a multi layered spiciness to it, which gets balanced by burned malts and bitter chocolate. The prominent barrel characteristics feature an apple sweetness, blending into cinnamon and flowery, caramel coated vanilla. 
Drinks truly smooth, while producing an oak covered barrel bite during the finish, with a subdued, fitting, lower carbonation, featuring the beer's complex body in a perfect fashion. 
Tastes of soft whipped cream, warm oak, and a big load of milk chocolate, which slowly turns more and more into a bitter chocolate direction, backed up by dried tobacco and burned malts. Sweet toffee, fudge and mousse au chocolate provide a nice, balancing sweetness, getting amped up by the spicy, yet pleasantly integrated barrel. This creates a breathtaking, well accentuated complexity, with a chocolate coated Bourbon bite prevailing. Finishes with its initial smooth chocolate qualities, with some alcohol soaked apple peel and lots of cinnamon cutting through, among cream soothed glazed toffee. 
A truly extreme beer as for spicy, dry Bourbon gets challenged by utmost creamy, smooth chocolate, exhibiting an intriguing interplay with almost charred, lingering malts. This holds up to its well build taste diversity, uniting far reaching contrasts on the palate, mostly due to a soothing cream smoothness, calming the potent Bourbon bite, and the omnipresent malt bill perfectly well. 1,531 charactersaleigator, Mar 14, 2016

Taste: licorice, chocolate syrup, burnt marshmallows,  Booze is so well masked and woven into the flavor
Feel:  a little syrupy
Overall: the only thing separating this from BCBS is this one has a somewhat pedestrian mouthfeel. Otherwise, this is an awesome BA Stout 478 charactersfx20736, Mar 07, 2016

4.45/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From a 650 ml bottle to a snifter. No date on the bottle, but this one has been in my cellar for about a year.
A-The beer is heavy and syrupy looking out of the bottle. A short, walnut colored head fades quickly leaving no lace and just a sliver of foam. The beer is a good looking deep-brown color with a nice sheen on the top. It is mostly still. 
S-The aroma is a heady mixture browny batter and fudge, with hints of cherry, plum, raisin, some burnt sugar and caramel, mild whiskey spice, and plenty of alcohol heat. This thing is big and the flavors layer nicely on top of each other. 
T-The taste is pretty similar to the smell. In addition to the dark fruits and whiskey notes, I taste a chocolatey fudge, lightly bitter coffee notes and cream that suggest a cappuccino. The finish is long and the lingering sweetness reminds me of whiskey and sherry. 
M-The body is huge, heavy, and chewy. Lower levels of carbonation. If you like your beers thick, this is your jam, but I find it to be a little too much. 
O-This is a really good beer. There is a lot going on here, but the flavors integrate well with each other and it never tastes busy or convoluted. 1,165 charactersspoony, Feb 21, 2016

Roughly 6 months since bottling (no bottle date)
Appearance- Pours a black color, opaque, viscous and oily. Thin layer of chocolate colored head, incredibly dark, dissipates to a very fine layer. Lots of sticky alcohol legs on glass, coats like a layer of film.
Aroma- Sweet bourbon, astringent oak, spicy earthiness. Tons of chocolate, rich fudge, vanilla, creamy sugar, and caramel. Mocha type aromas, mild coffee.
Taste- Dry oak, chocolates. Dry cocoa, mocha coffee, mild nuttiness. Sweet bourbon, some spiciness. Fudge brownie, chocolate cake batter, creamy sugar, sweeter dark fruits, tons of vanilla and toasty coconut.
Feel- Full bodied, very creamy, slick and sticky, coats the mouth. Can feel dry at times, and other times feel creamy and smooth w/ sweetness. Moderate to lower carbonation.
Overall- Intense and rich flavors, very dessert like with tons of sweetness. Bourbon and barrel characteristics are so up front and raw, like the beer was just emptied from the barrels. However, the base beer is just as strong and flavorful that there remains a great balance. Truly enojoyable sipper, one of those beers that is just a treat to try. 1,167 charactersOrangeMen, Jan 16, 2016

S - smells great, lots of bourbon and chocolate 
T - very similar. Bourbon up front, super smooth, and lots of sweet Malts and chocolate in the finish.
F - good amount of carbonation. Very creamy. 
O - definitely my favorite offering from evil twin. It's expensive, but it's probably worth it. 360 charactersbentnorton, Jan 11, 2016

L - Pours an opaque black like used motor oil. Looks thick and decadent.
S - A rich, boozy aroma from the glass. Lots of bourbon in the nose complimented by notes of coffee and bitter dark chocolate.
T - The taste follows the nose....I get alot more chocolate/fudge than I thought. Tastes like a bourbon soaked brownie washed down with some coffee. 
M - Decadent and creamy mouthfeel that coats the tongue and throat and leaves sticky residue to linger upon the palate. 
O - Easily a favorite of mine by Evil Twin. This is what a barrel aged stout should be. 608 charactersRAlmeida77, Oct 28, 2015

4.6/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Initially ticked this one after having a 3oz pour, revisiting after having a bottle. Poured into a nonic:
Appearance: as black as it gets. Totally opaque black, the typical "motor oil" look. Carries a small, dark-brown head that actually sticks around for awhile. Beer is visibly heavy....just looking at how dark the head is gives away that this one is definitely a bruiser.
Aroma: I got a lot of leather and char as the dominant smells, along with a lot of bitter dark chocolate. So much power in the nose. Sometimes I describe lighter beers as having elegant or subtle scents on the nose, but this beer is a punch in the face when it comes to stout aroma. Layers of char, barrel, chocolate and more decadence. Lovely.
Taste: fair amount of heat here, which I love in a barrel-aged stout. The heat is buttressed by sweetness, however, with layer upon layer of chocolate, coffee, and vanilla-y bourbon flavor coming through. It has a distinctive flavor that I always get in Evil Twin beers that I haven't really been able to put my finger on, but it is delicious nonetheless.
Feel: thick and viscous, it definitely delivers in terms of the double barrel experience. Really nice, especially as it warmed a bit.
Overall: at $25 or more, it's tough on the wallet, but it is delicious. Wish it was available in 12oz bottles so I could enjoy it more often, but I suppose I'll still buy it when I see it on the shelf. Excellent. 1,428 charactersTheElectricOne, Oct 19, 2015

Aroma is of chocolate and dark fruit with nice bourbon and vanilla.  I was happy that the dark fruit aroma did not carry into the taste, as I prefer a more roasty stout. Does have lots of chocolate and roast with a nice blend of bourbon.  This was still drinking a little hot though with some alcohol heat in the finish.  Nicely done.

L - Pours an impenetrable oily brown accompanied by an evanescent sliver of brown bubbles that trace a ring around the edge of the glass.
S - A rich, boozy aroma wafts from the glass. Abundant bourbon dominates the nose complimented by abundant notes of coffee and bitter dark chocolate.
T - The taste is prominently boozy, saturated with bourbon intensity that lends its characteristic spiciness to the flavor. Finishes sticky and sweet with a massive amount of coffee and chocolate. The deeply roasted malt presence fades into a subtle undercurrent of hopped bitterness. 
M - Decadent and creamy mouthfeel that coats the tongue and throat and leaves sticky residue to linger upon the palate. 
O - Without a doubt, this is one of the crowning achievements of the prestigious "Even More Jesus" series from Evil Twin. Huge, loud and utterly delicious. An instant classic. 920 charactersZippermouth, Sep 11, 2015

The nose is the real winner here: chocolate and waves upon waves of bourbon. The taste follows suit and the first sip assaults your palate with bourbon. Follow-up sips mellow in bourbon and allow the high quality stout characteristics to shine through (chocolate dominates). The chocolate and bourbon waltz in harmony through the rest of the glass. The mouthfeel is a tad thin to be world class, but it's only subpar compared to the rest of this outstanding beer. 524 charactersKevBot89, Sep 01, 2015

A. Pitch black color with a reddish/amber head that quickly retreats, but pops back up when swirled. Thick viscosity, amber layer when swirled.
S. The nose begins with dried figs, plums, and raisins. I get a strong barrel presence which comes through as a nice balance between bourbon soaked oak and a hint of straight bourbon.
T. The complexity of this beer can only be summed up as a Heresy chocolate bar, but only the flavor, not the sweetness. This does have a tad bit of sweetness, but not overly sweet, just right. The taste is very difficult to beat. The bourbon comes through the most as it is nearly room temperature.
M. Very sticky, very thick, and low carbonation.
O. This is a sipper but one would only want to cherish this as long as possible. I had high expectations and they were certainly met. Well done. I must compare to the BA Biscotti and I give the nod, ever so slight, to BA Biscotti, primarily because I like a little coffee in my BA stout. This is not a very hoppy or bitter stout. 1,027 charactersmacher0, Aug 28, 2015

A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/4 inch medium brown head that retains a bit before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of sheer surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves small strips behind.
S- Super bourbon forward with lots of fudge, burnt sugar and caramel.  Quite boozy.
T- Holy mother.  Sweet but so complex.  The bourbon character sets the stage for all the chocolate, vanilla, caramel, maple, brown sugar and butterscotch flavors that ensue.   The massive roastiness does a great job of balancing the sweet with the bitter.  Lots of grainy oak.
M- Creamy and a bit sharp from the booze.  Medium-low carbonation and the fullest of bodies.
O- Totally worth the $28.  I don't like the base beer that much but this treatment transforms it into a delicious treat. 879 charactersImmortale25, Aug 26, 2015

12% ABV Imperial Stout brewed by Westbrook Brewing Co. for EvilTwin Brewing
Poured into snifter thick and black like motor oil. Small 3cm head, decent lacing on the glass that disappears quickly.  Absolutely opaque.
Nose of whisky-infused dark chocolate  dominates. Hints of black licorice and anise at the back of the nose. Intoxicating nose.
Roasted malts dominate with dark fudge and whiskey/bourbon taste.  Coconut, sweet vanilla, and a smokiness fills out well balanced flavor.  
Thick and rich mouthfeel from beginning to end. Blankets the tongue with a fine silky effervescence without the alcohol burn.
An EXCELLENT barrel aged stout from Evil Twin (as usual).  Quite pricey, but well worth the entrance fee.  A sippin' stout!  CHEERS 762 charactersarkitekt2, Aug 24, 2015

It smells of vanilla, cookie dough, baked goods, chocolate. It smells huge as well. I could smell it right when i cracked it open. 
The taste starts sharp, oak, bourbon, fizz, then on the back end is all dark chocolate. It starts almost too dry on the front end, with a cherry note. Very reminiscent of Barrel Aged Speedway Stout.Very good. 412 charactersraynmoon, Aug 23, 2015

A: the darkest night with no stars has nothing on this beer  very small about an inch head of the darkest chocolate color I have seen on a head
S: Smells like chocolate fudge, with deep anise, licorice, and leather with deep roasted malts 
T: Oh wow.....Huge chocolate roasty deep anise taste nice and sweet booze is very well hidden this is almost like drinking chocolate powder with sugar added so great. There is coffee but its hidden behind tons of chocolate and sugar.
M: Lush thick and chewy everything you want a stout to be and a slight chalky taste 
O: Completely blown away by this beer. It is fantastic huge over the top chocolate, anise, licorice the anise is in your face.  The coffee is very hard to taste with all that is going on in this beer.

4.54/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Serving Type: Bottle
Consumed: 8.8.15
A: 4.75 Pours thick and pitch black with a small dark tan head.
S: 4.5 Lots of whisky on the nose at first. As the beer warms, roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla, and spice come through. Rather intense even though this beer is almost a year and a half old.
T: 4.5 Like the nose, this is a very whisky forward beer. I’m not really detecting different barrel treatments though. It’s a bit harsh at about 50-55 degrees, but as it warms, the fudgy, vanilla, caramel flavors usually present in Evil Twin’s stouts show up. It’s really excellent and almost perfect, but the roast is a bit much for me, leaving a finish that’s too bitter and dry.
M: 4.75 Super thick and rich. Carbonation is great; it’s low, but you can still feel the effervescence.
O: 4.5 Nearly perfect barrel aged stout from Evil Twin. They do stouts so well and they clearly know their way around a barrel. If you like roasty stouts, this is perfect for you. For me, the roast detracts from the fudgy, chocolaty quality I love about Evil Twin stouts. 1,067 charactersTele, Aug 10, 2015

Dark black body, half finger brown head, nice retention, a little bit of lacing though not so much. Appears smooth as motor oil. Smells of dark fruit, chocolate fudge, oak, whiskey, burnt sugar. A bit of coffee. Flavour is similarly chocolate-forward, oak, fudge, sugar, a little bit of vanilla, and a brandy-like sweet warmth. I have no idea what the second barrel treatment was, but I'd have to guess rum or brandy. Bourbon being the other barrel. Not cloying, nice complexity, very chocolate-forward. Mouthfeel is full bodied, although drinking this after a Perennial Maman made it seem a bit thinner in comparison, but it is certainly more full bodied than the average BA stout. Lower carbonation, smooth. Very good body, a bit of heat on the backend, but not that much. Overall, a very nice barrel treatment with a lot of chocolate fudge, good mouthfeel accompanied by a fair bit of heat. 983 charactersStevedore, Aug 09, 2015

T- Nailed it!  Dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, fudge, roasted coffee, molasses, slightly smokiness, very well balanced.
M- Smooth, full body, no heat from the alcohol.
O- Very well done, taste is exactly what I want out of a bourbon barrel stout, nose reminds me of BCBS.  Very easy to drink, worth every cent to the $25 price tag, I need more of this! 575 characterslarryi86, Aug 09, 2015

Pours pitch black with very little head. Leaves a nice lasing around the glass almost like a fudge.
Smell is incredible, starts off with a huge chocolate notes then a little coffee, also some barrel notes come through with the vanilla, dark fruit, and some oak.
Taste is right on point with the nose. Super intense fudge, raisins, oak, vanilla sweetness on the end with very small heat.
Mouthfeel is super thick. Very creamy and the taste last on the tongue making you want more and more.
Overall this is the best beer by Evil twin to date. It is a lasting memory. Small distro but if your lucky enough to get 1, DO IT! 656 charactersMIbeerGeek84, Aug 04, 2015

Very roasty, strong whiskey spice aroma, along with dark roast espresso, fudge, burnt brown sugar, vanilla, dark fruits, oak, and tobacco earthiness.  Loads of chocolate in the taste, bittersweet chocolate, with gourmet coffee, burnt caramel and molasses, more of the vanilla, a meaty smokiness, and char.  Thick and creamy mouth feel, bold sticky sweetness but not overdone.  Very impressive as all the flavors are well balanced.  The alcohol is detectable but at 12%, this beauty is not pretending to be anything its not.  Like all of Evil Twin's imperial stouts and porters, this one is a must try but just happens to fall ahead of the rest. 881 charactersCzarkazm, May 01, 2015

From a bomber into a snifter
APPEARANCE: A thick, sludgy black pour yields a 1+ finger, medium looking, creamy, mocha colored head with good retention. Pitch black body with just a touch of carbonation. Head slowly fades to a thick, dense cap. Swirly wisp and ring remain leaving dots of lacing down the glass. Really thick and black with a solid head as well. Good stuff. 
SMELL: Bourbon, lots of coconut and sweet vanilla cream, some oak, milk chocolate and dark cocoa, with some nice burnt espresso beans as well. Really nice, bold and enticing. 
TASTE: Big flavors again, with bourbon, oak and toffee, lots of coconut and sweet vanilla cream up front. Really nice stuff. Burnt notes at the swallow, leading into a bold and lingering finish of bourbon, coconut, milk chocolate, vanilla cream, butterscotch toffee, burnt malts, char, dark bitter chocolate and some alcohol underlining it all. Really flavorful and well balanced between the barrel and base beer. More balanced than the nose and has plenty of the good stuff we all love. 
PALATE: Medium-full body with medium levels of carbonation. Enough weight on the palate, very creamy and oily, slick and silky, goes down smooth and silky with a slight burn at the swallow and finishes very sticky. A touch cloying perhaps, but not at all off-putting. Fits the flavor profile well. Some heat lingers. Great.
OVERALL: This is just excellent. Just as good as the regular version and the barrel aging adds another layer of fun as opposed to overpowering the good stuff that’s already there. Would love to try out others in the Jesus series, as the regular and this double barrel version are excellent. Highly recommended. Thanks again jbeatty! 1,772 charactersJeffo, Mar 05, 2015

Pours dense pitch black color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense dark brown head with solid retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Some slight lacing clings on the glass, with a light amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, fudge, licorice, dark bread, spicy rye, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, raisin, prune, tobacco, light smoke/char, and roast/smokey earthiness. Fantastic aromas with incredible complexity and balance of big dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, fudge, licorice, dark bread, spicy rye, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, raisin, prune, tobacco, light smoke/char, and roast/smokey earthiness. Fair amount of roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, coffee, molasses, fudge, licorice, dark bread, spicy rye, toffee, vanilla, bourbon, oak, raisin, prune, tobacco, light smoke/char, and roast/smokey earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of huge dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; with an awesome roasted bitterness/sweetness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Light-medium carbonation and very full bodied; with a very smooth, creamy, slick, and lightly chalky mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is well hidden with only a small warming present after the finish. Overall this is a world class barrel aged imperial stout. All around fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of dark/roasted malt and bourbon barrel flavors; and quite smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. Very similar to Even More Jesus with some mellower deep roasted character and added rye and barrel complexity. An insanely delicious offering. 1,851 characterssuperspak, Jan 24, 2015

4.34/5  rDev -4.8%Bottle from trade. Excited about this one. Pours pitch black and thick with a half finger dark brown creamy head on top. Aroma of dark fruits, chocolate covered raisins, whiskey and oak, molasses, anise. Flavor follows with anise and dark fruits, chocolate, sweet molasses, and a long vanilla bourbon finish alongside a hint of cocoa powder. Really really smooth, not at all boozy, thick and rich, low carbonation. Really easy drinking and a beautifully made BA stout. While it’s on the fruit and molasses side of the flavor profile than I like, there’s no question that this a beautifully made brew. Would have it any time. Right there with Uncle Jacobs with a somewhat similar flavor profile. Yum. 703 charactersBMMillsy, Oct 09, 2014

Served in a snifter
The beer had an ominous appearance. Pitch black, super thick and sludgey, the liquid looked similar to motor oil. A thin, crimson tinged, mocha colored crown topped the beer, but it quickly faded to a ringlet of bubbles. A few small droplets of lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was fantastic. Super rich and robust. Boatloads of roasted malts were immediately apparent. The barrel came through strong and lent some intense, boozy, bourbony notes. Tons of vanilla bean. Quite sweet with indications of burnt caramel. Some brown sugar as well. Good amount of chocolate fudge. Hint of char and smoke. A touch of licorice was also noticeable.
The flavor profile was really sweet and even more intense than the aroma. Roasted malts dominated on the front end. Brown sugar notes came through strong in the center. Loads of espresso. Hefty amount of burnt caramel. Fresh vanilla bean was also apparent. The super roasty finish contained notes of char and ash. Some alcohol heat from the barrel came through as well, but the booziness was rather restrained given the high ABV.
While the nose and the flavor profile were both stellar, the mouthfeel was simply flawless. Super thick, rich and creamy. Sludgey and motor oil-like. The liquid contained an ultra fine, tongue blanketing effervescence. After each sip, the beer left a sticky film on my lips.
Even More Jesus is a fantastic beer, but this double barrel-aged version really brings things to a whole new level. Simply put, this is one whopper of an imperial stout. While the alcohol was fairly restrained for a 12% ABV beer, the flavor intensity and mouthfeel were similar to something typically found in something even "bigger." That said, this bomber would best be split amongst three or four people. 1,865 charactersDamian, Sep 24, 2014

Appearance - Inky black.  Medium khaki head.  Thick collar.
Smell - Whiskey and fudge.  More fudge than whiskey, though.  A little wood.  Slightly fruity.
Taste - Fudgy.  NIce whiskey.  Lots of rich chocolate.  I can't discern barrels.  Just lots of whiskey.  Some bitter coffee in the back end.
Mouthfeel - Boozy.  Medium heavy. Well carbonated.

Smell - Smooth bourbon notes create the aroma with notes of chocolate and malt in the background.
Taste - The bourbon comes to the front, but it is balanced and not hot. Dark chocolate coats the tongue and there is a hint of coffee. As one might expect, it is warm going down.
Mouthfeel - Some bourbon barrel stout and like drinking straight whiskey. This one is smooth and coats the tongue nicely.
Overall - This is really good. Seek it! 528 charactersJohnnyHopps, Aug 25, 2014

A- Very thick, dark molasses black fudgy. Half-pinky dark cacoa lacing with minimal retention. Gums up the glass pretty good. 
S- It smells like an infected rye whiskey stout. Thank God it is not; but past that is dark fudgy notes, cinnamon/clove? but the infected smell takes over. 
T- The double barrel age comes off first the rye whiskey much more than bourbon, which lingers for about 20 seconds until you can get to the spicy chocolate fudge. Really good, but the two dimensions are not as impressive as BA Biscotti. 
M- Fantastic here. Nice alcohol burn on the way down. Creamy and smooth. Cant say much bad about this ba stout. 
O- I had the impression that this was going to be better than BA Biscotti, but IMHO it is not even close. This is a great brew, but the former easier to obtain beer blows (relatively) this away. Cheers! 966 charactersgueuzedreg, Aug 02, 2014

The aroma has roasted coffee, forward whiskey, caramel sweetness, a hint of dark fruit.
The flavor follows of large spicy whiskey in the front. Then onto brown caramel sugar, bittersweet chocolate, and roasted coffee. There's a reasonable sweetness with a slight lacking flavor on the back end.
This beer could use a year or so of age to push down that whiskey in the front slightly. 428 charactersdar482, Jun 30, 2014

Rich, deep, chocolate-filled, decadent and boozy although it was hard for me to distinguish the rye whiskey from bourbon. Without doubt a big, bold beer which is meant to be sipped and savored.

Pours thick and black as hell, with a small half inch head, and sticky lacing staining the glass.
Smells like dark fruit, fudgy chocolate, bourbon, oak, and booze.
The taste is similar. Some boozy bourbon up front, with a rich melted chocolate flavor, lots of dark fruits- cherries, plums, etc. Some vanilla and oak as well. I am fairly clearly getting the bourbon, but not the rye whiskey. I kind of wish they used a second barrel that was significantly different than the first, like a combination of bourbon and rum, or apple brandy, or red wine, or port, or something of that nature. This tastes like a huge bourbon barrel stout, but not a double barrel stout. All that being said, it was tasty.
Thick bodied, essentially like motor oil. Creamy, heavy mouthfeel, with very little carbonation. Pretty drinkable.
This one was awesome, it just felt like it could have a been a bit more with a different second barrel. 963 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jun 23, 2014

Poured from glass into Tulip.
A-Dark as all hell just like EMJ. Slightly less of a head maybe 1/4in., same color, dark brown sugar. Head faded quicker like expected but the ring stayed thruout. Slight lacing but not as nice as EMJ but more legs than EMJ.
S-Holy mother of God. The bourbon barrel hits you immediately and soaks in for a while. A second sniff shows a glimmer of the base beer with fudge brownie and dark bitter chocolate being prominent. A spicy whiskey smell along with subtle notes of vanilla, cherry, wood and spice. Dark fruits, molasses. Dont get a real coffee smell as with the EMJ
T-Just like the smell that sweet, sweet bourbon is in front of the pack. Big hit of double fudge brownie (me and my friend were burping up double fudge brownies all night) Rye whiskey tang to it and the base beer comes back to life and you get the standard tastes of an imperial stout. More Boozier than EMJ but thats obvious. The boozieness was still in good form and complemented the base beer.
M-Smooth but lighter than EMJ, lighter carbonation, still sticky as hell.
O-Biggest question.... is it worth $25+? Thats up to you. I personally would pay the $25+ tag if I had the chance. Its a delisious beer. Better than the base beer but not the best I've ever had bit I promise you its up there. Its a damn good beer to split with a friend. 1,436 characterspjkelley82, Jun 16, 2014

S - Sweet bourbon, marzipan and a wee bit of vanilla.
T - Very sweet. This beer would really benefit from some spiciness; be that cinnamon or nutmeg on the one hand or chilli or cayenne on the other. This beer is the first beer I've ever had where I can start to see why brewers add chilli to beers like abraxas and hunahpu, rounding out the sweetness. Bourbon barrel character is stamped all over this beer.
M - Viscous, thick and very luxurious, bordering on overly rich.
O - This beer definitely has its strengths; primarily bourbon character and treacle sweetness. Yet it also lacks the depth which would be provided by greater chocolate, coffee, roasted malt or any sort of spice notes. As such, it's fairly straightforward and takes a long time to drink due to the richness. Abv. doesn't show up as heat, but instead as richness. In the end it's just too sickly sweet. Was it worth the $27.50 before tax I paid for it? Absolutely not. But you never know until you try. 1,087 charactersabeeronthebeach, May 16, 2014

Flavor is rich dark chocolate, dark toasted malt, dark dried fruit, hints of cherry, caramel and molasses all overlaid by bourbon and vanilla wood influence from barreling. Heavy, creamy body. A dense, flavorful bourbon stout, nicely balanced but with nice barrel character. Exactly what I'm looking for in an imperial aged stout. ABV dangerously well covered; this one requires slow pacing. The ales being produced by Westbrook for Evil Twin have been uniformly excellent. This was a quite expensive bottle (especially for a Westbrook brewed beer), but fully rewarding. A nice treat. 791 charactersLiquidAmber, May 09, 2014

A: Pitch black pour with a small but very dense dark brown head. Despite the smallish head it refuses to die and sticks around forever. Great retention. Lacing is heavy, heavy but doesn't stick too well. 
S: Oh yeah, mellow and smooth caramel. Lots of it. Thick, heavy fudge. Spiciness, must be rye whiskey. Hints of oak. Aroma isn't particularly strong or bold in anyway (low carbonation) but it sure is decadent.
T: Heavy, heavy, heavy bourbon up front with the thickest, most viscous chocolate ever. It's like drinking hot fudge out of the fridge, dipped in bourbon and rye whiskey. Lots of heavy caramel, spicy rye and loads of oak in the middle. Very sweet, very heavy flavors. Aftertaste coats the mouth like a chocolate oil slick with plenty of oak and a little rye spiciness mixed in. Oak seems to linger forever. Sweetness and heaviness hides the alcohol but there is just a hint of alcohol sting after each sip.
M: Incredible mouthfeel. Super heavy body, low carbonation. Thick, thick, thick. Honestly just a step away from room temp hershey's syrup. Or brownie batter. You get the idea. Weighty.
O: Interesting. I'm a big fan of Evil Twin stouts and this one does not disappoint. Great balancing act between the two whiskeys. Lots of chocolate to even it out a bit. Big, decadent and sweet flavors throughout. Mouthfeel is top notch, heavy heavy heavy. Wonderful but the strength, sweetness and thickness does make this one a serious sipper. Even after everything I've said, I think the base beer is still phenomenal and I have it rated ever so slightly higher. 1,630 charactersDope, May 01, 2014

S: Much plum, black currants, leafy hops & carob, some oakyness, faint boozey notes
T: Plum, slight coffee notes, a bit of booze, raisins & baker's chocolate up front. Some caramel mixes in along a trace amount of molasses, then raisins, plums & oaky dryness, slight pruneyness. Finishes dry, boozey, with plums, carob & a bit of figgyness
MF: Firm carbonation, warming, medium bodied, smooths out a bit once warm, turns sticky
A big bruiser, but no real flaws, wished the Bourbon Barrel would've came through a bit more. Not bad, but was expecting more... Well worth a go if your wallet can stand it... 766 charactersrusspowell, Apr 29, 2014

The flavors are blended well but its tough to get to any other notes than bourbon for me. Great beer, just a little too hot for my liking. I'm thinking this will be great next year. You still get that dark chocolate that we all know and love in even more jesus and its probably the best beer to make this hot because of the richness of the dark chocolate notes but hard to distinguish anything else. All in all, another worldclass brew from ET. 514 charactersbcp5296d, Apr 21, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pour is black as night, and as thick as tar mixed with motor oil. Aroma and flavor of rich, deep dark chocolate fudge brownie, raisin, fig, date, prune, cinnamon, vanilla toasted coconut, black cherry, molasses, barbeque sauce, marshmallow, leather, tobacco, and spicy rye in the finish. Balanced from beginning of sip through the finish. Body is way north of full, and it carries the aftertaste into a near eternal finish. If I could carp about any aspect of this beer, it would its drinkability, but I won’t, because the decadent richness is so all-encompassing that it’s like a glass of liquid heaven. 608 charactersImpfan, Apr 19, 2014

Black as night, with a creamy top forming of supper dark brown mocha chestnut color. Creamy collar and nice top. Virtually identical to it's bourbon biscotti brother, the head might even be darker dramatically. Aggressive, shocking, and dramatic looking.
Nice soft oak warmth and spiced fruit aromas. Hints of boozy whiskey warmth like kirsch. Some nice charring notes but with a fruit dominance and heat that is very controlling but overbearing. Some warmth brings some peppermint like candy.
Palate brings the goods in spades. Creamy and fudgy mouthfeel with cherry warmth and brandy like sweetness. Rye spicy forward a bit with a hint of sharp rye whiskey dryness and sharp berried fruit too. Palate feel is not as fizzy and more creamy, but doesn't bring much bourbon tones. Controlled warmth with dark chocolate and more fruits on the finish.
It's alot like biscotti bourbon but goes for a fruitier, boozier and drier quality. It definitely comes across more whiskey forward also, leaving some of the notes of oaked effected caramel, butterscotch and vanilla behind somewhat. Either way it is remarkably well made. 1,168 characterssmakawhat, Apr 10, 2014

4.65/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This is one of those beers that makes you raise your hands and say amen.
Appearance: dark opaque brown, nice head. This beer is thick.
The nose is strong, smoky, and bold but soft milky chocolate.
Taste/ mouthfeel: Oh man, it's a strange and subtle marriage of an almost bbq-like smokiness with the taste and texture of chocolate souffle--WOW! It is silky smooth.
This is a fantastic beer. It is one of those drinks that I had a half glass of and I was satisfied. That's not to say that it's one of those beers I can only drink a half glass of because I could have drank a lot more. But I was so satisfied and so impressed--so privileged, really, to have had that beer that we gave the last half of the bottle to the people next to us. 739 charactersjeagleton, Mar 31, 2014

4.67/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a BCBS snifter from a 22oz bottle.
Pours a gorgeous deep dark viscous black liquid. There is a nice quarter inch tan head that forms and is pretty dense. It recedes quit quickly down to a nice thin film. 
Aroma starts off sweet. Notes of molasses and some slight burnt caramel. Gorgeous notes of bourbon and some nice deep sugary honey. Nice notes of boozy heat are present in the nose. Slight notes of roasted malt with mild coffee and some nice milk chocolate notes are present. Overall aroma is pretty sweet. 
Flavor. Wow. Pretty amazing. Starts of with notes of sweet molasses and caramel. Very sweet notes of Bourbon with slight honey notes and slight vanilla spice from the wood. There are delicious notes of cocoa powder and bakers chocolate with some nice moist chocolate cake notes. There are some underlying notes of mild coffee roast as well as some nice dark bitter chocolate. The brew is very complex. The flavors are well crafted individually; they are vivid, silky and hearty but above all they are blended together so well. There are some delicious underlying notes of almond and some coffee as well wrapped up by some delicious Bourbon sweetness. Mouthfeel is perfect. Lower carbonation with great velvety richness.
Overall this is a winner. I haven't had a ET stout that was bad. The mouthfeel is flawless and the notes of chocolate and bourbon and sugary/caramel sweetness are outstanding. 1,424 charactersJoEBoBpr, Mar 29, 2014
