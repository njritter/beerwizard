Look - looks like a golden ipa with a bigger white head, nice body
Smell - lemon, other citrus, some grapefruit, some funk
Taste - lemon, grapefruit, barnyard funk, a little oak, nice acid
Feel - creamy in some sense, nice tartness but still subtle
Overall - very enjoyable, semi-complex, glad to finally have tried 352 charactersrabbott2, Mar 17, 2017

Aroma and taste had a great deal of complexity and funkiness. I did enjoy the vastness of this beer in contrast to the great but simple oude gueuze. Would definitely pursue this beer again. Not easy to find. 284 charactersraspy22, Mar 04, 2017

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours orange, with a surprisingly long lasting foamy head. Moderately high carb.
Smell is super unique and quite intense - earthy Muscat grapes, sesame crackers, celery salt, diesel and a bit of dried onion.
Taste is bright and sour - very Muscat-grape forward, with none of the strong cracker and herb aromas. Some sweet fruitiness - lemon, green grape, maybe a bit of sharp cheddar on the back of the tongue.
Overall one of the most intense gueuzes I've ever tried - unique and delicious, though some of the aromatics were a bit off-putting. I'm not sure if the bottle might've been a bit skunked or something. 612 charactersPDXAmbassador, Jun 08, 2016

-Dark orange flesh, hazy, with streaming bubbles. Fluffy head taking up half the glass.
-Stone fruits, oak, lemon, pepper, pear, brett.
-Tart fruitiness upfront with dry oak notes playing in the background. Stonefruits shine.
-Pleasant carbonation coats the palate.
As a person that's just getting into sour/tart offerings, I can definitely see myself enjoying these on hot summer days. Even if it means dropping $30 for 375ml bottles. 456 charactersSaulFox, Jun 02, 2016

I like Cantillon Gueuze very much and I find it one of the best beers out there, but this is even better and more complex. Definitively funkier and moldier than any gueuze I've tried. Possibly the best beer I've had so far. 310 charactershansavijaticar, May 07, 2016

Wine barrel for days. Mix of stone fruit in nose. Oak has perhaps become a bit unbalanced with age. Otherwise a nice fruit profile. Carbonation hasn't lost a beat. Strong, but with a nice tang. 288 charactersHootie159, Apr 10, 2016

4.12/5  rDev -8.4%look: 3.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4.5BOTTLE: Purchased at Plan B Rotterdam for ~17 euro. 37.5cl. Green glass. Unbranded hood-and-wire cap over a branded cork. Bottled 12/03/2014. Best before: 12/03/2024.
6% ABV. Geuze.
Expectations are extremely high given this beer's reputation and the brewery behind it. Served at cellar temp into a pilsner glass.
HEAD: Occupies 50% of the glass. Audibly fizzy. ~5-7 cm wide. Somewhat thin, but not weak (not robust either). Consistency is too thin, though, and there isn't much of a complexion. Retention is average generally speaking (~2 minutes), but poor for the style and relatively low ABV.
BODY: Seemingly unfiltered judging by how murky it is. Copper colour of average vibrance. No yeast can be seen within.
Appears aptly carbonated. Not a unique or special looking gueuze, but appealing in a general sense, sure.
AROMA: Lambicus yeast is evident, walking a nice line between funkiness and sourness. Sourness seems tame but it's unmistakable. Nuanced funkiness brings notes of gym sock (as much as I hate that descriptor), leather, and twang. Bacterial intangibles are present, but it isn't a lactobacillus bomb like many American brewed sours. Oak rounds it out nicely, but sits in the background somewhat reticent to join the party. Acidity is obvious. Lemon. The beginnings of acetic character. Flora. Barnyard character (dried lime, a blip of hay). Has some nice green apple without ever coming off cidery.
I love that unlike most Cantillon expressions of the style, it isn't heavy on cereal grains (at least aromatically).
Funkiness is dominant.
TASTE: The taste delivers on the promises of the aroma, with white wine vinegar-soaked oak unifying the flavour profile. Funky more than it is sour, actually; sourness is maybe a 5-6/10 in terms of intensity. Twangy throughout, with acidic lemon and acetic acid dancing across the palate. Green apples, bacterial intangibles, salt, faint barnyard notes. It's a nuance gueuze, with plenty of subtleties sitting beneath the prominent funkiness that guides the beer. Lactic acid. Balanced and enjoyable, this gestalt beer feels like a unified whole in spite of being a blend. 
Depth of flavour is good. Flavour duration is above average; that vinegar/acetic character carries into the aftertaste. Flavour intensity is relatively high.
As the aroma suggested, the cereal grain prominence that so often distracts in Cantillon's expressions of the style is nowhere to be found here...I think I prefer this as a result.
Some may find the oak reticent (especially those accustomed to more oak-forward American brews), but I find its subtlety masterful.
The funkiness that dominates the flavour profile is, possibly, the greatest funkiness I've ever experienced in a beer, with a lot of intangible intricacy going on. Showcases brettanomyces lambicus yeast shockingly well.
TEXTURE: Acidic and twangy. Smooth, near perfectly carbonated, and refreshing in its own way. Light-bodied.
It is almost exactly as it should be. This texture uses its acidity to emphasize the lemon, sourness, lime, and vinegar. Taste and mouthfeel are in harmony, elevating the beer beyond many examples of the style.
I will say that it's oddly dry on the palate, which can be parching. Maybe that's nitpicking, but it does lend the mouthfeel a bit of a scratchy hoarse vibe. So while the taste and mouthfeel are in harmony, it's not a perfect harmony. More softness would also be welcome.
Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, or harsh.
OVERALL: I could easily see this beating out most Cantillon gueuze style beers in a blind tasting, and I think that says it all. Highly drinkable, easily refreshing, and very satisfying. Yes, the dryness of the mouthfeel does hold it back a bit, but it's easily amongst the best examples of the style I've tried. It's hard to stop drinking, and I already wish I had more. Evidence Drie Fonteinen is one of the great lambic producers - and may be one of (if not the best) blender.
High quality though it obviously is, it'd be tough to shell out 17 euro for another bottle (heaven forbid the $30 USD I hear quoted for it in North America). But obviously price doesn't affect my rating, and it really is a must-try for the truly discerning drinker. Its high reputation is deserved.
Would pair well with salad. Would age beautifully; I'm sure Drie Fonteinen's 10 year guideline is right on the money.

Pours a saturated, bright, golden-amber color, with a small, fizzy head, receding to a thin, bubbly texture at the rim of the glass. 
On the nose, the beer produces an incredibly intense funkiness. It features green apple peel, crisp citrus wrapped up in blue cheese, leather, prickling mushroom, jogurt, and most surprisingly a pleasant floral note. All those flavors blend together marvellously, creating a very harmonious, aroma bursting impression. 
Has a soft, medium carbonation with a pleasant mouthfeel to it, refreshing due to citrus and mineralic tones, silk on the tongue due to a buttery, leather defined maltiness.
Tastes of a slowly unfolding citrus crispness, featuring a luscious sourness, next to a more and more pungent developing dryness. Dusty old earth produces a great balance, with a moldy toffee sweetness to be found in it. Its carbonation adds a vivid component to the drinking experience, masking the bigger body of this perfectly well. Finishes with an intense, mineral supported, citrus dryness among fermented green apple, sun bathed hay and a wheaty sweetness.
A treat throughout, pushing the already best Geuze even further. Everything I love about their regular Gueuze is detectable in this, while they amped it up a bit. Best example for this being the nose, promising an uncompromising funkiness, countered by its characteristic crispness on the palate, achieving an intriguing synergy, which lasts till the end. Unbelievable depth of flavors, while its balance is just spot on. 1,554 charactersaleigator, Feb 12, 2016

Funky barnyard smell, citric acid, sulfur, typical geuze stuff. The taste is sour as hell, apple vinegar style, salty as well, with a strong bitterness underneath. Surprisingly refreshing and apparently it goes well after a spicy meal. 304 charactersMarius, Nov 14, 2015

4.68/5  rDev +4%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a deep golden color that is slightly opaque with almost no head as expected. Just a small white collar remains throughout.
Wow! The aroma just punches you in the face with gueuzy goodness! First the burst of ripe stone fruit that is so juicy you can almost taste it! This is followed by an intense funk with cheese, horse blanket, hay, and other barnyard aromas going on. Assertive tartness is evident as well. Just a spot on aroma for the style!
The taste is quite sour from the get go. There is some overripe apricot flavor going on, but that is secondary to the super funky cheese and barnyard notes! Some tart lemon notes, alongside a dry pithy flavor in the finish. This is quite acidic, but it isn't overpowering. As expected from the style and the age, this is super complex, and quite delicious.
The mouth feel is medium, lightly carbed, tart and acidic, with a very dry finish that keeps you coming back for more!
This is just a world class example of the style! If you can still find a bottle of this definitely get your hands on it! 1,053 charactersSadMachine, Sep 10, 2015

This thing was crazy close to A&T. A&T just had a slight edge but if you want that and don't want to give up what it takes, just get some Golden Blend. So bright and balanced.
2014 bottle.
Edit: Dropping to 4.95 because of A&T. 357 characterscultclassic89, Aug 19, 2015

A: Pours a clear golden color with a short-lived fizzy bright white head that faded into a thin collar. 
S: Damp and musty smelling with dry notes of wheat, straw, and a underlying southerness. Very earthy but not much spice. I get just a touch of crisp golden fruit as well. 
T: Tastes is similar to the nose with notes of dry grains, earthy straw, a touch of musty barrel, and sour and slightly funky bugs. There is a delicate layer of ripe golden and stone fruits in the finish, and the aftertaste has a lingering gritty dryness. 
M: The body is on the lighter-side of medium, with a clean and drying mouthfeel that has great balance between slickness upfront and lingering gritty tannins. 
O: Another delicious geuze, albeit not my favorite. This, however, was very mellow and smooth without a huge amount of acidity. The aged aspect of the blend really comes through. Delicious. 915 charactersscottfrie, Jun 16, 2015

5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Drank from a 12.7 fl oz corked and caged bottle purchased at Liquor World, Cambridge, MA
Bottling Date 2011/02/17
Served in a Drie Fonteinen geuze tumbler
After loosening the cage, the cork instantly popped out of the bottle. Fortunately, none of the beer followed. With a slow and steady pour, the gorgeous, crystal clear, orangey-amber liquid became smothered by a billowing, five-finger tall, ecru colored crown that nearly spilled over the top of the glass. The head slowly faded to a thick, crackly plume. Bubbly chunks of lacing coated the glass.
An intense musty, woodsiness dominated the aroma. Loads of barnyard and leather. Super funky. Definitely some mineral character. The extensive barrel aging contributed strong oaky notes. There was an ultra crisp, powdery and dry yeastiness as well. Overall, remarkably interesting and complex.
The flavor profile was very similar to the aroma and just as impressive. Amazingly musty and leathery with intense barnyard notes. Super oaky and tannic. Bone dry. Uber bright and lemony in the center. Bitter lemon peel and aged, earthy hop notes were quite apparent in the finish and lingered long after the swallow. By the drink's end, I could feel the enamel being stripped from my teeth. That said, the actual flavor of the beer was somehow not overly acidic.
The mouthfeel was interesting and ideal for the style. It was super light and highly effervescent. Almost Champagne-like. Amazingly frothy and fluffy on the palate. 
Up until this point, Drie Fonteinen's Lente was definitely the best geuze I ever sampled. Oude Geuze Golden Blend reminded me a lot of that beer, except that everything about this was even more intense. Twenty nine dollars is a tremendous amount money to pay for a 375 ml bottle but, in this case, it was worth event cent. This was truly one of the greatest beers I have ever come across. 1,870 charactersDamian, Mar 06, 2015

I'm impressed by how sweet and fruity the cork smells as I pry it out of the bottle. That's always a good sign. 
I pour the beer into a teku glass and it produces a fizzy head (and accompanying sound) that quickly dissipates. But what remains is a gorgeous brew with a peach color and an opacity that suggests the beer is thicker than the fizz would suggest. 5
I can't escape the burgeoning fruitiness that this beer smells of, even from a distance I can smell slightly funky cranberry, raspberry and other fresh fruit. It's subtly earthy and faintly reminiscent of cider. I feel there's more than this than I can accurately describe, but it smells incredibly and seems to have no flaws. 5
Cranberries, tart cherry, raspberry. So many tart fruits seem to be in the mix here. These give way to a lemony citric flavor and some earthy funk. I find myself again searching for a flaw in the flavors here, but this beer is impeccable. 5
I love the balance of funk, tartness, and subtle citric acid achieved with this beer. It's incredibly refreshing, light, light-to-moderately carbonated and the semi-dry finish is as pleasant as any beer comes. Flawless. 5
Do I need to tell you this is a 5? It's flawless. Impeccable. Delicious. 1,312 charactersONovoMexicano, Nov 15, 2014

Appearance is an awesome burned gold sporting a huge tan head that settles to nice frothy layer. Bubbles stick to the side of glass when twirled. Starts clear but turns hazy towards the bottom of the bottle. This bottle has been upright undisturbed for well over a year now. 
Aroma on this is super funky! Cheese for days, and I mean nice funky artisanal cheeses like Camembert, Roquefort, Comte, and rich Brie's. Musky hay, wet barnyard, and freshly tilled earth come into the picture. And as for the fruity aspects you get strong lemon pulp, fermenting orange juice, nectarine skin, and faint apple notes. Gorgeous aroma. 
Taste.... Wow. This is one of the best gueuzes and beers for that matter that I've had. It's gotten better since last time I had it which was well over a year ago. This bottle is from Belgium so not sure if there was "bottle" variation. The funk is all up in the flavor but the fruit character is much juicier than on the nose. You get what you get on the nose except the orange is in the form of bright mandarin, lemon is sweet but mixed with lime, and the nectarine goes deeper than just the skin. Amazing!
Mouthfeel is also top of its game. Nice fluffy carbonation that really helps clean the beer on the finish from all the complex flavors. Heavier light body and very dry. Sports a nice lactic with faint acetic bite.
Overall.... What more can I say! 1,404 charactersMarcWP, Nov 06, 2014

Poured from a 375ml bottle, bottled 17/02/2011, best before 02/2021.
Bit of mold around the rim near the cork, all under the foil wrapping. Undeterred, i wipe it off and pour. Pours orange-gold, good formation of head that has an average lasting. Very tart and acidic, mouth puckeringly so but masks the flavors a bit. Carbonation is very low and the sour apples come through and are pleasant. Harshness with flavor not following makes this one a slight miss for me. 497 characterspapat444, Jun 09, 2014

Appearance: Pours a fairly opaque deep peach/apricot, medium amber color and immediately gives several fingers of off-white head that fade relatively quickly, over several minutes though, and leave a white layer atop the beer, along with plenty of lacing.
Smell: Sour apricots/peaches, lemon, lovely floral aromas, oak, nice bretty funk, black pepper, must. Perfect amount of funk in the smell.
Taste: Sour green apple, black pepper, citrus peel, lemon, floral flavors, bread, oak. As for sourness: about a 6.5/10 - just the right amount.
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a really frothy, fizzy, creamy body. Finishes quite nice and dry.
Overall: Probably the best gueuze I've had - very complex and really well done. The aroma is breathtaking and delicious and the flavor is to style and wonderful. Just the right amount of sour and funk with great flavors. 1,048 charactersResuin, May 09, 2014

Sharp, sweet, and musty yeast aroma, tart and funky. Fairly neutral, with a hint of citrus and wheat.
Extremely tart and crisp, funky shifting to a flat, musty funk at the end. Slight BPA or Saison sweetness and straw flavor behind. Citrus, and very obvious oak notes. Delicious!
Lively and tart mouthfeel, very drinkable but medium overall. Long semi-dry finish.
This is fantastic, probably the best geuze I've had yet.

Fast retention, not the most beautiful, but hey, that's what you get with forced, fizzy carbonation. Leaves a relatively nice layer on top, fair amount of sticky lacing. Cloudy, dirty orange. Not the most impressive, but the looks aren't why this beer is superb.
Smell: Sour strawberry notes are the strongest, fresh figs second, but a lot more going on here. The smell is fresh, different notes from apples to dry white wine, oak, lactic acid, cider like. Then the funk part - must say the most pleasant funk I've ever smelled. Smooth, hypnotizing, musty, leathery, barnyard - all perfectly balanced with fruity sour notes. Complex mixture, but works so well together. 
Taste: Light sweet pale, grainy malt at start, then the sour comes over it and kicks your senses. Sour transitions from fruity berries (a little less obvious than in the smell), lactic, even some acetic acid tart, then the enhanced citrus (lemon) zest close to the end. Funk tuned down a bit, still smooth musty, leathery notes. Sour intensity from medium to high, a little less when the beer warms up. Aftertaste consists mostly from zesty sour with some brilliant strawberry and oak notes at the far end. 
Mouthfeel: Fresh, crisp, fizzy carbonation, medium body. Very dry and coats your mouth with time. Classic geuze.
Overall: The smell is mind-blowing. Complex, balanced, smooth, the most impressive funk witnessed. And the taste that follows does it's job (maybe a bit high on sour for my taste, but hell, can't complain about that). Superb and well worth your time and money. 1,628 characterstmzl, Mar 01, 2014

A- a hazy golden amber with a lot of head. I actually had to stop pouring this on several occassions to let the head settle. After sitting for a little while, the head turns into a nice lace.
S- like apple cider. A very sour apple cider. Cinnamon spice and apples all over the place. Also very subtle hints of maybe some lemon and figs. Very nice smell. Although it reminds me of angry orchard a little too much. 
T- very sweet and sour. Has a huge blast of apple cider with the most of the cinnamon taste on the back end and lots of light fruits up front. Apples, figs and lemons. Such a beautiful taste.
M- this is probably my favorite part. Its so sour. The acidity melts your teeth enamel (just kidding) and the carbonation swells in your mouth. The sourness of it forces your cheeks to pucker and smack your lips. God its so good. 
O- a very well crafted beer. It makes you sip it though which i love. Very unfortunate that this beer is not made anymore. Fantastic beer. 1,058 charactersmlhyatt, Feb 13, 2014

4.08/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Purchased at Beverage warehouse in Winooski, VT. Bottle is dated Feb. 17th, 2011.
Step 1: start twisting open the metal cage.
Step 2: Recoil in shock as the loud BOOM of the cork shooting out of the bottle makes your life flash before your eyes.
Step 3: rush to the sink to contain the foam overflow. Clean up and pour into a wine goblet. Have your Magic hat keg glass on hand as backup.
A - overflowing with head so much I needed two glasses to hold it. Eventually fell to a thin collar. Color is opaquely hazy orange.
S - Smells like sharp citrus and dry white wine swirled around an oak barrel and thrown into a farmhouse. Unmistakably a Geuze.
T - Viciously tart, slightly tannic, and a bit oakey right up front, finishing dry and musty. Complex and challenging, leaving a somewhat pithy bitter yet satisfying aftertaste.
M - The carbonation is so active that even after its little tantrum upon opening, half of my sips felt like I was swallowing straight up foam. Such characteristics are more forgivable in a style like this, but I'd rather not feel like i'm close to choking half the time.
overall - It's rustic, sour, wild, and definitely not for everyone. Exactly what a Geuze should be, I'd say. The only big disadvantage is the price. 1,251 charactersDannyS, Jan 28, 2014

A: Everything exploded the second I got the cage untwisted -- cork, cage, and all. Currently happy to have both eyes. That said, the beer did not overflow the bottle and produces a thick (two fingers or more) frothy head. Rich, clear, and golden.
S: Hrmmm. I like this less than the standard Oude Geuze. It's both fruitier and more unpleasantly funky. The Brett taint is harsh and bitter. Once you get past that though, like the raw alcohol in a cask strength whisky, it is gentle and full. Red fruit.
T: Initial carbonic and sharp, but this very quickly fades into brilliant fruit, the red fruit I smelled distantly, apples, raspberries, strawberries. Hard mineral. Clean finish with lingering acetic acid.
M: Sparkling, funky, and clean.
O: Excellent! Highly recommended. Would love to have again. Perhaps my favorite lambic. 907 charactersAgentMunky, Jan 22, 2014

S: Smell is lacking in funk (to which I may be desensitized from smelling the previous Geuze in the vertical), and somewhat tropical. Papaya? Passionfruit? I'm not sure.
T: Lemon, orange zest. Lemon zest, orange, grapefruit rind, apple ,raspberry, a bit of black peppercorn.
M: Medium-light bodied with lots of carbonation, not harsh, though.
O: Akin to the regular Oude Geuze, but more drinkable. Carbonation settles down a bit and it's not so tart.

A - Pours was honestly a pain. Huge amounts of foam made it take forever but once it settled it left slightly hazy amber orange liquid. It eventually dissipated down to a sticky white film leaving small webs of lace down the side of the glass.
S - Smells of strong drie fonteinen barnyard funk, light basement must, bit of lemon tartness and some earthen mineral. The funk is pretty strong throughout, just as I prefer it to be.
T - Taste is a little more balanced compared to the nose. Starts off with still strong barnyard funk and light must quickly giving way to hints of oak, lactic sourness, lemon tartness and some light graininess. Finish is pretty dry, lingering long after the finish.
M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Some robust carbonation helps drum up the funk to match the tartness, making it really easy to consume.
O - I don't know why this stuff is still sitting on the shelves but I always buy it when I see it as it is truly a world class geuze. The price may be a little steep for the size but it is worth it to drink such an awesome geuze. 1,117 charactersorangesol, Jan 05, 2014
4.74/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a corked and caged bottle dated 2/17/2011 into a champagne flute. Cork was moldy on the outside around the edge. 
Appearance: Translucent, golden amber with a large, loose white head that dissipates slowly. A crown persists through the end of the glass, but no lacing to speak of.
Smell: Sour blackberries, funk. I've never been so reminded of a fruit flavor in a beer that doesn't have any fruit in it than with this beer. Lots of Gueuzy funk in this beer, quite vinous and a hint of alcohol comes through in the nose as well.
Taste: The blackberry strikes again. I'm almost entirely sure this is because of that mold on the outside of the cork around the lip of the bottle, but I did clean it off before pouring. I've had blackberry fruited sours that taste less like blackberry than this beer does. Lightly bitter, and far from the most sour beer I've ever tasted. Very mild, not at all mouth puckering. That blackberry mold flavor is really delightful though. If this qualifies as infected because of that, it's delicious. Wouldn't mind having one of these every day, except that I'd go broke fast.
Mouthfeel: Highly carbonated, but soft in the way a fine champagne is. Not prickly at all. Really beautiful.
Overall: While I'm sure that mold affected the flavor and smell of my beer, it wasn't a bad thing. This was delicious in every way. Would love to get more of this somehow, some way. 1,410 charactersWTKeene, Jan 03, 2014

A. Hazy golden orange with little head and a thin persistent cap of tiny white bubbles.
S. Deep oak, sulfur, pepper, lemon all pour out of the glass and are incredibly inviting. It literally takes your breath away. 
T. Citric tartness comes unexpectantly first, lemony and sharp. It is followed by the same aroma quality of sulfur and deep oak. The flavor is basically perfect for a geuze. 
M. Light, thin, crisp, sharp. Melting into the back of the tongue, it lightly coats the tongue once its gone, lingering on the palate for just a bit more.
O. An ideal champagne toast this new years day. Phenomenal and basically perfect. I'm not entirely sad that I dropped 25 beans on in. 849 charactersNuclearRich, Jan 02, 2014

In person traded to me from ScotNH after we decided it wasn't up his alley after an experience with grassroots brother soigné.
The cork couldn't wait to bust out of this bottle! Started unscrewing the cage and once it got loose it went flying across the room, cage still on it. You have been warned. Little bit of foam came up but no other problems.
Appearance: Big ol' bubbly two finger head, dissipating rather quickly. Looks awesome.
Smell: Very sour. Hints of citrus and pepper. Maybe some bitter fruit rind.This is gonna taste great, huh?
Taste: Oh yeah. Tart citrus, a little funk. Also getting some oak and grassy flavors upfront. Can't quite place the aftertaste. Peppery/hoppy/apple, whatever it is, I like it.
Mouthfeel: Very we'll carbonated. Coats your whole mouth with fizzy bubbles. 
Overall: Really enjoyed this. Everything was working for me, except the price tag, but I'm very glad I had it. Not too much experience with lambic or gueze but I'm hoping for some more. 1,108 charactersMikeypnh, Dec 27, 2013

Cork comes out with a resounding pop. This geuze pours a clear golden copper body with a white, billowy foaminess verging on overcarbonated.. fluffy as hell. Took a minute or so to pour a full glass. Stays a thick white foam on the surface. Leaves lots of lacing all over the place. Absolutely beautiful looking geuze! 
Smells like grape skin, a bit of sweet barnyard funk and a strong lemon zest.. it smells rather vinegary and acidic, as opposed to lactic which I don't get much of. As it gets warmer, the barnyard funkiness gets stronger and even better. It's a smooth smelling, balanced geuze that hits the spot.
I'm really enjoying this one. I get a tart lemony sweetness with some grape skin plus a nice mustiness and a bit of smooth funk on the back end. There is a sourness throughout that I would call acidic, vinegary rather than lactic. It's not as heavily funky as Cantillon's 100% Geuze can get, though. But the lemon zest flavour is classic Drie Fonteinen and I really enjoy that particular aspect. 
The mouthfeel is a very nice aspect of this geuze. It's medium thinner bodied with a ton of carbonation that is somehow just right. It literally fizzles on the tongue.. very complex with everything coming together very well. It is easy to drink (fortunately or unfortunately, depending on how you look at it) and even easier to enjoy. The aftertaste is a sour funk that stings the heck out of my palate. It is a rather sour geuze; probably one of the most sour I've had.. and it gets even more sour as it warms up!
Overall I really enjoyed this one. It's got a ridiculously sour aspect that I really enjoy, plus 3F's classic lemony mustiness. It was worth trying at least once, even at the hefty $26 price tag. Compared to the Oude Geuze which I had a few weeks ago, this is even more sour and a bit more complex on the palate. I think this is worth picking up 1-2 bottles of if you are a sour head with some money to burn.
Re-review notes: Shawn generously cracked open a Golden Blend at our non-Lente Seasons tasting today, 12/8/2013. Poured into a Vintage taster glass, split 4 ways.
Basically, it looks and smells like it has always smelled. Its cheesier and more funky than the Seasons were, but it just seems so one-trick compared to the more complex, intense Seasons; although the carbonation is better and it retains its flavour profile much better than Winter. It's a fantastic geuze to drink on its own, but we probably did it a disservice by drinking this with the Seasons. Easily worth trying once for anybody who considers himself a sour head, and perhaps another bottle or two to age for a while, but the price tag to quantity ratio is just incredibly high. 2,779 charactersStevedore, Dec 09, 2013

The cork legit nearly blew the orbital bone off my face when I opened it. When it poured, the head was 90% of the yield. It died down but still was quite thick. Very clingy lacing.
S-Firstly, the aroma just wafts out of the glass like a low but determined fog. It's has its tartness but it's much different than most of the style I have tried. The sourness mixes with this huge, grassy, herbal, earthen aroma. Funky earthy-sweet somehow. Soggy, woody oak and light honey sweetness. Mushrooms. Crazy nose. Probably the most memorable aroma I have ever experienced.
T-The flavor is quite like the nose. The tartness is pleasingly ramped up. The tartness also lingers like no other beer I've tasted. Vinegar, unripe apples, hay, grass, flower stems. Pleasant oaky notes and also a bit vinous. It's a potent brew; breathing in the fumes makes you nearly cough like when breathing in spicy buffalo wings. The flavor is savory and seemingly straight from the earth.
M-Surprisingly soft carbonation. Has more body to it than most. Tartness sticks to the lips and tongue. Very dry.
I/D-Super, super, super pricey but for a special occasion why not? Easily the most complex Gueuze I have had and clearly the best, too. It's stunningly complex yet all the flavors are perfectly integrated. Like a giant, choreographed flavor parade. You pay for the quality here. 1,411 charactersVelvetExtract, Nov 08, 2013

A: Bright orange-straw, with huge, puffy and fluffy white head. 
S: Typical for the style - tart, some must, oak, citrus, and vague malt sweetness
T: A step above most gueuzes here! Lemon citrus, oak, very dry. A distinctly dust-like finish, quite sharp. 
M: Spot-on. 
O: Really enjoyed, definitely a step up from most gueuzes I try. Big price tag but for once in a while, very worthwhile 444 charactersJasonLovesBeer, Nov 06, 2013

This pours flat, with a white grape juice aroma mixed with that pungent sulfur flavor I don't particularly care for. Hazy except for the very edges of the bulb where this is nearly clear. Plenty of carbonation that keeps a thin ring of bubbles present. 
Aroma improves immensely with warmth while there is still a touch of sock or wet dog, there is also a good bit of sour apple and white wine.
Strong fresh wood in leads the flavor with the rest of the aroma all present. Rather complex with a light flavor overall. 
Mouthfeel is spot on. Light, carbed, refreshingly crisp quite enjoyable. 
Perhaps this style isn't still my cup of tea as I take more displeasure from the parts that rub me the wrong way and not enough pleasure from the overwhelmingly positive aspects. Still, was certainly enjoyable.

A - Pours golden and cloudy with a one finger white head and strong carbonation. Fizzy head goes quick and there's not much lace. Fairly typical Gueuze lookin'.
S - Super lemony. Lotsa tartness. Light wheaty character, nice hay/barnyard sorta thing going on. Very inviting tart/lemon candy character. Nice. 
T - Holy tart. Nice sourness, sweet lemon candy, dusty, typical Gueuze qualities. Tongue scraping and stingy sourness. Acidic. Granny smiths. Delicious.
M - Nice sour finish. Nice fairly strong carbonation, medium body. Aggressive sour feeling. 
O/D - This is a boss Gueuze. Pretty aggressive stuff and doesn't hold back. Lot's of sour stuff and good flavour. Nice stuff. Really drinkable and keeps you coming back. 913 charactersbylerteck, Oct 25, 2013

375 ml bottle poured into a HF stemmed tulip.
A. Deep orange with a lovely Golden hue. Reminds me of Fall. Vigorous carbonation reduces to a nearly non-existent head. Lacing quickly recedes. Some sediment, but I balanced it between 2 glasses.
S. Tart, acidic and sour. A nice lemon quality. The aroma is surprisingly mild, giving off only minimal funk. I might have expected more of a buttery, cheese quality to it.
T. Oh, here's the funk. Dry wood, earthy tannins, and tartness all the way through. Finishes with a musty bitter quality (cheese rind?) that might not be desirable in most things, but is wonderfully present here. Truly delicious. Not overly sweet, nor overly sour. I would actually have welcomed a sharper sourness.
M. Medium bodied. Minimal effervescence; enough to mingle with the buds but not quite enough to blow my mind. The dryness at the finish of the beer could be a bit more punctuated as well. Alcohol is extremely well hidden.
O. Incredibly drinkable. Almost too much so, considering the price tag! I wish it was a tiny bit sharper, as all of the components are there, but a mid milder than I had hoped. But do not disparage; this beer is fantastic! 1,226 charactersTychoNDC, Oct 20, 2013

A: Pours a crisp, autumn orange-gold color. Billowing carbonation lingers leaving a generous head.
S: Earthy, funky and grassy. Lemon zest and grape skins are prevalent. Oak tannin lingers with a hint more funk. Lovely.
T: Spectacular acidity. More than expected. Cantillon level of sourness, but with this beautiful musty, cheesy funk. Bready and creamy. Oaky and vinuous on the back palate. Lots of grassy citrusness. Floral and puckering. Wow.
M: Effervescent and fizzy. Hugely carbonated. It really works to clean the palate and leave each sip fresh and new. Refreshing.
O: Just a spectacular gueuze. Instantly one of my favorite beers of all time. Quite possibly the best gueuze I've ever had. If it were cheaper, I'd have cases of it in my cellar. 808 charactersvonnegut21, Oct 18, 2013

Golden and slightly hazed with a near full sheet of whites. Smells good and funky with a solid punch of acidic tones offering a precursor to the oral experience. This one falls through good and tart, then some lemons, some slight bitterness (which I quite enjoy), some soily wet hamper funk. I like the flavor of this one for certain. Nice juicy mouthfeel with soft carb and a watering finish. I like this beer very much. 452 charactersharrymel, Sep 16, 2013

Pungent and tart. Lots of vinegar, green apple, currant-esque acidity, and lemon. There is a sweetness hidden that is almost almost honey-like. Very complex.
Wow. This is beautiful, round, and balanced. Soft flavors of lemon, dry white grape, and green apple skin. There is a bit of grainy finish. The finish is super-dry, all-in-all. The sourness is in check, but still obvious. Not as sour as is smells. Highly drinkable. 
Mouthfeel is medium weight. I get some tanniny resin on my tongue, almost like I just finished a sip of white wine. Highly complex. Awesome foamy carbonation. Extremely drinkable and balanced. 
This is an awesome beer--pure and simple. An exemplar of a balanced and classic gueuze. I don't know if I'm thankful or frustrated I can buy more easily. 3F knocks it out of the ballpark, but damn if they're not expensive.
Re-reviewed on 12/8/13:
Doing brief reviews of a few beers today. This was opened along side Oude Gueuze, Hefst, Zomer, and Winter. My reviews will be comparative. This was clearly an amazing tasting. Thanks to Dactrius and Stevedore for contributing and participating. I'm only reviewing for smell, taste, and overall here. Other reviews will be general to save time. Honestly, each beer was quite similar in these general categories.
Generally, I want to say that this tasting really wrecked my impression of GB. I loved this beer before. In fact, it may have been my favorite gueuze. However, the complexity, intensity, and depth of the other beers really painted this in a new light. It's far more simple, light bodied, and unbalanced than the seasons. Even Oude Gueuze was a more balanced and cohesive beer. Everything about GB seemed a tad watered down. The nose on GB seemed especially disappointing. It was a tad funky, not in the right way, and muted. I'm glad I was able to try in a side by side. It really helped open my mind to the world of gueuze. 2,043 characterslunarbrew, Sep 11, 2013

S: A big whiff gives me lactic acid which stings, some hay, light funkiness and lemon zest
T: Initial vinegar meets lemon drop blended with hay. Its not overly potent but very mellow, balanced if you can say that about this style. A light horseblanket underneath helps give it some depth. The finish is tart, dry and Earthy
M: Light bodied, high on the carbonation spectrum, tartness on the palate and tongue is persistent

a - beer opened with nary a pop (had me concerned), but a slightly aggressive pour yielded ample carbonation with a generous frothy head that hung out a bit but dissolved to leaving a thick skin of froth. great visible carbonation could be seen through the transparent orange elixir.
s - a tasting buddy of mine, i believe it was pete27lax got me into smelling the bottle and the cork right after opening and damn if this one doesn't smell fantastic. great grassy earth, but not over done or dirt like...like wheat grass. hints of lemon zest and very subtle rubber with a nice glazing of lambic soaked oak. i can smell it for days. it really just smells out of this world.
t - opens with a musty tart. my mouth is forced to adjust to the unexpected sourness. then there it is...that wonderful nose, in full force on my palate. bigger notes of lemon zest than the nose suggested and the pucker is strong. oak and green grape vinous notes tickle my tongue. a mouthful of spring time grass glazed in sweetened lemon juice.
m - great sourness. very digestible but on the sour side for a gueuze. very much like a soured version of the fantastic oude geuze from 3F.
o - overall, a winner. very much worth the money. if you are fortunate enough to still see this one lingering around, grab it while you can as you will be kicking yourself in a few years if you don't and thanking yourself if you do. 1,452 characterscosmicevan, Sep 04, 2013

Excited to finally try this at De Heeren - the price point in shops in Canada/Belgium is so steep so to find this at a reasonable price that I could comfortably consume at a world class beer destination was a thrill. 
Served in a sweet miniature gueuze basket - bright golden orange body with a healthy white foam. Musty and funky - bright citrus, farm-y, wild yeast, complex and funky. A real treat 428 charactersdirtylou, Aug 31, 2013

A- Pours a medium to deeper gold with a 2-3 finger head on the top. Retention is very good, and so is the lacing. The body is rather clear because I left the yeast undisturbed for the first pour.
S- Starts off with a hint of tart, but rather sweet on the front end. Moves toward a more typical, tart, somewhat citrus-like sour smell. Light notes of oak and a definite feel to the smell of effervescent.
T- Starts with a slightly dry, moderately tart taste. Moves quickly toward a stronger, more sour flavor that puckers the tongue. Acidic tart notes intermingle with light, oak barrel flavors to heighten the dry taste. Towards the end of the drink, the beer starts to display some of the more musty, biscuity yeast flavors, as well as a light bitterness on the back of the tongue.
M- This beer is the most carbonated beer I've ever drank. Rather sour, keeping you from drinking quickly, but not so sour to give you a heavy feeling in your stomach. Quite a good balance between sour and a little bit bitter make this one easier to drink that other Belgian sours.
Overall, this beer is terribly impressive. Although it is expensive, I think it is well worth the price tag; at least once. This may have convinced me to grab another bottle if I see it again, and lay it down for as long as I can leave it alone. 1,342 charactersboilermakerbrew, Aug 22, 2013

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice crystal clear dark honey hue with a good one finger white head that fades to leave a thin halo and light cloud. Quite nice.
S - Smell is tons of musty grape skin, barnyard funk, strong citrus (lemon) zest, super gueuze here. Dusty basement galore. Love it.
T - OOoohh yeah. I've had this at a few fests and have been waiting to review this bad boy. TONS of musty basement, barnyard funk, grape skin, lemons, horse blanket, lots of acidity to the point of almost being chalky, quite complex drie fonteinen flavours going on, really enjoy it.
M - Yep, this is spot on for mouthfeel, cant get any better than this. Super bright carbonation, flows along the tongue nicely. Gah, perfect.
O - Overall, love this beer. So much more dusty than the standard gueuze. Sourness is spot on, love the dust...glad I have a few more bottles to age! 990 charactersrudzud, Aug 21, 2013

In just a little over two years, I’ve been able to refine my palate, discover a passion for homebrewing, and join an awesome community of beer geeks, all while sampling some of the world’s best beers. What a ride. And to cap it off, I’m opening Drie Fonteinen’s Golden Blend geuze, a beer that I’ve always wanted to try but only just recently got my wallet to agree with me about. Cheers!
Bottled 02/17/2011, two and a half years before the date of this tasting.
A: Beautiful beer, pouring from with a translucent, copper-colored body. It’s completely inundated with carbonation: an absolute storm of bubbles soars from the bottom of the glass, lifting a soft head of off-white soap foam about two inches high before dropping it down to a retention of flawless cream. Strands of intricate, bubbly lacing decorate the glass’s interior.
S: Complex aromas meld to form a single alluring character: a woody barnyard funkiness. Cedar and rose petals are among the most prominent notes, a green, aromatic quality unlike anything I’ve experienced in a beer before; spectacular. Much of the actual funk of the nose emerges from yeasty notes of white pepper, cooked mushroom, and wet hay, with help from tart cherry and a mild acidity. Soft and elegant enough to be a perfume – I’m enthralled.
T: I’m glad I waited to do 499 reviews before this one; now I can just relish in this intricate, sophisticated palate. A striking taste of cedar wood, clove, rose water, and lemon zest is first on the tongue. It captivates you with that floral, grassy – almost herbal – flavor before a cherry and peach sweetness rushes in, adding a satisfying juiciness. Funk takes hold at the back end, drying the palate with tastes of straw, underripe blueberry, dry champagne breadiness, giving this a finish of sour-sweet lime acidity. This palate is more than a collection of flavors: there’s charm to the way it’s balanced, demonstrating with each sip that it’s something that you’ll likely never experience again. 
M: Silky carbonation that’s a tad foamy, but never enough to distract from the palate. The body is reminiscent of a low-alcohol white wine, slightly oily but refreshing overall, giving this beer both substance and drinkability.
O: I keep tipping the glass up to my lips, waiting for that last drop – it has to be in there, damn it! I can’t let this beer go so easily. Everything about it is so loveable, so pristine; it’s a calculated sensory experience that comes off like a work of art. In all this was one of the best beer experiences I’ve had in a long, long time, and a perfect finish to an outstanding list of 500 beer memories. Cheers. 2,720 charactersBarryMFBurton, Aug 10, 2013

Carbonation is spot on, assertive but not aggressive, plays with the tongue.

The cork showed that it had leaked a bit before removing. Pours out with a ton of carbonation, took a few minutes to fully pour and your left with a huge billowy white cap atop a cloudy golden orange body. Tons of carbonation bubbles streaming up. After awhile your left with a super creamy retentive white head. I've never seen a lambic hold such a nice head.
Lots of tart funk. Rotted wood or rotted cork comes to mind. Old socks and horse blanket funk, more as it warms, Bright lemon citrus.
Very tart and quite sour,lemons, some lemongrass, classic 3f house flavor, like a zesty lemon, musty, hay, quite complex. Some acidity lingers. Almost minty.
Has this really nice mouthfeel that you really only get in select guezes, hard to describe. But it flows over the palate so nicely, the perfect feeling carbonation despite what the pour led me to believe. Leaves a lingering sourness on the palate similar to sucking on a lemon. 
Pricey and worth it, but maybe not worth more than one or two bottles. Though its been awhile since I've had the regular oude gueze, its very similar with a bit more complexity. 1,240 charactersdogfishandi, Jul 27, 2013

A: Pours a hazy amber orange color. Vibrantly white head fizzes down to a relatively thick cap of foam for the style.
S: Strong notes of vinegar waft out of the glass. These are followed shortly by a lemon zest tartness and some funk. Hay and barnyard.
T: The vinegar and lemon flavor are potent but balanced. A fairly dry flavor with some wheat. Very funky with earthy, lactic flavors. Horse blanket, barnyard and wet hay. Apple vinegar. Lingering flavors or lemongrass and lactic funk.
M: High, effervescent carbonation increases the tart sensations.
O: One of my new favorite gueuzes. Incredibly tart and funky but more balanced than most in this style. The tart flavors are somehow both incredibly potent but not overwhelmingly sharp. Great flavors. 815 charactersWankelEngine, Jul 14, 2013

4.09/5  rDev -9.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25375ml bottle served in my Allagash chalice. 17/02/2011 indicated on the back label. Pours a dull, semi-hazy orange hue with a rocky, two-inch, bright white head that dissipates into a frothy band around the shoulders and a dollop across the center. Copious tiny bubbles are present effervescing in solution to the underside of the cap and adhere to the walls of the glass. Nose is bright and tart with a hint of sour pit fruit, a trace of candied fruit sweetness, cork and notes of cider vinegar. Taste is not as bright as the nose and less fruit comes across. There's definitely a citric acid presence as well as cork and a salty character; however, it's not overly tart. Mouthfeel is light and lively with a bright carbonation and some astringency that lightly stimulates the salivary glands along the sides of the cheeks. Overall, a very good Gueuze. Not my favorite, but quite respectable and approachable. I'm glad I have an extra bottle in the cellar. 957 charactersJwale73, Jul 03, 2013

Absolutely gorgeous. Golden pear colored body, like a glass of apple cider with a surprisingly full bone white head that fills the glass with ease. Waves of needlepoint beading stuff the body of the beer... perfect.
Overripe apple, white grape and plum with a mellow vinegar acidity. Pear and peach skins.
Apple cider vingar, pear, grape juice... all smothered with the funkiest of the funk. The mid palate is musty and provides a blank canvas for that tart, fruity finish.

Has a light copper color, with only a very slight haze. Mild tartness to the smell, like too-green apples. Right out of the fridge, you get a heavy carbonation in the mouth, and the cold mutes the flavors. After a few minutes in a warm summer room, the flavors come alive. There's a tartness to it, but nothing that overpowers. It's like subtle perfection in its refreshing quality that lets you know it knows it's awesome, but doesn't have to shove it in your face. 572 charactersyankeepride, Jun 23, 2013

Pours clear golden color with thin white head that lingers as a ring along sides of goblet.
Smell is tart apple and cherries. 
Taste is sweet and tart. Acidic with slight bitterness in the finish. Lots of apple and cherry. Not overpoweringly tart.
Mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with prickly carbonation.

This is one of the most amazing beers I have ever seen. In this glass, a ROARING carbonation of fire is coming from the middle of the glass, with wonderful streaming legs of pinhead bubbles charging up the sides. The head is soapy white, never forms, but it magically re-appears with more carbonation coming to the top of the glass. Body is a booming peach glowing orange, with yellow and lemon colored hues, looks like a creamsicle Popsicle with all this color and clear see- through fast carbonation. The beer looks like it's from hell, it literally appears to be on FIRE! Amazing.
Nose has a nice floral hint, and classic earthy dry funk notes. Hints of lemon fruit sour tartness and mild acidity, some of the funk brings some classic pepper. Memorable and impressive.
Palate is just supper fun. Fruit filled mid palate full of body and super playful carbonation. Juicy apricots and fleshy rind mixing with crisp lemon dry character and funk earth. Huge flowery garden aromatic with great chewy apricot and lemon tartness. Apricot flesh rind just rips and feels dense in the mouth. This is like a super aggressive Fou Foune… sort of… sharp carbonation but nothing distractive, playful and a good malt backbone. 
Stupid easy drinking, extremely memorable, I wish this bottle was bigger, a fantastic beer. 1,412 characterssmakawhat, May 18, 2013

Hazy golden color, with a thin white head.The head stays for a while as it is constantly recharged with the rising carbonation bubbles.
Very complex aroma. Funk, lemon zest, lactic sourness. Brettanomyces dominate. 
The complexity of the flavor is something unexpected, even for a complex style like gueuze. Tons of funk, and a perfect level of sourness. Light stone and citrus fruits, funk, wheat. Slightly sweet, but mostly dry and sour. The 4 year old lambic blended into this take it to a new level of complexity.
I should have bought another bottle. 623 charactersDanny1217, May 12, 2013

A- Pours a brilliant golden color with decent clarity. Large 3 finger white head with excellent lacing and retention. Spot on for a gueuze.
S- Musty and damp earth, moldy, some cheese as well followed by lemon zest and acid that is well integrated into the nose. I am expecting this one to be screamingly sour, although the nose doesn't give it away. 
T- Funky- this tastes like barnyard, rotten cheese, and moldy lemons. There really isn't a ton of acid here although it is present. The musty, dirty barnyard brett has taken over the flavor profile. Great, if you are into that kind of thing!
M- Effervescent and bright, champagne-like as it should be. Dry on the finish, but not too much. 
O- A very solid gueuze that will probably get even weirder as time goes on. It is developing well. I may have to scoop up a case when I win the lottery! 867 charactersjustforrazors, May 10, 2013

Darker than usual (for gueueze) copper color. Aroma is subtle, with citrus, oak, but also peaches coming through (which regular one does not have), and a pinch of earthy funk. Taste is orange, vanilla, peaches & cream. Not much yeastiness which 3F usually has quite a bit of. Somewhat fuller bodied than regular 3F, and less acidic, which creates a silky sensation. Really a well balanced blend. 
Worth $20? Well, not as a regular drinking beer, but i would recommend sour beer fans to try it at least once, because how many fantastic sour beers are made in the world? (answer: very little). 623 charactersjibbyvonjibb, Apr 25, 2013

poured into tulip glass.
small pop as the cork comes out of the bottle.
Appearance: this beer is definately golden in color. Medium golden yellow bodied beer with a huge 3 fingers of white head. The head has alot of staying power and stays around for a long time, but eventually falls to a thin cap with a thick ring around the glass. Stunning!
Smell: Lemon zest, mild musty/hay funk, hint of oak. 
Taste: lemon and grapefruit zest, green apple, pears, peaches, and white grapes. Moderate tartness with lemons leading the way. Hints of dusty and musty funk that balance out the tartness very well. The oak barrel just lends a little bit of character to this beer in the form of an earthy and woody note. Finishes with mild lemon notes and a perfect amount of funk. The balance of this beer is tremendous. It has fantastic complexity as well. Its tart without that over the top pucker of some sour beers.
Mouthfeel: light bodied beer with moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel on this beer is phenominal! Its soft and delicate, yet slick and creamy. The carbonation level is spot on! The beer has a semi to moderately dry finish that really showcases and compliments the tartness and the funk of this beer. 
Overall: This is a truly refined and sophistocated sour beer! Have a difficult time finding something that I dislike about this beer. This exceeded my expectations. I will admit that I was a bit complacient about the price tag of this beer when I purchased this bottle today, but now that I am drinking this beer I have forgot the initial "sting" of the price tag. It is in my top three sour beers I have ever drank and its without a doubt the best Geuze I have drank! 1,725 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Apr 17, 2013

Thrilled to have a second chance with this beer, as my first bottle met a particularly painful end. It pours a lightly-hazy sunset amber-gold topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose is a veritable field guide to scent-heavy apple varieties, along with some bits of grapefruit zest, white grape, honeydew, powdered sugar, and a hint of cobweb. The taste holds notes of tart grapefruit, heavy funk, chardonnay grapes, oak, and cobweb. The tartness and the funk don't play nicely together, spreading a minor din throughout my mouth where I hoped orchards and vineyards would re-enact a Fantasia episode. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, a certainly well-meaning gueuze, but one that just doesn't have the balance I generally look for, opting instead for a contentious mixture of strong funk and strong tart fruit. It's nowhere near bad, but not something I would readily reach for in the near future (especially with that audacious price tag). 1,055 charactersTMoney2591, Apr 16, 2013

Served in a Unibroue tulip, the beer pours a cloudy golden/orange color with a huge 3 inch off-white frothy head. The head sticks around a while, and there's also a lot of lacing. It smells like funk, wood, lemon peel, green apples, and some apricots. The taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some green grapes, vinegar and a bit of leather noticeable too. Also, the flavors are more tart/sour compared to the aroma. This brew just gets better the longer I drink it! Mouthfeel/body is medium, it's a bit slick with a good amount of soft, zingy carbonation. It's very enjoyable and easy to drink. Good, but pricey at $21.99 a bottle. 702 charactersbluejacket74, Apr 07, 2013

Cap removed with a resounding pop. Impressive amount of foam when poured into a tulip glass. Some motile lacing runs down the glass and gets reabsorbed into the foamy cap. Hazy amber body. 
Quite appealing bouquet of apples, white grapes, cheese, old wood. 
On the palate, tart apples, apricot, white wine, nuts, oak. Ends clean with a nice tart finish and just a hint of bitterness and spice. This is a complex, well balanced beer, resembling a good champagne. 
Light body and fizzy carbonation, very clean and refreshing mouthfeel. 
This is surely one of Belgium's top gueuzes, and a real delight to drink. This beer also complements food. I had mine with a grilled cheese sandwich made with Cabot Vermont cheddar cheese aged 3 years--I should have blended in some younger cheese with the older for a more complete analogy. I have a couple more bottles that I brought back from Belgium, so the next one I hope to drink with rabbit cooked with gueuze (I'll use a lesser gueuze for cooking). It is unfortunately quite expensive stateside ($26, 375 ml, purchased at Healthy Spirits in San Francisco and imported by Shelton). 1,156 charactersBeerenauslese, Mar 29, 2013

Barely audible pop on releasing the cork. Aggressive pour yields a finger of head that falls relatively fast to nought. Body is attractive orange amber and near crystal clear on the first pour, with prominent sediment on later pours.
Lovely bright and clean acidity, contributing zippy aromas of lemon zest, sour green apples, dried apricots, musty basement, hay, green capsicum, wet soil, and mild acetone notes. Great expression and subtlety. 
Flavours emphasise the tart fruit character a little more than the funk. Swathes of sour citrus pith, bitter lime, with drier jalapeno notes building later. 
Carbonation is surprisingly active on entry, spreading a pleasant tartness which is not hugely puckering, but satisfyingly so.
Without a doubt one of the classiest sours around. Complex, rewarding, and very well done. 840 charactersspicelab, Mar 22, 2013

Pours a hazy gold with amber accents capped by a huge seafoam-like bright white head that rises over the brew. Slowly dissipating head with some lacing here and there. Light citrus notes, white wine vinegar, tart apple, pear, accents of barnyard funk, pleasant pungency and warm oak. Grass and hay, toasted oak notes, white wine, very light cheesy funk, white grapeskin, citric acid accents, and very light meyer lemon rind. Finishes with expertly balanced oak accents and the perfect level of sour and tartness. Crisp, light body, with highly effervescent champagne-like carbonation. What an incredibly balanced masterpiece, an incredible gueuze. 743 characterschanokokoro, Mar 22, 2013

(A)- Pours a lightly hazy copper orange color. Produced a huge bubble white head of froth that slowly dissipated.
(S)- An in your face nose of some seriously dirty and earthy lactic cheesy funk followed by an acidic yet dry spicy oak aroma. Ever so subtle lemon rind. As it warms, some subtle yeasty biscuit bits. The oak becomes more prominent too, but such a great showing of it.
(T)- A wonderful sharp acidity up front that really stays with you throughout the taste. Plenty of oak showing as well. Bits of lemon and vibrant earthy and dry funk (not as lactic as the smell was, but fairly cleaner and crisper yet still quite dry).
(M)- A lively carbonation level and a wonderful balance to it. Harmonious and dynamic in the sense of everything works together so well; the oak, acidity, etc.
(O)- Just a joy to drink and consume. Armand is easily my most favorite Gueuze blender currently and this is just further proof for me. The only aspect of this that makes me a little sad is how expensive it is (Do not get me wrong, I totally understand why it is). Just when compared to their regular Oude Gueuze, there is not a huge difference between the two, despite this being almost double the price tag. Nonetheless, a superb achievement. 1,363 characterssweemzander, Mar 04, 2013

4.38/5  rDev -2.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Ron for bringing this one to the tasting. This one was super carbonated - after twisting the cage off, the cork popped out on its own. Surprisingly enough, no gushing over. It pours a cloudy, dull-golden color with a white head that grows big and settles around a quarter-inch or so. No real lacing to speak of, only a little bit of wet legging.
Golden Blend has a nice pungency on the nostrils; sweet apples, lemons, and white grapes, mild funk and musk, lots of acidity and a heavy sour/tart character that is easily accessible just from smelling the beer. Some dry oak in the finish, along with some more funky and corky notes that come out more as the sourness settles a bit. I'm really digging the way this one smells - plenty of sweet and tart, juicy fruits with a perfect amount of funky yeast. 
This one is super crisp and light on the palate. The heavy carbonation seemingly allows the beer to evaporate seconds after hitting your tongue. Super tart fruit up front, namely apples, white grapes, and some lemon zest. Very tart and puckering right out of the gate - even more so than the aroma would have you believe. Once the initial tart spike subsides, it's time for the funk. 
Big, heavy yeast flavors join; funk, cork, wet wood. The funk was a little stronger in the aroma than on the palate, but it's still a large contributor. Near the finish, I'm picking up some light cherry tartness as well. There's a slight bitterness near the very end, perfectly dulling the tartness and creating a nice "fade-out". Aftertaste is full of oak and funk mixed with the lasting fruit sweetness.
Wow, what a great tasting gueuze. Great balance of tart, sour, and funk. Easy to drink and so ghost-like on the palate that it's scary. Many thanks again to Ron for sharing this with us.
EDIT: Enjoyed this again a few weeks later thanks to Kevin. Still just as delicious as the first one. This is definitely the type of gueuze I would seek out because at this point in time, it's still not too hard to reel in, but it tastes amazing.
EDIT #2: Have enjoyed this many more times - the flavors and aromas are usually on point and delicious, however some bottles are overly carbonation and sometimes the wispy mouth feel is a bit too sharp and distracts from the flavors. Other than that, a great beer that ever gueuze lover needs. 2,337 characterstectactoe, Mar 03, 2013

Pours to a tulip orange, with a bit of haze. Tons of fluffy white head upon the pour that settles to a half-finger or so, some lace left.
Intense sour, sweaty, lemony scent, with light funk for good measure. Nice strength, makes for lots of anticipation on the taste.
Taste surprisingly steps it up a bit. There is more funk than in the scent, but focuses mostly on bright, fruity, sourness. Some bready/yeasty notes there as well. Very smooth, solid, potent, big sharp flavor while remaining quite drinkable.
Full body with high carbonation, very smooth overall, too easy to sip on for a beer that should be savored.
Certainly a stand-out gueuze, probably the best I've had. An excellent balance, nothing comes across as overpowering. Might just be worth the big price tag. 953 charactersChico1985, Feb 26, 2013

A- Poured from the corked bottle into two tulips. Cloudy dark-golden color to this Gueuze. A puffy and creamy white head forms to about two fingers in size with nice retention for the style. It all settles to a nice ring and a big clump of mystery in the center of the beer. A few thick pillows of lace toward the top and spotty lace down the rest of the glass.
S- Packs a punch as soon as you open and pour this one. Haven't had the standard 3F Gueuze in a while or even Cantillon Classic but this instantly brings me back to those rare chances. Sour fruity blast like lemons and tart apples/grapes. Acetic acid and some cheesy funk as well.
T- With the first sip I notice how smooth this is. Everything is balanced out with a tart and almost herbal saison feel, interesting. Fruit notes coming from the bugs are apple, grape and lemon in nature and make up a big chunk of the flavor. Nice oak, vinegar and grassy barnyard hints as well. Slightly funky but more on the straight tart sour side.
MF- Foamy body overall with a great dried out, light consistency. It is airy like a cloud when being sipped but this only makes it feel even more heavenly. Moderate sourness overall.
The funky and tart aspect of this beer grows with time but it is very smooth and balanced. The complex flavor makes me cherish each sip. The price prohibits me from getting another bottle but I just may after actually trying it. 1,561 characterscbutova, Feb 24, 2013

L – Deep gold color with an enormous, champagne-like 10-finger thick, mousse-like, white head initially. It eventually settles into a 6-finger bubbly, rocky, white head. Awesome retention and some great patchy lacing. The beer is very clear with a good amount of bubbles.
S – Definitely lots of musty, funky Brett with a touch of acidic sour apples, lemons, grapes. There are some dry, slightly earthy oak notes, as well. It doesn’t smell as sour as I thought it would, but let’s wait for the taste.
T – Well, I definitely spoke too soon. This beer is amazingly sour with apple, cherry, grape, lemon, and lime flavors. The barnyard, horse-blanket funk is still very apparent, particularly at the finish. Some woody oak and earthy, almost leathery flavors come through at the finish, too. The taste is very interesting because, while it is very sour, it is also very smooth and balanced at the same time. All I can really say is that it is extraordinarily well-blended.
F – Medium-bodied with great carbonation, a prickly and puckering mouthfeel, and a sour, funky, and dry finish. While the finish is dry, the beer has a wet feel throughout from all the saliva that my mouth is producing from the acidity. After the finish, some sour fruity flavors and some earthy, musty, and funky flavors linger nicely on the tongue and palate.
O – This is a great gueuze. Between the aroma and the flavor, the sour and funky notes are perfectly balanced. The funky notes are more prevalent in the aroma, while the vinegary, acidic, and sour notes are stronger in the taste. In my opinion, this is perfect. The wide range of complex products that are created by Brettanomyces are better suited for the aroma, while the sheer acidity and sourness of the beer can really only be appreciated in the taste. I would really like to try some more beers from Drie Fonteinen. I hear that their sours are out of control. If this one is any indication of how they are, then sign me up. 2,089 charactersBlackBelt5112203, Feb 13, 2013

4.24/5  rDev -5.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25375ml caged and corked bottle. Another weird opener for this brewery - after the final twist was applied to the cage's wire, the cork just plum popped off itself, this time deftly into my waiting hand, as opposed to ricocheting off the ceiling.
This beer pours a hazy, medium golden amber hue, with three fingers of very loosely bubbly, fizzy, foamy dirty white head, which leaves a low sudsy wall of cushion lace around the glass as it evenly sinks away.
It smells rather pungently of sour lemon, over-aged white wine, under-ripe green apples, a growing musty funk, a weak bready maltiness, and a soft kiss of astringent, grainy wood. The taste is sharply acidic apple, white grape, and lemon, with an actually perceptible, combined fruity sweetness, some bomb shelter pale grain, with a certainly laid-back funk, what with it being only a tad musty and cheesy. A lingering oaky woodiness seems incapable of letting go.
The carbonation is light, and fairly frothy, the body medium-light in weight, the airy bubbles providing a bit too much distraction for straight-ahead smoothness to take hold, which is strange, given the initial edgy acidic notes. It finishes off-dry, incredibly, the tartness abating for the most part, the fruit on the rise, in a complex interplay with the grain, tame funk, and neutered wood.
Wow, what a show - almost unpalatable acetic acid to start off, and then a slow, easy conversion to a balanced fruity, zingy oak-touched pale ale, Belgian-style, that is. Very drinkable, robust, and enjoyable well beyond expectations. However, since those expectations came from the 'regular' Oude Gueuze , and the price comparison between them is double, at least, that puts me in a quandary as to recommendations - try this, I guess, at least once, for an occasion. Mine appears to be a Monday night. 1,823 charactersbiboergosum, Feb 05, 2013

A- Boom, cork in the face. Pour leaves a thick fluffy white head that dissipates to nothing as it rests. Color is a translucent light gold.
S- Heavy doses of citrus zest and oak. Funk comes off as earthy with subtle notes of honeycrisp apple
T- lemon tartness and oak flavors are balanced by an underlying white grape sweetness. All combined with typical fonteinen funk and yeast flavors. This geuze is more assertive and brash than the regular oude geuze. 
M-Body is noticeably thicker than their standard geuze. Carbonation is very spritzy and ample. Lactic cheese/funk and oak linger on the palate.
O-This one is fantastic right out of the gate. I cant wait to see how it develops. With its bigger body and bolder flavors, I would think more subtle flavors will continue to show up as more dominate ones mellow, making this one more complex and intriguing. 877 charactersstx00lax, Jan 15, 2013

O - this is a really unique beer...and really...a different beer style that I'm trying to explore, albeit with some reservations; the cost of this and Cantillon is high and not really suggestive of casual exploration; I dig the flavors and mouthfeel, but the sour elements and the overall funky tart fuck with my gut. I imagine this is one of the better 'more available' gueuzes out there...and I'll pick up again to try, but no one's every going to find me chasing 3F. 978 charactersSkeeterBoganski, Jan 12, 2013

A-Cloudy yellow-orange, well carbonated, three finger fluffy head. The cork started coming off as soon as I unwound the cage.
S-Funk, lemon, grass, oak, green apples, all blended together well.
T-Not very sour, more tart than anything, and a mild tartness at that. However it is very fruity, green apples galore, lemons, some grass and the oak has a strong presence as well.
M-Light, highly carbonated and dry.
O-Just a little more in the sour department and this beer would be out of this world. 608 charactersrlee1390, Jan 03, 2013

Poured with about 3 fingers of an off white head that dissipated quickly leaving a thin coating that stuck around through the whole glass. Almost no lacing
Smell: Lemon, funky, musty, white grape, green apples. Funk becomes more present as it warms. This beer smells really sour.
Taste: Intensely tart and acidic at the front of the tongue, almost mouth puckeringly sour. Middle of the mouth is more lemon, white wine grapes, and funk. Finish has notes of oak and funk.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied, creamy mouthfeel. Carbonation is high. Finish is dry with a lingering sourness.
Overall: One of the best gueuze lambics I've ever had. Noticeably more sour than the normal 3F Geuze. The price tag prevents this from being a more regular purchase, but definitely worth picking up a bottle or two for special occasions. 885 charactersJonada, Jan 01, 2013

Not only did the cork almost rocket out but the head was unstoppable and even with a slow pour took forever, probably because I refuse to allow any of the sediment into my glass. Now I am going to jump ahead and say that this is a fantastic geuze overall but I probably won't buy any more unless I can slip it into an overseas order. Its great its just not light years ahead of the regular oude geuze. The appearance was beautiful, thick orange, milkshake fluffy head, perfect glassware. The aroma is pretty great, quintessential geuze, wheat, sour orange slices, maybe the slightest bit of oak, honey. Flavor is pretty fucking good, very round and mildly fatty, does not make me pucker at all. Grass, pepper, very tame lemon flavor, this is pretty exquisite. As I move through the glass I can admit that yes, this is better than the normal 3F geuze in the same way that the Oude Geuze Vintage and Armand 4 series are better. Masterful stuff.

4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The Golden Blend variation of Oude Geuze is, not surprisingly, golden in color. It’s definitely clear. Backlighting brightens it up a bit. Gives it a slight orange tint. Carbonation looks active and yields a white head that stands about three fingers tall. It’s slow to recede. Lacing was a bit sticky and moderate in volume. Good lookin’ stuff. 
The nose is impressive. It starts out with bit of fruit – lemon, apple, and pear. It smells earthy, grainy, and a bit herbal. There’s a musky side to it, but it doesn’t smell funky. It smells a bit sour and vinegary. Oak is definitely strong in the mix. Other fruit notes of grape and light berries follow. Smells a little white wine-esque. Secondary notes of leather and light tobacco round it out. Alcohol is pretty much buried. I’m not getting any at all. Very deep and complex. Excellent. 
The flavor might be even more impressive. It’s very complex and extremely tasty. A blend of fruit notes kicks it off. Lemon, lime, apple, berries, and white grapes are all noted. It’s definitely sour and vinegary. Yeah, it’s a bit mouth puckering, but it is delicious. Oak comes through loud and clear. It adds a ton of depth and character to the overall flavor. It is very earthy and musky throughout. It’s not funky though. Leather, light tobacco, and white wine notes wrap things up. Alcohol is never a factor. Finishes fruity, earthy, oaky, and dry.
The body is medium. While carbonation seems active, it’s very light and soft. There’s no questioning its Belgian origins. The feel is very silky and smooth. I could drink this all night and then some. 
The Golden Blend variation of Oude Geuze is excellent beer. No doubt about it. It’s complex and delicious. This is definitely one you shouldn’t miss. If you have any appreciation for or interest in Belgian sours, find a bottle. It’s pricy, but well worth purchasing a single bottle. 1,915 charactersprototypic, Dec 22, 2012
4.46/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a wine glass from the bottle.
A - The cork popped out forcefully with the removal of the cage, but luckily it didn't leave my hand, and didn't gush. A careful pour nevertheless yielded a massive 4-finger dense white head atop a cloudy golden-bronze beer. The head recedes slowly on this one, maintaining a centimeter or so layer on top. Effervescence remains as well. This one is a beauty.
S - Sour barnyard funk, pretty typical of a good gueuze.
T - Sour up front, moreso than the regular 3F oude gueuze. Funky throughout, while the sour gives way to a fruity, slightly malty back. This is a bit more intense than a typical gueuze, the sourness really explodes on the tongue, although the flavors backing it up come through nicely after the initial burst. Very pleasant.
M - The head retention and effervescence give this a creamy, bubbly texture that is superb, and the aftertaste is long and phenomenal. The fruity, malty notes linger for quite a while, and really make you pause between sips. The finish is very dry, inviting another delicious sip after savoring the last. Excellent.
O - Ignoring the price point, this is an outstanding gueuze. Hits all the right sour, funky notes, and delivers a different experience from a typical oude gueuze. I wouldn't recommend shelling out $20 or $30 for more than one, but it's worth trying one for the price. 1,372 characterskdb150, Dec 18, 2012

Some reserved funkyness, but far from the barnyard some evoke - tartness rises up toward the end and the finish is amazingly bone dry. 377 charactersBrent, Dec 10, 2012
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours hazy orange/yellow with a massive white sticky head that sticks around for a long time leaving spots of lacing down the glass.
Funky aroma with some tart/sour notes, oak, lemon and hay. 
Very tart flavor, more so than the normal 3F oude gueuze. Lemon, apple, grape and even a few white wine grape notes come through along with the typical horse blanket funkiness. Oak dries it out a bit at the back end leaving a pleasant sourness on the tongue. Fantastic complexity as I got a new flavor out of just about every sip.
Creamy body with high carbonation levels. Finishes dry and puckering.
At $26/375 it's a bit pricy, but if any beer is worth it, it is probably this one. Amazing complexity throughout the palate and a good deal more sour than the regular which is a plus in my book. I'll probably buy again although the price tag limits stocking up too much. 868 charactersjmarsh123, Dec 10, 2012

bottled on date: 2011/02/17
At $26 for a 12.7oz bottle this is officially the most expensive beer per oz that I have drank to date.
A: Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with just under 2 fingers width of bright white head, which dissipates down fairly slowly to leave a thick film that hangs around for the majority of the drink but leaves no lacing. Lots of carbonation bubbles can be seen racing to the top of the glass. 
S: Wonderful sour/tart, oak, and fruity sweet aromas explode out of the glass. Tangerine citrus, sweet white and red grapes, hints of cracked white pepper and estery- banana. So complex, with a great interplay between the sweetness, sourness, and oak. 
T: Tart, with a sour character that is somewhat puckering, lemony acidic, vinous with white grape notes, some peppery spice and banana on the finish. Oak lingers forever in the aftertaste, some mild wet hay characters but otherwise very little funk, a bitterness component hits the palate every once in a while, as does a champagne-esque flavor. Just so much complexity here, very well done. 
M/D: Heavy carbonation, fuller body than most of the style, but works well with the high carbonation. Has an almost chewy component, and is very quick drying. Puckering sourness at times. Drinkability is great, I had to make a conscious effort multiple times throughout the drink to slow down and enjoy it. 
O: Overall, what a great beer. Much better than the regular 3F Oude Geuze, with a better sourness, more complexity, and just generally stronger flavors. I would love to drink this beer again, but unfortunately the ungodly price tag will make this a rare treat. Really nice beer, but I don't think its worth $26 for a 375mL but then again I cant imagine thinking any beer could live up to that price. Bottom line is, if you can afford it, go get it. 1,862 characterszac16125, Dec 04, 2012

4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A: this started as a big time gusher, with the cork flying off, but it stopped gushing without more than a small amount of foam coming off the top. It pours very cloudy golden orange color after being stirred up so much by the gushing, and it has a gigantic head even with a soft pour when it came right out of the fridge. 
S: sourness, orange and lemon peel, and some funk. It's impressively fruity, and the smell really alludes to the sour taste. 
T: fantastic sourness that hits hard right out front. After that I get some of the lemon peel and a very small amount of malt. I can't put my finger on it, but the sourness in this beer is fantastic and not abrasive, but still decently intense. It's like the sourness from eating a raspberry without the raspberry taste. 
M: smooth, but still very well carbonated with fine bubbles that donate enough spritz to the mouthfeel to keep the sourness from sticking too much. 
O: excellent beer with lower drinkability than other gueuze. Good thing since I've gotten it for $20-$25 per 375 ml bottle. I'll save a couple of these and have them in a few years if the bottles don't explode. 1,135 charactersHolland, Dec 01, 2012

A: Hazy orange body with two finger white head. Good amount of lacing. Looks delicious.
S: Sour yeast, sweetness, oak, citrous, some barnyard funk. 
T: Taste follows the nose, but it's not as sweet as expected. Also, it's not as sour or puckering as I expected. It's quite bready, you really get the oak/woody-ness. Sourness and the citrus (lemon) kick in again towards the middle and the finish. Very nice, although for some reason, I originallyl thought this beer would be more sour and mouth-puckering. Some reviewers below mention that this beer is tart, but I am not sure if I agree. It's for sure acidic, but it's more of acidic sourness than tartness, imo. 
M: High carbonation, medium body, dry finish. 
O: Glad I got to try this. Surprisingly easy to drink and refreshing. 832 characterssukwonee, Nov 17, 2012

A: huge tan head (2in) that lingers for a long time and only goes down slightly. Its a nice golden amber color that reminds me of an IPA which is interesting to me but looks good to me
S: Its got a skunky bottom of the barrel funky aroma that would be off putting if it wasn't to style from what I know this is a good thing.
T: Its got a white wine like taste upfront but that mixes into an almost over powering funky taste that is most definitely sour but more like sour grapes that then anything else I can describe. The finish is kind of weird but it definitely has that funk to that I have been hearing so much about and a continuous of that same wine like taste. Seems pretty to style to me
M: It has a Champaign like carbonation but a Chard wine like feel and constancy, distpite all this its pretty drinkable and the carbonation balances out the funky flavors well 
O: Okay so I definitely like sours there is a whole lot of tastes I usually don't like but together I like it a lot I feel like I am definitely going to have to come back once I know more about the style, but its quite the pricy rarity to try again so Im glad it was good the first time. 4 1,259 charactersPinknuggets, Nov 14, 2012

Note-I should have read the reviews prior to opening, because I nearly lost an eye opening this thing. As soon as I loosed the cage, the cork shot out and the beer produced a mild gush of foam. 
A-Crazy amounts of light tan foam that hung around for a bit in the glass. The beer itself is a golden color with orange hues. A bit cloudy on the pour with a few streams of carbonation to be seen. 
S-Lactic (but not overly so), tart, and delicious. You get some oak and a lightly vinous smell to go along with the wet hay and light funkiness. There is a nice green apple component as well. Very concentrated and complex.
T-Also concentrated and complex, and with flavors similar to the smell. Finer and more delicate in flavor than some gueze, but with an amazing balance of lactic tartness, funkiness (wet hay and barnyard), bright fruit (green apples and tart, white grapes), and some bread/dough to carry it all. 
M-The beer is medium bodied with a pretty chunk carbonation. The finish is drying and very, very long lasting.
O-If smell and taste were all I could rank, this beer would be near the tope of my list. The smell and taste are simply amazing in terms of concentration and complexity of flavors. The finish just goes on and on, like a great champagne. Alas, I did not find the beer to be particularly attractive and the mouthfeel was a little heavy to garner a perfect score. Is this thing worth 24 bucks? Probably not, but will I buy it again? Probably so. 1,522 charactersspoony, Nov 10, 2012

Bottled on 2011
Poured into a Drie Fonteinen gueuze glass
Cork pops out of bottle immediately after removing metal cage and some gushing happens: be careful with this one.
Sampled side-by-side with a 2010 Drie Fonteinen Oude Gueuze.
Slightly more intense with tartness, sweetness, oakiness, and richness of flavors than the "typical" Drie Fonteinen gueuze, Golden Blend is a smooth and refined gueuze that is one of the pinnacles of the style. If the aroma was slightly more expressive, this could be near-perfect for me.
Looks virtually identical to its Oude Gueuze counterpart, perhaps a tad darker in color. Pours a fairly massive, tall head with fairly good retention of a few minutes. Head is off-white, eggshell, composed of large and medium-sized bubbles. As it descends, it leaves some streaks of lacing, with larger blotches near the body. Body is a golden yellow with a subtle orange tint, transparent if you don't add the yeast (cloudy otherwise). Nice, big bubbles of carbonation stream from the bottom of the glass to support the head.
Aroma is surprisingly sweet with oak undertones, some tangible tropical scents (pineapple) waft up, and there is some minor-key white pepper. This is substantially smoother, sweeter, and fruitier than the funkier, harsher Oude Gueuze. If you're looking for that compositing hay and organic matter scent in your gueuze, do not go for the Golden Blend.
Slightly more robust flavors overall, and smoother, with greater emphasis on wild yeast metabolites and pineapple-based tropical fruit: delicious, a definitely more "refined" version of their gueuze. Opens with meyer lemon like tartness, smooth wheat and pale malt base sweetness, and a bit of mixed tropical fruit flavor (pineapple, mango). Mid-palate of strong, fresh pineapple, white pepper, oak, with acidic and tart lemon juice. Back of palate is acidic and tart, with clear lemon juice and apple cider vinegar tones. Lingering aftertaste of subtle pale malts with lightly acidic tartness.
Beer is medium-bodied, with medium to medium-low levels of carbonation. The result is a smooth, crisp beer from the acidity, where the carbonation does not get in the way. Finishes very dry, as expected from the style. 2,251 charactersfalloutsnow, Nov 09, 2012

Pours a lightly hazed golden straw color with a thin layering of white head resting on top. Fades into a collar of retained film, leaving some spotty lacing on the glass. 
Incredible nose jam-packed with heavy funk and bright, effervescent tartness. Grass, hay and funky yeast punctuated by green apple and lemon peel. I could literally sit and smell this beer for an hour - it took me nearly 5 minutes just to take a sip. 
Bright acidic tartness hits the tongue immediately with lemon peel and green apple. Formidable funkiness with yeast, hay and barnyard. Straw and grass with continuing sourness throughout the whole profile. Dry and bubbly on the tongue, finishing with strong, lingering sour flavor. 
Medium body, well carbonated, dry and lasting on the tongue. This really takes the typical 3F Oude Gueuze (which is already a great beer) to a new level, adding depth of flavor driven by a phenomenal nose. 960 charactersxnicknj, Nov 06, 2012

Look. Pours a golden yellowish orange color with a 1/2 inch fluffy head and exceptional retention. The beers is highly carbonated and the cork actual hit my ceiling when opened
Smell. Upfront is a lactic sourness followed up by some lemon, hay, and oak
Taste: upfront is some lemon tartness backed up by some toasted oak wet grass and some more sour citrus
Mouthfeel. Light in body and ample carbonation and a puckering sourness
Overall. I enjoyed with one quite a bit and actually purchased a few for myself. Highly recommended. 572 charactersDarthKostrizer, Nov 04, 2012

Bottle to Pinot Glass
375ml
Lot Number: 02/17/11
Purchased from City Beer Store in SF for 22.99
The cork & cage shot out like a cannon!!!! Be warned
App- When the foam settled on this one it was more of a dark and ruddy orange with a bit of highlighted yellows around the edges. The orange stuck out a lot and the center was a good bit of a thicker look to it. The edges were a bit lighter and then left a nice bit of cling.
Smell- Well it was a gueuze. It had the oak mixed in. It was pretty much what I thought it would be, but just a bit thicker. A bit malty for me with a good matching amount of grass and barn aromas.
Taste- This was a very good beer. I wish I couldve went 5 but it was a bit too thick for me against the style. It was not Lente but it was damn close. The dryness of the style matched against the earthy herbalness created a great depth of flavor and left me wanthing more. I am a litle sad this wasnt a 750, but I think the $$ wouldve driven me away from it.
Mouth- For a gueuze it is a bit thick but this is a nice medium body with a fulll medium carbonation. The residual flavors are of earthy grass with a good amount of barnyard funk and a bit of oak behind it.
Drink- I really enjoyed this beer. It had so much layering and so much great depth of flavor behind it. The dryness paired with the earthy barnyard just made this really tasty. Served at cellar temp I fear it was a bit too warm. Next time a bit colder. 1,467 charactersFosterJM, Nov 04, 2012

Taste- Way more sour punch than I was expecting. Very dry finish as well, leaves you wanting another sip right away. Big lemony tartness and a bit of oak are in there as well.
Mouthfeel- lively carbonation and light body, nice and refreshing
Overall- An excellent beer, but I'm not sure if it's worth the price tag. I can't fault it for anything really, but I just don't think it is worth breaking the bank over. There are plenty of other great guezes out there that are very good and cost much less than this one. That said, if you have the means to stock up on this stuff, I'd go ahead and do that. I'm looking forward to trying my second bottle a few years down the road. 874 charactersmahak213, Oct 31, 2012

4.27/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark, golden orange color with a medium white head that goes down slowly. Scent is oh so funky...which is expected from a 3F beer. Not nearly as funky as some of the Krieks I've had from them, but more of a pleasant, non-stinky sock type funk. More barnyard and hay than anything. Great funky with some acidic aromas. Also get some peach and apricot in the nose, maybe a bit of grass as well. What a great-smelling beer. Taste is just as good. Great funky/sour flavors with some grass and hay. Some stone fruit flavors, but very subdued. This beer is sour, but not as sour as I was expecting. Maybe even a little less sour than the regular Gueuze from 3F. Not too acidic, and quite dry on the finish. A very well-crafted gueuze IMO. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, puckering, and dry. Drinkability is VERY high...could sip on this all day. Overall, this is a fantastic beer, but not sure if it's worth the price tag. It needs to make the normal offering from 3F feel shameful in order to charge double for this one, and it does not. I am just as happy with the Kriek and Gueuze. Glad I got to try it though. 1,111 charactersDovaliHops, Oct 29, 2012

Aroma is fantastic - great mix of oak, sour and funk that literally makes my mouth water - pretty much a perfect smell for a gueuze. So excited to drink this. Flavor follows the nose - it's always so tough to describe what distinguishes one gueuze from the next, but I'll do my best. I'll say, right out, this one is a great one though. The balance here is fantastic, it's got a nice blend of funk and sour and the oak mixes in very impressively. It's got some notes of lemons and apples too. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, but it's nicely mouth-coating. Overall, this is a top notch gueuze that has a lot going on and a fantastic balance of flavor. I feel like it tastes a bit like the regular 3F gueuze with the sour, funk and oak all more pronounced. 811 charactersstarrdogg, Oct 27, 2012

Deep saturated orange color, slight haze, steady trails of champagne carbonation. Initial head of billowing foam that threatened to overflow, but eventually subsides to a gentle skim across the surface. Not much lacing, odd as it was poured into a clean dry glass. 
Complex aroma of oak and citrus, hints at tropical fruitiness. The older lambic lends a pleasant rounded mellowness to the nose.
Extremely dry with a clean sourness, plenty of oak and more fruit in the bitter citrus peel vein. Very balanced with a rounded feel on the palate. Flavors are very much standard issue Drie Fonteinen, signature minerality and firm dry oak in addition to light citrus. This blend is a fun novelty to try, albeit a pricey one. At least it's going towards brewing on-site again, so it's easier on the conscience when dropping the coin to try it. 991 charactersemerge077, Oct 21, 2012

4.49/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It's often the delimma of a sour ale fan to achieve the exclusive taste of unblended lambic, but with gueuze like zest. Drie Fontienen answers the that question with this blend of four years of blends that culminate in exquisite earthiness and sharp complexities that are simply unparalleled.
The burnt orange hued beer pours with the carbonated creaminess that's expected from a well made gueuse. So if you are expecting a more still lambic stillness then expect a slight champagne livelihood. As the carbonation builds a creamy, cottony head, a swirl of the glass leaves traces of the Belgiany lace that we've come to expect. Solid retention accompanies the beer 'til the end of the glass. 
The bold sourness of the beer reveal the unadulterated scents of dried limes, lemons, crab apples, rhubarb, and citrus. But a deeply embedded grouping of aromatics reveal more earthen character: saddle leather, dusty woods, and cork all play into the scent that's both fragrant and pungent.
The decadent tastes start with the sweet and tawny interplay of white wine, cider, and dry wheat. Pile on the sourness of citrus, white wine vinegar, under ripened apples and berries and we have the majority of the taste. But then there's the earthy components of dried hay, sea brine, sandalwood, corkish wood, and chardonnay soaked oak that round out the taste. It's a fairly consistent beer as it traverses from it's initial impressions until its ultra-dry taste in finish.
But here's where the real secret of this beer separates from other world class gueuze: The fine carbonation resonates through a somewhat silky-sour note that's never been expected before. With no carbonic bite (as with champagne), the beer delivers a teeth-churning sensation that couples with the most delightful powdery-sour marriage that could ever be expected in a beer. It's simply magic what this beer does the the trigemental senses to the mouth.
Although the subtleties that this four-year blend gives is very well appreciated, I do think that this is not the beer for the uninitiated. Reserve this refined ale for those who are well versed in well made gueuze and lambics before opening- and be sure to have some steamed mussels and well aged gruyere on hand. 2,234 charactersBEERchitect, Oct 18, 2012

Upon loosening the cage, the cork came out with a loud pop. Lots of pressure but not a gusher at all. Pours a very hazy, dark golden orange color with tangerine edges and a two finger yellowish-beige head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Streaks of soapy lacing left behind. 
Musty, funky aroma with a strong barnyard presence along with lactic funk, citric acidity and light fruit. Earthy with lots of oak, cobweb, grass, wet hay and horsebkanket followed by lactic cheese, lemon juice and green apple. Smells very inviting but it seems like the four year old portion of the blend tones things down a bit. 
On the fuller end of medium bodied with tight carbonation and a tart, puckering flavor that lingers over the lactic funk, citrus, light fruit and pale malt into a crisp, dry finish. Aggressively sour at first but not harsh or overly acidic with lots of earthy oak, lactic funk and sweet citrus balancing things out. As it warms, the lactic cheesy presence stands out a bit more and the citrus acidity becomes a bit more tart. Earthy with toasted oak, grass and hay notes countered by lemon peel and green apple flavors. Funky and sour but well balanced and very quaffable and refreshing once the palate adjusts. I could drink gallons of this stuff if it wasn't so damn expensive. 1,325 characterscorby112, Oct 18, 2012

4.32/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to two very generous BAs, Jeffo and Alpineclimber, for getting me the two bottles of this beer. So nice to be able to cellar one of these expensive bottles for a while.
Poured into my gueuze glass with the big "3" on it.
Appearance. Pours a hazy, rich honey-gold with a little amber and a finger of frothy white head.
Smell. Tart lemon, some old wet wood and earthy, lightly sweet funk.
Taste. Lots of nice lightly bitter wood, dry earthy funk, and some lemon juice. 
Mouthfeel. Medium body, medium carbonation.
Overall. Another great gueuze. I've been lucky enough to have several lately and though this one doesn't stand out from the others as much as I would have hoped, it was a very delicious, well made brew. Thanks again to the great BAs that got me bottles of this. 786 charactersRutager, Oct 12, 2012
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottled February 17, 2011.
Beer is dark golden in colour with a medium-sized white head. Head recedes but never fully disappears: a large white rim remains.
Smell is funky, with real barnyard and horse blanket scents abounding. Lemon is prominent, and a bit of oak is there. Very nice. A classic gueuze smell and really enjoyable.
Taste is great. Quite funky, barnyard flavour, with tart lemon. Fairly sour. Crisp wheat flavours there as well. Finish is very dry.
Medium bodied, low to moderate carbonation. Tart, puckery- really dries the mouth.
Overall, really good. Really enjoyed this one. 598 charactersjrenihan, Oct 11, 2012
4.23/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle date: 2011/02/17
A: Pours an apricot color with one full finger of puffy white head. The foam takes a bit to settle, leaving some really nice lacing along the edges of the glass as it drinks.
S: The nose is lemon, salt, vinegar, grass, and other funks. It's sour, and it smells like a geuze. Who would have thought.
T: It starts off light and smooth on the palate, but less than a second later it's a big burst of sour lemon, salt, and bitters. It's drying and even a bit spicy in the middle. The finish is mild sweetness mixed with huge bitters.
M: Light bodied beer. It's not a hefty beer, but it is a definite palate wrecker. Dry in the middle, and super dry in the finish.
O: Really nice geuze, but I don't know if it's worth the extra money over the classic. I'm happy to have tried it, and I'd only really buy another bottle to throw in the cellar for awhile. 877 characterstrxxpaxxs, Oct 10, 2012
4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5pour is slightly hazed dark golden orange with a tight light tan head. The nose has tons of cheese, rather "rindy," and a light dusty funk behind. Golden fruits, apricot, pear, and peach. A light vinegar note underneath. The taste is slightly more muted than the nose, the funk isn't as bright but still an assertive cheese rind with more cob webby funk. The apricot and golden fruits are intertwined very well. The finish is dry and well carbonated, the body is light and bubbly on the tongue. 494 characterscpetrone84, Oct 09, 2012
4.38/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Side by side with the regular oude gueuze. Gold pour, very slight haze, white head. Aroma is quite woody, green pepper, oak, smells a bit old already. Regular 3F funk, taste is sour, woody, a tad dryer than the regular oude gueuze. Lots of bugs. Palate is effervescent with full body. I prefered it to the regular. Less sharp and citrus, more wood, bugs and refinement. Might not quite be worth it’s price but very good indeed. 429 charactersLuk13, Oct 09, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Golden colored beer that's a little bit orange in the right light. Small white head that fades to a partial cap and lives a ring around the sides.
S - Nice funk, barnyard, some citrus, touch of sweetness. Smells great.
T - Taste is very nice. There's a good dose of funk and horseblanket, bit more citrus sweetness than a lot of Gueuzes I've had before, but it's a nice change, somewhat tart. There's a lasting sourness on the end.
M - Active carbonation, slightly syrupy, lighter side of medium bodied.
O - Great beer, very much enjoyed it. More citrusy than a lot of high quality Gueuzes, but it doesn't get in the way of the great funk and barnyard taste. Would drink this regularly if given the chance. 714 charactersAgentZero, Oct 08, 2012

A: Pours a golden straw color with 3 fingers worth of quickly foaming head that settles down just as quickly as it came. Expected with the style
S: As expected, a good amount of barnyard funkiness, horse blanket, sourness, and light fruitiness
T: Plenty of funk, sourness, and oak. Layers of different flavors that all come from those nice little wild bugs. Every sip is something slightly different from the last
M: Light-medium bodied with the usual plentiful gueuze carbonation. The oak smooths it out a little, but it is still very carbonated
O: What an experience. This blend is really something special. The addition of the 4 year lambic puts this on a whole new level. It sucks that most of it evaporated, but what is left is a treat. Worth the price if only to try this once 954 charactersBEERMILER12, Oct 06, 2012

4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5What an amazing Gueuze by Drie Fonteinen, Armand really out did himself with this blend. An amazing crisp taste to it from the second the cork pops off till the last drop in your glass. Appearance is a deep golden yellow that captivates the viewer with bewilderment as it has the appearance of an elixir. The smell wakes up the nose with citrus notes with lemon and beyond. The taste bring additional citrus notes along with tart and sour notes of a gueuze all perfectly working together to create one hell of a brew. After the bottle was consumed, I thought back on what beer could top this in my list, and nothing could hold up to this. Seek this brew out as it is one of the best out there. Next time I would like to try it side by side with 3F normal Oude Gueuze. 767 charactersDaSolomon, Oct 05, 2012

4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5wow! as someone who has recently entered the world of sours, I must say this one is the champion for me. I have had almost all of the russian river contributions to the style as well as a host of other cantillon and readily available guezes/flemish beers. This might just be the best. tart, sour but not overly so, with a delicate little sweetness that bounces up and down like a child on a trampoline, diving back and forth across the palate in just a gentle and playful way. It has a certain zest and refreshing quality that I find to be unbelievable, with a complexity that to me is far and beyond traditional guezes. american wild ales certainly compete in terms of complexity but this just takes the cake. Wonderful mouth feel, the 4th year lambic certainly did a wonder to this brew and it more than justifies the price tag.
edit: while I still love the golden blend and I am staying true to my review, isabelle proximus, oude gueze 08 vintage and armand4' zomer all are better than this in my opinion. however, this one is not that difficult to acquire and should be consumed first before ascending the sour chain of command , if you are even lucky enough to get there. 1,177 charactersjsm1289, Oct 04, 2012
4.7/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 375 mL bottle poured into a Portsmouth Brewery tulip glass. Chilled just a touch before opening. 2012 vintage, bottled on Feb. 17th. After a couple of twists of the caged, the cork shot off with just a small bit gushing out. 
Appearance: Deep orange in color and clear throughout. Pours a fizzy, sticky white head that sticks nicely to the glass and recedes to a lacing around the edge.
Aroma: Lots of oak upfront. Some lemon rind and green apple skin as well. Loads of funk, horse blanket and earthy tones. Really interesting and well balanced. The four year old lambic adds a really interesting dimension. 
Taste: Bright sour lemon notes and green apple really stands out upfront. The tart notes are much stronger than the aroma suggest. Lots of barnyard funk notes as well. Some oak notes weave in and out as well.Some slight cheese character as well. Very balanced and interesting. Bright yet complex.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied and fully carbonated. Perfect and refreshing.
Overall, a really exceptional gueuze that delivers on the high price tag. The blend Armand has here is really interesting, complex and easy to drink. The four year lambic definitely gives an added element in terms of more funk and oak present. I am really enjoying this. 1,265 charactersGosox8787, Sep 28, 2012

A - Clear dark amber body. Tons of off white foam after the initial pour, settles down into a neat one finger high head with some large bubbles. Lots of rising carbonation. Great lacing and retention. I rarely give out 5's on appearance, but it just looks damn perfect.
S - Balance is the one word that comes to mind. Earthy brett funk, lemon rind, sour green apples, rubber bands, and oak barrel. Its all very intense and concentrated, but its just so well integrated.
T - More of that great balance. Earthy funk, cheese, vinegar, oak, sour lemons, and some light vanilla tannins. Incredibly complex and layered. This gueuze is beyond delicious. The finish is dry and abrupt with only a lingering lactic presence. Mouth feel is spritzy and well carbonated. 
O - Armand can blend some of the best gueuzes out there, and this one ranks right up there. I haven't had the opportunity to try the season beers, but the standard oude gueuze is my favorite beer and this totally beats it. That fourth year is a beautiful thing which makes the $30 hit seem worth it. 1,248 charactersdavey101, Sep 26, 2012

Thanks, Thorpe429!
Careful all, this cork is ready to explode out of the bottle once the cage has been undone.
Cloudy orange and light amber with a huge bone-white, moonscape head that makes pouring this beer somewhat of a challenge. Eventually, when the head has settled down, a nice off-white rin sits atop the beer all the way down, eventually leaving irregular lines of lace down the glass. A gorgeous beer, and perfectly appropriate.
A very expressive, funk-forward aroma: this has a good amount of old/wet towel notes, with big notes of barnyard and manure, earthy cheese, mushrooms, along with some bright lemon citrus, and an acidic sour character. On paper, that sounds awful (or not), but it smells amazing.
The flavor is simply stupendous, with the incredibly funk/barnyard/earth/cheese notes bumping up aggressively against layers of lemon flesh and peel, sour character, brick, and basement. Complete; flawless. 
The mouthfeel shines. It's as good of a mouthfeel as any gueuze I've had the pleasure of drinking. Light in body, with high carbonation, though disappearing, but flavorful throughout.
This ranks with the Armand'4 beers has some of my favorites ever crafted. 1,223 charactersehammond1, Sep 23, 2012

Pale copper in color, medium clarity, gigantic dense white head and cascading miniscule bubbles. Beautiful beer as usual from Drie Fonteinen.
S: Very unique smell for a gueuze. Huge earthy mushroom notes, wet wood, wool, herbal, soapy, very deep. What sets this apart from other gueuze is the distinct lack of lemony acidity.
T: The best word I can think of to describe this beer is 'refined'. It lacks the sharp acidity I generally associate with gueuze, especially those from Cantillon. Layer upon layer of earthy/herbal/damp brett character wrapped in a soft but tenacious lactic twang. It has a certain sweetness on the palate with a long barrely finish. Very unique, awesome.
M: Titanic carbonation and very soft mouthfeel. Extremely refreshing.
This is probably the most expensive bottle of beer per milliliter I've ever had. $20 for 330ml is pretty ridiculous but this is a very delicious and unique beer. 1,003 charactersmattsander, Sep 17, 2012

4.3/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Incredible Geuze Armand really hit the nail on the head with this beer.
Pour-Opening the bottle you get that huge champagne pop sound without of the overflow of that expensive goodness. It comes out with a golden look to it and a medium size foam head on it. You hear that carbonation working away.
Smell-Typical great geuze smell of citrus, lemon, barnyard funk and spices as well sweaty socks. The aroma is just incredible.
Taste-The best part you instantly get that smooth flavor of lemon and citrus with a little bit of spice to it. It's followed by kick in the ass sour tartness that I love. The 4th year really adds to that sour tartness note which is great.
Mouthfeel-Has a crisp light taste on the mouth much like nice champagne. 
Incredible beer I just wish it wasn't so goddamn expensive. 803 charactersSalMineo, Sep 13, 2012

A: pours a nice slightly hazy golden orange with two finger of white head that dissapates slowly , no lacing to speak of. A nice film stays through out.
S: nice blend of sour funk and oak, light straw, green apple and lemon, nice aroma, smells well balanced. Doesn't smell quite as sour as I had hoped. The big difference I notice between this and the regular blend is that it smells a little more oaky and rounded, the sourness seems a tad more subtle 
T: yum, nice balance of sour tartness ad oak, lemon tartness with a touch of straw/grass, some light green apple notes come through. Very well balanced between the oak and the sourness.
M: refreshing and nicley drinkable, with a light medium body and creamy effervescent carbonation, a touch dry with a hint of bitter oak on the finish, finishes mostly clean and dry though. The biggest difference here is there seems to be a good bit more effervescent carbonation then the regular blend. To the point where the cork literally blew off the bottle as soon as I took the cage off and scared the shit out of my cat
O: a very nice gueze, displaying a very nice blend that balances notes of oak and sour funk beautifully, really enjoy this one. Not overly sour, kinda just right, maybe a touch more tartness and I'd be in love. Overall not much different them the original
Blend, minus the effervescence and slightly more rounded oak notes, considering the price difference I'm glad to have tried it but I'm just as pleased with the original. 1,558 charactersPeterIngemi, Aug 29, 2012

Aromas begin with some funky minerality and an earthy mushroom-like character. Then you get some musty wood, very tart lemons. As it warms you get some nice wheat and yeast notes, as well as quite a some more emerging barnyard funk.
First impression in the flavor is super strong earthiness and musty oak. Straight from the barnyard here. There's some light acidity and a bit of leather and very light lemon. The acidity and funk flow right into one another. 
The mouthfeel is light-medium bodied with medium-high carbonation. Finish is dry quite heavy on the funk and earth. 
Overall this was a nice treat sampled amongst the other sour beers of the evening. Although the aroma delivered slightly more than the flavor, it was still quite above average. Everything about the aromas and flavors helps to deliver the maxim amount of funk. 1,003 charactersclaspada, Aug 15, 2012

Pours golden yellow, white head, thin collar on top. A nice mix of funk cheese, citrus, and must. There's a light fruity sweetness to this beer that really contributes to me liking it. Taste is a litte more sweet, nice citrus zest, funky, mother-puckering tartness. Dry and oaky, reminds me of a Chardonnay in some aspects.
Really excellent blend that is one of my favorite beers from Armand. Need to pick up some more, actually. 494 charactersSean9689, Aug 14, 2012

Pours a clear golden amber with a surprisingly big beige head that sticks around with an abundance of bubbles feeding the bottom.
Aroma is earthy grasses and barnyard funk with some lemon zest and other citrus notes. Plenty of oak and there is just a light mustiness to the whole thing.
Really earthy and musty up front with the citrus kicking in through the middle. The finish is very dry and crisp. There is also a bit of mineral character in the taste as well as oak and a light acidity.
Mouthfeel is light and very active on the palate with strong carbonation.
Another fantastic blend from Armand. Can't wait to see how this one develops. I wouldn't put it up there with Blauw or Lente, but it's still a superb sour. 754 charactersgford217, Aug 08, 2012

Served in a flute. 
Looks gorgeous. Dark golden body with a HUGE rocky mass of a head. The head is yellow-hued off-white, like aged ivory merengue. (if such a thing existed)
Smells hugely oaky with notes of leather and earth. Not overly funky, though funkier than the average 3F gueuze-- the oak owns this thing. Some light lemony notes find their way through to brighten things up. The flavor improves upon the nose with a perfect balance of of dry sourness, oakiness, funk, and tartness. 
Feels effervescent and fizzy-- but in a good way. Perhaps slightly overcarbonated. 
Overall-- a VERY nice blend. Armand is the absolute master. He makes some amazing blends. 716 charactersAleWatcher, Jul 27, 2012

S: Earthy, woody sourness. Lots of oak, nice raspberry and mango sweetness underneath. Rich funk in the sourness.
T: Very fruity. Strawberry, bitter seed, blackberry skin, oak, lemon, lactic and wheat notes, ghost of vinegar. Strong but balanced tartness becomes earthy and wet as it warms.
M: Slight carbonation, a little more than light-bodied. Less carbonated than the Armand'4s.

Appearance - Darker than 3F Oude Geuze. Big head, no retention. Surprising. Faint, discrete bubbles.
Smell - Citrusy. Lemon and orange. It's more prominent than the funk. Deep earthy, but not overwhelming cheese aroma behind it.
Smell - Extremely citrusy, which I didn't expect. Orange and lemon behind it. Less funk than the smell, but still an earthy oaky funk. Light body and very dry in the finish.
Mouthfeel - Light and very carbonated. Effervescent and dry. Sour, but not overly so.
Overall - Excellent, maybe not better than regular Oude Geuze. I might even say it's monotonic in it's citric notes. 687 charactersAlieniloquium, Jul 20, 2012

Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass. 
Lot number: 17/02/2011
Best Before: Feb 2021
Appearance: Golden blend certainly seems to be an appropriate name for this beer, as it pours a lightly hazed, but bright golden-orange. A rough pour yields a large, white head that lasts acceptably well for the style and leaves a few patches of lace on the way down. 
Smell: Mmmm, I could smell the funk as soon as the cork was popped - it has been way too long since I had a good geuze. Notes include: Dusty sacks, old dry leaves, oak, periodic bursts of funky cheese, old books, earthy mushrooms, orange peel, old wood and lemon. It actually smells quite acidic. 
Taste: The flavour is not quite as full as the nose, but is still top class. As expected, it is quite tart (lightly puckering) and very dry. Flavour notes include: Musty basement, dry leaves, dust, dry thatch, old wood, lemon and a touch of white grapes. 
Mouthfeel: Light-medium bodied, with a super high level of carbonation. The carbonation is initially a little too much for me, however things settle down sufficiently midway through the bottle. 
Overall: Another delicious geuze from Drie Fonteinen - it would seem as if Armand can do no wrong with his new releases! I wish I had bought more than this one bottle! 1,310 charactersThehuntmaster, Jul 18, 2012

Put on your safety glasses; the cork will explode out of the bottle. Pours cloudy orange/amber color with a huge white head. Intense funkiness as you would expect from Drie Fonteinen. Lots of must, oak, lemon zest, earth, and mineral. Soft tartness to it. The tartness is there in the form of lemon and green apple, but the funk is where this beer really shines. Lots of earth, must, mineral, and sweat to be had. Really awesome stuff! 461 characterswomencantsail, Jul 16, 2012

This was probably one of the better brews that we had during the night. A really well balanced brew all around that wasn’t overly full of pucker power and more on the funky and citrus side which was a very nice change. An absolute must try if you call yourself a sour-head. 839 charactersthagr81us, Jul 10, 2012

Pours a slightly murky honey orange with a foamy orange-white head that settles to a small cap on top of the beer. Foamy swaths of lace cling to the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some wood and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with a woody aftertaste. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp but somewhat dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a great beer that is tasty and very easy to drink. 540 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jul 01, 2012

Aroma is similar to the oude gueuze, but more fruity and citric, and a bit less funky. Some lemon, apple, hay, a bit of oak. Really nice.
Taste follows the aroma really well. A lot of citrus flavors, apple, and hay. Slight mineral aftertaste. Once again, excellent.
Mouthfeel is wonderful. Dry, light, decent carbonation, really superb. Very smooth.
The oude gueuze was really good, but this is just a different level. Really tasty, light, and supremely drinkable. A wonderful offering from 3 fonteinen, I can't wait to try the armand'4. 660 charactersrodkin, Jun 28, 2012

4.38/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a nice hazy orange copper color with hints of amber and apricot. A nice white head sits atop the beer, about 2 finges high, that recedes quickly but leaves a nice bit of film behind, but no lacing. The nose is a bit weaker than I anticipated but imparts some great aromas, notes of tart apples, faint citrus, funky yeast and hay, with a bit of wood at the end. The balance is great, every elements gets a chance to shine, it's just unfortunate that they aren't more powerful. The flavors jump out a bit more, much to my delight, nice funky yeast right off the bat, hay, stronger oak presence with great complimentary citrus notes. What I really like about this beer is the subtle fruit and berry notes that tickle the tongue so gently, could be apricots, strawberries or perhaps peach flesh. The body is spot on, nice and effervescent, dry and tart but the finish is so smooth, a bit more so than the original recipe.
Verdict: This is another knock out from Armand at Drie Fonteinen. I can't really say that the addition of the 4 year old lambic really took this beer to a new height, but it did come off as slightly different than the regular blend. The bottom line is, this is a fine beer that everyone should seek out and enjoy. 1,247 characterskevanb, Jun 20, 2012

Unlike some other reviews, there's no explosion when I remove the cage, just a gentle pop. The beer itself is mildly hazy, orange in color and capped with a beautiful, thick, creamy, long-lasting off-white head that leaves nice lacing. The nose is rather excellent. Woodier and chewier than your usual Drie Fonteinen gueuze, it seems closer in spirit to a Boon Oude Gueuze, and I'm guessing that's the contribution of the 4 year old lambic. Apart from that, it does have a very nice citrus/grapefruit sourness and brightness, a pronounced earthy funk with wet hay and petrichor. Quite juicy too, and swirled vigorously, there's a pungency that seems mildly solvent-like (but NOT acetone or acetic esters)
The palate opens with a pronounced woody sourness, lactic in nature with quite a bit of grapefruit brightness, sourness and bite. I would argue that the sourness is a little rough around the edges. In addition, there's a nice blend of fruity citrus, less earthy funk than on the nose, and flavors of horseblanket, wet hay, and earth. Drying, mildly bitter and a little herbal on the finish, with what is (I swear) a faint faint faint acetic character - not much, just a tinge. Moderately woody with a little vanilla as well. The sourness does seem a little harsh and unusually harsh, and the carbonation while high, doesn't seem to be particularly well integrated with the flavor profile. A good blend, though it does seem just a little disjointed. The 4 year old lambic does bring to mind Blauw, especially with its woodier aroma and flavor notes, but it just isn't as well-integrated or harmonious. Maybe some time will change that? At the price, though, it's hard to justify a detailed experiment. 1,752 charactersDefenCorps, Jun 14, 2012

Corked explodes out. Super carbonated 4 finger head that collapses slowly. Slightly cloudy orange goldenrod. Lacing is patchy and spotty with excellent stick. Nice. 
Nose is spritzy. Lemon tartness, woody, with some mild cheesiness stuffed in the back. Sharp sourness as it warms. Solid.
Opens super sour. Lemon, hay, cobwebs, and oak. Funky and spritzy throughout with a nice cleanliness. Finishes dry and puckering with some more lemon and oak. Good complexity with a nice clean development of flavors. 
Light bodied with strong carbonation. Bubbly and effervescent in the mouth and clean and dry going down. Finishes dry with a lingering, sticky aftertaste. As with almost all their geuze, near perfection!
A really solid beer that suffers a bit from its pedigree. Great flavor and complexity with an excellent mouthfeel but this one doesn't really stand out from other Drie Fonteinen offerings. Still, its excellent and very much worth aging. 1,074 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jun 06, 2012

The beer pours a yellow color with a large white head. The aroma is full of very tart lemons, with some nice wheat and yeast notes, as well as quite a bit of barnyard funk. The flavor is also quite funky, with some nice lemon and wheat notes. There is a medium amount of tartness and some nice yeast notes. Thin mouthfeel and medium carbonation.

Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden amber color with a finger of fluffy white head that fades to a ring around the edge of the glass.
Smell: Nice bland of tart and funky. Lemon juice sourness. Very light and nice.
Taste: This one is on the sweeter side. Lemon tartness and a mild funk notes. The citrus juice sourness sticks with you all through the sip.

There is also a light earthiness as well as a mineral note. The taste is quite tart with oak, lots of grapefruit, some lemon, a hint of green apple. It has a light sweetness to it. The finish is earthy and funky. Medium body. Medium-high carbonation, but not as high as I would have expected with how the cork came out. Another great blend from Armand.

The beer is orange in color with just a slight haze about it. Ample carbonation present and a gargantuan head with seemingly everlasting retention and copious lacing. I just wish yourefragile hadn't absconded with my 3F tumbler, as this would have been a perfect occasion for it. Alas...
Wow, what an aroma. World class lambic anyone? Hay, barn, grass, citrus, funk. Whoa. The citrus quality is remarkable.
Balance, flavor, bold, smooth, inviting, intriguing, exceptional, delicious. I could go on. This is on a level with Blauw. Stunning and phenomenal. Stock up on this brew while you have the chance. My highest recommendation. Ya, it's "that good". 798 charactersHuhzubendah, May 03, 2012

S- Lots of citrus and rind, also a nice musty, hay aroma.
T- Lots of complex yeast funk flavor, hay, horse-blanket, citric flavor has lemon rind and also some crispy apple towards the end, oak wood flavor helps to blunt the acidity, the tartness on the Golden Blend seems smoother than on the regular gueuze.

a - Pours a very clear golden color with two inches of bright white head and moderate carbonation. A beautiful looking gueuze.
s - Smells of that classic Drie Fonteinen barnyard funk, oak, sour fruits, earthy notes.
t - Tastes of funk, lemon, sour fruits, citrus, hay, earthy notes, bready notes, spice, and Belgian yeast.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Crisp and dry, easy to drink. Great mouthfeel.
o - Overall I thought this was an amazing gueuze; another winner from Drie Fonteinen. Super funky and some nice sourness, and easy to drink. Up there with their Armand series and Oude Gueuze Vintage as some of my favorite available gueuzes. Glad I have a bottle of this and will be looking to buy more. 768 charactersmdfb79, Apr 20, 2012

From a 375ml into mini flute 
Note: Drunk this right after the regular Oude Gueuze, so some comparisons will be drawn. 
APPEARANCE: Pours a big white head that quickly fades to a foam cap. Clear golden yellow in color with high levels of vibrant carbonation. A bubbly ring remains until the end and leaves some foamy lacing down the glass. Looks the same as the regular gueuze. 
SMELL: Relatively mild on the nose. Some hay, funky aromas and some definite floral notes. Less acidity and more mild than the regular gueuze. 
TASTE: Bolder flavors than the nose had advertised. Hay, funk, and some nice lemon flavors. More sourness for sure, as you’d expect with older lambic, and some oak flavors again. Bigger and lingering aftertaste is funky with oak notes and more lemon sourness than the regular gueuze. A touch of bitter floral notes linger and offer balance as well. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Light on the palate, goes down fine and finishes slightly sticky. A touch lighter than the regular gueuze, but still smooth with proper levels of carbonation. 
OVERALL: It was certainly interesting to try the regular Oude Gueuze next to this one. The inclusion of 4 year old lambic has made it more sour in flavor, but a touch lighter in the feel. This one was quite nice and the bold and assertive flavors made it quite easy to enjoy. Would gladly drink again. Thanks again for sharing guys! 1,625 charactersJeffo, Apr 05, 2012

Orange-amber colored body with a chunky four finger head, which eventually settles to a lasting crust.
A very musty, mineral, dry aroma. Mushroom and oak, grapefruit, earthiness and barnyard, a hint of spearmint. Smells quite good, leaning a bit more toward the earthy side than the standard 3F gueuze, with a strong citrus component behind it.
Grapefruit comes through more on the palate. There's a big earthy oak character that's probably coming from the 4 year lambic, but acidity is gentle and primarily lactic. It's faintly minty and herbal, mineral, citrusy on the mid-palate. The finish seems to be lacking slightly - it drops off quite a bit after the initial blast of funk, oak and acid, ending somewhat thin. Odd considering the large component of 4 year lambic. It's definitely a great beer, but I wouldn't take it over most of the 3F vintage gueuze blends or Armand 4s. 899 characterslargadeer, Apr 04, 2012

A: Crystal clear golden-amber body with lots of lively effervescence rising to sustain a finger of fine, soft off-white head. Some nice lace. Stunning.
S: Fairly restrained, balanced, zesty aroma of grass, lemon, flowers, and green apples. Amazingly fresh, vibrant, and appealing. I'd like more funk, but this is great, too.
T: Opens with a nice balance of malt and fruity acidity, with lemon pulp giving way to some more generic tropical citrus notes midway through. A bit of flinty earthiness gives depth, but is well in the background. Some almost sweet, juicy fruitiness toward the finish. Dry, tart aftertaste. If I hadn't just had Lente, this would probably be a 5.
M: Soft, creamy, nicely carbonated medium body. Great.
O: Considering that it has 4-year-old Lambic, this tasted rather young - but in a delicious, vibrant, zesty way. I can't wait to see what it does with more time. It's entirely different from the two Armand'4s that we drank before it (Winter and Lente), but it's definitely in the same class.

4.37/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a tulip. 2011 vintage, which is given a 10 year lifespan.
4.0 A: Lots of carbonation in this. The cork started moving as soon as I started twisting the cage. It took more than a few pours to fill the glass up due to the plentiful head. Well hazed (probably from the many pours) light orange brown color. Big frothy white head. Good retention and plentiful lacing.
4.5 S: Lots of fruity funk in this. Plenty of apple with lemon backing it up. Lots of farm aromas in this - apple orchard, dry wood from a barn, hay, livestock. Mildly cheesy and minor musty notes. Not very sour smelling, but plenty of tangy lactic acid giving it the pleasant fruitiness.
4.5 T: Like the nose, this is very fruity and funky. Apple is all through this. Light lemon zestiness underneath. Super woody, but not all from the oak. More like dry, dusty planks of wood. Slightly metallic. Light, though appreciated, cheesiness. Load of lactic acid and perhaps a touch of acetic as well. Less "barny" than the nose suggested, but much more earthy. Wet grass, apple orchard, rotting wood, and must.
3.5 M: Normally I'd probably give this at least a 4.0, but I'm pretty sure the Armand'4s have spoiled just about every other gueuze's mouthfeel for me. Very active, spritzy carbonation. Good there, but missing the creaminess that the seasons gave me.
4.5 D: Very tasty, super complex gueuze. I'm more than happy that I purchased a few more. 1,427 charactersDavoleBomb, Apr 01, 2012

Aroma: Very funky with old cobweb musk and wet basement. Lots of fruits. Grapes, lemons, melons, and others. Oaky. Wet horse-blanket. Very nice.
Taste: Very sour and funky. Fruity, but old. Lemon citrus, musky basement, cobweb, horseblanket, and melons. Oaky. This beer has a lot going on.
Mouthfeel: Sour and funky. Mouth puckering, but within reason. Light bodied with a higher amount of carbonation. Ends clean.
Overall, really solid. This beer is incredibly drinkable and very complex. It is up there with the other 3F gueuzes.

4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5375ml bottle into a matching Drie Fonteinen stemmed glass. As other's have stated, this one opens up with excitement. A loud pop and out comes the cork seemingly effortlessly. A careful pour yields a mildly hazed golden colored brew with a rich 4 fingers of frothy white head composed of rather large bubbles. The etching on the bottom of the glass causes a disturbance that releases an endless stream of bubbles to the surface in support of the head. Some patches of lace stick to the glass as the solution evaporates in my glass.
The aroma is very rich and inviting. It needs to open up and breath a bit as straight out of the gate the release of carbonation mutes the aroma a bit. But as it breathes, it really showcases barnyard qualities, cob webs, straw/hay, leather and under all of that funk is some citrus to fruity elements. Some wet old oak barrel that is mildly musty/moist is also evident that increases in character as it gets warmer.
The taste includes some carbonic quality initially that gets in the way a bit. As it breathes and the glass is swirled, it opens up and gets significantly more enjoyable. The taste has a bit of rindy bitterness that includes some citrus notes minorly like lemon zest before driving into a flavor of old musty oak and barnyard. Some straw/hay-like grain inclusion is present and when focused on really brings out that fruity appeal about this brew. There is a lot of standard oude geuze quality going on in this except with a slightly elevated bitterness, mustiness and barnyard/hay flavoring without much acidity. I can't get over how well the flavors of this blend together in a very unique way. It is rindy almost like grapefruit and pulp but effortless transitions into bold barnyard funk and musty barrel quality with a hint of lacto and stinky cheese aftertaste.
This is a light bodied brew with an elevated level of carbonation that is very active throughout the experience. The alcohol is very well integrated and this brew finishes crisp, refreshing and super easy drinking. I would have no problems finishing a 750ml bottle of this by myself if it was made available to me. My only gripe is the bit of metallic/carbonic nature about this brew. Maybe that will fade a bit with time.. we will see if I can resist drinking the other bottles I have. If you are a fan of geuze, this is another Armand must-try. 2,366 charactersstakem, Mar 29, 2012

A - Pretty carbonated, with a big white foam that settles to a thick cap and fingers of lace - not a gusher thankfully. Hazed orange-gold body that's a a few shades darker than your standard 3F Gueuze.
S - Huge musky funk, with some nice acetic notes, stone fruits, touch of lemon, and an odd salt and mineral Play-Do note in there as well. Very intense and very impressive - better than 4.5, but not quite 5.0-worthy.
S - The taste is nearly as good, with a very enjoyable collection of stone fruits, lemons and other citrus, lactic sourness and acidity, and perhaps a touch of oak. Significantly less funky and more sour than the aroma.
M - Smooth medium body, juicy, super dry, with moderate lingering acidity. Carbonation is initially lively, but quickly sizzles away to a more enjoyable lower level.
D - A great gueuze from a master blender. Well worth the price tag, and arguably better than some of the Armand'4 series gueuzes. It'd be very easy (and expensive) to drink multiple bottles of this in an evening. 1,133 charactersMasterSki, Mar 28, 2012

Pours a cloudy orange golden color with a massive foamy cream head. Head fades quickly though to a thin layer with spotty clumps of lace. As fast as the cork explodes, the aroma hits you as well; strong mineral, funk and barnyard must blending with surprising fruit sweetness. Flavor is remarkably complex, yet balanced this young. Starts with an immediate citrus rind and lemon sweetness on the front of the palate. Earthy and mineral funk quickly join mid palate with some light acidity trailing. Finish is pleasantly dry, tart, grassy and earthy. Very smooth transition from fruit and sweet to funk to earth. Soft, medium light body with effervescent carbonation and a clean finish. So, this is pretty great fresh and should develop nicely. I'd recommend buying 3 or 20 to age. 901 charactersyourefragile, Mar 28, 2012

Bottle from a very generous Tim, thanks! Holy shit these are explosive. Tim cracked a few bottles yesterday and the corks flew out as soon as the cages came off. Same thing happened with this bottle. Make sure to have a glass at hand so you don't lose any of this.
A: Hazy yellow gold with three fingers of fast fading mousse-like beige froth. Lacing is scattered.
S: Mushroom and blue cheese ride a wave of earth. Barnyard notes are substantial. Oak mingles with damp forest floor. Lemon is pronounced and I detect light apple notes with some leather. Strong earthy characteristics are accompanied by a subtle mineral note.
T: Lemon with a sharp citric acidity and a low acetic acidity. Brackish and tart, with lemon being prominent throughout. This is very earthy and there's a light mineral note. I detect a hint of grapefruit and just a little apple. Oak is faint. The tartness is mouthwatering. The beer has an upper moderate lactic sourness with a dry, tannic finish.
M: Lower medium body with high carbonation.
Overall: A really nice blend. It has a lot of depth for how young it is. 1,106 charactersHopHead84, Mar 26, 2012

Served in a 3F Geuze glass (as it should be)
Bottled: 17/2/2011
Best before: 2/2021
A: EXPLOSIVE POP! This beer was so excited for me to try it that it couldn't help but rocket launch the cork off the top as soon as I twisted the cage far enough. So, be careful and make sure you let it sit for a bit before opening. Hazy, medium golden orange. 4+ (big, bubbly white) fingernail head, that dissipates to almost nothing fairly quickly, on soft pour.
S: Smells like a farm (in the best way possible) on a warm summer day - dry barnyard funk, cracked hay, and must. Touch of fruit, soft oak, and more funk. Open-arms inviting!
T: Lots going on here. Upfront lemon rind and citrus are combined with smooth tartness (touch of green apple) followed by immediate funk. Middle to back includes mild (fruit) sweetness right before the classic gueuze sourness. Just as the sour fades there is a touch of very distinct, robust earthiness that rounds out this masterpiece wonderfully. Bravo!
M: Medium body with loads of carbonation. Prickly on the tongue, but in such a good way. So easy to drink my glass was empty too fast.
O: All-around this beer is beautifully blended and put together! I can definitely understand, support, and appreciate the name and think/hope this will only develop into another superb gueuze as it grows older. Considering how young it is at the moment, I was very impressed. I do think it needs a bit of age before reaching its peak, but it drinks amazingly well for where it is right now. Well done (again) Armand on a beer that will fill my cellar and make me smile for many years to come! 1,625 charactersspdyfire83, Mar 24, 2012
4.85/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle from overseas. Served in a Drie Fonteinen "3" gueuze tumbler side-by-side with Drie Fonteinen Oude Geuze bottled on November 18, 2010. The Golden Blend was bottled on February 17, 2011.
The cork started to pop out right after I started to release the cage. It's not a gusher, but this thing has plenty of carbonation. The pour was difficult, to say the least. Loads of foam leading to a very rocky, dense head that leaves behind a nice bit of lacing. Thin cap throughout.
The nose brings an incredible amount of funk and is reminiscent of the Armand'4 Herfst and Winter. This is what I love. There some minerality and an earthy mushroom-like character, coming close to a light bit of truffle. Some sweat and goatiness comes along after that. Some backing acidity comes through, leading into the flavor.
First impression in the flavor is sweaty horse blanket mixed with some strong earthiness. Straight from the ground here. There's some acidity and must that really longer. A bit of leather and very light oak. This is an absolutely gorgeous beer. The acidity and funk flow right into one another. Simply sublime.
The body is light, bordering on light-medium. Pod carbonation and a mild acidity. Heavy funk and earth at every turn. Spritzer-like carbonation. Everything about the body helps to deliver the maxim amount of funk.
What can I say about this? Armand has simply nailed it once again. Breathtaking. I love it. 1,431 charactersThorpe429, Mar 22, 2012
4.13/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pour is a challenge into my 3F Gueuze glass, taking several pours to empty the bottle. Pretty standard whitish gueuze head with big bubbles and an orangey-golden color. The nose is relatively funky and a bit fruity, like a hint of sour apple. A bit reserved. Taste is very similar to Oude Gueuze but with a bit more earthiness and age wrapped in. There is a bit of mineral that is slightly off, but otherwise it is a mildly funky brew. Carbonation is high with a medium body. Goes down really easily. Overall, I was really excited to try this beer. I would take Cantillon Classic/Bio over this, but it is still really good. 623 charactersseeswo, Mar 21, 2012
4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Be careful with the pour on this one. Lots of head rising quickly, took 3 separate pours to get it in my glass which means the yeast might end up getting mixed in (not that its necessarily a bad thing)
I could go into detail about the aroma and the flavor and name off a dozen different complexities, but let's be honest....this is just a 3 Fonteinen Oude Geuze (albeit a unique one) so most of the descriptors will carry over. So read my description of that beer if you feel the need (and if you are reading reviews for this beer, I doubt you will feel the need)
What really matters is how this compares to a standard blend and what my overall impression is. Well, I am happy to report that this is among the best couple handfuls of 3 Fonteinen I have had. Very reminiscent of 2002 Vintage if my memory serves me correctly (which it might not). Very balanced between sour and earthy characteristics and supremely easy drinking. A perfect every-day beer prohibited by price and availability. The 4 year lambic used in this blend worked wonders helping round off sharp edges that exist in certain batches.
A very worthwhile beer, and one that I will snatch up at a $20 price point once it hits the US shelves. More than $20 and I will seriously have to reconsider. 1,266 charactersalcstradamus, Mar 21, 2012

4.83/5  rDev +7.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Fewa for shipping this one so quickly to me. Because I have an important sour tasting coming up soon, I wanted to make sure this beer is worthy to be served there and did a pre-tasting.
Look: Orange-golden color with a nice very large white-yellow head.
Smell: Sour fruits, musty, hay, and the typical barnyard funk.
Taste: Very complex and balanced. The taste is surprisingly less sour than I expected, but increases in the aftertaste. Next to the sourness, this beer is slightly fruity, has clear wooden oak tones and a nice bitterness (especially for a geuze) in the end.
Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation and full bodied for the style. Very smooth.
Overall: This is another magnificent winner by Armand! I start to wonder if there will ever be a day that Armand will not deliver. This man is unique and proves to time after time to be the best blender in the world! What a delicate geuze! 907 charactersrvdoorn, Mar 14, 2012
