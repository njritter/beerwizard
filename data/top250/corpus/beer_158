A bit flat, as it was filled a week ago, but still with decent carb and a small head that left laces. Hazy but not turbid and an acorn squash color. Bright aromas of blueberry, pine, and herbal notes. The taste was as billed with prominent blueberry and stone fruit. Also a nice dank undercurrent with a restrained bready malt presence. The bitterness is there but slowly builds to the finish. Alcohol is well-hidden. One of the softest, fruitiest DIPAs I've had. 499 charactersBuck89, Mar 16, 2017

A - Golden wheat colored platform hides carbonation in plain site. A loose knit froth caps the pour, cumulus pillowy evidence clings to the glass.
S - Straight from the tropics, Mosaic hop on full parade, guava, papaya, pineapple, tangerine. a bit of mint and green tea as well.
T - Wonderful malt base, fresh baguette, covered in apricot preserves. very little bitterness. With a quick rise in temperature an earthiness develops, again a bit of mint, fresh cut grass hides in there. 
M - Near perfect feel, no edges on this, body is medium in heft, dances across the palate in long luxurious graceful strides. The finish has just the right touch of tropics and hint of rine act as the bitterness.
O - A wonderfully executed offering, the fullness of the body, and incredibly delicate palate are remarkable. Carbonation adds just the right amount of energy to nudge things forward. The total package with his offering. This may well be one of my favorite IPA from Hill Farmstead

Heavy citrus on the aroma, dank hops, grassy, herbal. On the tongue is tangerine, citrus, grapefruit, dankness on the finish with a lightly bitter aftertaste. Easy drinking medium body with medium carbonation.

Pours a nice tangerine color slightly hazy with one finger of soapy head.
Aromas are lots of mosaic and good malt. Malt reminds me of aroma of the brewery.
Flavors are perfectly balanced with lots of Mosiac up front. Very mild bitterness.
This beer is soft on the palate and perfectly balanced.

F: Medium almost borderline creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation
O: This was an incredible IPA! The creamy, full mouthfeel combined with a sweet/mildly bitter citrus-forward flavor profile made this taste like a cantaloupe and mango smoothie. I thought this was a bit of a welcomed departure from most of HF's other IPAs, but overall this an excellent offering and one I'd highly recommend. 685 charactersFireman_RK, May 07, 2016

4.44/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Growler from the brewery, it pours cloudy gold color which had a 1+ finger foamy bright white head that was full of bubbles and dissipated very slowly, leaving excellent foamy lacing coating the sides and rings as it went down.
Smell is really fruity and pungent with the first wave of citrus hops hitting and bringing grapefruit pith, lemon zest, tangerine, orange peel, passion fruit, papaya and maybe some pineapple as the waves of hoppiness leave a malty wake that has biscuit, caramel, graham cracker, peppery spices and fresh floral hops. The malts are a compliment to the fresh, juicy citrus hops and citrus hops, trailing with a mix of citrus, mild earthy spices and piney and floral hops. Overall it's really fresh smelling and complex in a way that makes it hard to distinguish all the fruity and hoppy notes.
Tastes just as or even more fruity than the nose with pungent citrus hops hitting first and bringing grapefruit pith, lemon, orange peel, tangerine, yuzu, passion fruit, apricot, papaya and wet floral hops that come off like weed. The malt base is full of crackers with biscuit, graham cracker, Ritz cracker and toast grains adding balance, then shifting to brown sugar, coriander, pepper and tea leaf bring some earthy spices and trailing with fresh piney hops and/or spruce tips that give some bite and bitterness. The 8% ABV is completely masked by the zesty citrus flavors that almost have too much bitterness for my liking.
Mouthfeel is light, thin and smooth with a medium level of bitterness akin to sipping grapefruit juice. The carbonation is very mellow and mild with a medium body, and then a citrus pucker as it trails off zesty with a lot of citrus notes mixed in with a malty background, piney hops, toasted grains and earthy spices. 
A really nice beer that exudes fresh hops in both the flavor and nose, but the bitterness is a tad too high to make this a session-able beer for me. It has all the components to be an amazing DIPA as it's well balanced and hides the ABV perfectly, but the bitterness is just a tad bit too much and negates the perfection of this brew. Don't get me wrong, this is a great beer but just a little too bitter for me. 2,185 charactersCHickman, May 02, 2016

"Hop Candy."
"God Level. Sweet. Tropical. Pineapples. Yum. Yum. Yum."
"Luxurious."
This is one of my favorite DIPAs and perhaps my favorite beer with predominantly mosaic hops. This is the beer that introduced me to mosaic and I haven't had a better mosaic hopped beer since. I was introduced with the best. 417 charactersSheppard, Apr 15, 2016

T-mosaic bomb!  love the flavors and depth of this beer.  Mango and pineapple heavy for the citrus side and then the grassy, earthiness comes through strong as well.
F-nice combo of creaminess and juiciness

The beer has nice head that diminishes quickly.  The smell is all mosaic.  Citrus/orange, a little dank and a little grassy.  Taste is more citrus followed by some earthy grassy flavors.  The mouthfeel is smooth, easy drinking like all HF Beers.  I liked this one more than S&S #5 which surprised me because as much as I like Mosaic hops, I like Citra even more.  Yet, the Mosaic IPA was the clear winner for its more intense flavor. 563 charactersELS, Mar 25, 2016

Tagged "Best Consumed By March 10th... Consumed on March 13th.
Pours a hazy golden apple cider hue. Slightly loose head rised up nicely. White. Quickly recedes to an insignificant afterthought. But thankfully it pumps out some serious aroma...Mosaic. Grassy, some onion.
Flavor is a mix of more subtle onion, grass, pine, a slight citrus zest, and some really beautiful mineral rich water undertones as well. Slightly creamy in the mouthfeel and finished dry. 520 characters2beerdogs, Mar 14, 2016

The pour is a hazy golden orange color with a two-finger fluffy white head. Not much retention but some beautiful cobweb lacing hangs around.
The aroma starts off a bit oniony, but is followed by sticky pine sap and fresh grass. A touch of citrus and grainy wheat sits on the back end. Complex and bold.
The taste has lots of pine and grass, as well as grapefruit and fresh mango. Plenty of sweet, bready malt provides a nice balance. 
The feelings is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy and smooth, yet very dry. Lingering bitterness on the finish.
Overall, a great and complex DIPA. Not the best offering from HF by any stretch of the imagination, but it's a bright, well-balanced beer. 751 charactersScaryEd, Mar 09, 2016

3.9/5  rDev -12.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5My notes below are truncated; I'm having this beer as part of a bottle share. Reviewed live at low altitude in Austin, TX. Expectations are sky-high; this is my first Hill Farmstead beer. Best consumed by: 01/21/15. 
BOTTLE: Brown glass. Swing-top. 750ml with a paper hangtag.
Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. Served cold into an Adelbert's stem-tulip.
No bubble show forms as it's poured.
HEAD: 1 finger wide. White colour. Nice creaminess. Fairly full, fairly thick. Not quite as smooth and even as would be ideal. It could also have a softer appearance. Retention is average - about 2 minutes. Leaves no lacing as it recedes.
BODY: Semitransparent translucent copper of average vibrance with yellow hues. Clean albeit slightly hazy; no yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.
Appears aptly carbonated. Not unique or special looking, but certainly above average for an (imperial) IPA.
AROMA: Hop-forward, absolutely. Oniony and floral, with some pleasant zest and lemongrass. A kiss of soapiness; how long did this spend in primary fermentation? I like that it's slightly juicy. Pale malts. Grassiness. I like that it's not as clean and clinical as many IPAs; there's a slight earthy influence which manifests via the herbal character and grassiness that I dig. Still, some nectary character and/or overt citrus might make it even more appealing.
Aromatic intensity is moderate.
No yeast character, alcohol, or off-notes are detectable.
Overall, it's a pleasant and appealing IPA aroma, but I've certainly come across better. The onion and slight soapiness are interesting, albeit risky.
TASTE: Has a pleasant hop profile replete with notes of herbal hop character, heavy grassiness, floral character, lemon, onion (which actually works in this flavour profile), and lightly twangy citrus. Well-balanced, with a perfect amount of pale malt sweetness but no obnoxious cloying caramalt. Above average depth of flavour. It's aptly complex for an imperial IPA, and doesn't have a syrupy or overbearing malt build. The hops are rightly the stars of the show.
Nice duration of flavour, with a moderate aftertaste. Good intensity of flavour; it doesn't beat you over the head with the hops. More and more subtlety emerges as it comes to temperature.
The balance is what really works here; it's not the imbalanced bitter bomb put out by many problematic contemporary breweries (e.g. Green Flash).
TEXTURE: Incredibly soft and light-bodied. Smooth, wet, refreshing, and delicate. Boasts a fragility rarely observed in IPAs. This texture complements the taste very nicely, elevating the beer to a level of shocking refreshment, which also bolsters drinkability. Carbonation is near perfect (and that's impressive seeing as this is a swingtop).
Not oily, gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy.
OVERALL: It's incredibly drinkable by virtue of its masterfully handled mouthfeel. Hides its 8.10% ABV surprisingly well. I could down this by the growler with ease. This is on par with offerings from Russian River - or even Alpine - and grows on me the more I drink it. It's a great introduction to Hill Farmstead, and makes me excited to try their other offerings; this emperor, it seems, indeed has clothes.

Consumed 1/17/15
A: Lightly hazy, medium gold with some orange highlights - pours with a medium-sized, bright white head, fades to a wispy cap, leaves some nice streaks and spots of lacing
S: Many hop, much Mosiac - very hoppy, with some big, juicy, orange, grapefruit, peach, and apricot - leafy, resinous, dank, and just straight-up hoppy, like sniffing a bag of hop pellets - lightly spicy - pale, clean malts
T: Extremely hoppy, no surprise - big, juicy citrus - orange and grapefruit flesh, juice, and some zest, rind - wet, resinous hops - tropical fruits, lemon, peach, apricot, pineapple - it's like hop juice - moderate level of bitterness - low level of sweetness - solid malt base, pale grains, light bread, extremely clean
M: Medium body, smooth, nice carbonation, finishes clean
O: Have you ever wondered what Mosaic hops taste like?
Surprise surprise, Hill Farmstead can make a world-class DIPA. This is extremely similar to some other of their others of this style, but that is not a criticism. Excellent stuff. 1,092 charactersangrybabboon, Jan 18, 2015
3.83/5  rDev -14.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.75Split with angrybabboon.
Appearance: Hazy yellow gold with a soapy bright-white head. Clumps of lacing stick to the glass. Ok head retention leaves a small swirl of a cap with a small collar.
Smell: Stone fruit. Peach. Malts are slightly sweet with some biscuit and a touch of dough. Slight crakcery elements as well. Some mild sweetness. Light and fruity. Dank. Warming adds even more weed to the whole mix. Peach and a touch of pineapple, but mostly weed. Vague sort of spiciness. Lemon drops.
Taste: Stone fruit and weed. Dank. Peach pit, flesh, and skin. Touches of pineapple. Some solid herbal and spicy hop elements as well. A bit woody. Pale malt base with some slight sweetness and a touch of bread dough. Slight lingering pine bitterness. Ripe mango and some passionfruit as well. Nicely balanced. Warming ups the stone fruit element a touch. Weed sits on the tongue.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate to light carbonation. Slightly creamy. A touch if lingering dryness on the back of the sip.
Overall: Better with friends.
It's yet another Hill Farmstead pale ale. That means it's good. The straight use of Mosaic leaves the depth a little underwhelming. 1,175 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jan 18, 2015

Body is full enough for style with good carbonation. Dominant floral hoppy notes makes for this a great treat. 407 charactersPhyl21ca, Mar 29, 2014

Appearance - Gold colour with an average size white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some decent lacing. The head lasted for around 4-5 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Hops, apricots, grapefruit, oranges
Taste & Mouth - There is an above average amount of carbonation and I can taste oranges, grapefruit, and hops. There is also some caramel and apricots and a bit of floral and resin.
Overall - Not as good as some of their other DIPA/IPA's but well above average for sure. It's amazing how many world class beers this place pushes out. Would love to have regular access to their products. 671 charactersspinrsx, Mar 24, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a beautifully hazy golden yellow.
The aroma is Mosaic all the way. The essence of grapefruit peel, guava, kumquat, hints of tropical, but not sweet, ripping, or juicy. 
The flavor follows with those flavors along with almost a fake candy flavor, or powdery candy. A fake blueberry candy or jam. But still, it’s that hard to describe guava, essence of citrus and mango, peach, kumquat, big pink grapefruit. There’s a beautiful citrus peel bitterness on the finish, a medium to medium minus bitterness.
A extremely clean, easy drinking, definitely the best hoppy beer from Hill Farmstead, even over Abner. 628 charactersdar482, Mar 20, 2014

Look - Pours the usual great looking hazy straw color with a vibrant white soapy head that retains a bit and leaves an abundance of chunky lacing all over the glass.
Smell - An array of tropical fruits, dank citrus with a touch of spice. Mangoes, pineapple, passion fruit, etc. Mosiac aroma is similar to Nelson but the differences are obvious as well.
Taste - Mango, pineapple, passion fruit, the hops are center stage, malt doesn't play much into it here, which is what I'm looking for with this style.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied with low carb. Rests subtle citrus and juicy. This brew isn't one of those ones warming up enhances, it actually heats up the malt a bit, though the brew does get a big juicier, so this isn't a huge flaw.
Overall - Amazing brew, glad to have been able to have this. 900 charactersJMScowcroft, Mar 08, 2014

A- hazy straw color with fluffy white head. White lacing all over the glass. 
S- mango, banana, passion fruit, melon
T- follows the nose with light tropical fruits like mangos, banana, honeydew melon, melon pear, and pineapple.
M- light body with moderate carbonation. Sticky hops. Oils coat the palate pleasantly.
O- another killer beer from HF. I love the mosaic hops. The more fruity and tropical the IPA the better. Easy to drink with tons of flavor and no harsh bitterness. 483 charactersAdamF625, Mar 07, 2014

It's a great color, with wonderful lacing on the glass, as well. The aroma is so juicy and tropical. Pineapple is the major one I'm getting, with citrus and maybe some passion fruit. It's so great. The smell is a little sweet, can't detect any bitterness yet. It Tastes just like I would expect. Sweetness upfront with some pineapple juice qualities. There are other flavors in there that don't let the pineapple sweetness overwhelm. Almost no bitterness. S&S 5 was great when I had it last time, couldn't imagine this would be better. So bummed I only have one growler. The mouthfeel is creamy and the sweetness lingers for a while, it's very smooth. The alcohol is barely there. The only reason It doesn't get a 5 for mouthfeel is because it's not heady topper quality mouthfeel, which is a 5. HT is so resinous. If you like super juicy DIPA's I can't recommend this enough. 973 charactersMikeypnh, Mar 06, 2014

A- Pours a pale orange. Like most all HF DIPAs I have had, the beer is opaque. You can't see your finger through the glass. The pour produces a dense white head with incredible retention. A sticky, unctuous lacing remains. A beautiful beer that could be proudly displayed alongside any of the other greats.
O - Intense citrus - orange peel, grapefruit, and mango are balanced by sharp pine and an herbal note The aroma is just incredible. Unfortunately, the smell is just a bit weak. It doesn't explode from the glass the way some DIPAs do. But quality certainly beats quantity any day and the beer doesn't suffer much.
T - Citrus and pine are really in harmony here. Beautiful mango and grapefruit presence, with some pineapple sharpness as well. The herbal and grassy components linger and eventually dominate the profile. The finish is somewhat reminiscent of mineral water: crisp and dry with a nice herbal quality.
M - One of the real highlights of this beer. Medium bodied with perfect carbonation! It's resinous by not heavy. Drinks like an IPA!
O - What a magnificent DIPA. The heavy use of Mosaic hops give it an atypical flavor profile, but there is marvelous balance. You wouldn't know this is an 8% beer. Another fantastic beer in the Society and Solitude series, and further cements Hill Farmstead's reputation for producing world class IPAs. 1,487 charactersTychoNDC, Mar 06, 2014

4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This beer is simply gorgeous. Solid, one finger, pure as snow white head. Thick, cloudy, opaque liquid. Dark, pulpy orange interior, lightening to almost lemon yellow on the edges. Good head retention and beautiful lacing.
Citrus hops jump at you from the pour. A closer inspection reveals light lemon citrus, mango and tropical fruit, delicate biscuit and caramel malt, and a hint of resinous hops. Mosaic lives up to its name: a lot of different hoppy aromas coming through, with the emphasis on fruit, but nothing overpowering. Delicate and complex.
Taste is initially drier than the nose, but the flavor profile is similar. Hops are present in juicy abundance: an initial lemon flavor, followed by a ton of tropical fruit, and finished off by a slightly dank and fully resinous - yet still very juicy - hop bite.
"Bitter" doesn't leap to mind, despite the hop profile. The water and the yeast carry as much of the flavor profile as the malts, all blending together to support the hops. I get some leather and tobacco, and light biscuit.
Creamy yet light mouthfeel, with an incredibly full flavor. Just enough sting to come across as lively. Not at all syrupy. Great coating of the mouth for a long, smooth aftertaste, and a hint of heat on the back-end. I can't imagine a much better mouthfeel, except perhaps Heady. This is different, albeit similar, but still extraordinary.
This is easily the best new beer I have had in a long while. Like all HF beers I've had, the balance, water quality, craftsmanship, and mouthfeel give this brew so much more character than just the hop load and malt bill. It's truly greater than the sum of its parts. 1,653 charactersRoguer, Feb 23, 2014

a - Pours a hazy orange-yellow color with one inch of bright white head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks pretty nice.
s - Smells of citrus hops, oranges, floral hops, fruits malts, and light tropical fruits. Nose is great; tons of citrus and oranges to it and very hoppy. I love it.
t - The taste is even better than the nose; really amazing. Tastes of oranges, citrus hops, tropical fruits, pasison fruit, pineapples, fruity malts, floral hops, grains, light grapefruit, and light pine. Amazing taste, no bitterness to it whatsoever. Taste has even more oranges and tropical fruits than the nose. Outstanding.
m - Medium body with low or moderate carbonation. Super smooth and no bitterness, very easy to drink.
o - Overall I love HF beers, especially their IPA's, and this is one of their best in my opinion. IMO, the S&S 4, 5, and 6 have all been outstanding; this one is just as good as 4 and 5, if not better. Tons of tropical fruits, oranges, and citrus, yet somehow no bitterness at all making it very easy to drink. If I could I'd buy this every week. Highly recommended. 1,268 charactersmdfb79, Feb 20, 2014

A~ hazy copper orange, not too pretty haha! nice bubbly head with a lot of lacing.
S~ starts with lemon, passion fruit,and grapefruit. followed by earthy, hoppy bitterness.
T~ the mosaic hops really shine here, tons of fruit! passion fruit is the most prevalent with under tones of grapefruit, lemon, orange and guava. all of that leads into some nice dank grass, and earthy pine. followed by a really nice honey flavor which surprised me. 
M~ interesting! thicker than most IPA's almost like they really did add honey. other than that easy drinking and nicely carbonated.
O~ half way through this review i was starting to think, wow... all of my HF hoppy reviews are starting to sound the same haha. but i was really inspired once i took a sip, so much going on here. always excited for more of the Society & Solitude series but would it be horrible to say that i'm more excited about the Excursions series, that ones off to a really great start! i had the pleasure of trying Excursions #1 at a tasting last night for the second time and i was blown away once again. must be that "lemon drop" hop. ohhhh this is a S&S#6 review... opps... haha! 1,203 charactersSkrip, Feb 17, 2014

App- Hazy straw-yellow body, nice 1 finger white head with great retention, filmy and thick collar. Lots of retention on the drinking end of the business. Looks just as delicious as any other of Shaun's pale ales.
Smell- Thick and very pungent passion fruit mixed in with biscuits and honey. Really a basic combination, which is a bit surprising for a Mosaic-hopped beer. Delicious though!
Flavour- Phenomenal. Passion fruit, orange, grapefruit, pineapple all mixed in with bready biscuits, a little bit of caramel and perhaps honey. Its a very complex combination of hops and malts that doesn't bring a ton of bitterness to the table. Incredibly well-crafted beer that doesn't mess around.
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied, almost on the verge of full-bodied due to the great carbonation that makes the feel so creamy. Nice dry finish that isn't mouthpuckeringly bitter at all. Lots of residual fruit flavours dance on my palate for time and a half afterwards.
Overall- Phenomenal double IPA that continues the S&S series' excellence in weaving hops and malts together. Ranks just behind #4 for me. Definitely worth getting, however much it takes. 1,269 charactersStevedore, Feb 13, 2014

The aroma includes notes of wheat and herbal resiny character. Suggestions of straw and or grass come out as the brew warms and is smelled more.
The taste includes a bit of wheat like cereal and herbs. It is bitter with grassy aftertaste just like the aroma suggested.
This is a light bodied brew with a light amount of carbonation. Despite the usage of a unique/different hop, this had the same classic HF character to it. Dry, refreshing and otherwise forgettable but not a bad offering. 662 charactersstakem, Jun 05, 2013

S: Dank. Passion fruits, tropical fruits with a dash of oniony grass presence. 
T: Pretty dank on the initial taste as well. An immediate light onion-grassy note smothered by tangerines, mangos, papaya and some peaches perhaps. A big juicy fruit basket is the best way to escribe this. The finish is nice, psuedo dry with a moderate lingering hop bite. A little bit of bread and honey appear as well.

4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a hazy yellow with touches of gold and a nice fluffy white, two-fingers- width head that stick around and leaves a sticky fat lacing on the glass. The beer’s body is an opaque haze and appears to be free of carbonation bubbles. On the nose, the beer smells pungently of sweet and juicy tropical fruit. Mango, pineapple, touches of grapefruit, tangerine, and even touches of nectarine run across the nose and are backed up with a strong shivering pine resin and a slight caramelly bread malt. On the tongue, the beer tastes sweet and then nicely bitter with a wonderful round feeling that doesn’t wrack the mouth, but does give it a proper tingle. There is also a slight pucker from acidity in this beer. The flavors begin as light and then grow, sweet tropical fruit juice flavors work from pineapple juice into orange and grapefruit flavors and then explode with bitter sticky pine in the mouth. Juicy fruit flavors also run across the palate during the sip. The finish is bitter and a touch medicinal, but thirst quenching and tasty, and the aftertaste shows the light bready malt background of the beer. In the mouth the beer feels medium light in body, and fluffy soft from the carbonation with only a touch of a prickle on the sides of the tongue. This beer also gives a proper thirst quenching snap to the mouth, which is lovely. The mouth is left dry on top and wet on the sides from the slight acidity. Overall, this is a lovely tropical fruit DIPA and a nice introduction to the mosaic hop for me. That this is a single hop beer really shows both the skill of the brewer and the wonder of this new hop variety. This beer is excellent, and you should try it. 1,685 charactersMaxwell, Mar 30, 2013

Pretty standard murky/hazy looking Hill Farmstead hoppy beer appearance. Plenty of head retention. Nose is full-on juicy tropical fruit, big guava and pineapple notes, slightly overripe and sugary (in a good way). A little doughy malt rounds out the nose. Palate is similarly excellent, very bright and citrusy, loaded with pineapple, mango and guava goodness. Nice sturdy malt backbone that doesn't provide much sweetness. Finishes mildly bitter. Another exceptionally good beer in this series. 535 characterslargadeer, Mar 26, 2013

Appearance - Hazy orange body with some sediment floating inside. Nice white head that nearly overflows the glass. Impressive sticky lacing down the sides.
Smell - Incredibly complex aroma from what is effectively a single hop. Tropical fruit, citrus, pine, and a nice herbal character reminiscent of a Lawson's IPA. Really nice.
Taste - Still incredible, but doesn't quite reach the heights of the aroma. Citrusy, but the tropical fruits don't come through as much as the pine and herbal characters do. I go for tropical fruit more than the other flavors, but it's still excellent. Just a little bit of sweetness behind it all.
Mouthfeel - Low sweetness, medium carbonation. Not quite the body of a double IPA, which is nice. Never feels heavy and is impressively drinkable.
Overall - Stunning, as always, from Hill Farmstead. That one hop is delivering all of this flavor is all the more impressive. 944 charactersAlieniloquium, Mar 26, 2013

A - Giant white foam settles to thick cap, with good retention and tons of splotchy lace. Hazed dark orange body.
S - Big juicy, tropical fruit flavors with some mild dankness, spicy, piney, and earthy notes, and moderately expressive malt backdrop; this is definitely a double IPA in character. As usual per this series, no obvious alcohol and terrific flavor integration, complexity, and balance.
T - The taste is similarly excellent, with massive doses of mango, pineapple, and light citrus zest. Perhaps a bit less earthy than the aroma, but balanced by a moderate bitterness in the finish. Supported by sweet doughy malts that complement without being intrusive.
M - Chewy, medium body, with the expected soft, medium-low Hill Farmstead carbonation. Dry finish with tons of lingering residual oils and resins. Deceptive, with minimal alcohol presence.
D - Great stuff, although I tend to prefer things a tad less sweet, as I didn't feel I could drink this as quickly as Anicca. Mosaic hops are clearly terrific from every example I've encountered and the Hill Farmstead take on them doesn't disappoint. Will have to go snag another pour of this tomorrow. 1,228 charactersMasterSki, Mar 25, 2013

A-Beautiful three finger head, on the pale end of DIPA, clowdy as unfiltered DIPAs are wont to be.
S-smells like dank rotted fruit, though not as offensive as the Double Citra, and does not stray into 'cat piss' territory
T-tastes like the smell, though more like sweet/overripe fruit than rotted. Mangos, papaya, nice balance of sweet hop flavor and hop bitterness
M-out of this world, like all HF IPAs. Give me your goddamn secrets Shaun!

A: golden in color it is semi transparent but not necessarily cloudy it had a big fluffy white head that goes away quickly and leaves an average lacing around the edge of the glass. 
S:lots and lots of hops upfront and there are different smells too. It is mainly resinous piney hops (mosaic) but there are also notes of citrus as well. Hop bomb and I love It 
T: follows the nose with lots of resinous hops upfront that stick to your tongue throughout the finish. Though there is definitely some citrus flavors in the form of mango and grapefruit as it is almost bitter and a little tart at the same time though it is quite bitter in the finish. 
M: the resin extends to the feel as you can feel the stickiness for like 30 seconds after one sip. It is oily, crisp and fairly thick for a dipa but it goes down easy and the alcohol is completely hidden. It's a little sticky for my taste 
O: really high quality dipa lives up to other S&S I've tried other hfs beers. It is hop bomb with lots of great unique hop flavors. Get this beer if you can. 1,073 charactersPinknuggets, Mar 22, 2013

The beer pours a nice honey, orange color that's very hazy. A thick, soapy white head appears, nearly a finger high that has nice retention and leaves behind a great amount of sticky lace. The aroma is very pleasant, lots of mango fruit with tangy grapefruit, light tangerine sweetness, lightly floral at times that finishes with bitter pine and dirty weeds. Lots of mango on the tongue straight away, grapefruit is really strong as well and very juicy with some more tangerine/clementine sweetness that brings out the alcohol a bit. The finish is very bitter and almost astringent, lots of earthy resinous pine and grassiness. The body is nice and juicy, soapy at times that coats the mouth well, finishes with a nice, dry bitter kick. 
Verdict: A really enjoyable DIPA from Hill Farmstead, yet another success in their increasingly expanding and impressive hoppy portfolio. While it's not up there in the same breath as Abner or Ephraim, this beer is still very enjoyable and has a nice mix of juicy tropical fruit with some earthy, bitter pine. 1,106 characterskevanb, Mar 18, 2013

Tropical and citrus fruits are right up front on the nose. A bit floral as well. First sip is refreshingly fruity with your typical grapefruit and orange notes packing quite the punch. Bitterness is there but it's certainly not the palate crusher some HF DIPAs are. Mouthfeel is smooth and medium bodied. 
Overall, another tasty DIPA from Hill Farmstead as expected. It's getting tough now though to differentiate between all the different Society and Solitude beers. Jucicy, citrusy hops seem to dominate all the ones I've had so far so even with the best of note taking, it's hard to pick a favorite. 733 charactersKinsman, Mar 18, 2013

The beer pours a nice golden orange with a small feeble head and some lacing, nice hazy body. THe smell is the highlight for me, a very nice pungent hop front with tropical fruit, weed, honey malts, and some more plant like nugget hops. The taste follows suit, but for me it seems like the malt is a little more stronger than I expected with a honey soaked barley not in the middle, with some citrus hops in the front and a very dry bitter finish. I hoped for a bit more hop bite, but instead it is a little more subtle for an american dipa. Nice feel overall, it is very well balanced and the carbo level is spot on. If it was thicker I could s it flirting with a 5. 
Overall a very nice offering, nice stuff. 760 charactersDreadnaught33, Mar 15, 2013

4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5thanks to ILOVESTOUTS for this one
poured into a HF stemware
appearance: cloudy honey yellow, thin white head, little to no carbonation bubbles, glows well in the light. looks delicious
aroma: soft notes of pine and orange dominate, some real subtle sweetness and some grass/hay smell as well. nice, but nothing stunning
palate: sweet & boozy, not very carbonated, sits well in the mouth, a little bitter going down but thats what you expect from a DIPA
taste: sweet oranges, tangerines, some lemon, a little too sweet tho. the citrusness of it gets overpowered. reminds me of alchemy hour by GL, but it definitely retains the robustness ive seen in other HF ipas
overall: another fantastic brew by these guys. they can do no wrong. very fortunate to have had this one 774 charactersmobius387, Mar 11, 2013

Pours a very hazy honey gold with a soapy finger of paper white foam. Great lacing, lively beading.
Very, very tropical on the nose... mango and pineapple. Dense, lush, bittersweet.
The palate is defined by a big abrasive bitterness. It's more abstract in its expression of the mosaic hop than the nose, there's peach and pineapple. It feels nice and wet, slick, thirst quenching. 
I like it. I'd like to become more acquainted with mosaic and I think this is a good start. Thanks Colin! 587 charactersyamar68, Mar 10, 2013
4.54/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Fluffy white head with a solid body on top of a cloudy, tawny-gold ale. Aroma filled with overripe pineapple, juicy yet pungent. Cracker-like dry malt aroma underneath.
Flavor brings a big dose of tropical fruit up front, leaning heavily towards pineapple. A rough, resinous edge to the hop bittering keeps the tropical flavors in check. Subtle malt sweetness underneath like a pie crust that's been filled with fruit.
Finishes with a firm bitterness and rather dry, wiping away any hint of residual sweetness. The dryness keeps it dangerously drinkable as you keep going back for another sip after the last. A roller coaster of tropical hop flavor barely held back by some piney resin finish. 695 charactersneophilus, Mar 10, 2013

A- Pours a hazy golden orangish color, topped with a finger of white head.
S- Very hoppy, tropical fruit aroma, mango and papaya, grapefruit and pine, the hops also have a nice resinous and earthy, very mildly garlicy aroma.
T- Similar to the aroma, very nice hop flavor overall, lots of citrus and tropical fruit with a nice amount of earthiness and dank hop flavors. Malty sweetness appears that wasn't in the nose. 
M- Medium-bodied, nice carbonation, smooth and creamy feel.
O- The mosaic hops on this are awesome, a really nice DIPA overall. 609 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 09, 2013

A - Opaque-ish, white and light orange. Big white head that retains for a long time, leaving lots of lacing.
S - rich tropical citrus, warm smell of orange and mango somewhat slight, but very nice.
T - awesome. Lots of rich and juicy tropical fruit. Mango, orange pineapple. Lots and lots of depth in the flavor, then a big snap of bitterness at the end . Very very good, easy drinking and tasty.
M - medium carbonation, rich, oily, very nice.
O - a top notch ipa. I would pick this up all the time if I could. 549 charactersBeerandboards, Mar 09, 2013

The beer is hazy and orange with a half inch off off white head. The aroma brings a wonderful bouquet of hops, citrus, tropical fruit, mango. Sweet tropical fruits with bitter citric hops. Lovely flavor. Oranges and mangos with a touch of warming alcohol in the finish. Pleasant lingering bitterness. Medium in body with soft carbonation. Not my favorite of the Society and Solitude series thus far, but this is certainly a delicious beer. Hill Farmstead strikes yet again. 540 charactersHuhzubendah, Mar 08, 2013

Beer is yellow / amber with a nice white head, small bubbles, some lacing, moderate retention, nice carbonation.
Aroma is earthy, sweet, floral, fruity.
Beer is medium in body and quite hoppy. It is nice moderately bitter on the end, strong throughout the beer. Earthy and fruity, no real malt character, I'd have this beer again. 547 charactersdrabmuh, Mar 08, 2013

Pours a mirky orange/yellow color, white frothy head, super-sticky lacing, thick ring, and thin cap. Nose is mango-forward, tropical, smooth hops, grass, light pine...really well-balanced and smooth. Flavor is lots of mango, pineapple, hops, grassy...perfect balance of hoppy bitterness and sweetness. Body is light to medium, good carbonation, oily finish.
It's hard to think of another DIPA I would rather drink more of in one session. The alcohol is well-hidden, it's very-well balanced, and the flavor profile is simply right-on. I have to say, my other favorite easy-drinking DIPA is Heady Topper, and this is superior. 649 charactersSean9689, Mar 07, 2013

A lot of people's reviews get hindered by a past recipe or ingredients and it isn't fair to the current version. I had this lovely at Prohibition Pig on tap.
A - pours a hazy, silvery, light orange. 
S - nice citrusy smell upfront along with pine and grapefruit. Not an overpowering hoppy smell to it but very subtle.
T - hop bitterness to the front of the tongue. Citrus grapefruit taste appears further back on the tongue. Nice finish to this beer. Bitterness lingers briefly in the finish. Very easy to drink and pretty well balanced. 
It's difficult to find something wrong with this beer and I'm glad I had an opportunity to try it. In my opinion, not as good as Abner, another IIPA, but definitely worth a try and grabbing a growler of this. Another success from the Hill Farmstead crew. 899 charactersnootch23, Mar 05, 2013
4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25750ml HF swing-top growler poured into HF stemmed glass. Review copied from notes since my computer wasn't working when I drank this. First sampled at the brewery and then entire growler consumed the next day.
A- Growler opens with a nice "pop" to pour out a hazy mostly opaque slightly brownish orange grapefruit color with 1-2 fingers (1 finger on first pour, 2 fingers on second pour) of foamy head with very nice retention and leaving frothy lacing. Nice consistent carbonation.
S- Grapefruit, fruity citrus lemons (not acidic smelling), light greeny hops, and a nice balance of malts hiding in the background and adding a balanced sweetness. Not as intense of a citrus aroma as the previous two Societys, but very pleasant and well balanced.
T- Grapefruit, lightly bitter citrus lemon, finishes with grapefruit juice and balanced malts that complement the citrus. Lingering balanced presence of citrus and malts. Again not as citrus forward as previous Societys, but a very nice balance.
M- Medium bodied, nice carbonation, very easy drinking, slight bitter feel but refreshing.
O- This is another great Society & Solitude that definitely lives up to the other beers in the series. I loved the mosaic hops in this however I think I like SS4 and SS5 just a tiny bit better with them being a little bit more citrus forward without the balance between the malts as much. That's just personal preference though. I definitely recommend checking this beer out, it definitely will not disappoint even if you hold it to high expectations. 1,540 charactersjaasen64, Mar 05, 2013

The taste of the beer is very good, plenty of fresh hop flavors and sweet malt. Fruity citrus and melon flavors cover the taste buds.

Pours a golden-orange with a loose, off-white head that dissipates into a soapy skim. Nose reveals citrus notes, rind, earthiness and juicy tropical, fruity esters as the brew warms. Taste consistent with nose; however, there is also some bittering and a slightly medicinal quality to the flavor profile that peaks out towards the middle and back. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a lively carbonation and a kiss of astringency. Overall, extremely drinkable but much more delicate that your typical DIPA with a very light malt profile. Nonetheless, an excellent beer worth seeking out, but definitely allow it to warm to experience it at its best. 724 charactersJwale73, Mar 05, 2013

Appearance: Cloudy light orange to yellow in color. Pours a light, fluffy white head that leaves a goregous lacing. Really similar to almost every other HF IPA. 
Aroma: Grapefruit and candied citrus from the hops. More of a dank, earthy character than the past couple beers in this series. The Mosiac hops offer a really interesting character I am not too famailar with. 
Taste: There is a huge grapefruit flavor upfront in this IPA and it is complimented by some sweet candied citrus and a dank bitterness. The earth tones of this beer are definitely more pronounced than other HF IPAs. Really nice balance of the sweetness and bitterness from the hops. The grapefruit character is really pronounced and relll executed. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied but really crisp and really drinkable.
Overall, a really nice IPA from Hill Farmstead but the hop profile is a bit underwhelming for me. Really well balanced and easy to drink with just an insane amount of bitter grapefruit. Incredibly smooth and tasty, but doesn't stand out too much and the bitterness can get really strong. 1,276 charactersGosox8787, Mar 04, 2013

Pours a hazy light straw golden amber with a large white head that fades to a thick collar and film with patchy clumps of lace. Aroma starts with sweaty and juicy tropical hops: mango, passion fruit, tangerine, and lime. There's also some bready and pale malt and some grass and pepper spice on the finish. Flavor starts from the front of the palate bitter and peppery that persists throughout the sweet and fruity body. There is a persistent doughy malt base that blends nicely the grassy hop bitterness and juicy tropical notes. Fruit presence tends more toward tangerine, nectarine, mango and citrus skin than the nose. Full bodied, with soft carbonation and a dry, smooth finish. Aftertaste of resin, grass, bread and hoppy bitterness. I like the mix of styles of beer in this series instead of sticking to just making massive IIPAs showcasing a different hop each time. This is another winner. 984 charactersyourefragile, Mar 04, 2013

Pour: Completely hazy golden orange, with a thick, sticky three fingers of off white head. Tons of lacing last the entire glass.
Smell: Loads of grapefruit, white pepper, and mangos burst from the glass to start. Some pear creeps in. A stick honey sweetness comes through, and a touch of bread. Nose closes with more sweet citrus.
Taste: First, delicious fresh grapefruit and tangerines. A touch of floral hop character, and lots of clean white pepper. Some pine. A larger bready sweetness than I was expecting, but it works well. Finishes with a sticky sweetness and fresh citrus fruits.
Mouthfeel: Quite sticky, with just a small residual sweetness. Very refreshing. No trace of the 8%.
Overall: Great DIPA. Maybe the least favorite DIPA from HF for me yet, but still head and shoulders above the rest. 858 characterscfrances33, Mar 04, 2013

Pours a cloudy golden orange color with banana yellow edges and a one finger frothy white head that slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring. Good retention with large streaks of soapy lacing coating the glass. 
Floral, earthy hop aroma with resinous, grassy pine notes along with a subtle sweaty/onion-y character that countered by tropical and citrus fruit sweetness and a pale malt backbone. Not very familiar with mosaic hops but this beer smells pretty complex. Dank and sticky with hints of spruce tip, grass and pine needle followed by subtle citrus rind, grapefruit and pineapple. Again, some vegetal, onion/scallion character with some bread and biscuit underneath. 
Full bodied with a slightly creamy texture and a blast of earthy, sticky hops which provide crisp, dry bitterness that lingers over the sweeter fruit notes and pale malts into a dry finish. Aggressive bitterness up front with resinous oils and grassy pine needle flavor. There's also a bit of that onion like character but its not as strong as the nose suggests and fades a bit after it warms and the palate adjusts. The bitterness is countered by subtle citrus and tropical fruit notes, especially grapefruit, mango and lemon peel. Underneath, there is a pale malt backbone that's strong enough to perfectly balance things out without interfering with the hops. Some bread/yeast character along with biscuit and graham cracker. 
The most surprising aspect of this beer is how drinkable it is. Even though it's full bodied and aggressively bitter up front, it's perfectly balanced by the sweeter notes and malt backbone. Complex and flavorful with a crisp and refreshing finish that leaves me immediately craving another sip. I had to slow myself down and savor it before I blazed through the whole growler. Another great beer from Hill Farmstead! 1,881 characterscorby112, Mar 03, 2013

4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Fresh growler filled yesterday, I sampled this while there and it was great, so here goes review time. 
Naturally poured into my Hill Farmstead stemmed tulip, with a big rich creamy 1.5 finger head, plenty soapy and fluffy bubbles, fades slowly with tons of soapy lacing painting the glass, hazy nectar orange slightly reddish hue color.
Nose is explosive, wafting for miles and filling the room. Big fresh tropical fruit hops, so much mango papaya and passion fruit, which also brings some musty resinous almost skunky like hops, big and pungent, but at hte same time fluffy aromatic and soft. Some citrus, and tangerine like. Underneath all that is a light fluffy malt, just enough to give it a nice backbone and prop up the great hops.
Taste is big juicy hops. again tons of tropical fruits, like I'm sipping fruit juice in the Bahamas. Tropical fruit comes walloping in, papaya, a bit of mango, little passion fruit, and with that is some citrus, tangerine, hint orange pith. The hops get fairly resinous too, musty and very slightly oily. This is so juicy and smooth, tasty, and but at the same time big. Malts bring a bit of sweetness and malty backbone but not enough to even really know they are there except to keep the hops in check as they only get somewhat bitter overall and don't get astringent. Booze is hidden well too. Finish is drier, long lingering hops, gets fairly bitter as it dries and the malts that you didn't realize were there are absolutely gone, long lingering fresh hop, little musty resinous, more tropical fruits lingering, and touch spicy even.
Mouth is med to fuller bodied, smooth and drinkable as hell, nice carb, touch oily, booze hidden well.
Overall this is so smooth and drinkable, again like a tropical fruit juice with a mild bitterness and sweetness. Balanced well, with just enough bitterness and sweetness to make it so drinkable. Tropical fruits are very tasty. I'm almost halfway through the growler doing this review as I just pound back sip after sip. 2,005 charactersjlindros, Mar 01, 2013

A - Pours a hazy dark yellow body. Holding it up to the light provides a vibrant ripe peach color. Loads and loads of soapy bone white foam with long lasting retention. Looks perfect.
S - So this is mosaic huh? Huge blast of nectarines, mango and grapefruit. Bitter, sweet, ripe, and juicy with a hint of the danky dank. Has a sort of chalky dry finish.
T - Ripe nectarines and juicy peaches and mango. The finish is lightly bitter. Clean and super tasty, unbelievably juicy fruits here.
M - Medium bodied with nice carbonation. The bitterness does get a bit overwhelming after a glass.
O - This is just excellent, excellent stuff. I still prefer #5 over this beer, but if this is what Mosaic is like than I am all aboard that train. 884 charactersdavey101, Mar 01, 2013

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice hazy sunshine hue with soft flashes of orange. A nice two finger sudsy head fades to leave spotty lacing and a thin cloudy blanket.
S - If memory serves me right, this is a mosaic heavy beer. So juicy and delicious on the nose. The hops just pop out without being too resinous or oily. Dank, dank grapefruit notes. So wet and dank, with nice candy sweetness and faint malts.
T - Nice bitter hops here, but not too bitter. Again, incredibly dank and wet hop flavours with glorious grapefruit rind and pith. Nice lighter sweet malts, the hops really shine here. Good hop and malt balance here, but obviously leaning much heavier on the hops.
M - Mouthfeel is excellent for a DIPA. Relatively easily drinkable with some light but sharper carbonation. Really hides that 8.1% ABV.
O - Overall, another solid beer from Shaun. I still think I prefer SS4 out of all the Society beers. That said, this beer is "worth the price of admission" so to speak. Well crafted again. 1,163 charactersrudzud, Mar 01, 2013
