Pours a sexy orange color that has a little bit of murkiness / haze to it. Cannot see threw the beer too well. Nice frothy two finger white colored head with good retention. Not too much lacing.
Smell isn't very large. I'm picking up mostly citrus and pine notes.
Taste is on point! Big citrus and bitter pine resin right out the gate then some tangerine and tropical notes come in. That indescribable 'dank' flavor is there also.
Feel is really well done for an 10.5% beer. Very refreshing, not overly carbonated, easily could pass for a much lighter beer. Dangerously crushable. 
Overall this is a stupendous offering from 3 Floyds! It drinks like a Stone Enjoy By but with more bitterness and pine in there. Same type of feel however. Lovely! 818 charactersaoampm, Apr 26, 2017
4.53/5  rDev +1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed a bomber dated "4-11-17" on April 26, 2017. I also had this on draft recently (undoubtedly the same production run--3F doesn't make it all that often).
I have had Permanent Funeral several times, including twice on draft. Although I have found most 3F beers to taste relatively the same on draft and in the bottle, Permanent Funeral is one that has impressed me more on draft. That said, I have never quite fallen in love with it. It is a great beer, but I feel that 3F's Dreadnaught covers most of the same territory but at 9.5% ABV instead of 10.5% and with overall better flavor. Funeral is produced less and often kept "beneath the counter" (like Zombie Dust); Dreadnaught is produced more and not hidden away. It's just an easier beer to grab and enjoy. Also, for the wild and screaming hop treatment, I'd rather drink Arctic Panzer Wolf (which *is* quite differentiated from Dreadnaught).
Permanent Funeral pours a deep gold. Nose is hoppy and inviting. The hops are aggressive, intense, high-pitched, and floral with a bit of bite. Malt is also nicely in balance. As others have noted, this beer does not taste like 10.5% ABV: it's intense but smooth and highly drinkable, so take care in that regard. It's very easy to chug a couple bombers and truly be bombed.
As a general caveat, 3F's hoppy beers (and hoppy beers in general) go bad very quickly. Permanent Funeral is less tasty at a month, shaky at 6 weeks, and close to undrinkable at two months (more like "Permanent Soapy Mouth" at that point). Mind the yellow date stamp on the bottle above the label, and don't buy it after 6 weeks, preferably much less.
In conclusion, this is a pretty darn good beer, but I prefer Dreadaught and Arctic Panzer Wolf. I don't feel Permanent Funeral has many advantages over these two. Happy drinking! 1,812 charactersMatt_Rouge, Apr 25, 2017

Muted aroma of pine, orange and pepper.  There's definitely some sweet malt in there as well.
Totally unique taste.  There's a big peppery, herbal quality up front; strong vodka-like alcohol and then some honey malt mid-palate; and touch of orange and pine on the backend.  The pepperiness lingers with some dull hop bitterness and orange sweetness in the aftertaste.
Very slick, oily mouthfeel.  Medium bodied with strong carbonation.
There are a lot of great DIPAs available these days, but this is right up there with them.  The aroma is sort of middle of the road, but the taste is excellent.  4/11/17 bottling date. 733 charactersthebeers, Apr 20, 2017

Pours a dark slightly hazy amber body with a two finger white head that reduces to leave some frothy foam. 
Aromas are initially quite fruity and tropical, giving way to piney and resinous aromas once it warms a little. On the tongue is pine and resin on a heavy malt backbone, sweet with caramel and a bitter finish. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. 
I can respect this for what it is, its a malt forward IPA that hides the abv quite well. Not a fruit / citrus bomb, but on the other end of the spectrum. 585 charactersgcamparone, Mar 25, 2017

Appearance- A medium orange color slightly murky. About 1 finger of slightly off white head with nice lacing down the glass. 
Smell- A ton of citrus fruit in this one with a nice pine note in it. I definitely smell grapefruit, orange peel, and apricot. The pine mix really screams drink me.
Taste- The citrus fruits combine with the pine for almost a perfect mix to me. The fruit definitely dominates but the piney taste reminds you it is a DIPA. Such a great juicy taste with no alcohol coming through. 
Mouthfeel- Moderate carbonation with more of dry finish than I anticipated. So much juicy citrus to finish dry. 
Overall- A world class double IPA and a great change from the NE style DIPAs. The juicy taste blends with the piney hops to make this super drinkable. Be careful of the fruity taste covering the high ABV. Wish I had one more. 910 charactersKdouble, Mar 22, 2017

Appearance: Pours a clear amber orange. Moderate amount of bubbles and a solid finger of off white head which settles into a thin patchy layer. 
Smell: A very juicy and dank hop driven aroma with a scent of citrus fruit and pine resin. Upfront scent of citrus hops with some grapefruit, orange peel, mango, passion fruit, apricot, tangerine, and melon with some pineapple. Dank and earthy hop scent of pine resin, cannabis, and grass. Malt hints of caramel, grains, and cracker with some yeast. A really good juicy aroma. 
Taste: Like it smells, a very juicy and piney hop dominated taste with big notes of citrus fruit and pine. Ripe and juicy citrus hop notes of orange peel, grapefruit, mango, apricot, tangerine, passion fruit, and melon along with pineapple. Earthy hop notes of pine resin and grass. Background malt notes of caramel, grains, and cracker along with some yeast. A really good juicy taste. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Juicy and oily with a drying finish. Alcohol is hidden fairly well. 
Overall: A really great Double IPA. Big citrus and pine flavor that is worthy of a great Grindcore band. 1,211 charactersMattyG85, Jan 22, 2017

This one pours a clear light amber, with a small white head, and a little bit of lacing.
This one smells like super bitter grapefruit, super resinous pine, a bit of booze, and sweet caramel malt.
This is definitely a bruiser- the malt backbone is certainly beefed up here, but it doesn't overpower the big hop assault- it's super sticky, with big grapefruit, some orange, heavy duty pine, cannabis, grassiness, and leafiness. There's some definite caramel here, but it's not too sweet, luckily.
This is medium bodied, with a pretty sticky body, and good level of carbonation.
This is an impressive beer here- it retains an interesting malt backbone, while still being a big aromatic and juicy hop barrage. 756 charactersGreesyFizeek, Sep 28, 2016

Look – copper color with nice head.  Leaves good lacing on the glass.
Smell – fruity hop aroma.  Alcohol comes out. Peach or pear.
Taste – alcohol is present.  Has some bitterness.  Rich flavor.  Complex hop taste.
Feel – Substantial.  Smooth.
Overall – Strong bold beer with well-balanced hops and fruity aroma.  Complex.  Love this. 421 charactersIrishjohn77, Sep 15, 2016

4.29/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25From a bomber into a snifter. I drank this fairly fresh, less than 3 weeks after bottled.
L - Pours darker gold color, with a good amount of head that stays around for a bit.  
S - Aroma is nice; sweet bread
T - a lot of hops up front, then some malt that is understandable given the ABV.  The grass / leaf taste outweighs the fruit tones to me.  Doesn't do a poor job of hiding the alcohol, but you can taste the 10.5%.  
F - Body is thick for even a IIPA - very strong, best part of this beer
It's a really good beer, though it's a bit too strong for my taste. 565 charactersChuckdiesel24, Sep 07, 2016

The first sip was even more powerful, you can definitely taste and feel that 10.5% ABV. That is not by any means a bad thing though., the flavors balance the strength admirably. I loved the spritely mouthfeel, it was like a thousand little tickly shocks on the tongue. In all its hoppy, hempy, tropical fruity. greatness, this is an excellent beer, worthy of all of it's high reviews. 504 charactersJDaniel502, Sep 03, 2016

4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a bomber into a Goose Island tulip. The pour is quite clear, gold in color, and (if rough) sports an impressive crown of white foam. The nose is nice, but a bit more subdued than I expected. I get sweet notes of fresh bread as well as some lemon.
Medium body with a hop-forward flavor and a silky feel. Some mild malty notes up front to balance out the hops, and then a big blast of oily, husky, hemp-like leafy flavors. It's like liquid hash, but in a good way. Very unusual flavors here. Along with the grassy notes there is a fair amount of over-ripe tropical fruit (mango? papaya?) and an elusive sherry-like flavor that seems to pop up and vanish before it can be identified. I definitely detect some alcohol on the finish, but it's not enough to detract from the drinkability.
This is such an odd beer. It certainly tastes like a IIPA, but I can't quite single another one out that it reminds me of. If I had to compare it, I would say it kind of tastes like a blend of Bell's The Oracle and GL Lake Erie Monster with the body of Stone's Enjoy By. I don't know. It's good, but Dreadnaught is (IMO) still the best damn IIPA Three Floyds makes. 1,162 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Aug 31, 2016

Look: Bright yellow-orange with two fingers of fluffy foam leaving behind tons of lacing as it settles. Cloudy body. Great-looking IPA. 4.25
Smell: Smooth hops with an usual sweetness. Also a bit of sweaty funk. I realize that sounds a little gross, but it's not stale or old-smelling. 4.0
Taste: Bright, citrusy orange flavor with a bit of spice on it. Smooth and sweet with some bitterness on the finish. Unfortunately, it has faded a bit, but it's still quite tasty. 4.0
Mouthfeel: Nice full/round feel, and it finishes clear and crisp. 4.0
Overall: I normally wouldn't review an IPA that isn't super-fresh, but this is still so good that I wanted to write the review anyway. This is a fantastic IPA. If I still lived in Chicago, I would *not* take this beer for granted. 4.25 806 charactersccg, Jun 22, 2016

The aroma is of fiercely bitter citrus hops and light malt.  The taste is packed with bitter citrus hops and light malt that barely keeps the aggressive hops in check.  There's a massively deep hop burn on the tongue.  The mouth is otherwise dry. 352 charactersFranziskaner, May 08, 2016

4.57/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5BOD 4/1/16.  Clear dark gold / medium amber pour.  Outstanding head volume, world class lacing and retention.
Rich world class nose of tropicals (mango, pineapple) and citrus (tangerine, orange) with a touch of spice over a cracker biscuit that also has bready elements.
Heavy medium body that is superbly smooth and escapes into the realm of oily and creamy from time to time.  World class carbonation / body balance with a nice prickly effervescent middle and a finely bubbled prickly finish.  The finish allows world class flavor complexity to pop.
The flavor profile is world class.  This is a hop flavor focused beer that rides over a solid, and sweet, malt base.  Bitterness is relatively low and teases the palate with orange/tangerine rind.  It begins with a slightly sweet tropical and citrus flavored blend that becomes more rind influenced until the middle.  Here, sweetness assumes center stage and the hop flavors separate.  Tropicals arrive first - mango, pineapple and possibly peach as an undercurrent (as it warms, this is definitely peach).  Sweetness fades as the finish approaches and orange is center stage with light tangerine notes coupled with zest.  The 10.5% alcohol remains completely covered, which indicates a brewing masterpiece - no astringency whatsoever.  The finish is subtly dry and all the previous flavors arrive for the curtain call and take their well deserved bows over a sweet base. 1,426 characterstillmac62, May 05, 2016

Bottled on 01-Apr-2016 and poured into a snifter glass on 11-Apr-2016. Immediately hit with aromas of pineapple and orange zest. Incredible feel along with fruity hop character and almost no bite -- especially for the high ABV. This is all accomplished unlike any other IPA I've tasted. I'll be making the trip back to Indiana for this, no doubt. 462 charactersTheBigJohnson, Apr 11, 2016

Good foam and lacing though. Super dank nose, hops and malt totally in the forefront. Slight zesty citrus note on the scent as well. The taste is a battle between malt and hop. Zesty and citrusy with a surprisingly slight amount of bitterness. Full mouth feel, pretty well-balanced. I'd say it's slightly below Dreadnaught, but an excellent beer nonetheless. Looking forward to trying the two other Double IPAS from them I have on hold at the store. 550 charactersmschrei, Mar 09, 2016

Appearance (awesome bottle artwork BTW)-  But crystal clear orange, minimal head, excellent lacing.
Smell-  Def get malt before hops on this one.  at 10.5 abv, not really surprised though
Taste-  Tropical fruit upfront, malt on back end,  can def taste the alcohol.
Feel- Creamy mouthfeel, finishes dry.
Overall-  a rock solid Imperial IPA worthy of its ranking. 397 charactersjcflorian, Mar 07, 2016

A- Pours a mostly clear bright orange with a small amount of head which quickly fades. 
S- Strong tropical and citrus notes are abundant on the nose. 
T- The same strong tropical notes carry into the taste, to include mango and orange above all. A slight sweetness of the malts is noted at the back end of the taste. 
M- Medium bodied, bitter, dry finish, very drinkable for the higher ABV., 
Very nice beer, Three Floyds does the hoppy stuff well. 517 charactersvic21234, Feb 28, 2016

4.41/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured at 50°F from a 22oz bottle into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
LOOK: Pours with thre fingers work of rocky and spacious, off-white foam that dissipates into a quarter fingers worth of white foam after 2 and a half minutes. A moderate amount of very thick lacing is left behind from the head dissipation. Honey orange in color with a moderate amount of cloudiness. There is a large quantity of medium-sized rising bubbles. Lacing is very thick and moderate. 
SMELL: Strong aromas of mango, papaya, peach, apricot, grapefruit, and tangerine are perfectly balanced by strong sweet bread and caramel aromas. There is a hint of alcohol and bitter hop aromas, also, but they do not make the aroma any less displeasing.
TASTE: Strong flavors of mango, peach, tangerine, apricot, papaya, grapefruit, and tangerine combine with mild sweet bread and caramel flavors to compose the initial taste. Subtle bitter hop flavors immediately follow as caramel flavors grow stronger. Hints of alcohol enter lastly as all previous persist, except for bitter hop, which grow slightly stronger.
FEEL: Full-bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Goes down smooth and creamy. Ends with a strong dryness. 
NOTE: An incredible IPA. What really surprised me is how the beer changed as it warms. Instead of the usual increase in bitterness that you would expect from IPAs, the citrus flavors grow stronger. I'm not sure how FFF pulled that one off, but heck yeah! I've never been big on bitterness and this beer isn't one of those. If you are looking for a bitter brew to satisfy your twisted taste buds, look elsewhere! 1,599 charactersMyotus, Dec 26, 2015

4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5This is a beautiful brew with an orange-apricot hue and a dense, uniform 2-finger khaki head leaving spotty lacing.
On the nose I get graham, light caramel, and a bouquet of fruitiness, orange, tangerine, lime, grapefruit. The hops continue to further provide some dank and pungent onion and rug, and spicy pine, keeping this just on the edge of being a vicious IPA.
That delicate and slightly sweet but tasty graham backbone is still present in taste, but is bombarded with all sorts of complexity from the hops, ranging from spicy citrus, to pine, resin, and even Fruity Pebbles.
Very drinkable with a super dry finish. When absolutely fresh, a supportive sweetness perfectly balances out the bitterness with that graham attribute filling out a nicely balanced IPA that makes it absolutely delicious. This is the pinnacle of the traditional American IPA style. 865 charactersSabtos, Dec 20, 2015

Immediately notice upon drinking that the abv is well hidden.  Amazingly well.  A little grapefruit.  I like how they call this a pale ale.  Amazing how effortlessly such a strong beer drinks, alcohol doesn't creep into the mouthfeel even downbottle as it slightly warms.  Tough price wise, but it seems to be a better version of Dreadnaught. 512 charactersrodbeermunch, Dec 08, 2015

A: Hazy, murky, golden tangerine in color with some honey highlights - pours with a medium, creamy, off-white head, fades to a wispy cap, retains a small collar, leaves some streaks of lacing
S: An aroma as aggressive as the bottle art - bright, brash, potent citrus - orange and grapefruit  flesh, oil, and zest - floral citrus, touches of marmalade - herbal with touches of grass - light hints of tropical fruits, but the emphasis is really the citrus explosion - vaguely musty fruit - solid malt base, grainy and decidedly bready, like whole grain bread - lightly sweet, light alcohol aroma but doesn't really smell like 10%
T: Lightly boozy citrus juice, but way better than a screwdriver - ripe, juicy, fleshy citrus - orange and grapefruit zest, rind, and oil - some resinous pine, touch of mint - floral, and herbal, with some earthy notes, but mostly fruity - straight-up hops - high level of bitterness - malts provide a solid backbone, with some bread and biscuits - lightly sweet with some honey - typically I hate the combination of high bitterness with sweetness, but the sheer aggressiveness of the hops somehow ties things together
M: Full body, very smooth, a bit chewy, oily, with some bite, finishes with some booze 
O: Yup, this puts the fun in funeral
This beer comes extremely close to being overly bitter, overly sweet, and overly boozy. But it somehow does not cross that very, very thin line. This is monstrous without being a mess. This is worth seeking out, especially if you're a fan of 3 Floyds' signature aggression, although I think I enjoyed Dreadnaught more. 1,613 charactersangrybabboon, Dec 05, 2015

Cloudy orangish color with good head and lacing. In your face aroma as soon as popping the top in a one month old bomber. Citrus, pineapple and sweet malt fill the air. The taste follows suit, what a blast of lemon, melon, grapefruit, and a balanced sweetness. Finishes dry and bitter making it impossible to put down. This should be three floyd's signature. 564 charactershardysf, Dec 03, 2015

Tastes... far worse than I'd have ever guessed.  Bitter and hoppy?  Sure.  Boozy, not subdued at all (in a bad overpowering way), and chalk filled with over peppery/over spicy hops that create an unpleasant mouth-feel.  Maybe this was just an awful/really old bottle?  Is this totally horrible?  No.  But it's bad enough I wouldn't even drink a free one if it was offered to me, which is saying a lot. 505 charactersanteatr23, Nov 27, 2015

4.1/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Well, I just dropped a lot of cash on this beer.  Was it worth it?  No, it most certainly wasn't.  Even as a fan of FFFs, I would strongly advise those searching for this beer to stop giving it any deference.  While it's good, it's certainly not worth the time, effort, and money to procure this beer.  Here goes:
A:  Good.  Pours a strong, slow-to-build head with adequate lacing.  However, the cloudy orange body certainly isn't appetizing, and the body carbonation is pathetic.  Nowhere near as robust as I was expecting.
S:  The best part of the beer.  Tons of tropical fruit; also some herbally grass.  Can smell grass, lemons, oranges, apricots, mango, peach, and grapefruit.
T:  While the taste is good, this beer doesn't even compare to many other IPAs and DIPAs on the market.  The beer contains a blend of sweet malt and grapefruit.  That's it.  Grapefruit coats the palate and is the overwhelming flavor; really, the beer is incredibly simplistic - I could've bought a beer that tasted exactly like this one at less than half of the price.  Sure, I suppose you can include other fruits within the penumbras of the overall taste, but the bottom line is that the beer is rather generic for its style.
F:  Not that good.  Thick and sticky but with very limited carbonation.  
O:  A pretty overrated beer.  Zombie Dust, Alpha King, and Gumballhead are much better FFF offerings. 1,390 charactersleantom, Nov 14, 2015

Served in a tulip, the beer pours a slightly hazy golden/orange color with a couple inch off-white head that stayed around for a very long time.  There's also a lot of lacing.  Aroma is nice, the brew smells mostly like citrusy (tropical fruit, mango, citrus peel) and pine hops, along with some bready malt.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also the addition of some candied oranges and dankness.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's slick and a bit creamy with a good amount of carbonation.  I thought this was pretty good, I'd like to try it again in the future. 681 charactersbluejacket74, Nov 07, 2015

The aroma is malty, sweet bread combined with some tropical fruitiness. Taste is very malt forward at first with caramel but it doesn't late long. There is a spicy peppery piney resin bitterness that takes over quickly and lasts throughout.  Some apricot lingers with the hops.  Some alcohol burn there in the end.  Mouthfeel is exceptionally full and soft. This is a great DIPA, but very different, understand why it gets such mixed reviews. Full of flavor, but you really need to love a bitter finish to dig it. 605 charactersNolaHopHead, Oct 25, 2015

Unfortunately, I wasn’t all that impressed with it. I didn’t review it at the time as I figured I needed a second go at it before really judging it in case of improper storage and such. I had it again on tap this past week and was able to give it another whirl…
Appearance (based on the photo I have from a dark-lit bar) is a clear golden hue with a solid 1-1/2 finger white head. Looks really nice.
Taste was just as I remember it from the first time… Very malt heavy and bitter, almost boozy. I feel as if the ABV on this beer hurts it more than anything… I find the booziness really masks any amazing flavor this beer could have. 
Overall it is a good DIPA, but that is about it. It’s not extraordinary by any means and I would likely pass it up on the shelf if I came across it anytime soon. Far better options out there. 966 charactersinvertalon, Oct 21, 2015

2.82/5  rDev -36.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 2.25 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 2.522oz bottle poured into a tulip. Pours a hazy burnt golden with a fluffy eggshell white head that doesn't fall leaving great retention and very sticky lacing. Looks very good. The aromas are disappointing. Very faint. Smells like an old IPA. Tons of orange and lots of malts. Lots of bread. The flavors are full of citrus and caramel malts. Syrupy. Some pine resin. Subtle spiciness. Some black pepper in the finish. Not really bitter. Meh. Mouthfeel is very nice. It's full-bodied and very creamy with active carbonation. Alcohol goes unnoticed, although it's sweet and warm.
I really like 3Floyds, so I'm not being a "hater". I hope this is an old bottle. The date was smeared, go figure. This is my first time having this after years of hearing the hype. Easily the biggest disappointment I've ever experienced based on expectations. There's no way this is the beer that everyone praised. Bottles have been popping up around around Cleveland for Cleveland Beer Week, so I'm assuming this is relatively fresh. Disappointing, but I would still like to try this again just to see if this bottle was a fluke. 1,108 charactersBB1313, Oct 18, 2015

Fruity nose, with tropical notes backed up by lemongrass and pink grapefruit. Feels richly decadent in the mouth, with a full body made for swirling around. The tropical fruit gives way on the tongue to the grapefruit and pomelo pith, an intense bitterness somewhat balanced by syrupy undertones. A bit of papaya and apricot reemerges as the beer warms, and a bit of malt tentatively raises a hand to wave hello, but by that point, your palate is likely passed out on Scott's couch. 531 charactersdarktronica, Oct 13, 2015

Taste - Explosion of flavor. Tropical, dank, tons of sweet malts, candied orange, definitely get the booze coming thru but that's expected @ 10.5. 
Feel - Coats the mouth, sticky, dry finish
Overall - This is a BEAST of a beer. A great DIPA but not for the faint of heart. Pure insanity in a glass! 440 charactersTonyjenlasc, Oct 05, 2015
4.43/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle into a tulip. Vibrant golden in color with a nice snow-white head. Citrus, pine resin, grapefruit, mango, and orange peel on the nose. Medium weight and very, very smooth for being north of 10%. Piney, hoppy resin on the taste along with juicy grapefruit, orange, and mangos. Just an outstandingly well-balanced beer. I can't believe this beer is 10.5%.
With that being said, I am a huge fan of 3 Floyds. However, in regards to this beer, it reminded me of Cimmerian Sabertooth Berzerker in many ways. Not sure which one came first, but I honestly don't think I could tell the differene between the two in a blind tasting. Not saying this beer is bad, I seriously just like CSB that much. I've love to have one of each on hand to compare. 746 charactersdo_ob, Oct 04, 2015

Look - Lighter orange yellow. Clear. Expected white head medium bubbles. Looks like an average IPA.
Smell - Pine. Resin. Vanilla. Watermelon. Grapefruit. Orange.
Taste - Perfect balance. Pine resin, citrus, and just enough musty danknous to contribute.
Feel - No carbonation bomb. Smooth. Tongue is ripped but while weird to say, only on the edges.
Overall - There is a lot of citrus but is well balanced. It was worth the drive to Chicago. I have been waiting for a year to get a bottle. Drunk me at DLD was right, very good. 606 charactersmadelfonatree, Sep 27, 2015

4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Pop the top and let the Dreadnaught colored beer flow.  Pours a darker yellow, good amount of clarity to it, soft 1/2" head on it, looks good, looks solid, reliable.  Aroma wafts up in yo face, pine is heavy.
Taste flows with the heavy pine hops, super dry, at over 10% this one drinks pretty effortlessly.  You get that herbal presence that often occurs when you get these monster west coast iipa level abvs.  Grapefruit rears its minimal head in the mouthfeel, but this is really light and dry so it is all good.  Dreadnaught tends to come across stickier, sweeter and with more malt color to it.  
The main problem with this is its $10 a bomber.  That's like twice the price of Grunion.  Cool to check out once, but I don't see how it can be a regular purchase. 766 charactersraiderandbeerfan, Sep 16, 2015

T: Juicy citrus nectar and sweet tangerine mix with tons of slick and greasy hop oils and caramel. Way to sweet for my liking, and too malty. Solid bitterness lingers in the finish, but the aftertaste is more sweet and caramely than anything.
M: Soft and foamy carbonation, super chewy and greasy mouth, full body. I will say that the alcohol is hidden well, except for the thick and heavy mouthfeel.

A - A beautiful deep, dark orange, and very clear.  Exactly the way I like them.  A decent off-white head with tight bubbles.  This will probably stick around for a few minutes.
N - Whoa, tons of citrus and pine.  This one is not fooling around.  The hops just get right up into your grill.  This beer is a close talker and doesn't care.  I get plenty of grapefruit.
T - Yikes, this is a mess.  There are so many flavors here I can't possibly describe them all.  It's one of the sweetest IPAs I've had.  There's ruby red grapefruit juice, fresh squeezed orange juice, maybe some dimetapp elixir or triaminic.  Very sweet, almost medicinal like a whiskey.  Like a said, a lot going on here.  Tasty?  Yes.  My style?  Not really...
M - I've definitely had a great run of IPAs with tremendous mouths.  The stuff turns to froth right away, and goes down so smooth.  Leaves a residue of spiciness, and I still get that medicinal, whiskey like quality tingling around the back of my mouth/throat.
O - The is the most unique IPA I've ever had, that's for sure.  A well-made concoction. 1,191 charactersCraftFan5, Sep 08, 2015

Smell leads with grapefruit only a bit more bitter, and a sweet malty flavor comes in next, with a bit of burnt toffee.  Tastes much the same way, with a surprisingly mild bitterness that makes me question the 100 IBU measurement, but that always seems subjective to me anyway.  Nice rich, heavy mouthfeel lets the flavor stick around for a while, which is totally a good thing, and not too much carbonation so it's sorta soothing as it goes down.  Overall, pretty juicy, well balanced, startlingly light for a high-octane pale ale (and thank you for not writing IPA on the label!) whose power sneaks up on you. 687 charactersjmasher85, Sep 01, 2015

S:  was a bit dank for my liking.  I was expecting more citrus but it didnt come through.
T:  outstanding.  Very citrusy.  It hides the alcohol well.  May be the best tasting DIPA I've ever had.
F:  mouthful was fine....not too heavy and not too light for DIPA.
O:  I love this beer.  I like it better than Zombie Dust.  It packs a punch at 10.5%.  I will continue to seek this beer out. 517 charactersTonyLuvsBeer, Aug 28, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Absolutely incredible. Usually collaborations are kind of gimmicky but Permanent Funeral defies all expectations. In my opinion, Permanent Funeral is better than Zombie Dust by inundating your palate with fruitful hops. Furthermore, the high ABV is well masked by the balance of the sweet and bitterness. Cheers! 312 charactersTrevor11, Aug 25, 2015

It's a 100 IBU beer, so I expected tons of hoppy fruity notes on the nose and lots of hoppy bitterness on the finish. I didn't really get either. The nose was pretty basic and the taste was more like an APA. I felt like I got more booze taste than hops. 289 charactersBeerSamurai34, Aug 23, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a sunny yellow color, clear, with a froth, very stable, big head.
The nose packs more lemon than I have ever experienced so far in a beer, perfectly fitting accompanied by flowery notes and crisp, ripe orange. Amazingly clean hop profile, with a balancing, bready malt foundation, completed by a toffeeish hint. The aromas are steamlined on the insane lemon defined hoppiness, very focused and prominent on the nose, balanced by just the right amount of malts.
Has an outstandingly soft mouthfeel, which changes drastically as the hops explode on the palate, resulting in a short burn, which is in no way alcoholic at all, as it gets immediately coated up by sweeter malts, forcing the focus on the hops.
Tastes of dough, bready malts, accompanied by an uncompromising, big punch of citrussy hops. Citrus stays on the palate till the very end, while a grassy dankness joins in, as well as lemon zest, giving the initial flavor even more punch. Finishes with a flavour explosion on the palate, resulting from amped up hops colliding with equally amped up malts, numbing my palate for a short moment, possibly revealing spice but I am just guessing at this point. Till the finish, the beer reestablishes its initial smooth mouthfeel, joined by sweeter toffee malts and dry, bitter, long staying citrus hops. 
Interesting, unique taste development, with a flavor profile which grows incredibly huge and intense on the palate, showcasing bitter citrus and clean toffee malts in a fantastic fashion. The flavors blend beautifully together in an almost extreme fashion, revealing the beers immense body in an exhilarating, challenging and explosive way. 1,657 charactersaleigator, Jul 23, 2015

Feel: Phenomenal. Drinks like a 6% pale ale. Light bodied for this big of a beer.

This bad boy was on point!
Poured a murky orange with a nice white, resinous head. The smell had me catching a tropical scent: papaya, guava, citrus fruits. The taste was more of that tropical feel, just gushing. Sweet on the front end with a warm alcohol finish that lingered for a bit. Perfectly carbonated, on the verge of being creamy.

4.76/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75I must have gotten a stale bomber.  Because the majority of reviews I read made this sound like I was going to love this beer.. Citrus, pine, hoppy all of that usually equals a beer I love.  This lacked all of that. Instead it was overly malty and stale tasting.   I'll have to try this one again hopefully fresher and/or on tap. 
So I amended my initial rating of 4.01.  I tried this on tap at Bigbys Pour House in Rolling Meadows.... What a difference a fresh beer makes.  The previous bomber I tried was 9 months old and usually I would have passed that old of a beer up. However I was trying forever to find PF, so I bought her anyways and my above review proves I was wrong in doing so, since the tap fresh PF was GLORIOUS, I officially understand that hype!  
Have since found PF again in a bomber, this time fresh.  AMAZING!!!  Again, anyone that says differently is just wrong.... Beer, especially craft WILL GO BAD sooner rather than later. 951 charactersmmahanna41, Jun 22, 2015

4.09/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Picked this one up at 1000 Liquors during the 2015 AAA National Instructor's Seminar.  22oz. bottle served in a Three Floyds Teku at 47 degrees.  Pours a dull burnt orange hue with a hazy clarity and a frothy, 1.5 inch, cream-colored head.  Head eventually settles into a rocky, half inch cap with textured swaths and bands of lacing present during the tasting.  Great nose on this beer - citrus and tropical fruit as well as a hint of grapefruit pith and a slight candied quality.  Taste consistent with nose; however, heavy on the malt profile and candied quality with a slight kiss of ethanol towards the backend and a light, residual medicinal character at the finish.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to medium) with a slightly oily texture and a mild carbonation.  Overall, very good; however, I'd prefer a little less malt to the body and slightly more carbonation.  That said, a very nice brew if you have the opportunity to try it. 954 charactersJwale73, Jun 16, 2015

4.46/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5I thought I had reviewed this but apparently not. It's going to be biased since I love FFF, and this is my favorite style and has basically reached god status with me.
L - from bomber into a tulip. Dark sunset orange with a generous head. Fades over a couple minutes with good lacing. Almost perfect.
S - hops, obviously. I guess a little malty? Citrus mostly and some resiny goodness at the end. Some toasted marshmellow and fresh grass too. Just kidding - I don't smell any of that shit besides citrus. Smells good but not as good as some other FFF offerings.
T - hello citrus hops. This is basically perfect for me. Maybe a teeny bit too sweet? That's the only fault, and I'm reaching.
F - very nice carbonation, thick and oily but doesn't coat your mouth forever. It's nice.
O - so glad they are putting this out more than once. If I had to drink 3 beers for the rest of my life, this would make the list. It's outstanding. 932 charactershoody711, Jun 11, 2015

Smell: typical dipa. Nothing impressive nor original here. Citrus aromas, light papaya and mango. 
Taste: sweet upfront then bitter aftertaste but it fades when it gets warm. This is not the best dipas. People should drink Ghost in the machine, Pliny,  kuhnhenn dripa, hopslam. This beer is tasty but doesn't worth a 100 score here. This is nothing special or unique. 
Mouthfeel: slightly carbonated and juicy. 
Overall: good beer but not worth chasing down. This is not 3f best beer. 561 charactersBIN29, Jun 10, 2015

Combination of bubble sizes.  The curtains on this one melt very slow.  Layers of fine lace.  This has to be one of the best looking Imperial/DIPAs I have ever seen.  Abner is up there as well.
Smell:  With a deep draw through my nose, I can almost smell some sweet alcohol.  This one is juicy.  Sweet oranges, tropical fruit, and flowers come to mind.  
Taste:  Sweet tropical fruit with a little bit of sweet background citrus.  This has a special blend of hops and malts.  There is noticeable heat + a spark at the finish.   
Feel:  Thick.  Even chewy.  Fine dense carbonation literally fills the bottom of mouth.  The small sips transform into dense foam.  For me, this is the best mouth feel I have had in an American Double/Imperial IPA. 
Overall - This is a tremendous beer...I do not feel like I need to say more.  Go out there and try it, you should not be disappointed. 970 charactersmabermud, May 10, 2015

4.24/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a hazy orange with a dense white head.  A pure unfiltered look.  Monster citra hop aroma: orange peel, mango, tangerine, papaya.  Juicy and tropical.  Taste is well balanced with  robust hops and bitterness, but a chewy, creamy, bready malt base.  The initial wave of flavor is refreshing and spot on.  
Overall, this is outstanding.  Fuller body than others of its style and it is quite balanced for an IIPA, but a terrific take on the style.  Right there with Dreadnaught as my favorite FFF has to offer. 513 charactersBosoxfan20, Apr 29, 2015

Really nice looking beer, a hazy peach color with a decent sized, bubbly head.  Smells of citrusy, dank hops with lots of grapefruit, some malt, hint of a sweet smell.  Taste follows the nose with the grapefruit.  More malt forward than the nose, but this is a really well balanced beer.  Good amount of bitterness up front, the malt backbone mellows that on the back end.  Delicious.  Very nice body and feel, very satisfying.  A little dry, more than usual for the style.
This is an excellent beer, a top notch DIPA.  Will be a repeat purchase when available.  Well worth your hard earned bucks. 645 charactersstortore, Apr 24, 2015

I'm resigned to the fact that certain flavor profiles must not be compatible with my palate. This was a bottle less than 30 days old, and was reminiscent of stale, cold french onion soup. Looked nice, didn't smell terrible, but the taste of garlic and onion was overwhelming. Bad bottle? I don't know. Maybe I'll find out someday. As much I adore Gumballhead and Zombie Dust, this was an epic 3F's failure for me. I'll chalk it up as an "it wasn't meant to be" experience and move on. 522 charactersglass_house, Apr 07, 2015

Look = 4.5 Pours a cloudy golden orange color with 2.5 fingers of thick, creamy off white head.  Great retention and lace.
Aroma = 5.0 Hops everywhere!  Citrus and tropical fruit notes are everywhere!  Big orange juice, pineapple, mango - really strong and smells great!
Taste = 5.0 Terrific.  Citrus and tropical fruit flavors dominate, really juicy.  Hop forward with a little sweet malt balance. A moderate bitterness on the finish.
Feel = 4.5 Light feel for a DIPA, not syrupy but also not watery.  Low resin, juicy.  Medium bodied with medium carbonation; fits the flavor profile well.
Drinkability = 4.75 Incredibly drinkable DIPA, low bitterness and terrific flavor profile.  Could sip on all day long.
Overall = 4.825 New highest rated beer for me.  Terrific in all categories. 861 characterskbwalters, Apr 04, 2015

Served on tap at Mikkeller Bar Bangkok. 
Earthy spicy fruity garlicky hops. Really rich and sweet. I'm not sure I love this. It's a bit...much? It tries to do too much. The aftertaste though is overwhelming. It doesn't end. I can't get it to go away. It clings through water, through pickles. It's a candied papaya sort of flavor with drying bitterness. Candy like and increasingly pleasant the more I drink. What a DIPA. Color me impressed, but one is enough forever. 490 charactersAgentMunky, Apr 01, 2015

A) Cloudy, hazy, orange.  moderate foam head.
S) lots of tropical fruits and melons.  lots of complexity in smell though.  One of the best smelling beers out there.  Bready Three Floyds malt bill/ yeast is there though.  You know its a 3Floyds  Just a wonderful beer to drink.  I love Dreadnaught but this tastes better.
f) Full, chewy, resin
o) Outstanding beer.  One of the best DIPA out there.  Would love a heady vs PF comparison.  For me this was better as I tried to remember the Heady .  It is a lovely beer, the label although cool does not give the beer justice because it is not harsh in any way.  Instead it is a fruity testament to hops.  With the famed 3Floyds malt and yeast.  Grandslam for me.
T) Damn its good.  All those tropical flavors hit home.  Mango, melon, a little grapefruit.  bitterness is low despite the quoted 100IBU.  Alcohol is non-existent.  You could sip it or crush it almost. 1,016 charactersJnashed, Mar 16, 2015

Juicy tropical hops, notes of mango, papaya, pineapple, peach, and some pine.
Very tropical, flavor matches aroma quite well with notes of mango, pineapple, grapefruit, resin, and earthy pine.
Medium-bodied, light carbonation, chewy, juicy and tropical resin, and some piney bitterness.
Overall, not the best DIPA, but certainly a top 10 for me. 460 characterslarryarms847, Mar 08, 2015

Appearance is that typical Floyd’s slightly hazy orange-copper color with an internal radiance that may have been fueled by my excitement that they re-tapped this beer after running out of one of their guest handles. A thin off-white cap remains in place for the duration and leaves rings. Aroma is tropical fruit, pineapple, orange, grapefruit peel, resin, pine, and caramel. Taste is medium citrus hop bitterness trailed by light malt sweetness. Medium bodied, oily and syrup thick texture, average to soft carbonation, finishes dry and bitter. 593 charactersSierraFlight, Mar 03, 2015

I don't know if I've ever enjoyed a beer more; perhaps the only instance close to this may have been trying Sip of Sunshine on tap at Prohibition Pig in Vermont - though the awesomeness of that is so much less in your face compared to what you get at 3 Floyds.
The beer itself... so juicy. So hoppy. So well balanced for a beer this big. Still blown away. 467 charactersIvanhoes_Backpack, Feb 25, 2015

A- Pours a medium amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves a broken ring behind.
S- Juicy, tropical fruit aroma brings to mind passionfruit, guava and pineapple.
T- Fruity in the onset with a bitterness that is certainly present yet perfectly restrained.  Alcohol is incredibly well-concealed and there's just enough malt backbone to provide complementary sweetness leading to an overall balance that's damn near perfect.  After multiple sips, the bitterness starts to slowly creep in but still stays at bay for the most part.  Great hop burps.
M- Tangy and bright with medium carbonation and a lightish body.  There's also a bit of creaminess upon further inspection.
O- How is this 10.5%? I can't wrap my head around how deliciously smooth this is while also being so high gravity.  Astonishing.  Just when I thought I've encountered all the wonderful and complex layers of flavor a DIPA has to offer, something like this comes along to show me that there are still a lot of innovations left to be seen in the style. 1,328 charactersImmortale25, Jan 31, 2015

S: Very strong hops with a lot of pine behind it. Slight smell of citrus and malt back. Very good smelling
T: Not my favorite. This is a much more piney and bitter ipa. You get smacked in the face with hops and has a strong biterness. Still  tastey and has a delicious after taste. Slight booze
M: 3F beers always have that perfect carbonation but this one has a bit of a stickyness to it.
O: A very bitter and piney Ipa def not my favorite but still a great beer. 556 charactersGinjaSlice, Jan 25, 2015

Tasted on March 6, 2016 in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt 6 oz bomber bottled on 2-15-16.  Tasted on April 21, 2017 in a Spiegelau IPA glass from a 1 pt 6 oz bomber bottled on 4-11-17.  Described and labeled as a pale ale by 3 Floyds.  Look is cloudy honey amber with a thick off-white head that dissipates into thin foam and leaves thick lingering lacing.  Smell is apricot, grapefruit, mango, papaya, peach, pineapple, tangerine, bitter hops with bread and caramel malt aromas.  Taste is a reflection of the nose with subtle bitter hop and sweet caramel and biscuit malt flavors.  Feel is medium to full in body that is smooth, creamy and somewhat dry in the finish. 740 charactersHopheadjeffery, Jan 24, 2015

22 oz bottle, dated 1/14/15, poured into a teku
A- A clear bright golden orange with a two finger white head.
S- Damn this is good, tropical fruits, grapefruit rinds, citrus, hint of mint, pine, and some sweet malts and a touch of alcohol reminding me that this is 10.50% ABV.
T- Slightly boozy and some caramel malts that bring a really nice balance to the huge hop profile, big piney finish, bright citrus, some tropical fruits.
M- Smooth, medium body.
O- Another awesome beer from 3 Floyds.  Definitely worth seeking out, alcohol is not fully hidden, but it actually works in balancing the beer.  Wish I had more! 698 characterslarryi86, Jan 23, 2015

Smell is very citrus forward. Lots of orange and grapefruit, some mango. Also a decent amount of bready, maltiness on the nose. 4
Taste follows the nose. Bitter orange peel and grapefruit. HUGE bitterness. Like holy cow this is bitter. Big malt backbone too, but no real sweetness except for a slight candied orange flavor. The finish is malty and bitter (if that makes sense) and lasts quite a while. The ABV (10.5%) is not hidden. 4.25
Mouthfeel is very creamy for a DIPA in my opinion. 4
Overall a good beer, but I will probably stick to other IPAs in the future. Glad I got to try it. 3.75 666 charactersBigRedDog, Jan 18, 2015

Oh my what a great smelling beer. Tangerine, oranges, and grapefruit. Pine. Juicy. 
Taste follows suit. Backed by sweet caramel, the citrus and pine are fresh and strong. It makes me want to gulp it. 
Mouthfeel is full, soft, and clean. Carbivation is perfect. Juicy.

4.94/5  rDev +10.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Serving: 22 oz. bomber poured into a tulip. Dated 12/19/2014, making this just over 3 weeks old. 
A: Pours a nice, bright orange color. Foamy 1-finger white head that sticks around. Has a nice haziness to it. Looks alive in the glass. 
S: Huge! Mango, pineapple, papaya, tangerine, peach. This beer explodes right out of the bottle and fills the room instantly. 
T: Oh man, wow! Huge tropical fruits up front. Mango, pineapple, peach, tangerine, papaya. Subtle hints of grapefruit zest. A touch of fruit juice sweetness on the back end. The flavor is unbelievably strong and just lights up your taste buds.
M: Here is where this beer sets itself apart from other DIPAs. Near perfect balance of bright tropical hop flavor and just the right balance of malt backbone. The not-too-bitter finish sticks around for just the right amount of time before fading and leaving a clean finish. I hate when big DIPAs get too sticky and resinous and just sit on your tongue. This one is so crisp and clean, and the alcohol is so well-hidden, it almost drinks like an IPA or pale ale, but is still full-bodied and powerful like a DIPA should be. It's kind of like Zombie Dust on steroids. 
O: Ever since I first had this over a year ago, it's been my favorite DIPA of all-time. And I've revisited Heady since, I've tried Pliny and had Double Sunshine twice, etc. I've had most of them. But this one just stands apart for me. The aroma is huge and alive, the flavors are so bright and complex, and the mouthfeel and finish are just so perfectly balanced. My only knock would be that it can be a touch too sweet on the back end. Not cloying sweet, but like a ton of fruit juice was poured into your glass sweet. A minor complaint in an otherwise perfect beer. I know this beer has been Top 50 for a while, but I'm shocked that I can just pick it off the shelf with no limits every time they put it out. This beer is world-class and deserves a lot more attention in the DIPA world. 
Recommendation: Must-try, hop-head or not. 2,013 charactersSparty1224, Jan 14, 2015

A. Golden staw color with nice two inch head. Great clarity, head retention, and lacing.
S. Pineapple, tropical fruits, with an undertone of pine. One of the best aromas I have encountered on a double ipa.
T. Amazing, this beer meets all expectations. Citrus, and Southern Hemisphere hops great tasting beer. It was balanced with a little more hop bitterness than malt, which is what I prefer. 
M. Carbonation was nice yet easy and dry on the finish, taste stays on the tongue for a second.
O. Easily one of the best IIPA's I have ever had. There is a reason Three Floyds is known for great beers. Get this beer if you can!

A. A beautiful light amber color with a white 2 finger foamy head. Great head retention. Very nice full ring lacing.
S. Very tropical fruit aroma mixed with pine.
Very inviting.
T. Wow. Very nice citrusy and tropical fruit character with a good amount of hoppy bitterness.  Bitterness retains for a minute but finished very clean making you want more.
M. Nice light carbonation to start that picks up after the swallow and just hangs around long enough. Perfect for a DIPA.
O. One of the best DIPA's in the world in my books. Excellent balance of sweet to bitter taste. Looks great. Smells better. Feels great in the mouth but still finishes pretty clean. Very well done beer. 715 charactersIPAGeorge, Dec 22, 2014

Appearance is gorgeous. I'd love a little fluffier, more sustained head, but don't we all just want a little more head? ;)
Aroma is ridiculous. Up there with the best. So juicy, resinous and downright tropical. No alcohol or harsh aromas to muddle the wonderful bouquet of this beer.
Flavor doesn't quite follow the aroma, but it is by no means far off. I have a sensitive palate to sweet beers, and this tip toes on the line of being too sweet. However, this bottle IS a month old and while it is still delicious, we all know IPAs get sweeter as the hops diminish with every day since bottling/canning/kegging. THAT BEING SAID...the tropical fruit plays with the sweetness and gives it a literal 'juicy' aspect. After it has sat for about 10 minutes, I get a lot of oranges, making this a literal 'Permanent Mimosa'. Very good. Just wish it was a little more resinous.
Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with soft carbonation and a long finish. Mouthfeel isn't syrupy or cloying in terms of the sweetness level.
Overall, this is definitely up there in the conversation for top 10 DIPAs out there. Not in my personal top 5, but certainly in my top 10. A real treat and so glad I got to try this badboy! 1,366 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Dec 12, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +6.5%I am not quite as knowledgeable as some but I know what I like. So do my bartenders Joel and Nick at Bigbys Pour House in Addison Illinois. Most times I walk in and a beer just appears. The past two days it has been Permanent Funeral. the beer is served in a small glass due to the 10.5% ABV. This fine brew does not taste like or go down like some of the higher ABV brews. It has a very nice carmel color and the head lingers a while. While it is a Double/Imperial IPA and I would have not chosen this initially believing that it would be strong and all hopped up it was DELICIOUS!! One of my favorites the past two months. Give it try. 637 charactersstyman, Dec 03, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +6.5%Quick review here.
Pours with a thin head, grows slightly. Normal for this level of alcohol. Some light lacing fading into legs around the glass. Beautiful hazy gold color, copper out of direct light. 
Nose is heavy, heavy fruit, primarily mangoes and a hit of citrus. Reminds me of citra and mosaic, but I don't know if mosaic was even commercially available when this recipe was developed. Maybe not even citra! Anyway, delightful nose, does not belay any alcohol notes.
Sips very bitter up front, but quickly assuaged by the aromatic hopping: hints of pine and resin complement the more dominant fruit. The malt base seems entirely to accentuate the hops: nothing overwhelming, but full enough to even the alcohol and hops.
Overall, a very big beer that's incredibly well made. Perhaps a tad thin, but this is easily the best DIPA I've had in a while. 858 charactersVincentFrey, Nov 25, 2014

5/5  rDev +12.1%Was able to drink this bottle when it was only 7 days old. 
Pours a rich and dark orange. Looks very much like a DIPA.
The nose is wonderful. So much citrus and pine. Pineapple and grapefruit. Very sweet smelling. Exactly what I look for in the aroma of an ipa.
The taste is absolutely amazing. This tastes like fresh, wet hops. The pure hop flavor shines through in this as much as any DIPA I have ever had (reminds me of Pliny in that way). Tropical fruits are on the tongue just like the nose: grapefruit, mango, sweet hone, etc. There is some pine and dankness as well. The perfect balance for me. As much as I love Dreadnaught, Alpha King, Zombie Dust, Arctic Panzer Wolf, etc., this is the best FFF offering imo.  An absolutely stunning beer that you should definitely get your hands on. 796 charactersKsoden1186, Nov 21, 2014

Pours rich copper/amber color with a frothy 2 finger head that SLOWLY retreats to a nice film. Mega laces.  The nose starts with grapefruit and pineapple, minor hints of vanilla, barley, and some booze. The taste follows the nose with a huge citrus profile. The taste does not go to the pine/resin end of the hop profile. Very smooth, full body and high carbonation. A little creamy and silky feel.
Damn this is near perfect.  A fairly light malt backbone rides a huge citrus smell AND taste. A wonderful crafted ale. Very strong across all metrics. 590 charactersmacher0, Oct 26, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +6.5%Poured from a bomber into snifter.
A-  Pours a slightly cloudy orange with a light golden hue.  Nice finger of white frothy head.  Plenty of carbonation and lacing present.
S-  Lots of fruity hops up front on the nose.  Orange peel, tangerine, peach and mango present.  A decent amount grain is also detectable as well as a hint of cut grass.  Alcohol is also there a smidge.
T-  As the smell indicates, lots of tropical fruit goodness in every creamy mouthful.  This is followed with a little bitterness from the hops.  I got a little cracker, bread, or biscuit taste foloowed by pine.  Strong tasting, but refreshing at the same time.
M-  Medium bodied overall, but definitely on the fuller side of the DIPA spectrum.  Very smooth and almost a little creamy, but the carbonation perfectly balances that out.  Has a slight dryness on the aftertaste.  
O-  One of the better DIPAs out there.  I enjoy and appreciate a lot of what FFF delivers and this was no letdown.  I thoroughly enjoy Zombie Dust and this would be comparable to Zombie Dust on steroids.  Very bold and packs a punch, which is what is expected.  My only complaint is the same I always have with FFF, I wish it was more easily obtainable.  Great beer. 1,224 charactersEveningCordial, Oct 25, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +6.5%This beer is so smooth for 100 IBU year beer and 10.5 ABV. I didn't research this before I drank it. I simply poured my glass full and started enjoying it. I thought it was rather smooth with a slight bit of heat to it that I knew was a higher ABV. I drank the bomber in a little less than an hour. 
It smelled great. Malt presence was strong, but not overpowering like a lot of big IPA's. I really get disappointed when an ipa tastes like a malt bomb. I would drink this again...and again...and again. This beer is in my top 20 ever had. 539 charactersDroopy487, Sep 20, 2014

4.69/5  rDev +5.2%Bottle in trade from Joe. Thanks buddy! Been wanting to try this one for a while now. Bottle dated 8/20/14 poured 9/11/14. Pours very slightly hazy golden orange colored with a huge creamy and fluffy white head. Aroma is big time juicy citrus hops, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, grass, sweet malt and very reminiscent of Dreadnaught (though it's been a while since I had that one). Flavor is big on the dry pine bitterness with sweet mango and grapefruits, some sweet malt backing but this is much lighter than expected. Lingering dry bitterness on the tongue. This seems to bridge the gap of the super bitter and the sweet tropical malty DIPA extremes and comes off very nicely. Medium plus bodied, very resinous, dry finish, with medium carbonation. This is excellent. 771 charactersBMMillsy, Sep 12, 2014

A:  Poured into a tulip.  Beer poured a slightly hazy beautiful orange color.  It had a nice fingers worth of slightly off white head that dissipated somewhat quickly.  Left nice sticky lacing down the sides of the glass as I drank.
S:  Huge aroma from the Citra hops.  Lots of tropical fruit like pineapple and mango.  Not much in the way of malt in the smell.
T:  The taste follows the aroma.  TONS of Citra hop flavor.  Nice pineapple and mango flavors with some citrus in there too.  There was a nice underlying malt sweetness that I enjoyed.  NOt much alcohol heat despite the high ABV
M:  Medium bodied.  Its not too dry which is nice, it lends that nice underlying sweetness to the beer without them adding a bunch of specialty malts that would muddle the hops.
O: This beer and Dreadnaught are two of my absolute favorite DIPA's, though Arctic Panzer Wolf is right up there too.  I love the way this beer delivers that huge blast of hop flavor, but has a nice malt body too.  Great beer, and one of my absolute favorites. 1,137 charactersBrams17, Aug 26, 2014

1 pint, 6 oz brown bomber bottle in typical FFF style and shape. A ridiculously metal looking label with the head of a slain werewolf(swords still lodged into its skull). Then again, maybe this is how this beast looks when it kicks down a persons door to do its nightly business. Either way, its a pretty intense looking wolf. Poured into a nonic style pint glass. 
A -Pour was of a golden orange with a ton of funk floating about. I'm talking big particles and that only means a grand stand of flavor and aromas. Big off white head settles fluffy and never goes away leaving phenomenal stick to the walls of my nonic glass. 
S - big fruit forward aroma to start. Sweet tangerine and pineapple with hints of soft mango really grab the nose. Biscuity malt balance the aroma nicely giving off a sweet honey character toward the back end. A touch of alcohol spice is noticeable as this warms.
T - much the same as the nose. Big time tangerine, pineapple, sweet grapefruit, and a big splash of mango with apricot working in the backbone. The biscuity bread like malt does well balancing some pretty big sweetness going on. It's just a massive candied fruit bomb with the hops doing most of the work. Not bitter hops but luscious sweet fruity hops with a solid biscuit malt backbone. Some alcohol Booziness does creep up as it warms but only adds to its brilliance.
M - full bodied and thick as you'll find. This is straight up FFF at its best and adds yet another gem to its already stacked ipa/double ipa lineup. Coats the mouth almost shockingly well and leaves you thirsting that next sip of sweet goodies. Just a treat to drink. 
O - Permanent Funeral is a grand offering from Three Floyds. It's definitely one worthy of grabbing a place in their year round or seasonal bottlings. Just when you think these guys can't add anymore brilliance in terms of a big ipa they slap everyone In the mouth and create an all out jewel of a brew like this. It's def my 2nd favorite brew from them behind only the infamous dreadnaught, but both offer different qualities and that's great to see. No doubt Permanent Funeral will go down as an all time great for years to come. 2,324 charactersBradtheGreat7, Jul 20, 2014

Hard to see through orange body. White sticky head. 
Sweet caramel malt laden citrus/tropical fruity aroma.
Quite malty but I assume it is pretty fresh even halfway across the globe. It does pack quite a punch of hops though. 
Smooth and creamy and supremely bitter. 285 charactersMattSweatshirt, Jul 04, 2014

A - Beautiful vibrant orange color. Brightly opaque capturing all of the light in it's brilliantly dry hopped body with a perfect fine white head and moderate lacing.
S - Extremely strong hop fragrance with tons of tropical fruit that you would ever want all packed into one glass. Mostly a papaya, pineapple, and mango mixture that I can barely describe the awesomeness. Could smell it as I opened the bottle. Like a grownups candy it makes your mouth water. Definitely the best smelling beer ever!
T - Beastly hop flavor with a full fruit bouquet hop character with tons of tropical fruit, citrus, some pine, and dank resin hops to round yield one of the greatest beers ever made. If you like tropical flavored hops by the bucket full this is a great beer. There is some malt and the slightest amount of alcohol but it's all masked by the hop explosion on your taste buds. The bitterness seems perfect without detracting from the amazing hop flavor. This is clearly a Citra lovers wet dream. I would alike it to Zombie Dust that has been infused with gamma rays and turned into a Zombie Hulk!
M - The perfect medium mouth-feel with perfect carbonation. Basically only the hops sit on the tongue but some how it isn't too much and I never wanted to stop drinking it.
Overall, probably the best beer I've ever had. Amazing aroma, flavor, feel, appearance, and anything else you would desire in a DIPA. This brew is absolutely perfect for every hop head out there that loves tropical flavored hops. This beer went down fast and I wish I could have it's grace in my presence again. Super rare but I would shell out big $$ to get this again, any day.

color - darker gold/ orange
Smell - great hops across the spectrum - Citrus, pine, dank, floral
Taste - Big body, but balanced by the great hops. some maltiness and also grapefruit and citrus that almost make for a crisp finish, but not quite.
mouthfeel - creamy and a little sticky 458 charactersJerryG, Jun 17, 2014

Bottle to 3F Teku
22 oz
Thanks to KevanB for this one.
App- Out of the bottle, this is a blend of dark orange with a little golden yellow towards the base. A bigger 1-1/2 in head that was a wee bit frothy forms and then leaves more of a soap bubble film along the side of the glass. A bit of a ring forms and stays for quite a while.
Smell- Its a battle on the nose. I think this one is starting to slide a little but its got a good sweet fruited nose with a little bit of rind and skin tropical must. A bit more mango and guava and balanced by a candy coated sweetness. The malts are fighting to come through and battle with the hops to take over. 
Taste- Its a bit more caramel than I wouldve thought. I like the balance on this one between sticky candy hops and a sweet malt backbone with a bit of grassy herbal flavor and more of a tropical fruit note. Its not overtly one way or another, just a good big beer. A sipper for sure. Im halfway done and its creeping on me. For some reason as it warms I am getting a small raisin flavor.
Mouth- A very big and solid medium body on this one. Even bordering on a bit thick. The carbonation level is a bit frothy and riddled with caramel. The residual feel is more of a candy like caramel. Dissipates quickly and leaves more sweetness and hop oil around.
Drink- Well Kevan has struck again and landed a long time want for me. Its always good to have some friends in the midwest. I enjoyed this beer and was pretty damn good. A bigger DIPA for sure. 1,521 charactersFosterJM, Jun 17, 2014

A- Golden Straw body with a single finger white head
S - Citra HOPS! Sweet, citrus and flowery
T- WOW, Again I wish can't wait to try this fresh to taste some of the shaper hops, but this is crazy good in terms of the hop bill. Just like the smell, I get sweet, citrus and flowers. No sharp pine to speak of.
M - Solid IPA feel. I may be so distracted by the hops flavors that I'm giving extra point to the mouthfeel.
O- Next time I see this beer, I am going to buy as many as I can and drink them all as fresh as possible. 640 charactersPBRmeasap1980, Jun 14, 2014

A - Pours a quite hazy, pale orangey golden color, almost fruit juicy in appearance with a thick cap of off-white, dense foam and lots of sticky lacing on the glass.
S - Thick and heavy hop aroma, plenty fruity with tropical notes of pineapple, citrusy grapefruit and resiny pine. Firm malt backbone too...sweet maltose, caramel, a bit worty in aroma. A fair amount of yeasty esters too...contributes to the overall fruitiness of the beer.
T - I get a big piney hop blast on the first sip that plays off of the sweet, sugary, maltose'y malt profile. The malt gives this an impression of almost a hop syrup. Not especially bitter, rather focusing on the hop flavors - again tropical in nature with a mix of pine and some slightly background citrus. Mildly buttery, caramelly, noticeable alcohol, estery, lightly yeasty.
M - Has the feel of being a very big beer...which it is. Thick and syrupy in body with a lowish/medium carbonation that brings some life and shows a tendency towards foamy in feel. Has a sweet candy on bitter and fruity hop flavor that is mildly dessert-like. Alcohol is noticeable, but not distracting - you do know that this has a bit of a kick to it though.
O - Its been a while since I've had a bottle of Dreadnaught, but this seems reminiscent of that fine beer in my recollections. Malt profile is pure Three Floyds - their bigger IPA/DIPA offerings seem pretty similar in this regard. I think the yeast used in common among many of these beers too. I find Three Floyds and Stone have very distinctive and identifiable fermentation profiles that I feel confident I can pickup blind pretty easily.

A: Deep apricot in color with two fingers of creamy off-white head.
S: Juicy citrus, apricot, grapefruit, stone fruit, some malt
T: Citrusy hops, creamy malts, faint alcohol in the finish
M: Medium body and low carbonation, almost creamy from the malts, which are perfectly balanced with the hops.
O: Probably my favorite Three Floyds beer available in bomber-format. A really solid, gushing, citrus-forward IPA, easily up there with the likes of PsuedoSue, etc. 515 charactersHalfbrother83, May 26, 2014

I bought it after a small taste of a guy that was in line at the beer kiosk! Holy moly, this beer is awesome. I really like ZD, but PF is just flat out AMAZING!
A- Has a reddish orange tinge to it. Looks almost like a Killian's Irish Red.
S- Has a smell of fermenting fruits with a hoppy/boozy finish.
T- The taste was surprisingly smooth. I was expecting a bit of harshness, but one I was gravely mistaken. Had hints of fruit (honeydew), and almost a legume taste to it (as weird as that sounds, it was utterly delicious).
M- It is a bit thicker than a stereotypical beer, but feels great on the palate
O- I would rate this beer as one of my favorites. Venturing out into the world beyond blue moon and fat tire is sure exciting. I'm thankful that I live within an hour drive of FFF. This craft beer stuff is pretty tasty but can get expensive pretty quickly. 934 charactersSvyturys30, May 21, 2014

Hop-forward aroma, which gave way to a very well blended DIPA. The malt comes through with a sweeter, caramel flavor to balance the slight bitterness from the hops. Overall, well balanced and delicious. Glad I could try it fresh from the source! 350 charactersDawgboned37, May 20, 2014

A nectar-like IPA which I'm stoked to try, poured into a nonic pint glass.
A: Orange-apricot in color, cloudy, with a healthy dose of suspended yeast. Looks like sea monkeys live in there. A small, sudsy head completely recedes leaving almost no lacing.
S: The nose is obviously hop-forward, resiny and citrusy. Lots of rindy grapefruit and orange. Malt-backbone is ample and caramelly. Booze is there but not overpowering, barely warming my nose.
T/M: Citrus and bitter rind at the front, along with a touch of pine. Caramelly malts quickly even things out, leaving an orange-y undertone. Not as oily and resinous as you'd expect for a 10.5% ale, with adequate carbonation keeping the mouthfeel lively and refreshing. Flavors are incredibly harmonized, with a surprisingly quick and clean finish. Yum.
What an incredible beer. I've been disappointed (slightly) with some of the coveted, non-West Coast-style IPA's, but I'd put this up against just about any of my favorite IPA's. Refreshing, layered, balanced, drinkable (dangerously)...no hype in this one, this is the real deal. 1,135 charactersrand, May 09, 2014

A – Mildly hazy, golden straw color, big fluffy white head, great retention, light carbonation.
S – Citrus forward. Pretty spectacular. Lots of orange, grapefruit, and other citrusy goodness. 
T – A lot of citrus. Grapefruit is the main one, a little orange, a tiny hint of pine, and just a small hint of malt backbone to round it out. 
M – Pretty perfect. Light bubbles tickle the tongue. Just the right amount of bitterness. Not sure how it can be better for a big DIPA. No alcohol detected. 
O – The best FFF beer I’ve had thus far. Hell, it might be the best beer I’ve had period. 669 charactersPSU_Mike, May 01, 2014

Less nose than I expected, could pick up some grapefruit and pine but not overwhelming. At first was slightly disappointed. Seemed a bit unrefined and bitter. After sitting for five minutes and warming up the citrus starts to come out and evens out. Half way through bottle it was what I had hoped for. Overall a wonderful dipa and worthy of its rating. Definitely not an everyday beer or for faint of heart but one I hope to secure again in the future. 572 charactersNW_IPAHEAD, Apr 19, 2014

Smell: Wow.  Huge, citrus fruit aroma (orange, tangerine, grapefruit).  Subtle malt backbone that comes through more as it warms.
Taste: Much like the nose - strong citrus fruits of orange, tangerine, grapefruit, and maybe some pineapple.  Tastes almost like fruity candy.  Some biscuity malt.
Feel: Medium bodied and slightly creamy.  Hides the high ABV well.

Appearance is beautiful, cloudy, murky orange/amber haze. One-inch thick white, fluffy head which dissipated gradually to persistent white collar, with ample tiny bubbles and lots of very sticky lacing throughout. The nose is incredibly pungent, yielding a malty citrus/mango/banana/pineapple & piney scent. Sadly, the impression on the palate does not quite match the promising nose, as the malts and heat from the alcohol tend to overwhelm. Mouthfeel is nice, full and supple, with appropriate carbonation.
All said and done, a very good DIPA, but could benefit from a little more floral citrus and balance on the palate. Well done nonetheless. 717 charactersJohnParadee, Apr 16, 2014

S: A rich blanket of tropical fruit and caramel malt. A touch of spicy pine, mango, peach and honey. Smells pretty nice.
T: Mango and peach upfront, with a resinous pine note creeping in around the middle. Finish brings a blanket of caramel malt and some lingering pine on the finish. From reading other reviews, it seems like this has faded a bit in the month and a half since it was bottled. Really glad to have tried it, but I'll have to try it again a bit fresher. 621 charactersnotchucknorris, Apr 15, 2014

4.68/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75The beer comes in a hazy golden orange.
The aroma is very hop juice. Very bright of grapefruit, citrus peel, pineapple, mango, some sweetness and a light bready malt. 
The flavor follows with a predominant note of clean light grapefruit and citrus peel. There’s a very pristine sweetness behind this beer without having a big malt backbone or substantial. The finish is again of grapefruit and a hint of herbal quality that Citra gives. 
This beer does not show itself as a 10.5% ABV through alcohol nor its malt body, which are the two usual giveaways. An clean drinking beer, which is on par for how Three Floyds constructs their hoppy beers. 
Despite the bottle being 5 months old, this held up being incredible well. Possibly the best hoppy beer from Three Floyds. 774 charactersdar482, Apr 06, 2014

Tasted on 3-Apr-14
Purchased from Warehouse Liquors in South Loop, Chicago for $15.
Bomber poured into Bottle Logic "can" glass.
Generally agree with most of the tasting notes reviewed on this beer. The bottle claims that this beer is a "pale ale." It doesn't note the ABV on the bottle, but I was able to gauge the ABV level from the buzz I was getting.
Overall, can't say I like this better than Zombie Dust because I tasted it almost a month after bottled. Still, it's one of the best "pale ales" I've ever tried. Hope they brew this one again. As a SoCal native, I don't have buyer's remorse for what I spent on this beer. Says a lot for a mere "pale ale." 681 charactersRollzroyce21, Apr 04, 2014

S-A huge, damp fog of herbal and zesty hoppiness. Hop perfume. Herbal/hempy hops, grapefruit concentrate, lemon peel, pine and some underlying tropical fruits. A wee bit of sweet bread.
T-I was smitten with the power and overall flavor of Permanent Funeral. It's electrifyingly hoppy. The first sip, my taste buds were stunned momentarily. The second sip and I began to pick up of its rather unique, and undeniably maniacal hop profile. It was so tangy and zesty; I got a bunch of lemon and pounds of nearly tart grapefruit. Then there was some candied orange hoppiness, resiny weed and pine. The caramel and bread crust malt is nearly disintegrated byt he power of those hops.
M-Body is surprisingly light for a beer of this ABV. Incredibly bitter. Long winded aftertaste. The slightest hint of alcohol. Tingly carbonation.
O-What a beer this one turned out to be. I loved its pure power and it's intriguingly unique hoppiness. Will probably never try this again and that makes this review very bittersweet. 1,118 charactersVelvetExtract, Apr 03, 2014

Review #900
The hazy, glowing, golden-amber liquid was topped by a frothy, one-finger tall, eggshell colored crown. Drippy rings of lacing cascaded down the glass.
The nose was super hoppy and bright. Fragrant tropical fruit notes dominated. Loads of mango, guava and papaya. Good dose of citrus as well. Orange peel was quite noticeable.
The flavor profile was even more impressive than the nose. Again, the hoppy, tropical fruit-like notes were in full effect. Tons of pineapple and guava. Lots of candy coated orange peel. Quite dank as well. Ruby red grapefruit notes appeared on the lingering finish and lent the beer a touch of bitterness. All in all, amazingly well balanced. As the beer warmed, the tropical fruit notes subsided and candy coated orange and grapefruit flavors took over.
The beer was amazingly slick, creamy and smooth on the palate. A fine, zippy effervescence gave the liquid a pillowy soft plushness. Really impressive.
Permanent Funeral is an amazingly hoppy double IPA that contains boatloads of those sweet, tropical fruit notes that I love so much. Three Floyds makes a number of excellent hoppy beers and this is one of their best. 1,208 charactersDamian, Apr 02, 2014

4.77/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Fresh bottle (less than a month old) poured into a tulip glass. Track one from Pig Destroyer's album Book Burner playing. The color is a beautiful light orange brown and retained less than a finger of head for a few minutes. Robust lacing. Gorgeous. At refrigerator temperature, I just got a nose full of grapefruit and assorted citrus, but as the beer warmed and the smell developed, I got a distinct sense of pepper to balance out the sweeter citrus. The Diplomat, track five playing. This really does taste like a heavier Zombie Dust, but still feels refreshing in the mouth, which is surprising. It's not heavy at all, unlike track 10, Baltimore Strangler. It's a concise sip: pepper, citrus, crisp finish, all in rapid succession. All in all, an incredible beer. I wish I had picked up more than just one of these when I saw it in the shop. 
By the way, in terms of pairing this with food - I drank the first half of the bomber while cooking and enjoying spaghetti and red sauce for dinner, and the second half with ice cream afterward. Honestly, I got the best flavor when I was just drinking the beer; pairing it feels like a conundrum. It doesn't have the same dry acidy bite that calls out for cheese that I sometimes get from other big pale ales, and it's not as sweet as I expected from some of the other reviews. (I am guessing that the people who find it extraordinarily sugary are not drinking it fresh.) I hope I find it again so I can get closer to matching it with the perfect partner. In short: get some of this if you can, and don't hold on to it - drink it! 1,578 charactersschris, Apr 01, 2014

Appearance: Deep golden honey color with a nice frothy head at first. 
Smell: This is quite possibly one of the best-smelling / most aromatic beers I've ever had. The smell is very fresh, hoppy, and fruity. Had my mouth watering as I poured it. 
Taste: This is a fantastic tasting beer. Ranks right up there as one of the best DIPAs I've ever tasted. 
Mouthfeel: There is a bit of a viscous feel to hit. Almost like theres a slight bit of honey in it. 
Overall: This beer was crazy good. Easily making it into my top 3. Can't wait to gave more! 587 charactersDomD1121, Mar 29, 2014

Tried it again and rated it up a bit but it's still a beer that starts off fantastic but somehow finishes in a less impressive way. Love the look and the texture, though. 471 charactersQbdoo, Mar 27, 2014

M - Fairly thick, slightly viscous mouthfeel, but still fairly drinkable for a high abv beer like this. Perfect for this style.
O - One of, if not my all-time favorite beers. I get this every chance I get. I cannot emphasize the importance of freshness with this one though. I've had it several times in a bomber a couple weeks after being bottled, and it was amazing; however, I had it on draft at a place that tapped it 6 months ago, and it was a completely different beer. The tangerine and citrus hop aroma and flavor were gone, and all that was left was malt and intense bitterness. 1,027 charactersDVoors, Mar 22, 2014

A - Pours a very hazy golden orange color, with a thin 1/2 finger of off-white head.
S - Has a unique, dank smell. Not really fruity, or earthy. Very unique, but not in a bad way. 
T/M - The taste is heavy on the tropical fruits. Mango, papaya and a little pineapple round out this DIPAs hop profile. A pretty big malt bill is the base of this beer, but it's just right to stand up the hops. Mouthfeel is a little thin, good carbonation.
O - A damn good DIPA! Great hop profile, and a very pleasant hop aftertaste left behind. For 10.5% abv, this has almost no trace of alcohol heat at all. I do however prefer my DIPAs to be a little heavier on the tongue, but that's the only negative I can come up with. Overall, this beer is a must for any lover of hops. 858 charactersRizalini, Mar 21, 2014

Three Floyd's Brewpub
Bottled: 3/4/14
4 Days old. Whew, potent! I can smell this beer from a yard away. Permanent Funeral is the color of heavily tarnished copper and the haze enough that there's no chance of seeing anything through the body. A weathered white head caps the surface and is bolstered by a constant stream of carbonation. Sheet lacing and heavy drink lines cover the glass. This looks like an IIPA I would enjoy consuming.
Holy shit this beer smells amazing! Straight up, potent, tropical fruits fill the air anywhere near the glass. Mango and papaya by the shovel full, peach and apricot as well. Not only are these fruits juicy ripe but the candy sweet dried versions are in there as well. A little Floridian citrus brings up the rear. Candied grapefruit and orange peel. Sugar cookie sweet malt and a dash of caramel make up the malt base and with some warming a peppery alcohol compliment creeps in. This beer smells like the best fruit salad you could imagine.
Those tropicals I mentioned in the nose are in full force in the flavor. Fresh and dried tropical fruits hit right off the bat and follow through to mid palate where peach, nectarine, and apricots take over. The finish tastes so much like dried apricots that I feel like I've just eaten a handful. It's crazy how each individual flavor is so distinct yet segues so seamlessly to the next. A touch of peppery alcohol spices up the finish. The malt brings a drizzle of light caramel. Undercurrents of citrus are again in play. Damn...
A beer this big should never, ever be this easy to drink. The body feels moderate and while there's a touch of powdery sweetness the finish dries up nicely. Not a whisper of viscosity or stickiness. The bitterness eventually numbs the tongue but never destroys the palate. Dangerous...
As I sat reviewing this beer, each number I entered I thought to myself "this can't be that good", and with each successive drink it was actually that good. An IIPA dripping with juicy fruits, an aroma that makes you salivate uncontrollably, assertive bitterness, and drinkability that will get you in trouble. This is the best IIPAs I've had in ages and probably prefer to Dreadnaught. Oh, and Pig Destroyer is fucking HEAVY! 2,248 charactersjoe1510, Mar 09, 2014

S - Not a huge aroma for this beer. A muted citrus (grapefruit and Pineapple?) with some malty and dank sweetness.
T - This definitely gets some points for showing no signs of the 10.5%. Suppose that's the permanent funeral part, dangerously drinkable. Balanced tasted with a citrusy fruit start and a medium hoppy finish. Again score gets a boost considering how well the alcohol is "hidden".
M - Smooth but not remarkable mouthfeel. Has a nice oily finish considering the alcohol.
O - Again did not blow me away with complex flavor and taste but the alcohol is hidden and I could drink alot of this. It has the potential to be a permanent funeral. 765 charactersWolberjs, Mar 06, 2014

Tawny gold in color, with a nice cap of bone-white foam.
Aroma- Heady bouquet of piney/citrus hops
Taste-Onrush of sweet, toasted malt, pineapple and candy sugar. Big hop profile not quite enough to keep things in balance, as this brew comes off a bit too sweet for my tastes. Cries out for a spicy food pairing to balance things out a bit. 385 charactershosehead83, Feb 23, 2014

A-dark gold. Not very transparent. Head is decent at about 1 inch and slightly off white.
S- sugar, pine, citrus. In that order. 
T- very similar to the smell. The sugary malt really takes over this beer. The hops are there but they are overwhelmed by malt. The fruit is also overwhelmed by the sugar. 
O- this beer us delicious but the sugaryness to it keeps it from being outstanding to me. This bottle was dated almost 2 months ago so that could have something to do with it. Will revisit this beer again more fresh. 563 charactersmlhyatt, Feb 10, 2014
4.77/5  rDev +7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours out a hazy burnt orange to yellow with one finger of suds that leave lacing around the pint glass. The small bubbles stay with the pour throughout the sipping process.
Smell is dank wet pine and orange/mango overtones. This is so bright in aroma and is one of the best beers I have ever put a nose to.
Taste is mellow orange/grapefruit peel and sweet mango with a sweet candy sugar finish. This is a very clean but sticky beer that cleanses the palate but leaves that dark dank pine tar.
Mouthfeel is great here. I poured this a little cold but it holds up well and goes down so darn smoothe. Only a slight stickiness can be had here and it is very sweet. Makes you want to drink this brew quickly. 
Overall I really like this PALE ALE from Three Floyds. Rivals Zombie Dust in hop flavor and drinkablilty. Well done! 822 characterspeabody, Feb 09, 2014

3.63/5  rDev -18.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.2522 oz bottle poured into a snifter.
10.5% ABV, 100 IBUs, 12/13/13 on bottle.
A - A generous dollop of dense foam rests on the hazed golden beer with little recession, helping maintain the beer's big hop aroma, while thin lace splatters on the glass when the beer is swirled.
S - Sharp, sticky hops brutally attack the nose with relentless resinous quality, stabbing with sugar-coated mango, pepper, and grapefruit rind and mild notes of earthy pine sap. Stiff malt provides an abundance of caramel sweetness, trailed by alcohol for a warming - a full-smelling body.
T - Permanent Funeral is hoppy, ridiculously f-ing hoppy, past the double IPA point of hoppy. The first sip though, strangely brings fourth the beer's massively sweet malt base; sweet to the point of being cloying. The second sip unleashes a wave of super bitter, tooth enamel-stripping pine sap-like hop resin with a secondary focus on tropical fruit notes that clashes on the tongue.
M - There's no beating around the bush with Permanent Funeral; this double IPA is one of the most bitter beer's I've experienced. It's like sucking on a hop cone. The hefty malt base tries to even the playing field but it's the lingering sticky sweetness that fights the onslaught of bitter hop resin for attention all throughout that really strikes a nerve with me. The alcohol warmth finishes out with a stomach-warming heat.
O - I'll be honest, Permanent Funeral isn't for me. Don't get me wrong, I love double IPAs, but this beer just goes a bit over-the-top. It's extreme hop profile and almost cloyingly sweet malt base clash on my tongue, finishing with neither component the victor, just a mash-up of one extreme vs. the other without compromise or collaboration. 1,728 charactersBeerFMAndy, Feb 09, 2014

S- dang! huge grapefruit, pineapple, mango, citrus-piney goodness that has the right amount of malt on the nose to know its gonna be good.. not getting much booze at all
T- Yep, this is anamazing beer..a nice grapefruit and hop bitterness,then a tad sweetness from the malt to balance it out and finishes with a nice citrus aftertaste with a slightly dry finish leaving you to want more.. just the right amount of balance on this beer everything I look for in a IPAs from the smell to the finish. For the ABV this is amazing
M- medium, the right amound of carb, and a slightly dry finish

A-Rich golden color, slightly cloudy with a finger of cream colored head that really has staying power, lots of lacing.
S-Galaxy hops? Strong, strong citra hop profile with grapefruit, orange, green pepper. Very similar to Zombie Dust and elements of the other pale ales in FFF's line-up.
T-Hop forward (no surprises there) with Galaxy hops standing out the most, the booze heat sneaks in with more citrus flavor underneath that, with grapefruit tang and hop bitterness on the finish with a very long, resiny aftertaste. Like a sampler platter of all the good elements of FFF's different pales.
M-Very resiny, a bit dry on finish, mild booze heat left my lips tingling a bit.
O-Fantastic example of what FFF is doing with pale ales. 760 charactersDersOne, Feb 06, 2014

I had rated this beer before but was unable to give it a proper review due to the setting.  This time I was able to stop and take some notes, so here we go.
Pours to a hazy amber gold in tone.  Head only achieves about an inch of off white head.  So often top pours try not to give you much head.  A little more here would have been nice, otherwise perfect.  Nose is flourishing citrus and floral hops explosion.  Super fragrant and it really gets the mouth watering.  Taste is just so big and luscious with the gambit of citrus going on here.  You get citrus rind, juicy freshness, and even the orange based meaty pulp plays in the flavor.  The flavor profile of this beer is just so vibrant and full.  Really on of the most flavorful and drinkable DIPA's I have ever enjoyed, and I've had a few.  Complex and not abrasive at all. 920 charactersSPLITGRIN, Feb 04, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Luminous orange color. Fragrant pine and mango on the nose. This is sticky, gooey, luscious hop business from start to finish. It's humid and tropical up in here -- just like you want a DIPA. The hops bite nice, but the malt rounds things off perfectly. This is extremely well balanced. A delightful beer, but falls just short of the hype for me. It may be the freshness factor: My bottle was 1.5 months old. I would definitely reevaluate with a slightly fresher offering. 472 charactersjjdc, Feb 02, 2014

L - served in a snifter;  brilliant amber body, creamy ivory head
S - awesome aroma! Sweet, ripe apricots, caramel, pine
T - apricots again here, very sweet, but very bitter also. Pungent grapefruit, caramel, pine, a bit tropical, booze is well contained for 10+% and is hardly noticeable. 
F - full bodied, ample carbonation,  bitter, dry finish conquers the palate
O - one of the best DIPAs I've had. Too bad it was a one-off. I love its uniqueness,  especially with the apricot notes. 528 charactersbarnzy78, Feb 01, 2014
4.52/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a clean, dark orange color with a robust, persistent off-white head that laces like crazy.
S - Citrus combines with other mineral and vegetal hop notes.  Some fine pine elements.  Quite punchy.
T - About as bright a first hit as I've had. I immediately was reminded of biting into the bright red pulp of a red grapefruit. Lemon and orange come to the game. Some of the minerality of the nose comes out near the end. A strong bitter bite builds, but that is to be expected.
M - Given the hop assault this lays out, this is surprisingly smooth going down, but with significant drying at the end.
O - No one would mistake this as anything other than a serious beer. Surprising, given its over 10% ABV, is the lack of heavy booziness. This could get you in trouble for sure.  One of the finest DIPAs I've had. 819 charactersTsar_Riga, Feb 01, 2014

Permanent Funeral is a thick light orange color. It has a lot of brightness along with its thick opacity. The yellowish head is fluffy and rocky, and big as most FFF DIPAs are. Lacing is thick and heavy, and distributed in seeming proportion to the beer's big overall character.
This beer has a familiarity to it, as there's a common nature and character connecting all of this brewery's (huge) DIPAs. They seem to tweak a recipe and pump out amazing beers with just little differences here and there. This one's as much a beast as any of the others. It produces massive citrus notes and a huge bitterness, but countered by malts and balanced such that hops rule unquestionably but aren't too harsh to be distinctly delicious. Grapefruit and orange have flesh and peel elements together to make it juicy, raw and fresh, while pine resin bites a bit and notes of grass, herb, earth and young green wood make it immensely well-rounded and complex.
The feel is dry without giving off an aspirin or chalk-like scrape on the tongue, staying consistently dry but keeping the tongue from fatigue with the juiciness. The body is big but not too heavy, enough to support everything happening without weighing down. The bite is strong from beginning to end, and smoothness is not neglected. 1,292 charactersBrenden, Jan 25, 2014

This beer pours a hazy orange with a serious head that sticks to the glass leaving behind a gluelike crust as you drink. Big citrus aromas with a citrusy taste held in check by a caramel malt keeping this big beer from wrecking your palate. This brew only got better on the second pour from the bomber. Plenty of hoppy flavor without too much bitterness. FFF hit the nail on the head with this one. 535 charactersJho3325, Jan 23, 2014

Pours a hazy light orange with a foamy tan head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus fruit, citrus zest, and tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink. 571 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jan 21, 2014

Sweet tropical fruit, resin, and dank cannabis form the initial aroma. Mango, grapefruit, and pineapple are dominated by skunky notes.
Flavor reveals a base of tart fruit, which is supported by a strong body of toasted caramel malt, becoming resiny and just a touch bitter in the finish. Grapefruit pith, lemon, green papaya, and mango emerge. Great quantities of fruity and resiny hops. Lightly burnt caramel surfaces again in the aftertaste. As the drink wears on, tropical notes seem more citrusy, weigh orange dominating.
Body is silky smooth and fairly full, with moderate carbonation and notes alcohol warmth.
Delicious beer, with great hop presence on all fronts. Hop bittering and malt sweetness are fairly balanced. Fruit notes dominate, overall. Would love to have side by side with Dreadnaught. 919 charactersbarczar, Jan 14, 2014

pours a cloudy dark copper with a nice head. nose is this beers high point...extremely citrusy and just plain awesome. the taste though is too sweet for me..lots of citrus and sweet malts. very hoppy. big beer. almost full bodied, medium carbonation.
overall a tad disappointing..definitely not a 100 but still solid. 358 charactersAxnjxn, Jan 07, 2014

4.15/5  rDev -7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This has a super clean and clear facade as it supports a billowing, bright white cloud of foam.
The nose and tongue come across nearly the same only the nose is more brilliant. Caramel malt start yields a citrus fruit near the middle with some strong lemon and grapefruit. It ends with a spicy floral hop.
This is very crisp and easy to drink and there's no evidence of a very high ABV.
This is very good, very tasty and probably pretty dangerous. 450 charactersKYGunner, Jan 06, 2014

S: Huge pine resinous notes upfront with some peach, mango, pineapple, and a tad of garlic like onion.
T: Really nice pine upfront with alcohol. Some mango, orange and light hint of onion. 
M: Medium bodied with soft but nice carbonation.

4.81/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bottle from Fusebuddy. Arrived on my door step very cold. Sat in the fridge a couple days to thaw any potential slush. Poured into a Prohibition Pig tulip glass. Bottle date 12/13/12, drank on 1/5/14.
Pours a very nice orange color. Minimal head that fizzled out quick. Leaves a nice bubbly ring around the glass. This smells awesome. Tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, some other tropical fruits. It's so juicy. Tastes follows the nose really well. A lot of ipas smell awesome then fall short on the taste, this is not one of those ipas. Truly delicious. Grapefruit is abundant but there are so many other tropical flavors, too. Papaya, mango, hint of pineapple sweetness. So much flavor it's almost overwhelming. Slight alcohol burn and bitterness. The bitterness lingers on the top of my mouth. Mouthfeel is a bit creamy, not overly carbonated but enough to feel it on the tongue. So easy to drink. I really liked his. Even with almost a month on it and it being shipped in artic temperatures it was amazing. If you like juicy ipas, definitely find one of these. 1,065 charactersMikeypnh, Jan 06, 2014

A: Pours a murky tangerine orange body. Big, fluffy, dense, beige colored head. Leaves a thin frothy head. Moderate lacing.
S: Hops just jump out of the glass. Tons of grapefruit citrus. Orange peel. Tangerine.
T: Tastes of grapefruit rind bitterness upfront. Loads of citrus hops. Tangerine sweetness. A bit of caramel malts but not overbearing.
M: Prickly. Sticky. A bit oily. Boozy warmth. Full body.
O: Def lives up to the hype. It's a hop heads wet dream. Fresh hops jump out from the pour all the way to the first taste. A bit maltier than I anticipated, but it works perfectly. Well done FFF. 628 charactersJustin_Neff, Jan 04, 2014

A: Pours a medium gold with a hefty cap of off-white head, average clarity, average retention and a few lines of lacing.
S: Apricot, citrus (tangerine, lemon), caramel, orange and mango, a little biscuity pale malt. Lots of appealing, big flavors all at once. Delicious. 
T: Tangerine, apricot, a little caramel and pale malt, with a mild backbone of bitterness which is swamped by sugar. The (moderate) sweetness is at the same level as some TIPAs, which is to say that it’s a bit much for the style.
M: Medium-full bodied, round on the tongue, with light carbonation. Alcohol is miraculously (for a 10.5% ABV) hidden.
O: A very nice, though overly sweet, DIPA. Drinkability is limited by the underattenuation, unfortunately, but this was still a treat. They really nailed the aroma—so much flavor. 895 characterspmarlowe, Dec 31, 2013

T- very orangey & citrusy with some pale malts in the background. Somewhat of a soapy taste every now and then. Definitely taste some onion, as well. 
M- moderate carbonation, sticky mouthfeel. Reminds me of a fruit cup from elementary school with a super oily mouthfeel.

A - Fairly clear golden orange with a huge 3 finger head. I may have been a bit too aggressive on the pour. Head retention is amazing and there are large blobs of lacing all over the glass. 
S - Smell is big on fresh scents of tropical sweet juicy hops. Some nice sweet honey and bread malt to balance it out. Must drink!
T - Hops, tropical, hops, citrus, hops everywhere! Rich tangerine, grapefruit, pine, mango, pineapple. The flavor is so intense! Sweet and bready malts show up with some mild alcohol warmth on the finish.
M - Big medium mouthfeel with excellent carbonation. Very sticky and intense hoppiness!
O - Helluva IIPA! I am so thankful to finally try this. It just showed up in Madison today. It may be the freshest 3Floyds beer that I have had and it was incredible. 845 charactersRi0, Dec 28, 2013

Beautifully sweet on the palate, balanced by just enough bitterness...again, piney, slight citrus, over-ripe papaya. Complex malt profile, some aromatic malt, and I swear a hint of rye. Finishes strong, tingling with a pleasant lingering residue that is not entirely bitter, nor sweet, nor alcoholic. Better when 50-55F than cold, IMO. 530 charactersTickman, Dec 20, 2013

Bravo to Three Floyds for finally bottle dating their beers. Exponentially stoked to finally have this beer, as I have wanted it for a while.
Poured into a clear balloon snifter.
A - Oh yeah, this thing pours three big fluffy soapy creamy fingers of off-white head on top of a beautiful bright burnt sienna orange colored body with some very fine sediment floating in the glass. Excellent head retention, and fat rings of lacing. Looks fabulous.
S - Smell is of big fruity & floral tropical hops - mango, papaya, grapefruit, pine, tangerine, lemon. Very citrusy. Slightly soapy. Smells fresh, juicy, and mouthwatering.
T - Big fruity tropical hop bitterness - tangerine, grapefruit, pine, lemon, papaya. This thing is seriously delicious. Some dry bready malt character is there, but this thing is mostly a hop showcase. Mild soapiness & mild alcohol warmth on the finish.
M - Goes down smooth and creamy, with lots of fresh sticky tropical hops lingering on the palate. Pretty bitter, but not overly so, especially not for being 100 IBU.
Overall, definitely one of the freshest, juiciest, and most delicious DIPA's I've had in recent memory. This thing rivals some of the bigger and better DIPA offerings from Pipeworks. This is a beer that deserves some serious attention. Big 10.50% abv is extremely well-masked, and rewarding. Possibly my favorite Three Floyds beer yet.

poured into Duvel tulip glass.
Appearance: Golden orange bodied beer with 2 full fingers of white head. Decent head retention and lots of sticky lacing on the glass.
Smell: Resinous pine, citrus, and a touch of dank chalky hops.
Taste: moderate bitterness. I am actually surprised that this beer is 100 IBU's. It does seem that bitter. Oily and resinous piney hops and pine cones. Juicy grapefruit and grapefruit rind. Lemon zest. Chalky and dank hops. Light malt bill this beer is all about the hops.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Hard to believe this is almost 11% there is no hint of alcohol. ABV is very well hidden and the beer drinks like an IPA not a DIPA. Light and creamy feel to this beer.
Overall: 3 Floyds shows a little bit more finesse with this beer than I expected. I am not a huge fan of chalky and dank hops in hoppy beers (I prefer citrusy and tropical fruit notes from my hoppy beer), but this was still pretty good considering. I thought this beer was going to be another over hyped hoppy beer by 3 Floyds. It does remind me alot of Fremont Brewing's DIPA "The Brother". 1,216 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Dec 19, 2013

A - Pours a very nice very slightly hazy orange hue with a big, creamy two finger white head that fades to leave lots of sticky lacing and a rich, creamy blanket. Glorious.
S - Lots of sticky, resinous citrus, super, super faint tropical, and a light tea leaf quality. Light sweet malts.
T - Taste is similar to the nose. More of the very sticky hops, not bitter at all, nor juicy. Like citrus rind oils spurted onto ones tongue. There is more of that tea leaf finish mingled with sweeter sticky malts. 
M - Mouthfeel, while a bit heavier due to how sticky it is, still hides that ABV very nicely. Bright carbonation too!
O - Overall, this is a very tasty DIPA. I do like how this is not all that bitter, but instead is super sticky. Would have liked to see more tropical notes than tea, but still well done. 862 charactersrudzud, Nov 22, 2013

Notes from memory...
A: Bright orange with a thick white head which lasts long on top of the glass.
S: Hoppy smell with a resinous scent, citruses and tropical fruits.
T: Taste isn't overly sweet or malty as expected given the ABV and IBU, also this is a more than solid DIPA. Fresh hops (a bit herbal and resinous) and very fruity (tropical fruits, citruses). Leaves a dry bitterness on the finish.
M: Smooth and thirst quenching, not heavy at all. Alcohol is very well hidden. Finishes dry.
O: A very good DIPA. Glad to have tried this one, I would happily drink more! 661 charactersFux, Nov 17, 2013

Lots of tropical fruit on the nose -pineapple, mango, guava with hints of citrus - mostly orange and grapefruit. Sweet carmel notes as well. Taste is amazing - bright citrus with some resinous pine that melds into a nice carmel bready malt backbone that finishes slightly bitter and juicy. Even though this beer clocks in at 10.5% abv, there is no overt alcohol warming. 
Medium bodied with good carbonation. Overall, this is an outstanding offering from FFF, well crafted, well balanced. I hope this becomes a regular release from them! 615 charactersJohnG190, Nov 05, 2013

The beer is orange with a small off white head. The aroma is classic FFF. Hop forward with a robust, supportive malt body. Dank citrus and biscuits. A full bodied beverage, teeming with flavor. Alcohol presence is there but unobtrusive. Well-balanced and delicious. Really, a wonderful beer. 345 charactersHuhzubendah, Nov 02, 2013

Aroma is straight up citrus peels, pineapple flesh, and other tropical fruit notes flowing from the glass. So worth the drive to Newark, OH to try the last of their stock of this fine American brewed IPA. I don't know the next time I will see this beer but I will definitely savor this pour of 22 ounces of liquid bread coated hop candy. The flavor is sugar coated raw herbaceous hops, big citric layers, orange marmalade, tropical fruits...mango, star fruit, and hints of passion fruit. Over ripened fruit juice with bready malts bring all the caramelized sugars to the forefront and the big oily hop oils let those sweet candy qualities fade to the background. Mouthfeel is big oily resinous IPA, carbonated well carries each sip effortless down the gullet, to equate to perfect realm of dangerous drinkability. I can't talk enough about how much I enjoy this beer, all of the true hopheads listening go find this, drive 6-8 hrs if you have to, hell make a pilgrimage to the brewery. I might even start listening to metal if Pig Destroyer had a hand in the collaborative creation of this liquid beauty. 1,270 charactersWVbeergeek, Oct 21, 2013

Consumed a few half-pints (standard serving size) of this really wonderful DIPA - it's big bodied, for sure. Huge assault of grapefruit, pineapple and tropical fruit. Boozy undertones throughout. Moderate bitterness and just an exceptional hop profile throughout. Shame they were out of bombers, but still glad to be able to consume this in &gt; GABF quantities. 384 charactersdirtylou, Oct 20, 2013

Appearance - Light straw colored, pineapple juice yellow. Nice 1 inch foamy, creamy head with tons of lacing. 
Smell - Big citric hops, orange, pineapple, grapes, some yeasts, even a little malt in the finish.
Taste - Much like the smell, insane amount of pineapple/orange and grapefruit with a nice sweet yeast backbone. Hops are sweet not so overly bitter. Malts add some caramel goodness, along with a little balance so this aint a 100% total hop bomb.
Mouthfeel - Hops dominate the tongue, along with some sweetness from the added sugars. Palate gets more hops along with some caramel malts. The aftertaste is sweet, and loads of pineapple and orange.
Overall - Drove 4.5 hours total to get this and glad i got it. Huge flavorful beer done up right. Hop heavy beer with the right amount of yeasts and malts to make it a wonderful beer. Alcohol is masked really well, making it easy to drink the bomber. World class for sure. 961 characterswvsabbath, Oct 20, 2013

Poured into a snifter, appearance is dark orange, somewhat cloudy, 2/3 inch foam which retains well.
Mouthfeel is soft, creamy, carbonation is medium.
TASTE IS PURE Orange/citrus. I can hardly detect any alcohol. This could be a substitute for a 10year old's Ecto-cooler juicebox. Again not really that bitter lemon/grapefruit, this is pure tangerine type citrus hops. 
I could drink like 6 of these bombers.

O-this is my favorite beer to date. It's like that first album by your favorite band. It's perfect because it's gritty and there are so many rough edges (imperfections).

Lacing sticks around as long as the nose dose.

S - Smells fantastic. Bitter dry hop aromas with tons of grapefruit and rinds, sweet malts and resinous spice notes.
T - wow. Possibly my favorite FFF IPA/DIPA (this or APW). Initially lots of sweet and citrus deliciousness. Grapefruit, pineapple, orange. Transitions into a kind of spiced resinous rind. Finish is resinous and dry bitter hops. Very dry and bitter. Aftertaste is citrus and bitter hops. Absolutely fantastic.
M - medium bodied, good carbonation, ideal mouth feel. Definitely a joy to drink.

This is the only beer I have had lately that I would compare (seriously) to Pliny the Elder. I would not be suprised if this got onto the top 250 in a hurry. I had 2 of these at the brewery and made sure I had a dozen in my trunk before I left. Dark redish brown appearance, floral hopiness and sweet smell, wonderful flavors abound with a perfect balance of sweet and hop with a long lasting piney flavor that sticks around for a while. I though it held up well in the bottles I have had as well. Tasty stuff folks, get one if you can. 645 charactersBigmojo14, Oct 03, 2013

Pours clear, coarsely carbonated, with a small white head. Smell is delicious. Honeysuckle and pine and grapefruit, abundantly.
Taste is a surprisingly fair balance -- enormous sweetness to match the enormous hoppy bitterness. For the strength, it has a very surprising smoothness and is quite (dangerously) easy to drink.
Mouthfeel is light, dry, slightly effervescent. Overall, this is a pretty damn good beer. 512 characterssnaotheus, Sep 28, 2013

Appears pale orange with lots of creamy white head, gorgeous. The smell is very strong of citrus, tropical fruit, and alcohol. This has to be the most intense smell I've ever detected in a beer, the juicy goodness just fills the room. 
The taste is mind blowing! More sweet tropical fruits and citrus, so good! The alcohol presence is there, but hardly noticeable. It feels so creamy and smooth. As it warms everything just intensifies. 
Overall this right up there with the best of them. It's only supposed to be a one time release, but hopefully they decide to bring it back someday. 647 charactersd5001986, Sep 27, 2013
4.69/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Had on draft at the brewery last week, and picked up a couple bombers on the way out. The draft version was quite good, but this bottle is extraordinary.
Pours much like many other DIPAs... About 2F of off-white head over a hazy golden body. Lots of sticky lacing. 
Aromas are powerful, but in a totally inviting way. Fresh as anything, it bursts with sweet tropical fruits... Lots of pineapple and mango. 
Mouthfeel is amazingly smooth for the ABV...dare I say "creamy"? Yes, that is confirmed, but does finish with some dryness. Flavor is sharper, and just packed with pine, dried apricot, mango sweetness, and some nice balance of malty sweetness, without being the least bit thick or cloying as many in this style fall into. Finishes with a sharp, drying bitterness.

This smells awesome with strong pine resin and tropical fruit.
The taste is more intense than the nose with intense bitterness combined with the tropical fruits. Not as malty as Dreadnaught. Alcohol is well hidden. This really tastes like a double Zombie Dust.
The mouthfeel is medium and slick.
Fresh on tap it is one of the top DIPA's I've tried. Amazing that 3 Floyds can ratchet it up another notch but they did. Contrary to many posts this is not retired. It is currently on tap at the brewery and for sale in bombers. 684 characters312HopBomb, Sep 18, 2013

Acquired via trade
Thanks, mcbeerbrew!
Clear apricot in color with very little visible carbonation. This leaves irregular, webbed lines of lace down the glass.
Big notes of citrus, floral elements, and melon combine in the aroma. There's also some alcohol present.
Hugely bitter, with lots of citrus (pineapple), melon, and a bit of cracker. Some alcohol present. Though I love the style, and there's nothing wrong here, I can't drink a lot of this.
Medium to full bodied with moderate carbonation.
Above average and quite tasty. 549 charactersehammond1, Aug 27, 2013

Hazy ornage with one finger of white head, sticky eith a bit of lace. Smell is full of hops, citrusy, orange, grapefruit and mango are dominant but fairly fruity in the nose overall, a touch of sugary malt as well. Taste is fruity lots of citrus and tropical fruit, mid palate malty-sweetness that leaves notes of grapefruit/citrus candy mixed with all those hops, quite bitter and finishes a bit dry with lots of tropical fruits. Light to medium carbonation, medium full bodied and fairly sticky with a bit of an oily feel. Awesome stuff here, second favorite of the whales brought by Liam on this evening. 664 characterspeensteen, Jul 29, 2013

Nose is a bit skunky, some prominent cat pee, very dense dried pineapple and dried papaya. Stickier, tropical. Taste is melon heavy, lots of thick mango and cantaloupe. Palate is dense, lightly nutty and spicy. Mild tannic bitterness. Not very buoyant or quenching. But still yummy with a big focus on aroma hops typical to FFF.

S - Citrus & sweet, like candied grapefruit. Not getting the pine or earth as others have mentioned.
T - Overall, it seems a bit of biscuity and caramel malts. Starts off grapefruit hops with pine and mixes back and forth. A good bit of hops as well, though no palette wrecker hop bomb. 
M - Medium body/carbonation, sticky and wet. 
O - Currently it's rated a 100 and I'm not seeing that out of this beer. May'be it was the bomb fresh?? I'd much prefer other hoppy 3F beers over this one. 591 characterscvm4, Jun 28, 2013

4.32/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Another beer that looks eerily similar and tastes eerily similar to Dreadnaught. Pours a yellow color with ample clarity, soft white 3/5" head. Very good aroma, definitely hits the pine scents well, plenty aromatic, they really waft high up out the bottle and pint glass.
Taste, very dry, lots of piney hops, hides the alcohol and bitterness immensely well. Has a mildly herbal presence that can often occur in the high hop low dry malt types of beers like these, isn't a detraction at all. Grapefruit creeps unto the pine hop note territory in the mouthfeel, remains so light and dry, and then some minor tropical fruit notes. A great example of a light beer that hides alcohol oh so well.
Actually, compared with the meh Dreadnaught they served at the FW fest, this is actually better. When both are fresh, they are probably tough to distinguish in a blind test.
$10 a bottle is a little steep for any ipa. If you're a fan of Zombie Dust, Dreadnaught, Arctic Panzer, Alpha King, Aeotara, Apocalypse Cow etc. . . you're very likely to dig on this, even if you've had beers very similar to it from FFF already. It is a great summer beer with a punch. 1,153 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jun 27, 2013

S: The nose is pine, citrus, some caramel and a little bit of dank Earthy greenness.
T: Sordove dank upfront. Some herbal goodness meets pine and fruits(tropical mainly) The malt bill seems to be a blend of caramel and biscuit. There is a pronounced sticky, lingering aftertaste on this beer, sordove syrupy even that I did not enjoy. This was about the only thing I disliked about the beer. 
M: Medium-full body with good carbonation. Sticky and sordove cloying.

WOW this is amazing.
my oh my.. the taste is all grapefruit up front, pine, more grapefruit, floral, more grapefruit, sweet malt, bready malt, more grapefruit, caramel, honey, and finishes with.. WAIT FOR IT... grapefruit. this is a fucking hell of a hop bomb, but not overly bitter by any means, more citrusy and sweet.
the abv is very well masked by the sweet malt and hopy profile. a medium body ipa with a creamy mouthfeel and a nice amount of carbonation keeping your thirst quenched, but with a sweet finish which screams FEED ME MORE!
this is a fantastic dipa by FFF.. on par with apocalypse cow, which is my favorite by them. awesome artwork and an awesome band to collab with. pick this up before it's gone. 980 charactersfacundoCNB, Jun 27, 2013

The aroma includes pine and a toasty to burnt malt character. A bit of fruit, grass and alcohol. Sone orange rind is also present before the onset of something more dank and herbal feeling.
The taste is mutualky dank and piney. A bit of biscuit to burnt grain character overtop solvent alcohol and minor fruity tinges. It is quite resinous and pine-like with plenty of herbal clingy bitterness.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is a big boozy brew but isnt too over the top. I would drink this again and I am very thankful to the Richmond BA crew who sent this my way. 816 charactersstakem, Jun 12, 2013

Smells like a lot of citrus and floral hops. Nice potent orange and grapfeuit notes before it finishs with floral hops and a slight malt bite. A fair amount of piney hops come out as it warms.
Starts off with lots of bitterness followed closly by a big rich malt body and finishes with a hoppy presence similar to that to the floral hop aroma.
There is a nice thick rich feel to this beer. Carbonation is good and the thick feel compliments the rich body nicely.
Overall this is a great pale ale. Aromas are great and a lot of delicious malt pulls through the body of this beer which is balanced great with the large bitter and floral hop notes. 735 charactersFcolle2, Jun 08, 2013

It's got all the tropical flavors you're accustomed to in a citra hopped beer, plus some kind of sweet corn thing going on (sometimes). 
PF was the best IIPA available when first released, and still is when you get a good batch - of the last three less-than-a-week-old bombers I've purchased, the first two were sub par, overly bitter and piney, but the last one was incredible. 
Overall, this beer has since been surpassed by Pipeworks (and sometimes Spiteful) in the region, and by other breweries elsewhere, This is due to lack of consistency more than anything else. 661 charactersRMelyon, Jun 06, 2013

It holds a two and a half finger head of cakey whitish bubbles, showing great retention as they bubble away slowly like a stew. A thick sheet of lacing is left as it goes. A chill haze cuts clarity, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be active. The nose is just as bright and juicy as you would expect from any of the other dynamite pales they churn out, with crushed citric and grapefruity hop freshness, and floral, nectary, and lightly earthy hops to add sweetness and to balance. Mixing are notes of toasty pale malts, burning phenolic chemicals, raw booziness, potato starchiness, under ripe strawberries, tangerine and pineapple juiciness, sticky honeys, chalky yeast, coppery and light soured candy tartness. With warmth comes a brush of coppery metallics. Our first impression is that this beer is juicy as hell, as you would expect from the nose, but it remains in keeping with the “pale ale” style, with exemplary forwardness of the malts and freshness up the wazoo. As we sip, the taste opens with crisp pale malty goodness, massively juicy grapefruity and herbal hop bite, phenolic plastics and fusel booze, honey sweetness, white sugar, grassy earthiness, and salty pretzel doughiness. The peak comes with light piney resin, orange flesh, pineapple, and mango fruitiness, with earthy and herbal hop bitterness, black pepper grind, gravel, root and dirt, crisp pale malts, milky creaminess, slick metallics, and light sea salts. The finishing wash comes with revival of that boozy punch, massive dried mango sugars, coppery yeast, black pepper, juicy pineapple and tangerine, musky and earthy essence, and mineral. The aftertaste breathes of greenstick resins, barky earthiness, citric rind, corn husk, pale malt and straw dryness, green grape fruitiness, roasted apple sweetness, mustiness, and those airy citric and herbal hops. The body is medium but a bit syrupy, and the carbonation is medium but frothy. Each sip gives soft smack, lip, cream, foam, slurp, and finishing pop. The mouth is coated with silkiness, dripping wet into the softest pucker and light chalky astringency. The abv is surprising, but well hidden, and the beer drinks insanely well.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this brew was its taste. Had you given this to me blindly and told me it was Zombie Dust I would have believed you. Point being, it lives up to that level of expectation. Since we’ve had the pleasure of sampling Zombie Dust there are certain obvious differences, but to no real detriment. This guy is much more fusel, boozy, phenolic, and generally strong, but then again it’s about twice the abv. This remains decently well hidden throughout, but is nicely contributory when it comes up every now and again. The tropical fruitiness in the end was astounding, giving sugary sweetness, syrupy thickness, and glorious balance. The nose is not as juicy as it could be, but that is merely keeping it just “awesome”, rather than "perfect". With too much warmth the booze does take things a touch off base in the flavoring. This is a phenomenal addition to the masterful pale ale lineup, and something I certainly wish I bought more than one bottle of on my visit to the brewpub. Simply awesome. 3,308 charactersTheBrewo, May 31, 2013

Smells of mango, pine, candied tropical fruits.
Big mango flavors, slight grass, ever so slightly catty with a bit of alcohol on the finish.
Mouthfeel is just great. For 10 percent, it is quite drinkable. I don't like my IPAs/IIPAs too syrupy.
Great beer here. Perhaps not the out of body experience I was expecting (not quite 5s across the board), but quite, quite good. Love the way FFF handles the citra hop. They may use it better than anyone. 605 charactersPowderhornphil, May 30, 2013

A: pours a beutiful golden orange with about 1/2 fingers worth of ehad formation that dissipates into a thin yet bubbly film.

T: following the nose, and the hops really are massive here. big tropical fruits again, with mango, pineapple, grapefruit and citrus. there is a sweet malt backbone that holds this one together and i even pick up on some sweet honey as well. again, the balance is very nice.
M: solid medium bodied that leaves a long lasting hop bitterness on the palate. 
O: FFF at its best here. just a terrific balance of tropical fruits, sweet malt and bitter hops. and the alcohol is very well hidden. excellent brew! thanks again Sleuthdog! 918 characterstut2528, May 27, 2013

The beer poured a copper color with a nice fluffy white head. The aroma was a big shot of pineapple and grass, overall quite sweet. In the initial taste, one gets pineapple, apple, grapefruit, and notes of pepper. In the aftertaste, the dry and pungent hops make an impression. It was a wonderful tart sensation. There was a slight warming impression in the aftertaste that was accompanied by a peppery nature in the back of the throat. In terms of Imperial IPAs, this one is right up there with FFF's Dreadnaught. Really good stuff. 691 charactersJohnnyHopps, May 26, 2013

Initially thought this was a Pale Ale but doing a little web searching steers me towards DIPA instead. Putting away my Three Floyds pint glass in favor of a Delirium Tremens tulip. There's a very slight haze cutting through the orange liquid and a frothy cap of white foam sits up top, about 2 fingers tall. Good retention and lacing. Heavy hitting fruit in the aroma with mango, citrus, and some dankness. Not picking up much in the way of malt. Big, biting bitterness grabs on the palette immediately with piney, orange being prominent in the hop flavor. A little sweetness on the back-end could be coming from caramel malt. Definitely picking up on some warming from high ABV with a medium-body and modest carbonation. Thanks again, Al! 856 charactersBrewerB, May 25, 2013

Golden shower on the pour.
Smells of booze and sweet and sour sauce....the industrial type that likely litters the back room of your local Great Wall or something similarly universal and bland. 
Good lord this is sloppy beer. Sweet and sickly pineapple sinfully penetrates the la Choy pseudo Asian condiment, leaving some love it if its mine loathe it if its not progeny that only a Pig Destroyer or a Floyd's apologist can love.
Overly sickly sweet and far too boozy for its own good.

The bright white head poured a finger and a half tall in the 3F teku glass. When it receded the lacing coated the edge of the glass with a chaotic patern.
S: Huge tropical melon and sweet tarts candy sweet aroma that hits your sences like a tsunami. More juicy citrus and pine aroma blend in. A small amount of toffee, carmel malt squeeking through the monster hop nose.
T: Piney bitterness and flavor hops wash over the pallet first followed by a bready, doughy malt profile. The finish is slightly sweet with a lingering bitter pine, a nice contrast. 
M: A dry finish with moderate carbonation The hop bite is almost sharp (in a good way) as its rests on your pallet
O: I've been a Pig Destroyer fan (Prowler In the Yard era) longer than I've been into craft beer so maybe I'm a little bias, but after having this beast of a beer at Dark Lord Day while watching Pig Destroyer and standing next to Todd Haug (Surly), How could I not pick up a few bottles.

A beautiful bright, light orange color that is pretty clear. Tiny carbonation bubbles lead to a large one finger creamy, bright white head. Lace is fairly minimal now but does stick some as this is consumed.
Smell is overwhelming citrus hoppiness. Naval orange and yellow grapefruit. Very sweet smelling, honey? Quite nice!!
Taste is much like the smell. Tons of sweet and bitter citrus. Maybe some mango and peach? This tastes a lot like Nelson. There is a gentle load of bitterness as well, with some mild booze burn way late which I quite like.
Mouth is quite refreshing. Mild to medium carbonation with a pretty thick body for the style. Finish is long and wet with the mild alcohol burn that I rather enjoy.
Overall I must say FFF knocks it out of the park again. The bottle says "Pale Ale" cough, cough bull shit!! This can compete with any IIPA on the market. I highly recommend this to anyone with access. Yes trading for it = access. Thanks again to sleuthdog for this bottle. 1,061 charactersazdback, May 17, 2013

S: Aroma is bright and aromatic. Strong aroma of hops is "balanced" only by the sharp tang of alcohol. Hops are an interesting blend of pine, mango, and orange. 
T: Taste is very interesting. Again very hop forward. And somehow this beer seems to hit every major hop flavor out there. Starts with strong grapefruit notes. Grapefruit and orange pith. Then there is a bit of pine before turning tropical with notes of mango and passionfruit. Finish is a bit earthy, with a residual pithy bitterness. On my first few sips the beer seemed on the sweeter side, but about a quarter of the way down the glass, the bitterness took over and just pounded the sweetness into submission. 
M: Sweet at the beginning, but fades to bitterness. Strong, persistent bitterness, especially on the finish. Moderate carbonation. 
O: A very nice IPA. Overhopped, heavy on the alcohol, and excessive in every way possible, this one just screams "Three Floyd's!!!" all day long. 1,139 charactersFlorida9, May 17, 2013

A: Pours a very clear golden color with a big white, frothy head. Looks amazing. 
S: Opens with a blast of fruits/pine resin. Peach, mango and pineapple. Earthy hops and pine resin follow. A big floral hop character. A bit of malty sweetness. A tiny bit of onion. 
T: BURST of pine and spice. Too much in my opinion. Orange zest, peaches, mango and malty sweetness follow and make it much more tolerable. The malty sweetness got bigger and bigger as the beer got warmer. The hops make it very juicy as it's going down, and it finishes a bit dry with a big dose of hops and grassy bitterness. 
M: Medium bodied with light carbonation. 
O: Great DIPA, glad I got to try it but I wouldn't go out of my way to find it. 727 charactersstandardcherry, May 16, 2013

4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Having quickly become a fan of 3 Floyds Zombie Dust, the chilled bomber of Permanent Funeral was calling my name after beating a late night deadline. Props to DuoBob for the sweet trade.
From the moment the top is popped, the Permanent Funeral experience begins, and one quickly realizes there is nothing subtle about this 3 Floyds concoction. 
Pours a slightly cloudy off orange with a generous 3 finger creamy white head that stays put, reducing to a generous cap. Lively carbonation but not over the edge.
Aromas are certainly hop forward, lots of sweet juicy tropical fruits like nectarines,tangerines.
There is a sweetness to the aroma that must have a tall malt bill to tame all that extreme hopiness. The phenols are quite pronounced, and for my tastes, they are seductive and inviting.
Flavors follow the nose, however at 10.5% abv, it comes with a touch of heat that you can feel at the back of your throat within the first couple of sips. For those that appreciate their IIPAs that have that tropical mojo, Permanent Funeral delivers the goods. There is an underlying malty sweetness that works hard to balance the aggressive hop qualities, and as a result, it finishes off a touch sweet, but make no mistake that this is a heavy duty hop bomb.
Mouthfeel is on the heavy side,really coating the palate like roofing tar with malty sweetness and pungent hops: this becomes a sipper halfway into the bomber, with a slight oiliness. The long bitter grapefruit rind aftertaste is pleasant to ponder as the beefy alcohol content punches you squarely in the jaw.
Overall, this is a big beer, and offers all the subtlety of a sledgehammer in the delivery of zesty hop flavor and balanced malt sweetness. The alcohol ("heat") does not go unnoticed and actually isn't hidden all that well, yet the end result is a delight for hopheads searching for a self inflicted punch in the face! It's YOUR funeral, so raise your glass high!! 1,936 charactersHendry, May 16, 2013

I was thinking that this was a pale ale as stated by the label and somewhere in the 5-7% range. I was shocked when I learned the actual ABV, but that's a testament to the balance of this brew. Nice gold pour with dense white head and plenty of lacing. The nose is aromatic with a few varietals of hops coming to the surface, mainly citrus, lemon rind, melon, and pine come through. The taste is fruity and full of delicious hop flavor up front with light bitterness. Tastes as if this brew is hop bursted as the bitterness is well overshadowed by the aromatic hops. Notes of pineapple, grapefruit, and peach join the party with a sturdy malt presence towards the finish. Mouthfeel is moderate with smooth and somewhat creamy body. Overall, quite a tasty beer with absurd balance and drinkability. 887 charactershomebrew311, May 13, 2013

S - Nice citrus smell, but yet another overhyped FFF offering. There's not a lot of malt presence, and it's overall a solid smelling DIPA, but to be rated as high as it is boggles my mind.
T - Similar. Can tell it's a FFF DIPA. It's pretty similar to Dreadnaught as far as I remember.
M - No alcohol presence. Smooth and good amount of carbonation for the style. 
O - Another solid FFF offering that's not really that special. I'd still stick to Zombie Dust only, but because they don't bottle date I had to watch my friend open ZD after ZD and pour them down the drain right after he got them in a trade. Let's go FFF, you make enough of a killing on your prices you can afford to bottle date or you're doing something wrong. 792 charactersnrs207, May 12, 2013

A - pours a clear, light orange with a standard white head. Some lace. Light bubbles.
S - resinous pine, faint onion, sweet tangerine, ripe pineapple, orange peel, faint cantaloupe and a nice melanoidin malt note. The overall aroma is a low-medium intensity for the style.
T - is similar to the aroma. I get tangerine and pineapple upfront with a smooth piney and slightly floral finish. Smooth 10%. Tasty!
M - medium body. Mild sweetness. Pleasant, medium bitterness with a medium-long sustain. Not syrupy like Dreadnaught, thank you. 
O - I liked this quite a bit more than Dreadnaught which I think is seriously overrated. Dreadnaught is a syrupy, barely hoppy mess and Permanent Funeral is what Dreadnaught should have been. The West Coast should like this beer. It probably won't make their top 5, but maybe their top 10. 868 charactersGuzzLah, May 12, 2013

A - Great orangish rusty haze. Two finger head quickly rises and falls to a splotchy ring that indents the glass with lace.
S - Pineapple and hop oil hit first. Less a bouquet and more of a solo...all I get is Pineapple in terms of fruit. Not even something akin like mango resonates for me, just pineapple. Slight cream soda notes. Solid alcohol
T - Cream hop hit. Surprising vanilla extract note. Very mild bitterness for 100 IBU. Pale malts just barely suggest balance. Slight alcoholic tingle
M - Low carbonation, not very lively. Mild burn. A little too sappy in consistency for me.
Overall, this is a great beer with great label art that I would love to drink again, but I think its just a little hyped. It seems that the loads of hops kind of cover up the lack of sophistication. But, don't get me wrong...I couldn't brew this. 873 charactershopoilcrazy, May 09, 2013

Thanks! 1 pint 6 fl oz brown glass bottle with interesting label art and standard branded pressure cap served into a conical Samuel Smith's pint glass in me gaff in low altitude Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. Reviewed live. Expectations are through the roof given the brewery and its current ratings.
Served cold, straight from the fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.
A: Pours a 3.5 finger beige colour head of nice thickness and cream, and damn good (~8 minute) retention for the high ABV. Body colour is a clear understated pale copper; fairly vibrant. Translucent and refreshing-looking. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. I like the clarity. Very impressed by the head. Lacing is uneven but thick. It could be frothier. I'm really looking forward to drinking this.
Sm: Pleasant floral hop character. Thick fresh pale malts. Resinous as hell. Hop oils come through - though not in a Lagunitas hop extract kind of way - more in a natural thickly layered manner. Nectary. Grassy. A twinge of lemon/lemongrass. No alcohol or yeast character is detectable. Clean and inviting. Hops are dominant. I'm excited to try this. A rather mild aroma for such a heavy Imperial IPA. Luckily, no hop bitterness is detectable. I hope the flavour profile is as balanced as the aroma.
T: A bit heavier on the malts than I was anticipating; I get heavily layered thick pale malts and grassy somewhat heavy grains. They give it definite presence but sap drinkability. Heavy powerful floral hops. Overzealous hop oils. Any light nectary or citrusy character gets buried by the other hop notes - which overwhelm. Some alcohol is detectable, but overall it's very well hidden. No yeast character comes through. Vaguely fruity, but I don't get any luscious juicy hop esters. Resinous as hell - a dominant characteristic. It's a bit overbearing, which really takes a toll on the balance. Luckily, little hop bitterness comes through. But I'm not sure that end justifies the means; the heavy malt backbone really thickens it to such extent that it's difficult to drink. It's a monstrous brew, but I wouldn't dare call it complex or subtle. The hop character is muted by the taxing malt component. Do I like it? Sure. But I expected far far better. It's just not that flavorful, all things considered.
Mf: Way too thick and heavy on the palate for the style, ruining any chance of it being refreshing or particularly pleasant. A biteen overcarbonated. Overbearing on the palate. Too full-bodied without enough diverse and deep flavours to justify it. Smooth and wet - to style. It suits the flavour profile decently, but it's far from ideal.
Dr: I will say that it's pretty drinkable considering the high ABV. But you wouldn't want more than one; in fact even just this bottle will take some time to finish. The thick filling body makes it a lot to take on, and there just isn't enough flavour to really keep me interested. I expected this to blow my mind, but I think it suffers from a common issue with (I)IPAs: it's not a contest to see who can brew a higher ABV, higher IBU, and/or higher hop content beer. Brewing is a matter of care and balance, and while I see some of that here, it seems more interested in indulging trends than in generating something lasting.
Even if your goal is a high ABV hoppy Imperial IPA, this just isn't that drinkable. I'd argue that something like Dogfish Head 120 Minute is twice as drinkable at twice the ABV - and I'm not even that big a fan of Dogfish Head.
I honestly wouldn't get this again unless it was on-draught. A good but not great offering from Three Floyds.
Low B-

02/04/14: Another bottle from Duff27. Bottled 12/2013. Truncated notes:
A: 1 - 1.5 finger wide head of white colour. Nice cream and thickness. Nice even fluffy consistency. Complexion could be smoother. Not much lacing. Retains for 5 minutes.
Body colour is a pale copper of average vibrance. No yeast is visible.
Sm: Warm alcohol-laden fruit: tangerine, mango, tropical fruit. Pale malts. Hoppy bitterness seems well checked by malty sweetness.
A moderately strong aroma. Not stellar for a pale ale or IPA.
T/Mf: Hop bitterness does come through - esp. on the climax, which ruins the balance. There're plenty of hop notes here, but the tropical fruit dominates, which isn't ideal for my personal tastes. I want more resinous and oily hop character. Maltwise, there's too much emphasis on the caramalt and not enough on the pale malts. It's somehow both too sweet and too bitter.
Heavy, thick, filling, full-bodied, overbearing. Shallow depth of flavour. Not gestalt.
Dr: I'll finish with some effort. Not a fantastic beer, and not up to par with 3 Floyds' reputation. I doubt I'd get it again, even if I chanced across it on the shelf. I think it's personal taste in large part; I'm just not a big fan of this kind of tropical fruit profile.

I’ve always wondered how these types of collaborations work. The dudes from Pig Destroyer meet up with the Floyds, nodding intently as the brewers describe yeast and hops and whatfor. Eventually there’s a lull in the music or a ray of clarity cracks through the bleariness and someone from the brewery asks someone in the band for their beermaking input. “We would prefer it to rock,” says the bassist. “Naw,” interjects the singer, “we want it to be brutal.”
Then, god-willing, there would be a 1970’s Certs commercial-style back and forth: Rocking! Brutality! Rocking! Brutality! Before one of the guys from Three Floyds—preferably either the fat bearded one or the bartender who has a goatee tattooed on his face—he jumps in and is like “now settle down fellas, it can be both!”
That wonderful image aside, I’m afraid I’m not equipped to comment on how brutal or metal this beer is. I like metal and all, but I’m not an expert. So I asked my cousin Zach what he thought. Zach’s way metal. He plays in a band named after a skin disease and has given himself tattoos. His response? “Brutal as fuck.”
This confuses me. My expertise is that of an amateur beersman, a prestigious title afforded only to those of us who are willing to drink a lot and then have a cat walk strategically over our internet-connected keyboards while we sob about how much we miss Janice, how she’s the reason our pants don’t fit anymore, how dear god I wish this beer was flammable. A beersman like me is amazed by how goddamn smooth and quaffable this beer is. Gone are the high-alpha cat pee nodes of Dreadnaught. Likewise, the usual pleasant fieriness of the Floyds’ bigger beers is replaced with dark fruit nodes.

Pours sparkling clear copper with an inch of white head. Plenty of tattered lacing and a partial skim coat for the duration.
Aromatics lead off with a blast of juicy, tropical fruits. Peach, mango, and apricot with pixie-dusted pine resin.
Medium bodied with a crisp, tacky mouthfeel.
Plump, ripe, tropical citrus fruits on the palate. Very light malt to balance and minimal bitterness.

4.67/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Served from a bottle into a goblet glass.
Appearance- Pours a hazy orange with a light head that makes a halo on the glass. Lots of bubbly lacing left on the glass. 
Smell- Sweet tropical fruits mask the hop character at first. Sweet papaya, tangy apricot, and honeyed mango burst into your nose. Froot Loops(!?). Earthy hop subtlety follows. Finishes with a big champagne-y sweetness that is slightly acidic. No booziness forward. Smells amazing.
Taste- Crisp apple cider bite followed by a hint of booze. Big juicy fruit salad notes, resiny hoppiness then back to the booze. Finishes with a touch of malt leading the bitter hop finish.
Mouthfeel- a bit dense but expected for an imperial. Some fizz at first, but goes down soft and smooth.
Overall- This one does not hold back for an imperial- the alcohol is in there. The amazing thing is that for as boozy as it is, it does not dominate. Everything holds up to it and matches it well. Perhaps the most perfect balance of any imperial IPA I have had. Very well done Three Floyds. The collaboration with Pig Destroyer is an awesome added bonus. Amazing. 1,110 charactersSaisonRichBiere, May 07, 2013

A - Golden orange, perfectly clear, with 1.5 fingers of off-white head
S - Citrus, orange, grapfruit - fresh juicy hops
T - Wow - tons of juicy, citusy hops upfront. Like biting into a juicy orange. Very easy to drink with only a minimal amount of bitterness, considering both the ABV and the IBUs. 
M - Medium bodied and pretty typical body for a big FFF IPA. Similar to Dreadnaught
O - It's hard to imagine a DIPA that I would like more. I don't know how FFF is able to get that much fresh, citrusy hop flavor into a beer that is almost refreshing to drink - even at 10.5 % ABV. For the hophead, this is a must try in my opinion. 748 characterscnbrown313, May 06, 2013

Do not drink this too cold. The taste at first sip was very good but turned to excellent as it warmed. Somewhat similar to Z.D. in aroma but not at all a grapefruit bomb.

A - Mildly hazy golden-yellow with a 1-finger white head that fades quickly and leaves moderate, sheeted lacing. 
S - Big aroma; like a Zombie Dust with more pineapple. Tangerine, pine, hop floral and crushed hop cone goodness, light malt.
T - Hop forward giving way to pineapple flesh and light malt sweetness. There's a spicy, herbal-mint tea lingering in the background that I like. The bitterness reasserts itself into the finish but doesn't dominate as the other flavors provide good balance. The sweetness tastes more fruity than grain based and there's not a roasted malt presence at all. This is definitely not a barleywine. The alcohol is evident but subdued into the balance. As it warmed, it kept tasting better and better. 
M - Light-medium body and medium carbonation. Prickly, abrasive. Not watery, not thick. Just right. Dries nicely. How can a 10+% beer be refreshing?
O - It's a laugh to see "Pale Ale" on the bottle but I guess I get it in the sense that it's light on the malt, which is a very good thing in this beer. I'd not heard of this beer until today and of the samples I had at the brewery, this is the shining star. Better than Dreadnaught for sure. Maybe equal or close to Zombie Dust (my personal 3F favorite). Dang. 1,289 charactersTucquan, May 06, 2013

A - Translucent golden yellow colour with one finger of cream coloured head.
S - Tropical fruit aromas dominate the nose. Peach, mango, tangerine, pineapple. Some pine and a hint of caramel sweetness. 
T - Bitter up front with pineapple, mango, tangerine and peach flavours. A fairly big sweet caramel malt backbone that is just slightly too much for my liking, which is the only thing keeping this from being a flawless DIPA.
M - Medium body. Stick and full of resinous hop oils. Light carbonation. 566 charactersTheSevenDuffs, May 05, 2013
4.38/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A - slightly cloudy, golden, big tall loose foamy head.
S - lots of floral hops, light citrus peel, some tropical notes as well
T - the floral and aromatic follow over to the taste. Big punch of tropical notes. Very little bitterness. Too much ABV though, there is definitely some heat and alcohol sweetness. I think this would be a stone cold 5 if it were about 8% instead of 10.5%, but relatively small complaint.
M - medium, smooth finish, some alcohol heat.
O - really liked this one. Like zombie dust with more punch. 526 charactersBeerandboards, May 05, 2013
4.48/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours a light pale golden color. Very clear, with a small foamy head. 
Smells of big tropical fruits, peach, pineapple, orange citrus, mango. Slight hint of wheat-like malts. The smell is really big, clean, and inviting. Kind of reminded me of ZD.
Taste is the same fruit bouquet, with a slight touch of malt sweetness providing balance. I was surprised at the bitterness of this brew. I was expecting a tongue bruiser, but it's pretty smooth and easy drinking.
Mouthfeel was medium bodied, medium-low carb. 
Very good DIPA, very drinkable. One of my favorites by FFF, behind ZD. 583 charactersrodkin, May 05, 2013

4.64/5  rDev +4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75First off, I love how Three Floyds tries to confuse people by putting "pale ale" on the label. I am not being sarcastic, I think it's funny and unique. Secondly, the artwork on the label is awesome. I am a huge fan of the genre of metal that Pig Destroyer play...though I am not a Pig destroyer fan. I tend to like Job for a Cowboy, Chelsea Grin, The Chariot, BTBAM, etc., but never got into Pig Destroyer. Now, let's get to the beer. Pours a nice clear golden orange color with a small-medium white head that disappears quickly. Scent is VERY inviting. Lovely citrus fruit and piney aromas. Sweet honey with a ton of hops and just a bit of tropical fruit...mango mostly. Just a hint of malt in the nose. Taste is fantastic. Not overly sweet...just the right amount of sweetness for a DIPA of this ABV. The hops are the most noticeable in this beer. I had a six pack of ZD a long time ago, so can't really compare. Some sticky, malty, honey-ish flavors...but thankfully just a tiny bit. Lovely blend of citrus and tropical flavors...stellar combination of hoppiness. Finish is smooth and kinda dry. Drinkability is very high, as alcohol is well hidden...not hot at all. Mouthfeel is slightly sticky, but perfectly carbonated. Overall, this is a fantastic beer that I wish I could get more of. I would love to see how this one would do if it had been at The Bistro's DIPA Festival during SF Beer Week. 1,400 charactersDovaliHops, May 05, 2013

Taste is also very bright tropical fruits, sweet hops, bright citrus, some biscuit, some licorice, and just the perfect hop bitterness, not too much though and a hint of malt backbone (I guess a hint of malt makes it a pale ale for FFF). I agree I don't see how this isn't an IPA but its amazing. Extremely drinkable, nice velvety mouthfeel, very bright fruit and west coast style hop profile. I wish I could get this again. 537 charactersbrewtus, May 02, 2013

4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle from the Three Floyds store (Munster, IN). 10.00. No bottle date but I should hope they aren't selling out of date product at the brewery. Served in a Three Floyds teku. 
Pours clear bright slightly orange hued gold with almost teo full fingers of pale head. A good bit of lace webbing. 
Smell is dominated by those trademark Three Floyds hops! Mango, peach, orange and some nice inviting malt sweetness. 
The tropical hops kick off with a big bitter dose of orange, citrus rind, peach, mango, sweet bread, fresh cut grass, pine and honey/caramel. Almost zero noticeable alcohol. The booze is hidden in the tropical forrest of hop goodness. 
Nice oily slick medium full body with light zesty carbonation. Sweet orange and slightly bitter grass finish. 
If I'd known how much I would enjoy this I'd have purchased more than one for sure. This is an outstanding DIPA with plenty of tropical citrus hop character, a nice sweet malt body and nicely balanced body. Very well done and worth checking out while it's still around. 1,039 charactersThickNStout, May 01, 2013

A: Pours a beautiful sunset orange with a a slightly off-white creamy head. As it warms, it becomes quite transparent
S: Bright citurs. Lemon peel, sweet tropical fruit, pineapple. A sort of east meets west DIPA.
T: Lemon, sweet tropical fruit, grape fruit. Definitely a swetter DIPA with a fair amount of bitterness to balance it out. The 10.5% ABV? NO WHERE to be found. Perhaps a SLIGHT warming, but goes down almost too easily.
M: A little more than medium. Carbonation is spot on.
O: A great DIPA. This thing drinks like a 8% beer. Tons of flavour, great aroma. It really reminds me of a HF DIPA meeting a hardcore west coast DIPA. I cannot pin point anything overtly wrong with this beer. Perhaps the ONLY thing is that it isn't showing me anything SUPER different from some other great DIPAs I've had. With that said, it is done almost perfectly. A great amalgamation of DIPA styles. 986 charactersmontrealbcr89, Apr 30, 2013

A - Burnt orange, sunset coloring. Soapy sticky eggshell head with a pink hue. light lacing and plentiful alcohol legs.
S - Big citrusy orange marmalade, fruity bath salts, light honeysuckle, banana, pineapple, golden delicious apple, alcohol phenols, mint leaves.
T - Pine zest, orange peel, peach, pear, slightly deeper fruit quality like a bing cherry, grapefruit picks up at mid palate and pushes through the finish. Touch of honey at the back as well.
M - Medium body, perfect carbonation, dry finish. Zero heat even with this high abv.
F - Initial impressions were great, but the aroma actually worsened as it gave way to the higher alcohol. Deserves a 5 for the label alone, and while its not utterly spectacular this is recommendation that requires no hesitation. 828 charactersAuracom, Apr 29, 2013

Riedel tulip
A: Hazy bright orange color. Half finger of bright white head. Good carbonation. Leaving sticky lacing.
S: Dripping tropical fruit punch of hops: papaya, mango, tangerine, etc. pineapple. Overripe peach. Little touch of sweet assertive malts behind it too.
T: Big burst of hop bitterness on the tip of the tongue. Definitely those fruity tropical notes. Papaya and mango are really coming through. Love that the malt bill is thinner than other FFF DIPA. Finish is dry but with lingering fruit cocktail like sweetness.
M: Larger side if medium. Thinner than other FFF DIPA which is nice. 625 charactersinlimbo77, Apr 29, 2013

It pours a half-murky amber color with gold in some places and copper in others - very wide gradient of color. The bubbly, foamy white head has nice retention and leaves a good bit of wet lacing in its wake, nearly all the way down the glass.
A true hop explosion on the nose; Permanent Funeral shows up big with huge notes of citrus, grapefruit, pineapple, and other various, tropical elements. I'm catching a slight hint of mint leaves in the background, as well. The hops give off a vibrant pine aroma, glazed with plenty of hop oils, wet and resinous to the core. Such a bright and uplifting aroma through and through. Someone said this reminded them of an "Imperial Zombie Dust". I can definitely see where they're coming from, although I think it lacks the same citric punch to a certain degree.
The first sip deals out a crazy-huge tongue thrashing of hops and fruits; loads of citrus, tangerines, grapefruits, pineapple - there;s almost more of a citrus overload on the palate than the aroma which is usually not the case. The hop abrasion is still largely intact, though, with plenty of leafy counterpoints; herbal, lightly ashy, with heaps of pine resin. The aftertaste is like a good dose of citrus soaked in a bath of wet, hop oils. Malt? Eh, a little. Light bready flavors that really only appear in the aftertaste, but not much else. The 10.5% ABV is nearly undetectable - always a plus. Medium bodied, slick on the palate, almost sticky, medium-heavy carbonation.
I can't believe this really says "pale ale" on the label. No matter, whether you wanna call it a pale ale or an IPA or a double IPA, the fact remains that it's a damn good beer regardless. Similar to a more potent, less citric, and slightly more abrasive Zombie Dust. Three Floyds definitely knows their way around a hop, and this is nothing but proof. 1,930 characterstectactoe, Apr 23, 2013

What a great smelling DIPA!!! Grapefruit, peach, mango, pineapple and pine needles and faint hints of melon, I could sniff this stuff all day long, and be happy. Taste is very rich and satisfying, a tropical hop explosion, everything I was hoping for and more. A little boozy, but not overpowering. Overall this is another world class DIPA from Three Floyds, I put this one between APW and Dreadnaught. If you can find this one, get it! Three Floyds is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries in the world, and they continue to blow me away with their hop-forward line-up of great brews.

Hazy orange amber color with a white creamy head that dissipates fairly quickly, moderate lacing. 
Aroma of citrus hops, orange, grapefruit, a bit of pine, hardly any malts.
Taste follows the nose with loads of citrus tropical fruits, pine, resin, a little bit of sweet caramel pale malts. Overall taste is very hop forward.
Full mouth feel, fair amount of carbonation, a little sticky and oily but not too much, nice bitter bite at the end. 
Overall, I think I may like this one more than Dreadnaught. Though the bottle says it is a Pale, it definitely drinks like a DIPA. Maybe Zombie Dust’s big brother? I really enjoyed the loads of citrus aroma and flavors. Being a fan of aggressive music, you can't go wrong with a brew named after a Pig Destroyer song. I am hoping that FFF will consider adding this brew to their regular line up. 880 charactersxdtfx, Apr 21, 2013

Pours a lighter shade of glad compared to other FFF double IPAs I've had, minimal activity but a healthy finger and a half of bone white head retain rather well only to leave behind thick sets of lace. 
Sweet, light fruits like melon and soft citrus are the first thing I notice. 
Tasty in a different sorta way. Those classic tropical flavors are present... then some heat from the booze bill is pinned up against some prickly pine. Bittersweet in most every way. The alcohol isn't as well integrated for FFF standards but it doesn't seem to detract from the rest of the beer. Malts aren't entirely lost on this one which is something I can appreciate. 
Very glad to have had the chance to try this one out. Superbly superb! 765 charactersyamar68, Apr 20, 2013

A: Crystal clear golden amber, with a fantastic 'big' looking yellow-tinged head - big bubbles sticking to the sides of the glass, looks like the big beer it is. 
S: Amazing. Incredibly crisp and fresh. Juicy sweet tropical fruits - slight sticky pineapple and mango astringency and orange peel. Big pink grapefruit and sugared grapefruit rind, and incredibly fresh pine, as well as orange juice. I'm going to guess there is a ton of citra and some simcoe in this one - like a sweeter ZD.
T: Huge, intense, perfection! First hit by crisp fresh pine and grapefruit bitterness. In the middle of the mouth it explodes with hop-oily-tropical-fruits - big astringent, musty overripe pineapple and mango, orange peel and grapefruit juice. Finishes forever - waves of sticky resinous pine and grapefruit and coat the mouth. Incredible - super flavors forever

A - Transparent golden body topped by generous white foam that settles to a thick collar, wisps, and splotches of lace.
S - Loads of juicy orange flesh, peripheral tropical fruits, some grapefruit zest and pine as well. A faint hint of alcohol reveals that this is a double IPA, but there's very little malt presence and this doesn't seem all that much bigger than the Zombie Dust we had beforehand.
T - The taste actually seems like an Imperial Zombie Dust, with it's hefty dose of creamsicle flavors - orange flesh, pale malts, and moderate piney bitterness in the finish. No alcohol presence here, but the increased bitterness and malt does reveal that this is a double IPA.
M - Medium body, moderate carbonation, super dry texture, with some lip-tingling bitterness in the finish. Mild warming, but nothing offensive for 10.5%.
D - A really nice beer, although it's not as mind-blowing as I was expecting given some of the other reviews. I could definitely drink this in large quantities, but it doesn't have that intense crackle to it that the best beers do. 1,132 charactersMasterSki, Apr 17, 2013

This is a very good limited release beer. For 100 IBUs I was expecting much bitterness, but the bitterness was somewhat mild and the beer was very delectable. However, Southern Tier's 2XIPA is as good, if not better, and the 2XIPA is much cheaper at only about $1.50 per glass compared to $5 a glass for the Permanent Funeral, so I will stick to ST's 2XIPA for my IPA needs. 445 charactersmjc3151, Apr 16, 2013

4.55/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked this up this weekend with my friend Wyatt. I always have a great time at the brewpub and their food is always delicious. This beer doesn't blow my mind but I am still thoroughly enjoying it. This beer is right on par with the rest of their products and I'd gladly buy again. 
Appearance (4.25) – Great two and a half finger head. Huge amounts of carbonation coming up. Crystal golden color. Head fades at a medium pace. Lacing is not outstanding. 
Smell (4.75) – Has that characteristic Three Floyds smell but scaled up. Very big citrus notes. Incredibly sweet and fresh smelling as well. Citrus presence is so big. Grapefruit is obvious. This is truly mouthwatering. 
Taste (4.50) – Starts with a really bold kick to the senses. Hops are right up front with a huge flavor presence without a bite of bitterness. There is a bit of an alcohol bite, but it is far from offensive. Considering the overall content, it is hidden well. The flavor delivered up front with the hops consists of fruit notes. I get mostly grapefruit and pine which lasts through the finish. Hops linger nicely.
Mouthfeel (4.50) – The bold hop explosion from the beginning leads to a very satisfying hop experience overall if that's what you're looking for (which I am). Lips are slightly sticky and the beer is a little bit thicker than I would have expected (though not thick overall by far). Slow drinker that shouldn't be paired with much.
Overall (4.50) Really solid beer. It delivers a ton and really just has it all. It boasts a huge bounty of flavor from the hops and if you're looking for crunch, it doesn't leave you asking for more. This is a beer which overshadows anything that comes before or after it. It will be the only thing I drink tonight and I will not be saddened! 1,777 characterscsparace, Apr 15, 2013

Appearance - Pale, hazy golden yellow. 1 finger of light foam. Very little lacing.
Smell - Pine, grapefruit, tangerine, peach. Slight vegetative note.
Taste - Astringent pine with a solid malt body. Not getting the fruit notes that I got in the smell. Kinda tastes like a piney version of Zombie Dust (without the Citra) on steroids. Bitter aftertaste.
Mouthfeel - Medium body, medium carbonation, sticky semi-dry finish.
Overall - A nice limited release, but I'll be sticking with other FFF brews. They call it a double pale ale, not a double IPA. I can see why. It's hard to believe it's 10.5% ABV though. It's blended extremely well. Even as it warmed up, the taste did not fall off. That's huge for this style. Extra points just for that. 768 characterssbxx, Apr 14, 2013
4.71/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Picked this up earlier today from the brewpub. Poured from a 22 oz. bomber into my 7venth Sun tulip glass. 
A - Pours a toasty golden yellow, with two fingers of yellow-ish white head. Abundant carbonation billows it up, but it deflates relatively quickly. Sticky lacing clings to the side of the glass throughout.
S - Immense citrus & tropical fruit character. Boatloads of sweet pineapple, grapefruit & mango. Juicy & dripping like they are all at their perfect stage of ripeness. A Hawaiian fruit basket in a glass. Mouth-watering! Little evidence of malt or alcohol, which I find surprising at 10.5%.
T - Hops on hops on hops! The taste mirrors the smell, but with even more intensity. Mango-pineapple juice is my best description, or like the sweet syrup that fruit cocktail comes in. Grapefruit & orange zest. Unbelievably ripe & juicy. A mild alcohol burn, but it drinks like its more in the 8% range.
M - A fuller than usual mouthfeel for the style, with a light sticky sensation that remains after each sip. Great carbonation level as well.
O - It's no surprise that Three Floyd's knows how to brew great hoppy beers, but this is just absolutely ridiculous -- astonishingly good. Makes Zombie Dust seem like water, this is so intense. Be sure to grab this one while its still around! 1,297 characterswyatt13, Apr 14, 2013

First of all, thanks to Dr. K for picking this one up. Poured this from a 22 oz bottle into a CBS snifter. Served chilled...
A) This is a nice looking golden amber brew, with good clarity. There was about a finger of white frothy head on the pour, which quickly settled to a wispy dusting. Nice lacing on this one.
S) A good amount of tropical fruit on the aroma, mainly pineapple. I get a little bit of sweet melon too. There is a bit of pine as well, and a whiff of booze as this warms up.
T) The nose is a good indicator. The tropical fruit becomes even more prevalent in the taste. This finishes with a fair amount of bitterness, that can best be described as white grapefruit with no sugar sprinkled on it. There's definitely some pine as well. Just a hint of that 10.5% ABV. It's well-balanced....
M) Pretty full bodied. It's fairly thick and it coats the mouth. Moderate carbonation. A good aftertaste with a tingly finish.
O) This Mo-Fo gets the job done after a tough work week. If Three Floyds put this in their regular rotation, I doubt there would be anyone complaining. 1,119 charactersRoamingGnome, Apr 13, 2013

a - brew pours a transparent yellow orange with some visible carbonation and a finger of grey white ipa head that leaves a coating of lacing on the side of the glass.
s - my oh my. smells like happiness in a glass. great tropical fruit with just the right amount of dank sticky bittery hops. mouth is officially watering.
t - bouquet of citrus tropical fruit with the perfect amount of sticky dank bitter hops dialed in. really an unbelievable beer.
m - medium to light bodied. refreshing...just phenomenal.
o - with so many of these ipas with the insanely great nose, the taste leaves you disappointed since the nose set the bar so high, but this beer...the taste lives up to the nose. truly a master piece for the style. hope that this becomes year round and available locally (hey, i can dream can't i?). 1,078 characterscosmicevan, Apr 13, 2013

A - Hazy copper orange with golden hues. Pours with a one finger milky white head that settled down to about a quarter inch
S - Tropical fruit nose filled with sweetness of mango, pineapple, passion fruit and strawberry. On the back end, there is biscuity malt and slight hint of alcohol. 
T - Bitter grapefruit up front to give it a kick of hoppy bitterness. However, the profile after the Inital kick is sweet tropical fruit with passion fruit, strawberry, and juicy pineapple coming. I even get a slight hint of cotton candy. There is a slight grassy and hoppy aspect that comes through in the finish to balance against the sweetness.
M - Medium body with low carbonation. Light stickiness within it as you drink it. Light hop resin sits on the tongue in the finish as well. There is a bit of warmth that comes through from the alcohol as well.
O - A very tropical and sweet beer from FFF balanced with the usual FFF hop bitterness. Definitely a unique beer in the FFF profile though with so much juicy and tropical hops. Great collaboration that is definitely worth seeking out. 1,110 charactersjeonseh, Apr 13, 2013

4.58/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Pours a mostly clear golden orange with a nice two fingers of white foam.
Smell: Sweetly pungent aroma of overripe tropical fruit: mango, tangerine, orange, and apricot. There are also some subtle floral notes and a bit of sour funk.
Taste: Clean pine bitterness, tangy grapefruit and orange, some caramel malt, and a bit of a floral nectar sweetness with a semi-nutty finish. I definitely felt and tasted the alcohol on this one, which is not surprising as this is about as high an ABV I've seen for a pale ale.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a smooth but alcoholic finish.
Overall, this may be the best double IPA Three Floyds has ever brewed. It feels very much like an amped up, imperial Zombie Dust. Bursting with juicy, dank, fruity flavors and a nice clean hop bite, Permanent Funeral is a big, bold beer. The only thing I didn't love was the relatively strong alcohol heat present in the flavor. I'm a fan of high ABV beers but I feel like knocking this down to 8.5 or 9% would make this a more balanced and easier drinking IPA. Still, this is a fantastic and extremely well-made beer with one helluva hardcore label and name. 1,174 charactersWolfsbaneBloom, Apr 12, 2013

Aroma: Shoot, as soon as I put the bottle opener on the bottle, I got a giant blast of grapefruit to the face. I felt that boded well for the rest of the nose, and it does. I get passion fruit, caramel, honey and pine in some form or another. And it's very pungent. Definitely in the top 5 for DIPAs in the nose department. 
Colour: A beautiful, slightly hazy copper body that pours with an impressive 3cm white head that takes a good 1-2 minutes to dissipate into a thin white film on top of the beer with a smallish white collar. The lacing is thick and sticky. Definitely a great looking DIPA, but nothing that distinguishes it from other excellent DIPAs.
Flavour: Niiice. If you take Zombie Dust and double the hops and malt, I think this is what you get. A giant blast of grapefruit along with passion fruit, maybe pineapple and pine. And in the middle of it you get a nice dose of honey, caramel and toffee breadiness that reminds me that I'm drinking a DIPA rather than hop fluid. The finish is similar to the start- a blast of citrus, tropical fruit and pine hops leaving a smooth, bitter finish. This is easily up there with Dreadnaught as one of the better DIPAs in the midwest. 
Mouthfeel: A thicker medium-bodied beer that is very well-carbonated which contributes to the smoothness and fizziness of each swig. The finish is a little too dry for me, but the aftertaste is full of grapefruit, pinecone and pineapples. It's a wonderful feeling afterwards to just bask in the hops for a solid minute. Nicely done.
Overall: FFF hits another DIPA out of the park, following their others. I don't care if they call it a Pale Ale, its a double Zombie Dust that's heavy on the citrus that is barely balanced by an intense malt presence in the middle of the swig. It's a beer that lives on the precarious edge of balance, which is typical of FFF and definitely worth going out of your way to buy a bottle of. I usually prefer a little more balance to my DIPAs, like from Pliny or NG IIPA, but I am definitely very pleased with how this one came out. 2,189 charactersStevedore, Apr 11, 2013

4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5...and they do it again. They tinker with Dreadnaught-like base recipes and employ new stuff here, omit stuff there, dry the beer, focus its bitterness, and wallah- another world class IPA!
And like their other outstanding hoppy ales, the beer glows with a medium amber, strong gold, honey-like orange hue. Its modest haze makes the beer look like a night light that has just been plugged in. Firmly capped with a light ivory blanket of foam, the retention outlasts the session and laces with broken rings with every sip.
Its focused aromas are all about citrus- grapefruit pulp and pith, freshly zested oranges, and a hint of lemon. Lightly musty in its citrusy scent, mild fragrant herbs, grass, and fresh bark back the citrus but with very little influence from tropical or other fruit. Soft malt support seems to give the fruit aromas a fresher and plumper aromas in an alomost honey or thin caramel kind of way.
The taste is extremely consistent with the aromas. Just as the thin caramel malt saturates the front of the mouth, the hops pull from the sweetness with ripe and juicy grapefruits and oranges before quickly morphing into lemons, grass, and resinous pine to finish. Deeply bitter to close, the beer snaps shut- leaving the palate refreshed and teased, begging for another quick drink.
Medium-full to start, the beer quickly sheds its sweetness and racy carbonation and favors dry malt textures in support of hop dryness, grassy bite, and a crisp citrusy finish. The bitterness grips the throat and bullies it a bit before it fades.
It's an effortless Imperial IPA that favors citrusy hops over all other. Simple in its plan but extraordinary in its results! 1,678 charactersBEERchitect, Apr 09, 2013

A: Pours a clear orange color with a white head forming on the pour. It recedes slowly to thick ring that leaves some sticky, soapy lace behind.
S: Juicy citrus and tropical fruits. Orange, mango and pineapple. A little lime zest with some strawberry sweetness.
T: The same fruitiness transfers over. Orange with a little citrus zest. A little lime, some mango and a touch of piney bitterness. Sweet bready malts balance the zest. Sweet stone fruit pop up as well. As it warms the sweetness does get a tad much, but not to the point of making it undrinkable.
M: This drinks like it's 7-8%. Dangerously drinkable. Medium to light bodied with a medium carbonation level. Sweet finish.
O: Very drinkable for the ABV, although it is slightly sweet. The fruitiness of it overall was great and the slight bitterness really added a little pop that this needed. Definitely an enjoyable DIPA from FFF. 939 charactersTreebs, Apr 06, 2013

Poured into FFF Teku
Pour: An inviting deep, deep copper orange with outstanding clarity. Head is a solid two fingers of off white with huge amount of thick lacing left. I just really like the color on this one for some reason.
Smell: Not a surprise but the nose is your typical FFF DIPA but one that I continually enjoy. Citrus with pineapple, mango, grapefruit, tangerine and melon dominate. Then some resinous hop presents and some floral hops. There seems to be a sweet component such as honey to balance everything out. I do not get any alcohol on the smell.
Taste: Again the citrus is the key player and the orange (tangerine), grapefruit, some pineapple and a touch of the mango hits at first. This is followed up by some oily resin like hops that helps create a nice hop bite. Then an almost deep dark like honey sweetness peeks through creating a comforting sweet balance. I would classify this one as a juicy DIPA with a sweet twist. Funny I don't get the 100 IBU's though.
Mouthfeel: Smooth and slick and surprisingly light and easy drinking for a high ABV and IBU. The finish is crisp and refreshing.
Overall: I have come to expect nothing but good from FFF with this style. I have to admit they all taste similar to a degree but holy shit I find this one so flavorful and enjoyable that I believe another drive out to the brewery will be needed before these are gone. This is one that I wish they would add to their regular line up because I'd be one happy man. 1,512 characterssleuthdog, Apr 06, 2013

4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This has been described by previous reviewers as an "Imperial Zombie Dust"
Appearance-
A dark orange to red, opulent.
Smell-
The best thing about this beer, strong with pineapple and mango. So rich it almost feels like it clearing my sinuses.
Taste-
This is what I lovingly call "a thinkin' beer". It is not meant to be rushed in anyway shape or form. It started with a surprisingly bitter wash, I felt more characteristic of Stone. Confused at first, since I tasted nothing I smelled. The more sips I took the more rich and flavorful, morphing into the juicy flavors.
Mouthfeel-
Thick, but the hop bitters helps keep it from feeling oily.
Overall-
Fantastic, but not an everyday casual indulgence. 703 charactersRope, Apr 03, 2013
4.44/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25650ml bottle poured into a Three Floyds Teku
The beer pours a nice, bright copper color, just a slight haze in a an otherwise clear complexion, with just a few bubbles rising to the top of the glass. A fluffy, white, soapy head rises out of the beer, nearly 2 fingers high that has good retention but leaves behind just the thinnest spots of lace. The aroma is full of juicy, fresh, tropical fruit, lots of pineapple and mango, tangy grapefruit, sweet tangerine with some light pine and sweet biscuity malt and faint alcohol that is hidden nicely. The flavors are massively pungent, lots of fresh pineapple, honeydew melon with crisp grapefruit and sweet tangerine that brings out the sweeter malt elements with some warming alcohol. The body is super juicy, just enough light carbonation to keep the beer lively that coats the mouth very well that finishes with a fairly dry kick and a nice warming sensation from the alcohol.
Verdict: A very intense Imperial IPA from Three Floyds, which doesn't really come as a surprise, but this might be one of the juiciest and pineapple forward beer I've tasted to date. It's massive, it's bold, it's brutal and yet the bitterness is kept in check making this wonderfully drinkable. 1,224 characterskevanb, Apr 03, 2013

O: Would love to see this permanently in stock. Huge fan. 657 charactersMCain04, Apr 02, 2013

A: Beautiful clear deep orange/amber with nice thick layer of fluffy foam. Side Note: The label art is fantastic.
S: Tons of sweet juicy fruit with just a hint of malt. 
T: Nice and citrusy with just enough bitter hops to balance it out. A little bit of maltiness on the finish, but no alcohol comes though.
M: Smooth and slick with a clean and crisp finish.
O: Just an amazingly flavorful brew from 3 Floyd's. This should be the DIPA they brew all the time, even over Dreadnaught and APW. Really felt like a double Zombie Dust. I'd step over my grandmother to get another bomber. 635 charactersRoyBatty, Apr 01, 2013

4.56/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle poured into a Three Floyds teku.
Pour: Completely clear deep orange, with two fingers of frothy, cream colored head. Head leaves some really thick lacing. A nice effervescence maintains a small head most of the glass. Great looking beer.
Smell: Resinous and agressive on the nose. Lots of fresh blood orange, grapefruit, pine, and oily hops. A honey caramel sweetness definitely balances, but just the right amount. The least impressive aspect of this beer, but still good.
Taste: Much more citrus forward than the nose. Lots of tangerine and nectarines, grapefruit, and a touch of mango. More bitter hop resin. A nice subdued dark honey sweetness. Finishes juicy and bitter with a tandem of citrus and pine.
Mouthfeel: Surprisingly, and welcomingly light. No trace of the abv. Slick, and oily with hops. Finishes with a lingering bitterness and juiciness.
Overall: A really, really impressive DIPA from Three Floyds. Quite possibly their best work yet in that category. 982 characterscfrances33, Apr 01, 2013

A: Pours a brilliant golden to orange hue with a finger of white head that settles quickly, leaving some decent lace and a thin crown on the surface. Great clarity! 
S: Initially, some alcohol is present, but then a swath of citrus, mango, and pineapple overcome, leading to a slightly sweet honey-like aroma.
T: At first I get honey and some caramel sweetness, along with dried fruits. Then comes a rush of grapefruit, orange peel, mango, and... agave nectar? Wow! That's really the only way I can describe that flavor. Finishes dry, with some grassy notes and a hint of warming alcohol.
M: Big and full-bodied mouthfeel with loads of flavor that linger on the palate for a long time after each sip. Finish is insane!
O: Permanent Funeral might be my favorite brew of the style that Three Floyds has put out to date! It's top-notch, and each sip leaves me craving more. Well done! 935 charactersWYVYRN527, Mar 31, 2013
4.64/5  rDev +4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a bright, opaque sunset orange color with decent carbonation and about a finger length head that dissipates to a thin lacing. Smells of pretty bright, juicy tropical fruits like papaya, mango, and pineapple. Also get some citrus fruits like orange and a slight grapefruit. Nice candied sweetness as well. Smells like a big, sweet, fruity double ipa. Taste is amazing. Starts with bright tropical fruits like papaya and mango with some orange juice. Sugary sweet malt is there too. This gives the fruity hop qualities a more juicy-like flavor. Medium is more of the same with some dankness layered onto that. Finish dries out the beer and brings with it a significant citrus peel bitterness. Along with this comes more of the juicy fruits. Papaya, mango, and orange stand out as well as a great candied sweetness. Just the slightest alcohol burn on the end, but no alcohol to smell, which is impressive for 10.5%. A smooth carbonation and oily and somewhat sticky finish. High medium body with a creamy and slightly oily mouthfeel from the hops, but still very clean compared to other dipas at this strength. I have very high expectations when it comes to three floyds dipas and this one meets it and then some. Outstanding beer. 1,234 charactersbrewskis, Mar 31, 2013

A- Looks like a DIPA, nothing to really analyze here. No real lacing present.
S- The smell is amazing. Great citrus notes initially. Followed up with that great earthy smell. When you first pour into the glass, the smell explodes and is present throughout the whole room.
T- Very well balanced. Not a ton of malty flavor but the hops compliment each other so well that it is not needed. There is a lot going on in this beer. Great citrus flavor initially followed by earthy taste. Pine is present as well. 
This is such a treat. Didn't have huge expectations on this beer. This is easily one of Three Floyds best beers ever. An Imperial Zombie Dust is a fair assessment. If you can get your hands on this beer then DO IT!!!! 790 charactersDavihaw, Mar 30, 2013

Poured into a Dogfish Head signature glass, orange/amber in appearance with a decent sticky head.
Smells amazing, citrus and pungent hops.
Intense! Tastes almost like a Zombie Dust on steroids, intense citrus and bitter hop combo.
Wonderful experience. I immediately wished I had purchased another bottle of this after the first sip! 407 charactersMcCarty74, Mar 29, 2013

4.61/5  rDev +3.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured on tap into a 4 oz. taster at Pizza Paradiso Dupont DC. From notes.
A golden bronze amber body, with some nice lemon hues towards the sides of the glass. This looks a tad hazy though, and is presented with a simple thin 2mm off white collar.
Oh boy is this bouquet explosive. Hops and juicy quality just leap off the beer. Sweet tropical melon, juicy fruit, ju jubes and mellow candy with some faint crispness. There is no heat coming off of this either.
Palate is very complex, and extremely hop varied. The palate has that wonderful juicy body and good malt sweetness, but then comes a big blast at first of pine hop resin in the mid palate. The swallow lingers with green melon, and there is an incredible bursting HUGE menthol mint character that permeates the palate. It's almost like shaving cream I kid you not, then the sweetness balances out with multiple sips. Tropical punch juices and more mint candy.
A seriously stupid good DIPA that is aggressive yet tolerable, and a heck of a lot of fun. Really dug this brew a lot, I don't know if I'll ever get to have this again though, that's my only disappointment. 1,131 characterssmakawhat, Mar 29, 2013

4.73/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75On-tap at Pizzeria Paradiso DuPont Circle, brewed in collaboration with Pig Destroyer for the NHC 2013 conference, unknown brew date, poured into a snifter glass, drank 3/28/13 over ~one hour.
A: 4.75 -bright orange, impressive clarity (considering the aroma), soft vertical bubbles and legs, one finger frothy white head that resolves into subtle glass lacing;
S: 4.75 - lots and lots of tangerine, grapefruit and pine pouring out of the glass; I don't know the hop profile but would anticipate some Citra and Simcoe in the mix 
T: 4.75 - I'm not terribly keen on sweet DIPAs but this one delivered; moderate hop bitterness on the front of the tongue explodes into tropical sweet madness - grapefruit, papaya, mango and blood orange
M: 4.5 - moderate booziness at 9+%, solid carbonation and lingering flavors 
O: 47.5 - I am so glad that I had the opportunity to try some 3Fs beers again as part of CBC 2013, and this beer was a pleasant surprise but, to be honest, I shouldn't have been surprised by its quality; it simultaneously hits hard with hops and sweetness, which, to be frank, is really difficult to pull off well because most sweet "Third Coast" DIPAs are sickingly sweet for my tastes; in sum, this is another fine example from The Hop Lords 1,259 charactersMNishCT77, Mar 28, 2013
4.81/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Another amazing new three Floyd's offering at pizzeria paradiso DuPont during CBC week in DC. Man this is awesome, can we hold this every year in DC please? 
The beer pours a very pretty orange fairly clear color with a small ring of head and some nice lacing. 
The smell opens up nicely with some orange rind, tropical fruit, honey, nice semi sweet bitters and slight bit of alcohol warmth that completely mingle with the hops. The flavor is just phenomenal, huge hops right away and all throughout the flavor, grapefruit, tropical fruit, weed, perfect amount of malt and alcohol to compliment it all. Just super resiny, sticky, outstanding. Might be hard to drink a lot of this because of the incredible complexity and thickness of the hop bill. 
An awesome, awesome beer, they again are masters of the hop! I am not worthy. 829 charactersDreadnaught33, Mar 28, 2013
4.63/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Pizzeria Paradiso Dupont.
Pours a light straw clear beer. Frothy white head atop the beer which recedes to a white thin ring. Not much to look at but the aroma and flavor makes up for it. 
The aroma is on par with other big DIPAs. Big tangerine peel notes, some pine, and slight onion. Dry cracker malt profile lingers in the background, but barely noticeable.
The flavor is ridiculously big on hops. This might pack the most hop flavor of any beer I've had. Super citrusy tangerine peel. Floral, pine cones, slight onion.
Tongue scorching bitterness. Medium carbonation. 
Overall this is a SERIOUS DIPA. This is unequivocally the most powerful DIPA, flavor-wise, I've had. Crazy good and definitely something to seek out for hopheads. 750 charactersahalloin, Mar 28, 2013
