Poured into tulip glass off draft.  Super Cloudy, Hazy, and Orange.
Orange, citrus, and light floral nose.  
Fluffy white head with nice lacing. 
The taste was and mouth feel take this beer to the next level in my opinion.  Smooth and almost pillow like, with notes of orange, grapefruit, and mango.  Ending with a smooth malty finish. Well balanced.
This is everything I want in a beer. Truly a world class beer! 461 charactersVFerrec, Jan 30, 2017

This beer is fantastic.  All the reviews hit I right on the nose.....speaking of nose, that's they only lacking for this beer.  It truly had very little if any aroma to me.  I was shocked by that considering how incredible the flavor is.   A world-class beer without a doubt. 359 charactersryno6616, Jan 30, 2017

A: Poured into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Hazy honey-golden body with a small whitish head. 
S: Very nice nose. Juicy citrusy hops (grapefruit, orange peel) and some tropical fruit.
T: Juicy. Citrusy hops - oranges, grapefruit, clementine oranges and a hint of apricot. Hops are soft, not brash, and more tasty than bitter. Warmth from ABV is felt in the belly ever-so-slightly. 
M: Medium-to-full in body. Juicy and creamy, with modest carbonation.
O: This is pretty damn close to being the perfect DIPA. 562 charactersKendo, Jan 30, 2017

3.64/5  rDev -20.5%look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.75Currently #25 on the Top 250 beers list. I found it on-draught at Threes Brewing for $9 per small pour. Billed as an imperial IPA in spite of its scant 8% ABV.
Pours a white cap - somewhat soft - which recedes within the usual 2 minute timespan. Nothing uniquely good in terms of retention or head appearance, but the thick coating of lacing on the sides of the glass is nice.
Body is a murky nontransparent orange-copper of average vibrance. Appears unfiltered, though no lively yeast or dead lees are visible.
Appearance isn't anything special for an (imperial) IPA, to be honest. Looks pretty standard.
AROMA: Brings notes of yogurt (in classic hill farmstead hop fashion), pale malts, floral hop notes, tangerine citrus, onion, and subtle rindy bitterness. Aromatic intensity is average. The yogurt is the standout hop note, lending uncommon tanginess to the hop profile. Suggests a  balanced IPA with a nice hop profile. I'm looking forward to trying it, but aromatically it's not dazzling - just well executed.
TASTE: Fantastic tangy yogurty hop character melts into the tangerine sherbert fruit character, with notes of faint orange creamsicle, floral hops, bright vague citrus, and really faint dried lime in there too. A perfect pale malt sweetness presence keeps the balance impeccable even if the flavour profile as a whole lacks the intricacy of the best beers in the IPA style (let alone the depth and pungency of flavour you'd expect in a terrific imperial IPA).
Hop profile is rather good, but isn't fantastic if we're nitpicking (and one must when confronted with a top 25 beer). Average duration and intensity of flavour (for an IPA; it lacks the punch one wants in a true imperial IPA).
TEXTURE: Refreshing and tangy with a well disguised ABV and an approachable medium body. Soft enough, and well carbonated though not perfectly dialed in. Smooth and wet. Not oily or juicy.
OVERALL: I wish I were in a less crowded environment so I could give this beer a review in finer grain; it's good but not dazzling work from a brewery that excels at capturing an almost unique yogurty hop profile. But depth, subtlety, and intricacy of execution just isn't there yet to make this true Top 250 material. Why it's billed as an imperial IPA is beyond me, but that's neither here nor there. It's a very good IPA I'd happily buy 6ers of if I could, but it isn't worth going out of one's way to track down. Highly drinkable but not dazzling fare from Hill Farmstead.

4.48/5  rDev -2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The beer looks beautiful. Rich, thick, cream colored head that stays. It's got great retention. The body is a hazy golden yellow. It's looks very enticing. 
The smell is a great blend of citrus and floral notes. Stong orange with lighter hints of a floral bouquet and fresh cut grass. 
The flavor is a 180. Strong piny hop flavor bordering on a bitterness that almost resembles coffee. It's balanced by citrus and a sugary sweetness. Leaving mainly a burning bitterness on the front of the palate and a tangy stickiness on the back of the palate.
The beer has the perfect mouthfeel of a double IPA. Rich fully body balanced by a noticable amount of sharp carbonation and hoppiness. 684 charactersTheBeerCarl, Nov 19, 2016

Look: supy hazy bright yellow. All IPA should look like this.
Smell: lots of citrus on the nose with a little bit of tropical fruit in the background. It doesn't explode with aroma out of the tap but it gets nice and aromatic once it warms up a bit.
Taste: strong grapefruit flavor with lots piney bitterness on the back end. A little orange pokes through as well.
Feel: nice creamy mouthfeel. Finishes with a strong drying bitterness
Overall(style points): juicy DIPA that leans toward the bitter citrusy end of the east coast IPA spectrum. a solid beer but I'm not sure it deserves a perfect score. 94.75 points 720 charactersMikeyMcD86, Nov 04, 2016
4.68/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5From a 750ml growler, filled at the brewery 11/02/16. Served in a spiegelau.
Pours a thoroughly hazed dull-gold straw colour with three-plus fingers of lush shaving cream-like head. Retention is good for better than five minutes and leaves solid walls of suds behind.
Smells fresh and yeasty, white bread, pears and ferns.
Taste is lemon zest, grapefruit peel and soda crackers, followed by pear, onion, grassy herbs and pine needles. The chinook pops at the end, finishing quickly with a little bitter orange and pine, and no discernible alcohol.
Feel is smooth, super dry and full bodied, with ample carbonation.
 Overall, a classic benchmark NE DIPA. Other breweries are doing it differently than Mr. Hill, but ain't nobody doing it better. 748 characterspapposilenus, Nov 03, 2016

4.5/4.25/3.75/4.25/3.75
Lush finger of head and heavy lacing. The beer is a dark, unfiltered yellow. Promising. 
It smells hoppy from a foot away. Up close, it's a bit more subtle and aromatic. Pine, moss, bread, jasmine. 
It tastes rather plain, to my great disappointment. Well-carbonated, with a lemony-bitter bite up front. The maintaste is very earthy-herbal hops, very bitter, rather dry (though this is cut near the end). Aftertaste is pleasantly piney and reminiscent of the elder Pliny. 
Would I drink this again? Sure. Would I seek it out or pay through the nose for it? I would not. I think it would benefit from some of the newer, fruitier hops HF sometimes uses. 693 charactersAgentMunky, Nov 03, 2016

Sampled S&S #4,  Susan, and Abner before purchasing anything, then got growlers  of the latter two.  Expected to like Susan best (and it's great), but preferred Abner on site and then when drinking both head to head at home.  As for Abner:  delicious beer with no flaws.
L:  Golden, somewhat cloudy but not, say, Treehouse/Trillium cloudy.
S:  Lemon, grapefruit, maybe a hint of pine, but I get mainly citrus.
T:  Awesome.  Again, citrus--I don't get a lot of the tropical some do.  It's bitter, very much so, and yet  not at all harsh.  Just the right, understated malt balance to smooth things out without at all being a malt-forward DIPA.  
F:  As good as it gets for DIPAs.  Enough body to be substantial, light carbonation, and smoooooth.
O:  At the risk of redundancy:  awesome.  In my top 3 or so DIPAs to date.  Drove 4 hours to get to the brewery; went partly for the bottles of assorted farmhouse ales, but would have felt ok about the trip if I'd just scored growlers of Abner. 1,063 charactersprofessorchow, Oct 29, 2016

4.51/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Yields a completely hazed yellow-golden mango pulp color with a fluffy, stable white head.
Smells of a very intriguing hop plethora, with just the lightest note of cakey malts, perfectly complimenting to the orange quality of the hops. Also packs lime zest, wet grass a hint of dried blueberries and fresh fallen leaves.
Has a fantastic smooth, fuller bodied mouthfeel with a lively finish, never loosing any of its softness on the tongue. While turning remarkably dry, especially during the finish, the beer stays in perfect balance throughout, due to light white bread malts.
Shines from the very first moment by its world class mouthfeel, which is incredibly creamy and soft, slowly inviting fruity hops to the palate. Lemon pulp, orange peel and some unripe mango get amped up by a pleasant, adapting onion sharpness and soothing wet grass. Its only indication that this is an 8 abv beer is its doughy malt balance, which gets recognizable by rounding out the hop melange, providing just a hint of sweet maltiness - the beer drinks incredibly easy. Looses its fruitiness during late mid palate, slowly getting replaced by more silkness and an intense, long lasting lemon and leaf dryness, producing a short, earthy ginger peak. 
Very impressive double ipa, gaining much of its greatness from the incredibly silk mouthfeel, while its perfectly hop composition does the rest. Awesome how this develops on the palate, turns from fruity to herbal to dry - always soothed by soft malts, very well pronounced and clean. 1,521 charactersaleigator, Oct 27, 2016

Color is lemonish and slightly cloudy. Lots of white head 3-4 fingers worth. 
Citrus smell is fantastic with lemon, grapefruit and a little pine. It seems rather tropical. 
Taste is great. I was expecting more of a fruity taste but there is some bitterness there too. 
An extremely drinkable DIPA. I would not have guessed the ABV was 8%. 408 charactersKdouble, Oct 20, 2016

Appearance is golden yellow, slight haze with great lacing
Smell- fruit upfront with slight piney dankness on back end
Taste-  Rock solid IPA, but back to back with Susan, preferred Susan more
Feel- very creamy, this is the beer's best feature.
Overall-  While I thoroughly enjoyed this beer, I felt it did not live up to the hype.  This is not same level at Tree House IPAS 403 charactersjcflorian, Oct 14, 2016

Smells of lemony, caramel, piney, citrusy, dankness.  Sweet and floral, but tropical fruit present as well.  Extreme balance. As it warms, vanilla and sugar emerge.
Wow.  Sweet but citrusy, bitter, and grapefruit pith lingers on the tongue.  Tropical fruit in a way that is subtle and bright.
Thick and juicy body, with a little sparkly carbonation.  Amazingly smooth.
Got at Hill Farmstead today, Sept 28, 2016 in Greensboro, Vermont.  Amazing, fantastic brew.  The look, the smell, the taste, and the mouth feel all tie together flawlessly as though they are one frequency.  Drinking near Ludlow, Vermont the same day I got it. 796 characterspatre_tim, Sep 29, 2016

Beautiful deep hazy Amber appearance.  Nose has a lot of complexity which also comes in the taste: floral, citrus and mild pine taste.  Full, flavorful sticky mouthfeel.  
A high tier DIPA. But I still prefer the HF Society & Solitude #8 DIPA which I also had filled at HF into 2L growler and had back-to-back . 411 characterseifster82, Sep 27, 2016

A great blend of pine/citrus/and resin.  This was a nice change from the "juice bombs" everyone is brewing now.  Look is a nice light orange with moderate haze, leaving lines the glass.  HF just nails the body and mouthfeel. For a highly hopped 8.2% DIPA this beer comes off as almost delicate.  Such an incredibly balanced beer.  Malt flavor is just strong enough to provide backbone for all the hops.  So smooth and easy to drink.  Amazing execution of this style. 565 characterswasatchback, Sep 20, 2016

This is an unbelievable DIPA. Some interesting things hung on. Initial taste says west coast style - done to perfection, but there is also something softer on the back end -- maybe pear?? Hop bitterness lingers. Aroma begs you to sit down and drink. Well worth the trip into Vermont farmland for this gem. Just hoping my other Hill acquisitions are half as good. In my opinion, earns the world-class hype 544 characters11-52_4hops, May 29, 2016

A= This beer is orange, best way to describe the color.  It has a nice level of haziness, still allowing light through.  A bit of actively rising carbonation creating a thick pure white head.  The lacing is very sticky.
S= I get hoppy pine and earth flavors up front with citrus in the background.  The citrus seems mostly grapefruit rind, but pink grapefruit that has a bit of sweetness.  
T= Smooth and tasty hop layers, nothing overpowers the other.  Pine, grapefruit, lemon zest, floral, some resinous in the background.
M= Medium body with moderate carbonation.  Very smooth, a bit syrupy.
O= Nothing that is a noticeable negative.  This may be my new favorite from Hill Farmstead (previously Double Citra).  Perfect balance of hop flavor, malt backing, and bitterness. 872 charactersjhavs, Dec 18, 2015

Appearance:  Light red/ orange, and hazy. Big head, had a lot of lacing.
Smell: I was like smelling a perfect air freshener, lots of flower scents and citrus. Sweet fruits also like apricot or dried peaches.
Taste: tastes like a bitter version of the nose. I feel like I tasted mineral water , orange peel and flowers, maybe so honey dew followed by grapefruit at the end. 
Mouth feel: I think was a strong medium body, it did coat my tongue.
Overall:  I really enjoyed it. It was really juicy and flavorful in the beginning and then would have a bit of bitterness to balance it out. Really a perfectly complex ,extremely balanced beer! Very drinkable. 696 charactersMr_Moe, Dec 11, 2015

32 ounce swingtop growler
Pop it off, very little noise from the pop, was expecting less carbonation to come thru. Full, beautiful white cream head comes up after the pour about 1 - 2 inches in my tulip. one of the most beautiful colors a beer can be - orange, hazy, a bit dark, exciting, mouth is watering
Taste = pale moderately toasty malt/biscuit/hints of caramel/huge citrus notes - not much grapefruit full fruit taste - attention to hop detail,  warrior hops hit hard at the end, but not too stingy for the MF - mouthfeel is unbelievably resinous and smooth and beautiful.
One of the most beautiful beers I have ever had. These guys are amazing. Thanks to Darren again for this beer - looking forward to the next one! 799 charactersthorkelson, Dec 09, 2015

Had on-tap@ Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT
Appearance - Hazy and golden orange in color with a foamy, half-finger width head. Great retention, eventually breaking down to a thin, consistent layer of suds across the surface. Remember that movie and/or show Alien Nation? How those aliens had crazy, intricate markings on their heads? That's how I'd describe the lacing on this puppy.
Smell - The aroma hits on notes of orange, grapefruit, pine and a bit of leafy/minty character.
Taste - Oh wow. Strong orange and a bit of grapefruit pith. Lesser notes of mango and a touch of banana peel. Some leafiness and a light, minty character is found along with moderate citrus pith in the finish.
Mouthfeel - On the lighter end of full-bodied with moderate carbonation. For as big as this is, it goes down incredibly smooth and easy. 
Overall - I love unique brews, and I've never had a DIPA quite like this. It's kind of the Anti-Pliny. Whereas Pliny exhibits crisp, clean precision, this baby makes it's mark by incorporating complexity from all over, but delivers an incredibly well-layered, harmonious flavor profile. Simply lovely. 1,174 charactersTheSixthRing, Dec 07, 2015

Then one of my fave brew pubs down here had it on tap but again I missed out by hours.  I swore I wouldn't let that happen again.  2 more swings n misses before I finally got to try this fine brew yesterday and it did not disappoint.  Another fine  IPA out of VT.  Nice golden color - not mush of an aroma but what was there was pleasant. The taste was exactly what I expected, nice hop hit and super smooth with tons of flavor.  Well worth the effort.

A: Pours a hazy light orange? Tall and bubbly light tan head. Head is soda-like initially but settles down to more of a light, foamy mass. Great retention but just spotty lacing. 
S: Floral with lots of citrus following. Pretty sweet smelling, borderline juicy in fact. Get some nice apricot when swirled. Yum.
T: Very citrusy and juicy up front. Lots of orange and grapefruit. Bready malt. Floral hit with a huge wave of bitterness in the finish. Quite bitter and drying on the back end, giving it a sort of resinous lingering mouthfeel and taste. Tastes almost sort of minerally between sips. 
M: Shockingly heavy bodied. Very full bodied and coats the mouth well. 
O: Hell of a DIPA. Great full mouthfeel and very smooth for having such big, bold hop flavors and bitterness. It creates a very nice balance and ups the drinkability. Make no mistake though, this thing has some sharp flavors and some serious bitterness on the back end. 978 charactersDope, Nov 09, 2015

4.92/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Pours a beautiful unfiltered bold orange with a full two finger head.  Great lacing and retention.  Smells of fresh citrus, slightly dank, some earthy notes and pine.  Taste is overwhelmingly flavorful with mango, orange, pineapple.  Plenty of hops and bitterness on the back end, but it's superbly balanced so not one single great flavor stands out much more than the other.  If anything, a slight nod to the citrus.  Drank from a growler filled the same day, Abner is incredibly smooth and creamy.  I expected big things from this beer given it's notoriety, but this is undoubtedly the best Hill Farmstead beer I've ever had.  It may be the best beer I've ever had. 667 charactersanteatr23, Oct 19, 2015

4.68/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Description: Golden color and clear as could be with a white head and lacing.  Aroma or citrus, mandarin orange, apple, floral, maybe a bit of pine and something a little earthy.  Fruit and apple come through on the taste and bitterness is just enough.  The beer is extremely well balanced and leaves a very clean, dry aftertaste that slowly dissipates off the tongue.  For an IPA, it's a very full-bodied, 'meaty' beer if not quite velvety.
Suggested food pairing: Salmon (grilled or baked)
If you like this beer then you should also try: Sip of Sunshine
Ideal time to drink this beer: After a day of fly fishing in Vermont you've collected an impressive stringer of salmon, trout and other wild, free-range, organic fish (all fish in Vermont are like this).  Since you prize farm-to-table freshness so much, you don't even bother to get home before you clean you fish and immediately place it over a wood campfire that you've built beside the river from wild, free-range, organic wood (all wood in Vermont is like this).  To cap it off, you reach into your bag and draw out the wild, free-range, organic growler (all growlers in Vermont are like this) of Abner that you purchased that same day and enjoy it with your catch.
Overall: 4.75 (This beer is excellent and I would definitely drink it again)  This is the first beer I've had from Hill Farmstead and it exceeds expectations, which were high to begin with.  Complex flavors, perfectly balanced, with just the right amount of bitterness.  This is an extremely drinkable beer.  Everything about it exudes quality and craftsmanship.  HF beers are not easy to get a hold of, but if you can it's well worth it.  Bravo, Abner. 1,683 charactersSHDoyle, Oct 14, 2015

O: One of HF's finest IPAs. To me this is the perfect gateway from the hop-forward tongue bruisers that were all the rage on the West Coast a few years ago to the soft, juicy NE-style that reigns supreme today. Incredible beer and one to be savored. 455 charactersFireman_RK, Oct 11, 2015

4.44/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I tried this from the growler chilled in a Hill Farmstead Goblet shared with abru17
The color is a golden shade of amber with slight haze and voluminous white head with very fine bead and waves of lace stick. The smell has a strong citrus/tropical hop aroma with slight dank quality and mild pine with herbal odor and mild alcohol scent with mild floral quality. The feel has lost of hop in the textur but moderate bitter up front with resinous oily texture and mild malt sweetness with slight alcohol warming as it increases in temperature and very dry bitter finish.
The taste has a slight pine element with high alpha hopping apparent in that there is dank herbal tropical fruit and slight citrus zest with hint of floral esters. The malt is there mid palate with only a mild amount of sweetness to support and subtle mango with pine in the residual taste with a mild pineapple-like quality which carries that dank hop taste after the swallow. This is a great Imperial Pale ale, loverly blend of Simcoe taste with a great blend of hops to provide lush aroma and low bitterness yet a ton of hop flavor which makes a great Imperial IPA to me 1,144 charactersSlatetank, Oct 05, 2015

Still retains its carbonation judging by the frothy and creamy pale white head. Streaming carbonation reaffirms that. Copper-colored body showing excellent clarity. Lacing by the ton, think wild west brothel. 5
My, my, my. I know that smell. It's my favorite. Bright, popping sweet and mellow honeydew and canteloupe. I love this aroma. Reminds me of Yellow Rose, which I can't get enough of. I'd leave it at that because it's such a dominant and yet pleasant aroma, but to expand a bit, this has a bubblegum, floral quality and alluring sweetness. Hints of citrus. Beautiful. 4.5
While I immediately connected this beer to the Yellow Rose I love and adore as far as the aroma, the flavor diverges quite a bit. Sweet melon flavors, bubblegum and flowers carry on from the nose, but there's much more of a bitter, grapefruit peel flavor hitting my tongue. Light caramel notes squeak in front palate before the citrusy side of the beer make a forceful entrance. This is pretty remarkable. 4.5
Smooth, floral and mildly yeasty initially before the emergence of a more assertive zesty, tangy citrus feel. Smooth all around though. Creamy, minerally, and bitter. 4.25
What else to say? Damn good. 1,293 charactersONovoMexicano, Oct 03, 2015

S: Very nuanced smell until the beer warms a bit, then it's an explosion of citrus fruits.
T: Taste follows the smell. Very delicious citrus fruits, with a gentile pine bite.
F: Incredibly soft and way to easy to drink. Perfect carbonation and no booziness.

Thanks to @Evilash for grabbing this for me over the weekend.    Poured darker than I expected.   Was expecting a cloudy haze of a beer in the grand NE tradition, but this beer bucks tradition in every way.    Huge citrus on the nose, floral in taste, and that clean HF finish.   There is a slight booze burn, but it adds depth to the beer.    All in all, a wonderful experience- right there with the other VT IPAs and perhaps exceeding them. 525 characterstmbgnicu, Sep 30, 2015

Acquired from the brewery last Saturday.  About the only one of the early Hill Farmstead releases I have not yet tried, perhaps because it's their highest rated on BA.
Poured from the 25.4 oz. growler into a Samuel Adams IPA glass.
a: Clear dark gold/amber with a huge two inch foamy white head which receded to rocky surface foam and dense lacing which hung on from the very top of the glass on down.
s: Moderate citrus.
t: Citrus with orange notes over a medium biscuit malt base and a balancing hop bite.  Bitterness lingers a bit on the tongue.  Rather high ABV is well hidden.
m: Medium, good body and no shortage of carbonation tingle.
o: A very fine DIPA distinguished by tasting at least 2% less than its reported ABV and relatively easy drinking as such.  Been awhile since I had Ephraim but Abner certainly gives him a run. 874 charactersscotorum, Sep 24, 2015

A- pour is hazy, yellow color with ridiculously tight-packed bubbles. Wow!  
S- I got citrus in the realm of grapefruit, apricot, tangerine. 
T- really. Hits you with bitter citrus like orange peel, lemon rind, danky bitterness. Superb!
M- rich and creamy medium-bodied. Soooo good. Finishes nicely, not really dry at all. 
O- this is truly a world-class IPA. 408 charactersJamesStreet, Aug 03, 2015

A: The beer is a light gold color, with a large dense off-white head that fades very slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains citrus (most grapefruit), caramelized malts and floral hops.
T: Everything comes out at you all at once with this beer… the bitter hoppiness, the citrus sweetness and the hearty maltiness. I have had a great number of IPA’s & 2IPA’s over the years and have not experienced one where it happens as much as it does with this beer. There is also a very good balance especially considering the strength of flavors. Everything is strong but nothing is over-powering. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is very clean for the style.
O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent 2IPA to pound down for as long as you can handle it. 1,028 charactersTheManiacalOne, Aug 01, 2015

It's bitter, it's sweet, it's piney, it's juicy. It compliments the malt and at the same time forsakes it. It is a beginning, a middle, and an end playing out on an earthy stage. Fantastic. 282 charactersAlpacaAlpaca, Jul 30, 2015

A: Extremely cloudy with a thin, white head. Has a dull, creamy yellow color.
S: Grapefruit pith, tangerine, sticky/hoppy dankness. 
T: Heavy on the grapefruit, some notes of lemon and has a nice dank aftertaste. I detected a hint of tangerine citrus as well.
M: Crisp, refreshing DIPA. Hops are prickly to the tongue with little bitterness. Has a clean, dry finish with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: Simply stunning! The combination of grapefruit and sticky, hoppy dankness is an aroma that I will never forget. 582 charactersMA_hops, Jul 28, 2015

F - One of the smoothest 100+ IBUs I've ever consumed
O - excellent stuff, I want to meet Abner and share a glass with him someday too
I have to add:  This is one of those beers that you need to sit and have more and more of.. It seems to really open up and become even more impressive as your sitting goes, only other beer I've said this same thing about is Pliny the Younger 614 charactersM_chav, Apr 04, 2015

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My favorite beer to date.  Opague amber orange, nice lacing but the difference maker with Abner is the nose.  Holy shit!  Huge mango nose and pretty much any other citrus and tropical fruit you can think of.  Smell is beyond a 5.  Taste follows and although slightly boozy at the finish it's still absolutely crushable.  I can't get enough of this beer when I'm in VT and my mornings suffer as a result.  I can go on and on about Abner but you'll just have to try it yourself.  If you are heading up to VT with the highest expectations and you fear that as a result Abner may be a slight letdown what will likely happen is it will be better than you could've imagined.  It's that good. 685 charactersHopDeezy, Apr 02, 2015

When leaving the brewery... and not knowing when I'll get to try this brew again... left me feeling a bit empty.  It is everything it is said to be... simply awesome. Having to hunt this stuff down for one glass... keeps me from ranking this a 5 across the board. This is a beer that should be #1... but will never be... because it won't reach enough mouths to experience such a piece of beauty in a beer. The fact that it is a 12 here... is only data... purely data. 573 charactersfulcrumbs, Mar 30, 2015

A: Cloudy, murky yellow/gold colored beer.  Big white head (2 fingers) with great retention.
S: Juicy tropical fruits (grapefruit, oranges, peach), some floral notes, the malt breadiness is there too, with big sweet sugariness/caramel on the back end.  Really complex smells that work well together
T: Citrus and pine blend together so well with the malt.  I'm normally a much more hop forward guy when it comes to DIPAs but this is done so well.  Its funky, dank--the grapefruit/tropical fruits are creamy and juicy without being too sweet, too.
M: Drinkability is crazy--nice mouthfeel (medium/full) and good amount of carbonation.
O: The hype is real!  I've been waiting quite  a while to get my hands on this one.  Its incredibly well done (shocking, this is HF right?) and just so damn drinkable for 8.2.  Hard to say much more here other than go get this one! 926 charactersTbub18, Jan 31, 2015

4.79/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from growler into a hill farmstead tulip. A couldy yellow colour with a really nice head retention and lacing, silky white head. 
Aroma is full of citrus floral notes, lemony and some light piny notes, robust florals, peppermint, grapefruit, wildflower honey. So complex and inticing.
Taste is full with balanced hop character, creamy grapefruit, resiny wildflower notes, a touch of floraly lemon sweetness then a growing gradual resiny bitterness. Tons of rich orange citrus. Fantastic balance. Drinkability is crazy with so much depth and balance.
Mouthfeel is really full, gentle carbonation with a full bodied malt creaminess, maintains enough of a full dextrin complexity to balance the hop bitterness impecably. Alcohol is well hidden and such a fruity and hoppy body with a creamy upfront malt.
Lives up the hype as an impecable ipa. It balances itself so well between the strong citrus and floral hop character and a creamy malty body. It's is delicious and complex, fantastic. Certainly an impecable beer with a great complexity and warming beer, impressed by the great balance here and the ridculous quality from start to finish. 1,150 charactersmick303, Nov 24, 2014

Appearance: Hazy dark gold. Head is bright-white and fluffy to start. Tiny wisp of a cap with a small collar. Some splotches of lacing. Moderate carbonation on the pour. 
Smell: Stone fruit. Very vague notions of tangerine and grapefruit. Loaded with mango and peach and some pineapple. Slightly bitter pine needle. Juicy fruit. Malts are typically light and bready. Touches of pale malt sweetness with honeyed biscuits and some undercooked white bread. Slightly caramelized malt sugars. Deeply floral with some hints of hibiscus. Pine sap and some raw honey. Big and bold without being too aggressive.
Taste: Follows the nose closely with a touch more bitterness. Tons of stone fruit - mango, peach, and something like papaya. Tangerine with some touches of grapefruit and orange rind. Oily resin. Tons of floral elements. Fresh flowers, dried almost hibiscus. Bitter pith. Malts are lightly sweet with a combination of pale malts - offering bready elements and a touch of raw biscuit dough - and some slightly sweeter caramel malt. Bready. Bitter pine needle. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Initial sip is slightly slick. What I want to see out of the style. A little sticky.
Overall: We can be friends.
A nice Imperial IPA. It's big but balanced and carries that drinkable quality every Hill Farmstead IPA has. 1,366 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Nov 15, 2014

Consumed 11/15/14
A: Hazy tangerine - some copper at its core, some gold around the edges - pours with a medium, white head, fades to a nicely wispy cap, leaves some spotty lacing
S: Big, juicy citrus, with some level of sanity - juicy, fleshy, ripe orange, grapefruit, ruby red grapefruit - very fruity with peaches and apricots - tropical notes, pineapple and mango - resinous, with a big floral push - very flowery, with some herbal and grassy notes - light pale and caramel malts, with some light sweetness
T: So juicy, so fruity - juicy, ripe orange, tangerine, and ruby red grapefruit - to an extent, this tastes like a tropical fruit blend, with all the fruit flavors co-occurring here - ripe peaches, apricots, pineapple, and mango - lightly sweet throughout - pale malts with some caramel - pine, herbal notes, floral notes, and a light touch of mint - moderate level of bitterness - light touch of alcohol, but extremely clean overall (the norm for Hill Farmstead)
M: Medium body, nicely carbonated, smooth, finishes mostly dry
O: Stop living up the hype, please
Presently, I live about 80 miles away from Hill Farmstead. After now having reviewed a handful of their beers, I realize that I would drive 180 miles each way. Maybe 280. And I'm not entirely happy about this. Abner is among the best I've had from Hill Farmstead. The hop profile is excellent, and it's so clean that I just want to drink more. The fact that this is 8.2% ABV is actually dangerous. 1,536 charactersangrybabboon, Nov 15, 2014

S - Great nose.  Passion fruit, fresh ferns, bright cilantro, mango, grape skins.  Rustic edges.  Incredibly fresh.
T - Fresh, bold, and herbaceous.  Juicy center with orange and mango.  Biscuity malt on the backend.  Bitter herb and mineral water finish.

5/5  rDev +9.2%Where do I begin about this beer.  Enjoyed from the brewery in Greensboro.  
Aroma is full of pine and citrus.  Balanced nicely, without being overpowering.
Taste is perfect.  Literally as good as it gets.  A blend of lemon, grapefruit, pine, and tropical fruits.  I get lots of passion fruit for whatever reason.  The mouthful makes it easy to drink an entire growler alone.  
As good as a DIPA gets. 404 charactersbitterbeerguy, Nov 05, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +3.7%I've never had a beer before that claimed it was so high in IBU, but so delicate on the palate. 
Huge aroma bursting with citrus, pine, mango, and papaya undertones, maybe some evergreen as well. Perfect carbonation, nice white fluffy head with lacing that seems to stick to the side of the glass nicely. 
The flavor was to follow suit with the aromas, but I would add hints of kiwi and pineapple to add a definitive tropical flavor. 
Overall, one of my favorite imperial IPA's for sure, but not by means my favorite. Amazing stuff though, hopefully I'll obtain more in the future. 584 charactersWreckedPalate, Oct 02, 2014

2.75/5  rDev -40%Meh.  I'm not really sure what the hype is about.
Popped a growler.  low carb, thin bodied, light aroma,  seems like a standard IIPA.  Not sure where they theorize 170 IBUs pretty sure this is a made up number.  
I would have left out the Dextrose.  This seems to have dried out the beer a little too much and left behind some fusil alcohol notes which are undesirable.
Shaun really missed the mark on the this one. 418 charactersGentalmensRelish, Sep 30, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.2%Abner is an incredible DIPA. I wish it were easier to get, but as it is, I feel blessed to have had 2 growlers full (2L & 750). They're doing a lot of things very right at Hill Farmstead.
Perfect color - bright orange and hazy and gets slightly lighter around the edges. It's easy to pour with a nice fluffy 3-4 finger head, and the lacing on the glass is thorough as the head dissipates.
The smell is a bit understated. I don't want to imply that Abner doesn't smell wonderful, because it does - it's just that it doesn't fill the room with hoppy smells like some beers I've opened. That said I pick up a huge array of fruit including pretty much all the tropical fruits (guava, papaya, mango, pineapple, passionfruit) as well as sweet citrus and orange/tangerines.
Taste follows the nose. This is an incredibly complex and flavorful beer. Just like the smell, the taste has all of the tropical fruits as well as citrus, orange, tangerine, and more. The malt takes a back seat to the fruit, and any pine or resin present is very understated compared to the fruit as well. If you love fruity, juicy DIPAs, then Abner is your holy grail. Don't be fooled by the 170 IBUs either. Abner is so incredibly flavorful, smooth, and balanced that it doesn't taste bitter at all. I've had beers with half the IBUs that tasted twice as bitter.
Mouth is soft, smooth, and amazing. For a DIPA it's perfect. I'm sure Hill's water has something to do with it. As others have said, I'd really like to know what's in Hill Farmstead water that makes all their beers so soft and smooth tasting.
Abner is a truly world-class beer. I confess that as of this review I haven't had Lawson's DS (but have had MBC Dinner, lots of Heady, Ghandi, etc..), and I've heard some people say they prefer DS - and others give the edge to Abner, but I think it would be nearly impossible to brew a better DIPA than this. Abner is the holy grail and well worth the drive into the NEK of Vermont, regardless of where you're coming from. If and when I do try Double Sunshine, I'll update this review. 2,065 charactersRichKent, Sep 29, 2014

L) Pours a hazy, tawny/orange with a average size white head.  
S) Smells of beautiful hops and a bit of yeast thrown in there. I prefer mine a bit more citrusy, but this is still an amazing beer.
T) This is a well balance DIPA.  Not too bitter and not too malty. Again, I would like a bit more citrus, but I'm just nit picking.
F) Nice.  A bit dry. 
O) Not going to lie, this did not live up 100% to my expectations. When drinking DIPA's I have to compare to MBC Dinner, which I thought was spectacular. Would I drink it again, yes, but I would not go out of my way to acquire again. 684 charactershuddyball, Sep 21, 2014

4.72/5  rDev +3.1%Poured from a 750 ml growler into a hill farmstead stemmed glass. Best by 9/19, purchased 3 days ago at the brewery!
Pours a super hazy golden body with a big frothy head that reduces slowly to leave thick lacing and chunks of white foam.
Smells amazing - super aromatic with heavy citrus, sweet resin, bursting tropical grapefruit, pineapple. 
The taste follows the nose with citrus being the dominant note, followed by tropical fruit, pine, floral hops, and creamy malt with raw hop oil sticking to the tongue, leaving a resinous pine bite on the tongue. Absolutely delicious, perfectly balanced. Medium carbonation with a rich creamy body.
Overall, does Abner live up to it's high regards? Drink it fresh (this was 3 days old), and the simple answer is a resounding yes. This is up there with heady, and with it's raw character and perfect balance, it's safe to say that it can give heady a run for its money. 916 charactersgcamparone, Sep 16, 2014

Peach foggy color-- thick white head dissipates after a couple of minutes to thin white lacing
Aroma of citrus- orange and apricot, mildly dank hops, and vanilla
Taste is citrus, orange, apricot, slight mango, fresh hops and sunshine

Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of citrus, grapefruit zest, mango, light peach, bitter pine resins and some buiscuity malts on the back. 
Taste: Like the aromas, it has a loads of citrus fruit, grapefruit and orange zest, mango, peaches, some bitter pine resins and some buttery/buiscuity malts.

4.75/5  rDev +3.7%Poured out of a 750ml growler into a tulip glass. I seriously want to thank one fellow bottle share local who brought this and several other HF beers out to the Bay. It really was a one of a kind, special event.
Pours a cloudy, near murky amber color. Lots of frothy foam at the top, and definitely does its job to stick around. I no longer dock beers for their appearance, but it's definitely easy to say that this is quite rustic looking and not clear eye candy as "other" famous DIPAs are. Nevertheless, this is highly representative of the Vermont, home brewed styled aesthetic, and this beer can't be faulted for that.
The aroma is lovely - a combination of tropical fruit notes, citrus, herbal dank esters, and lots of complex yeasty and malt notes. Pineapple, guava, and mango are very evident here, as are lots of other citrus notes. Peppery and floral, with a lightly earthy and lightly wet and funky presence from the yeast. Very herbaceous from the hops - think green onions and you're on the right track. You can tell that this is ALIVE, and definitely delivers a punch that many hoppy beers of its nature strive for.
Tastes absolutely delicious, with no surprises based on the aroma. It's definitely bitter, with an enormous blast of citrus and tropical notes at the front, with a creamy, crisp characteristic that takes the profile that Vermont's yeast strains are known for to the next level. Notes of guava, peaches, and pineapple really hit point blank here, with a bittered citrus and spicy finish that is complimented by the fresh crisp toffee malt flavor and body of the beer. Could it be the water? The yeast? Regardless, all of the ingredients come together perfectly, and the finish is absolutely one of the most memorable I've had on a hoppy beer to date. Not only do the hops appropriately cleanse the palate, but the finish is clean and airy as any great beverage - or, hell, any great glass of water - is. The palate is immediately ready for the next sip, and the beer never becomes a chore to drink. I had two more beers from HF that night, and even though this was the best one overall (though not my favorite), the qualities of its body seem to be a common consistency among HF beers - and, arguably, I can see why people often claim they're the best in the US for that reason.
It was a true pleasure drinking this - the last of hyped beers I've ever wanted to try, and a perfect closure to my beer journey in the past two years. I shall gladly drink this again, but I'm glad I don't have to fly to Vermont to do so right away. HF beers are of world-class quality, and Abner is no exception. Sets the bar for what a good homemade recipe can be, and what it aims to define as to why we drink excellent beer in the first place. 2,759 charactersmagictacosinus, Sep 04, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -1.7%Appearance- Hazy yellow, medium head with good lacing.
Smell- Mango, guava, pine, slight acidity.
Taste-  Citrus backed by light pale malts. Resinous but also fruity. This is extremely light for a double IPA. Way too drinkable, almost scary. 
Mouthfeel- Crisp, clean, highly carbonated.
Overall- Vermont double IPAs are a style that I don't quite understand. The ones I have tried have all been lighter than most single IPAs but pack a huge punch. This was a delicious, very drinkable beer but not what I look for in a double IPA. 534 charactersspacebear09, Sep 04, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -1.7%From a refillable bottle gotten at the brewery today. 
A: Like all the other DIPA's, this pours a dark yellow color, hazy, with a strong pure white head that has good retention. Lacing is pretty good too.
S: First things I noticed are the lemon and clementine juice. Then, there is ripe mangoes and apricot followed by very ripe pineapples. I didn't expect this much sweetness from this beer to be honest. It is like powder sugar and a tiny tiny amount of caramel. 
T: First off, you get the lemon/clementine attack. Then, you get assaulted by the hops. A quite impressive amount of dry-ness comes in the shape of citrus peels, just like biting into a bitter grapefruit peel directly, very strong. Then, you get the powdered sugar finale. What is weird with this beer, is that it seems to "echo". You go back to the lemon/clementine then hops then sweetness all over again. It's like the tastes are so strong by themselves that they all lingers on. Alcohol is nowhere to be seen. Very sour and dry, but also sweet.
M: Quite light but quite sticky too, which is not my preference.
O: This is quite unique I must say in a world of copycats. From a brewery that mastered the DIPA style, I get this, and it is quite different but I can't seem to describe how it is different (maybe it's the use of more "traditional" hops than what we are used to see in the DIPA scene). A must try for any hop-whores. This is very drinkable stuff too. 1,436 charactersflipper2gv, Aug 29, 2014

M: Full-Bodied and Chewy.
O: 100/100, Amazing, Bar-Non the "BEST" APA I have had the pleasure of laying lips to.
Notes: 
I don't know what else I can say about this delicious beer, other than this is the "real" best American Pale Ale in the world.  This isn't about being a local either, Zombie Dust was and is one of my favorite beers that I have had the honor of sampling, but Abner is the real deal.  As are his relatives, Edward and Ephraim...  
All I can say is get some of this beer, this beer is going to be more common on Hill's Tap List in the coming future, so wait to see the response this beer will receive as more of a mainstay on the tap list like Edward...  Come to Vermont and get some of this or hit up a trader with a growler.  You won't be sorry. 1,129 charactersVTLocal420, Aug 26, 2014

Huge green nose with spruce tips, grapefruit rind, and almost a dankness/ditchweed character.  The beer has just enough sweetness and drinks like liquid hops.  Minimal bitterness cold, while there's a bitter kick at the end as it gets closer to room temperature.  Absolutely world class.  The body is so clean, and the mouthfeel is so smooth.  Nicely carb so it doesn't come across as sticky. 517 charactersPHBoiler, Aug 22, 2014

Enormous citrus aroma, heavy with oranges. Assertive and inviting. 
Firm semi-sweet malt foundation. Explosion of fruit. Bitterness bursts at the swallow, and drags the fruit with it through the afterglow.
Nice prickly mouthfeel.

A) Cloudy amber, big head with good retention and lots of lacing.
S) Very floral up front, malts and some yeast in background. 
T) This is all about the hops, very little of anything else. You get tropical and citrus flavors, lots of them.
M) Medium-bodied, light carbonation, very good balance, dry finish.
Definitely lives up to billing. Too bad the brewery is 625 miles away or I would be a frequent customer. 483 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Aug 09, 2014

A: Poured a very cloudy, golden color, with a slight, 1/2 finger head. 
S: Floral in spades, with that certain "Dreadnaught-esque" candy-coated alcohol that is absolutely to die for. 
T: Very Dreadnaught-esque in its IPA disposition: Fresh Orange juice, grapefruit, and some caramel and butterscotch thrown into the mix.
M: Hell, what do I know here. I guess I'll add that it's lowly carbonated, non-sugary, and damn-near perfect here.
O: This lives up to its hype, for sure. 628 charactersChaney, Jul 21, 2014

A fat head of creamy white foam adorns this beer and it looks striking. It has a beautiful tempting nose. Succulent hops, their citrusy fruitiness and some spice. A bit of soft sweetness for malt. It's the fruit peel that comes forward first and then as it drinks, some tangier tropical flavors. Dry biscuit malt that's a touch earthy and a lovely and balanced hop bitter finishes this one with grace and poise. A floral that comes to to the nose subtly and translates into the drink almost unnoticed except for it's lightness , it's flower petal backnotes. Dry with a crisp middle this drinks heavenly. It has stature and a tallness in the glass. It 's the way that the flavors come together with the spice creeping up on you until it ends with a slight flourish. It's the way the malt is softly sweet but not too sweet and how the fruit character seems to soar. It's the balance in the drink and in the end and that the bitterness is complimentary not dominating. 
This was tremendous. Thanks Roguer for sharing this on with me. 1,107 charactersutopiajane, Jul 13, 2014
4.53/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Beautiful beer: 1 finger Snow White head with good retention and tons of lacing; opaque, pulpy light orange and yellow brew.
Full, classic DIPA aromas. Light biscuit, slight tropical fruit, lots of citrus, a hint of pepper.
Delicious! Tons of juice: mango, lemon, creamy pale malts, biscuit, and slight pepper. Far more tropical fruit than citrus. Some citrus peel and pine resin on the backend.
Creamy, relaxed mouthfeel. Soft yet lively.
Another delicious hoppy beer from HF. 481 charactersRoguer, Jul 13, 2014

Poured beautifully into a 12oz water glass. Didn't have proper glassware due to the fact that I'm taking a short vacation in VT (I'm drinking this at a Holiday Inn Express). The body is hazy and amber orange. Two fingers of fluffy white head.
Smell is like taking a stroll through a farmers market: fresh, crisp, vegetative.
Taste...magnificent. So fresh, so balanced. I'd believe the brewers if they told me this beer had no alcohol content whatsoever.
Creamy, airy mouthfeel. Very pleasant. 
#14 on the Top 250? Well deserving! 625 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, Jul 11, 2014

A - Brilliant orange color, with a pleasant haze that screams freshness. A ivory head coats the sides of the glass as it quickly fades into the brew.
S - I pick up orange and pine, and some subtle yeasty esters, but none is overpowering. Certainly not the extreme olfactory experience of other DIPAs.
T - The taste is much more forthright compared with the nose. Rich orange citrus and sticky pine resin tastes coat the tongue. The the only way to describe the malt is a masterpiece of balance - nothing else really compares. The finish is just a touch bitter, but for 170+ IBUs absurdly smooth.
M - Like the malt blend, liquid perfection. 
O - What a fantastic beer. Like all Hill Farmstead beers I've had, it doesn't hit you over the head with flavor and leave you trying to catch up. Rather, it invites you in to savor all the layers of flavor and fermentation expertise that go into the beer. The somewhat tame nose confounded me somewhat, but the experience of actually drinking this beer is one not soon forgotten. 1,090 charactersporter_collie, Jul 08, 2014

A - Hazy, burnt orange color with a yellowish glow around the edges and bottom of the glass. Has a look as if I just poured a glass of grapefruit juice. Leaves a creamy head that dissipates quickly into a thin ring around the top of the beer. Slippery lacing slides down the sides leaving some splotches. A design-like swirl of froth covers the beer on top. 
S - On the nose I'm getting grapefruit rind mixed with pine and orange peels. Mangos come to the front as the beer is aerated with a quick swirl. I'm in love! If left sitting for a moment, you can pick up a little bit of dankness from the hops. 
T - Now this is what I have been waiting for! Just a load of resinous delight from the amount of hops used with a blend of tropical fruit. Fruit such as: mangos, pineapple, grapefruit, stone fruit...I could go on and on. There a cleanliness associated with this beer and I impart that because of the well water used. There is a honey-like sweetness from the malts used as well. A delight to sip!
M - This bad boy coats your entire palate and sticks to all four corners. There is a slight expansion of froth once it lays there for a second. A delightful bitterness is very present, but subtle enough to feel the acidity. Medium bodied, complex and well-rounded.
O - If I lived in VT, I do not believe I would drink anything else. I'm sure it's like anything, you'd get tired of it after a while, but it would be very hard in my book. As I mentioned before, I am absolutely in love with this beer. I can't thank Steve enough for sharing this with me. If you haven't had it yet, trade everything for it. And if you have had it, why are you drinking anything else! Cheers! 1,764 charactersCubatobaco, Jun 28, 2014

I'll skip to the review of taste, as the others all take care of aroma and appearance.
Taste - A little different than I was expecting based on the description and other reviews. To me, this beer had some citrus aspects, such as bitter grapefruit peel, but the flavor was mostly dominated by the pine. Not my favorite flavor profile.
Overall - This is a very solid DIPA, and I enjoyed it. However, I enjoyed a number of the other HF hoppy beers I've tried much more. It surprises me greatly that this is the highest rated of the bunch. Glad to have tried it, but certainly not one I would seek out again. 668 charactersthebigredone, Jun 27, 2014

A - Medium haze like a great IPA, fine one finger snow white head. Lacing clings to the edges, delicate and fine.
S - Tropical pine, if there is such a thing. Mango mashed with spruce, and grapefruit. The nose is complex and a bit formidable.
T - Straight from the nose, lots of fruit. The challange is corraling all that flavor. It swirls and dances acros the palate. Alcohol is buried in the maelstrom.
M - Medium bodied. A thick slick feel. Nothing offensive, with a clean tight finish. The fact there is not a long lingering oil from all those hops speaks to the design and exceution from the brewer. Stunning quality.
O - The beer is simply wonderful. The hop profile is significent, however the beer is crafted with such detail that nothing is offputting. The flavor and nose dance a delicate duet that culminates in, delight.

A: Bright golden color, slightly hazy, pours with 2 fingers of white frothy head that reduces slowly and leaves great lacing. 
S: Dominated by the grapefruit, mango, citrusy blend. Not much malt to speak of in the aroma. I like. 
T: Very sweet, has a lot of the citrus characteristics present in the aroma that pop in the flavor. I do have to say, having had Harlan last night, I prefer the flavor profile of Harlan to Abner, as it has a more balanced profile all around. 
M: Carbed well, fairly dry. Surprisingly bitter. 
O: Solid offering by HF, definitely a beer I'd love to get again. The aroma and flavor leaned strongly towards the fruity/citrusy side. 690 charactersroger617, May 23, 2014

4.62/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75L: A super hazy gold, almost looks like fruit juice, with a creamy white head and excellent lacing.
A: Big Pine, apricot, citrus and a touch of peachy esters. Malt is neutral and clean in the aroma.
T: Smooth bitterness upfront, moves into big juicy and piney hops and a moderate mouthfeel. Hop character takes on flavors of apricot, big piney notes, and citrus. The ester profile from the aroma enhances the fruity character, and the malt sits behind the hops and allows them to come to the front. A dry but creamy finish gives the hop character a nice lingering finish.
Overall, one of the best DIPAs I have ever had, very well balanced and full of big, complex hop flavors. The brewers here in Vermont seem to be creating their own version of IPAs, very similar to west-coast but less bitter and with a more prominent yeast ester contribution. Hill Farmstead is living up to the hype. 890 charactersSiriusfisherman, May 11, 2014

Citrus and pine on the nose. Notes of sweet orange and tangerine-like flavours, and maybe some mango. Soft caramel malt throughout. The combo of hops adds amazing floral and piney notes as well.
Tastes much like it smells, and goes down very smooth with little bitterness. Hops are more present than they are on the nose. The malt flavour is much more pronounced on the finish with notes of toast and caramelized bread crust.
The body is medium to thick, and has decent carbonation. A slight warming feeling going down is really the only indicator of the alcohol content. 649 charactersIan_B, May 03, 2014

S - nose is earthy/herbal and juicy/fruity. Freshly juiced oranges. Tangerines. Grapefruit. Sticky pine needles. Freshly Pollenated flowers.
T - if i had to sum it up in one word. Grapefruit juice. But since i can expand... Crisp and cracker-y malt profile. Grapefruit rind dominates. Lemon zest. Green leafy herbs. Lots of pine. More tropical fruits on the backend. Tangerine with a touch of guava.
M - lighter side of medium bodied. Texture is smooth yet watery. Very resinous on the palate. To be objective a bit astringent but i did not find it to be detracting.
O - an exemplary double ipa. A massive hop bomb yet it just calls to be quaffed dispite its high alcohol content. 803 charactersTeleweizen2, Apr 27, 2014

In his honor, this double pale ale is dutifully crafted from American malted barley, a plethora of American hops, our ale yeast and water from Abner’s well. It is unfiltered and double dry hopped. Aromatic and flowery, bursting with notes of citrus and pine, this is the ale that I dream to have shared with Abner. 8%, 18.5º P, 170 Theoretical ibus. Ingredients: Pale and Caramel Malt; Dextrose; Centennial, Chinook, Columbus, Simcoe, and Warrior hops; Ale Yeast, and our Well Water."
Received this growler in a trade, and the tag says "Best Consumed by April 3, 2014".
Served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed balloon glass.
In the glass, Abner is a rustic but beautiful looking IPA. The body glows with a bright orange haze and the puffy, marshmallow head develops slowly and compacts easily, giving it the ability to pop out over the rim of the glass. It has a smooth, creamy texture, and leaves impenetrable rings of lacing on the side of the glass. After some time, the head withers down to leave just a floating island of white bubbles in the middle of the glass.
Inhaling Abner's scent is not something you would soon forget. It is not delicate, but it is certainly not bold. The aroma carries hints of sweetness and bitterness, oozing with notes of pine sap, honeysuckle, kiwi, mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and citrus zest. It's a feast for the olfactory glands. This tropical aroma, bright and citrusy, is very popular with craft drinkers right now, and while I am not opposed to any other types of profiles out there, I find this particular "style" of hop aroma to be so appetizing, refreshing, and interesting all at once.
The head acts like the cream on top of the milk.It is soft and buttery on the lips. The texture of the beer is also very soft, and approaching creamy. Smooth carbonation, and plenty of it. Up front is a bright fruitiness, with hints of peach tarts and grapefruit. Immediately following that, across the palate is a flash of bitter citrus fruit, and then some serious pine flavors mixed with the lingering bitterness and astringency of citrus rind. The aftertaste carries notes of tropical fruits, and a light berry flavor. 
There is no doubt that this is a world-class IPA. What Shaun has done with this beer is create something that is classic, rustic, and sharp all at once. It's highly drinkable...in fact, it is crushable (though it may end up crushing you). I finished off the 750ml growler by myself. I am feeling the effects: lulling me to sleep, spreading a smile across my face. I am so glad that I got to try this beer. This is something that the Beer Hunter would have been excited to try. 2,810 charactersMusicaleMike, Apr 03, 2014

The aroma is big juicy hops of pineapple, mango, peaches. A bit of yeasty note along with a light white bready malt. The beer has a medium plus to heavy bitterness.
The beer despite the lack of Citra or newer American hops has beautiful fruity flavors, despite a theme of pine and herbacious bitterness. It is one of the best hoppy beers from Hill Farmstead outside of Societe and Solitude #6 and Susan, of the ones I have had. 476 charactersdar482, Mar 20, 2014

Like many have been a huge IPA head for a long time, but have found this one to be elusive. Won't waste time with redundancy. Beer has been well described without yet another blow by blow from me. Having said that glass I drank had a wonderful fresh orange nose and taste. One that was not so much one of many characteristics of the beer... as it was a real definer and distinguisher from other IPAs that are more lemon/orange or grapefruit forward.
I also loved that it was so delicate. Don't get me wrong...this is a big beer. But it didn't bury your tongue. It didn't coat everything. It came and went with just aromas and flavors lingering... not the actual residue of the beer. Coming in at a less than 9% also makes it almost sessionable. 
I'm trying to imagine coming home from work and just grabbing one of these as my end of day relaxer. Hmmm... wonder if wife is up for relocating?
Add my voice to the chorus...Bravo HF and thanks for the craftwork. 1,017 charactersBillRoth, Feb 18, 2014

Poured from tap into a tulip glass at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, Vermont. Deep orange/amber color and expected cloudiness. On the nose, the scent of citrus pine was easily overwhelmed by grapefruit/orange scents. On the palate, hops assert and the malts were nicely subdued. On the palate, the theme repeats itself, with a nice, clean hoppy burn on the end. The mouthfeel is more than drenching full/substantial. I think I like this well-crafted monster (dare I say it) better than the infamous Heady Topper of similar profile. All in all, a remarkably fabulous experience! 671 charactersJohnParadee, Feb 02, 2014

4.95/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Served from a 750ml growler into a Hill Farmstead stemmed tulip.
Appearance- Hazy orange with one finger foamy white head with great lacing.
Smell- Peaches and tangerines for days. There's some strawberry and pineapple mixed with grass and pine. Floral and fruity with a decent malt backbone.
Taste- Peaches, pineapple, green grapes, nectarines, pears, fresh cut grass and spruce, mango, etc. Very fruit forward with a nice bitter piney finish. No real malt here, but the sweetness of the fruits makes up for it. Finish is bitter and dry. Absolutely no hint of booze.
 Mouthfeel- Medium full bodied with firm viscosity and high carbonation. No booze heat. Pretty much perfect IIPA mouthfeel.
Overall- Pretty incredible. Can't believe how long it took me to try this, but I'm glad I finally get to! 802 charactersSeanniek91, Jan 27, 2014

All of the offerings from HFS are phenomenal and this is their pinnacle for me. Just a beautifully done DIPA all around. 
Hops are wonderfully done here; stone fruits, pine, floral beyond comprehension. Had on tap numerous times when in VT for HT. Was so good I bought a few growlers to bring home with me.
If you get the chance to try some do it. Shooting up the BA ranking and for good reason. 442 charactersMS22, Jan 27, 2014

A: Golden, cloudy appearance with vanishing head leaving a ring of white lacing at the edge of the glass. 
S: Wonderful nose of tropical fruit, pine and citrus. I could sniff this forever. Slightly sweet.
T: Fresh piney, earthy hop flavor followed by tropical fruits and a lovely grapefruit bitter finish that lasts forever. Despite the nose, the malt presence is fairly dry. A bit of alcohol on the finish.
M: The mouthfeel is masterful for a double ipa. Tiny bubbles dance across the tongue. The feel is light and resiny at the same time. So easy to drink which is dangerous for an 8.2%. The finish is drying and pleasant - each sip invites another.
O: This is an artfully crafted double ipa which I enjoyed immensely; the hop freshness is front and center but the balance is the key to success here. Well done HF, I look forward to trying more of your beers soon. 984 charactersbrianmandell, Jan 23, 2014

Didn't want to send it again as a two week old growler. Looks like the shipping hasn't affected it. Pours a murky yellow/orange. Small head but great lacing left on the glass. The smell isn't overwhelming but it's very pleasant. Citrus is dominant. The taste is very well balanced. The citrus and grass/pine mesh well and nothing specific stands out. There is a nice slight bitterness, and it's not too sweet. Carbonation has held well. Mouthfeel is creamy, medium bodied, and spot on, like most HF ipas. This has to be my favorite HF beer, if not my favorite of all time. It's so easy to drink with so much flavor. Abv is hidden very well. 711 charactersMikeypnh, Oct 13, 2013

A: Attractive orange, cloudy, and very Hill-esque.
S: Strong citrus hops--as to be expected--and alcohol.
T: Kind of like Susan on steroids. Tropical citrus and apricot overwhelms with a significant alcohol finish.
M: Perfect, as to be expected from Hill.
O: Undoubtedly one of Hill's finest. Don't take my word for it though, it's one of Hill's most reviewed and still perfect. One of the few beers I could drink without end. Try it if you can. 535 charactersBTVflatlander, Oct 12, 2013

Taste is much more piney than the aroma. I also get some of the honey flavor; presumably from a light malt. The color also hints that they used lighter malts. Mouthfeel was a tad thin, but I did enjoy the hop 'sting' on the tongue. Overall a great DIPA; I haven't been disappointed by Hill Farmstead yet, and doubt I will be any time soon. 457 charactersmverity, Oct 11, 2013
3.6/5  rDev -21.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75A - yellow orange and clear. 
S - great aroma from the strong hop profile. The citrus and pine notes really set the scene. 
T - whoa. WAY too much alcohol flavor. Shockingly so for how highly rated this beer is. Plinys ability to hide alcohol must be unique. For me this knocks this beer down. The rest of the taste is in line with a great American IPA or apa. The strong alcohol presence will prevent me from buying the beer again. 
M - very nice carbonation and very consistent. 
O - I was delighted to get this beer on draught at the brewery (after a 4 hour wait!!!) but thought that this beer did NOT live up to the experience or the hype. Hill farmstead makes good beers but in my opinion and experience totally not worth it. Sorry HF fans. 745 charactersKiteman, Oct 11, 2013
4.9/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Fresh growler poured into HF tulip.
Appears clear sunny amber with two fingers of fluffy white head with great head retention and good lacing, she is a beauty. Smells of light orange peel, grapefruit rind, apricot, wheat. Taste rich citrus notes,dry but some sweet malt to counter bitterness, very well balance, hard to detect the alcohol which is surprising at 8.2%. Light-moderate body, moderate carbonation, creamy mouthfeel.
A brilliant IPA from HF, my favorite from them so far. One of the better IPAs I have sampled. 524 characterswilliamjbauer, Oct 11, 2013

Alright, so this beer pours a clear copper body. Perhaps straw-orange. With that trademark Hill Farmstead 2cm white head that has awesome retention. Not a whole lot of lacing on this actually, but who cares? 
Nose is not as pungent as Susan which we drank earlier today, but it just smells better.. its got that orange zest combined with citrus and tropical fruit.. but the biggest contribution is that floral scent. Deliciously floral. Great nose still, but Susan and Ephraim has it beat. 
But you know what, that flavour profile is so incredible. So complex with tons of citrus and tropical fruit. It has that great malty backbone that isn't too strong but just balances out all the hoppiness in this beer. Its such a perfect balance for a DIPA. 
Mouthfeel, again is that incredible creamy Hill Farmstead full body. I have never had such a full bodied double IPA. Again there is just something in that damn well water, I want to go visit Hill Farmstead, use the bathroom and fill up a water bottle and send it into a lab for analysis so I can treat my homebrew like so. Aftertaste is that bitter citrus flavour, but not so strong. It is so incredibly drinkable, even more so than Susan was. Can't tell that this beer is 8.2%, not at all. It drinks like a session beer.
Overall this beer is one of the best double IPAs I've ever had. It beats out Pliny and Heady, but its kind of unfair since this is Hill Farmstead we're talking about. It's up there with Double Sunshine as one of the best to come out of Vermont. 1,619 charactersStevedore, Sep 07, 2013
4.75/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A - Yellow-orange, no head. I could care less about appearance, so unless it's really beautiful or really ugly, it will get the average of the other ratings. Who drinks a beer for appearance anyway?
S - Fruity, piney, maybe a little spicy, but definitely different from a typical IPA. Not sure exactly if it is a particular hop that gives it that smell, it could be the yeast or even the malt because I would almost describe it as a very clean malty smell. 
T - Fruity, piney, clean malt taste, possibly the most balanced IPA taste. 
M - Low carbonation (which I like), extremely smooth, and actually too light (can't believe this is 8.2% ABV), great balance of malt and bitterness. 
O - This might be the most balanced IPA I have ever drank. About the only thing bad I can say about it is it is too smooth, too light, and there is nothing in your face about it. 866 charactersianmatth, Sep 04, 2013
4.72/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75a: poured from a 750 mL growler purchased at brewery, 2 days later, into branded wine style glasses, the beer is thoroughly hazed thanks to its unfiltered nature, a deep honey amber in color, producing a full head that retains well
s: a beautiful array of hops here, with fresh blood orange zest leading the way, opening further into fruity notes of kiwi, pineapple, peach, and coconut - really awesome and I can say that I haven’t come across a better hop nose, somewhat floral, just generally fresh with something new around each corner, wholesome unfiltered yeast nuances, the malts compliment perfectly, pleasantly grainy with a balancing dose of caramel, lovely stuff
m: medium bodied, silky on the tongue, with a lower level of carbonation, extremely smooth
t: again with the arrestingly delicious hop character - oily orange rind blends with sweeter, juicy notes of kiwi, peach, and pineapple; tasty, perfectly balanced grains with a firm but clean caramel note, the lack of filtering lends a fullness to the flavor, and the bitterness begins midway, creeping to a big but not overwhelming strength in the finish, love it
o: without question one of the best dipas out there, and seems totally unique at the same time in the way it is weaved together, expertly crafted for sure, and a testament to fine ingredients

Anyhow, Vermont has destroyed my pallet. We secured Double Sunshine and Heady before making our way over the ol' Farm(stead), and when we got there all they had on tap were hops, hops, and hops. It was like a goddamn rabbit convention. But even then, after already sinking several feet deep into Heady Sunshine, and even after sample the three other selections (Citra, Amarillo, and S&S4), even then, this one tasted special.
At first, honestly, I thought it was the citra and the girl had just made a mistake while pouring, since the beer begins with a pronounced mango burst. But then a couple sips in, centennial and columbus hops become super pronounced, with big nodes of pine and herbs and a slight grape-iness. A bready finish of fresh yeast and caramel malts provide balance in the back end and do a phenomenal job of disguising its high ABV.
Most people, myself included, will probably prefer Heady, but this is definitely the more sessionable of the two. 1,103 charactersmynie, Aug 31, 2013

Hazy golden orange colour, one finger of dense white head with a solid ring of lace. Smell is quite dank with tropical fruits, some fuzzy peach and a bit of lingering malt. Taste is hoppy with lots of grapefruit and dank pine resin flavours, more citrusy as it goes dry with a moderate malt flavour as well in the finish. Medium carbnation, dry and fairly full bodied. Excellent stuff here, so incredibly easy to drink with no alcohol to taste, would drink this as often as I could. 518 characterspeensteen, Jul 17, 2013

#1
 - Tasted and noted on 12-Jul-13.
Poured from a howler that was filled 14 days ago and it traveled cross country in summer days. Not the ideal condition probably, but seeing as how I'm in SoCal, I'm not complaining.
Aromas are kind of faint but get the typical pine and tropical and citrus fruits. Smells as if it's going to be dry. Bit of zest and earthy-ness. In the taste, it starts off with pine and earthy-ness. Then a sweet, caramely, nectary juice. Dank pine hops all throughout. Definitely in a good way. It's got a low malt body and got a crisp dryness in the finish. Almost got a saison-quality to it. 
170 theoretical IBU?? Tastes like half that. 8.2 abv? Could pass as a single IPA. Fantastic DIPA. Very dangerously drinkable. I can only assume fresh from tap would make this unworldly.

 - 2014 vintage

Tasted against Double Citra, Legitmacy, and Nelson Single Hop. Of the four, I ranked this one 1st. In fact, this is one of the best IPA's I've ever had. I will now often wonder when I'll get to have this off tap again... 1,161 charactersRollzroyce21, Jul 13, 2013

A- Pours a somewhat hazy golden/straw color with a thick white head with decent retention and good lacing. Some floaties can be seen upon close inspection.
S- The aroma is piney, with a lot of butterscotch, and a big punch of citrus, tangerine and grapefruit in particular. An aroma to die for!
T- The flavor is somewhat hard to define, though it is markedly delicious! It takes some work, but I'm able to distinguish caramel, butterscotch, fresh grassy hops, dank hops, citrus with more grapefruit than tangerine (opposite of the aroma), finishing with a dry piney hop bite that is moderately bitter. 
M- The mouthfeel is buttery and smooth, with mild, yet distinct carbonation. Dangerously drinkable at 8.2%!
O- This is yet another fantastic beer from Hill Farmstead! It took me 3 trips up (the first 2 it came off the tap list the day before and the day of arrival!), but it was well worth the wait! 950 charactersSadMachine, Jul 09, 2013

Appearance: Pours a hazy amber and leaves a finger of fluffy white head.

Taste: Starts with some light pine and earthy tones, followed by some citrus/grapefruit. Finishes with some nice, bitter earthy hops. Alcohol is very well hidden.
Mouth-feel: Medium, or a little more, carbonation with a medium, refreshing body well suited for the flavor profile. Very smooth finish.

A: Pours a golden yellow with a small white head on top. This is exactly how this is supposed to look. There's some lacing that's left along the glass as I drink this bad boy.
S: Holy hops! Citrus and pine hops erupt from this brew into my nose. The intensity is absolutely mindblowing. What a fantastic smelling beer. If you are looking for malts then this is definitely not the beer for you.
T: The taste follows the nose to a T. Big, juicy citrus and pine notes dominate my pallet with ease. The citrus notes follow to the tune of grapefruits and this makes for a pleasant drinking experience. There are a miniscule amount of bready malts, but the beer is all about hops and not much else. I'm not sure if I've ever had a better DIPA in my life, and I'm not sure if I will have a better tasting one.
M: A medium mouthfeel that dries pretty quickly. A modicum amount of bitterness, which allows for an extremely pleasant drinking experience. I don't feel like my taste buds are being assaulted, but rather being catered to in a nice, juicy, hoppy, flavorful manner.
Overall: This may set the standard for DIPAs. What a fantastic beer. I really didn't know what to expect upon cracking this growler open. Boy, am I glad I did. This may be one of my favorite beers of all time. Hill Farmstead did an amazing job crafting this one. Especially since I know it came together in a tiny ass garage. Shaun and crew, I tip my hat to you guys for an exceptional beer and experience. 1,532 charactersRichD, Jul 09, 2013

Cloudy golden yellow with a frothy 2 finger bone colored head that holds nicely, and it is an unfiltered Imperial IPA, just gorgeous with superb lacing.
Aroma is that of an intense hop-bomb, like strolling through a grapefruit grove surrounded by pine trees, with a hint of juicy pineapple. Malt? What malt?! Hop forward as they come: delightful.
Taste is intensely packed with hops, grapefruit is predominant. The bitterness factor is formidable, and not for the meek: definitely builds as the growler is extinguished, yet it never reaches the level of overkill for my tastes.
Mouthfeel is medium, incredible dry finish, bitterness lingers at the back of the palate & even the throat. There is a relatively high level of acidity going on with Abner and overall is a real palate spanker.
Fans of all out grapefruit bombs will marvel at this bold IIPA as it delivers the goods in every way. Those not on board with the high level of bitterness would probably prefer Hill Farmstead Ephraim, but either way, HFS caters to hop lovers that appreciate superior craftsmanship only found in small handcrafted batches. 1,205 charactersHendry, Jul 07, 2013

Poured into a tulip glass from the tap at The Farmhouse Tap and Grill.
Pours a nice pale copper with some slight haze and some orange hues. There is a nice half-inch medium dense head that forms that is white/off-white. The head is sticky as the brew goes down and the head recedes leaving some slight lacing on the sides. (4.75)
Aroma starts of with resinous and piney hop notes that are dank and fresh. Somewhat herbal. There is then an amazing plethora of tropical fruit; orange and tangerines mixed with some slight pineapple and mango and of course the ever-present grapefruit offering a delicious and inviting refreshing citrus note to the brew. Some slight bready malts are perceived under this dance of amazing hops. The tropical fruit notes really shine in the nose as the brew warms. (5.0)
Wow. The taste is ENCHANTING. There are notes of resinous pines with some herbal and quite grassy characteristics starts things of. Then the awesome tropical fruit notes reach in and fill the palette. Once again the grapefruit dominates for me with some slight lemon citrusness. Then some mild pineapple, notes of mango and tangerines and even some peach. Amazing. These are all well orchestrated and so layered amongst each other and give the brew a very elongated flavor profile. The nice pale malt gives the brew some balance with good earthy, bready grain and some slight caramel notes as well as the slight boozy sweetness from the higher ABV. Mouthfeel is near perfection with a smooth and silky body that is carbonated perfectly to allow for some palette cleansing. (5.0)(4.75)
Overall the tropical fruit notes mixed in with the citrus hop notes are the key to this brew. Very well orchestrated and a plethora of flavors that are rich on their own but are also very well layered and balanced with each other. (4.75) 1,848 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jul 03, 2013

4.67/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5This brew was poured from a refillable 750mL Hill Farmstead bottle, filled at the brewery growler-style, into our Founders snifters. It glows a coppery golden orange, putting up a two finger head of creamy off white bubbles. This shows nice retention, leaving thick honeycombed lacing around our glasses. A definite haze cuts clarity, but no sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be moderate. The nose is richly citric and resiny of hops, with pale and lightly metallic toast of grain, fresh apricot, pineapple, and nectarine fruitiness, and a floral honeysuckle air blowing across the top of it. With warmth the aromatics really start to flourish, giving enhanced hoppy bite and sweetness of grapefruity, floral, and softly earthy varietals, mineral-laden well water, mud, black pepper booziness, muscat grapes, graham cracker breadiness, fresh mint leaf, blackboard chalk, and fresh peppery vegetals. Our first impression is that the flavoring gives extraordinarily juicy and fruity hops, but with nice balancing bite from the harder water and zing of grain. As we sip, the taste begins with a strong interplay between starkly, but authentically, sweet nectarine, tangerine, and pineapple syrups, and the dominant power of grapefruit rind, hop, and stem. These are met and balanced by a menagerie of raw honey, white grape sweetness, sulfuric mineral, lemon rind, herbal and earthy leafiness, cooling vanillas, lactic creaminess, metallic yeast juiciness, and solidly pale grain. The middle comes to a peak with lemon and grapefruity hops, herbal and spicy malt undertones, ethanol, gravel, mineral water hardness, mango fruitiness, and floral clover sugars. The finish is awash with pale graininess, effectively cutting the hoppy onslaught, along with newspaper inkiness, bright yeastiness, chalk and graphite, shitake meatiness, mango, strawberry, and pineapple fruitiness, and sweet booziness, with more of an herbal hoppiness shining through the ashes of the former grapefruit gods. The aftertaste breathes bitterly of grapefruity rind, seed, and juice, sweetly of nectarine and white sugars, pale grain, ghostly wheat, gravel, distant bubblegum esters, planty sap and resins, bittering moss and musk, light amber maltiness, and sea saltiness. The body is medium to full, and carbonation is medium to high. Each sip gives beautifully soft and creamy slurp, smack, froth, and glug. Finishing pop is nice and long. The mouth is left cooled and wetly coated, with eventually mild tannic astringency across the palate, and moderately robust pucker. The abv is appropriate, and the beer drinks incredibly well.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. While the nose gives a strong, balanced, juicy rendition of the liquid to come, the ultimate taste is astonishing from that first sip. The hops remain dripping wet, sweet, and juicy, but take on a curiously strong bitterness of grapefruity rind and citrics. The yeast works its way in giving bitterness, along with that harder well water that is so apparent, but seamlessly inclusive. The feel on the sip gives just about all you could ask for, with frothy brushes of creaminess and enough pucker to wake you up. This is a must have from Hill Farmstead, and well deserved of the reputation it has thus far attained. 3,297 charactersTheBrewo, Jun 30, 2013

Pours a cloudy orange with a dense off-white head.
Aroma of pine, citrus, grapefruit, light orange/lemon.
Taste upfront is moderately bitter with flavors of pine, grapefruit, lemon, and orange peel mixed with a slight citrusy sweetness. Less bitter finish with piney notes. Very little malt presence. Lingering pine and lemon peel bitterness. As the beer warms it gets a bit more bitter and some of the citrusy sweetness drops out.
Medium body with moderate to low carbonation. Clean finish.
Really good. Hop-forward, but not overly abrasiveness even with such a light malt presence in the taste. Nice mix of citrus and pine.

A: Pours orange-tinted pale colored with two fingers of dense, fluffy off white head which slowly deflates. Very good retention, leaving a thick ring and some surface head for much of the duration, and generous swaths of lacing.
S: Pretty long-reaching aroma, I can initially smell it from a foot away. Candied tangerine, hint of a tropical note, peach, pink grapefruit, an undertone of breadiness/cracker.
T: Floral and light pine notes, pink grapefruit rind, pale crackery malt, finishing with a mild, lingering bitterness and noticeable sugar. Alcohol is almost completely hidden.
M: Kind of a yin-yang, with soft, milky medium-full body and sharp, medium carbonation. Leaves your mouth completely dry.
O: Very good, well constructed beer. Quite drinkable. That being said, it wasn't quite blow-my-mind good, and it seems that there are much easier to get options out here in SoCal (e.g., most IPAs from Alpine would be better than this). But I was very glad for the opportunity to try this. 1,011 characterspmarlowe, Jun 18, 2013

Pours a hazy peach honey with some soapy top suds. Smells of peaches, mangoes, some resin and some biscuit malts. Not that impressed on the nose. Flavor is malt, more peach, some pear, grapefruit, lemon, resin and more crackery malts. A little sweet, but some bitterness in there too. Medium bodied with moderate carb and an off dry finish. Although decent, not overly impressed with this one either. Of the imperial IPAs I've had from Shaun, I've yet to really feel like he has done much for me, a little too sweet in 2 out of three (best so far was S&S4). The pale ales have been tits though. 622 charactersharrymel, Jun 12, 2013

A: Beautiful golden color with a thin ring of head. Some legs on the glass. Nice. 
N: Surprisingly light nose. Tends toward the earthy with a hint of grapefruit. Plenty of crystallized sugar. Mandarin oranges in syrup. Pineapple starts to show through as this warms. Some onion and garlic. 
T: Quite bitter with just enough malt to balance. Hops are well showcased and earthy. Light touch here leads to a cavalcade of flavors. Some minerality, artesian water in here. 
M: Very dry to the point it almost feels like the body disappears. 
O: As good as advertised. Definitely a beer that showcases the best of the style. More kudos for Shaun Hill, I suppose. 693 charactersSarlacc83, Jun 10, 2013

A. Hazy light amber with a white head, fading quickly and leaving the faintest of lace
S. Beautiful floral bouquet of citrus, pine, a light caramel-like malt.
T. Wow. First softly floral then immediately eviscerated by a strong pungent piney resin that has serious follow through. Just enough lightly sweet malt to keep the hop punch in check. The sweetness is slightly tropical in quality, especially as the drink warms; apricot, pineapple, peach. The sweetness is very secondary in nature, the shoulders and neck to support the mind full of hops.
M. Just a tad into medium, fairly light bodied. Coats the tongue and imparts its bitterness leaving your taste buds daydreaming. Crisp enough, where the bitterness and the bubbly are harmonious, and not struggling or raging.
O. One of the finest DIPAs I have ever had. Complex, unabashed, and simply delicious. 954 charactersNuclearRich, Jun 08, 2013

Flavorwise, it's everything the nose leads with plus an added strong earthy hop punch. The earthiness starts to come out in the nose at it warms as well. It can be described as a bit garlicy. I get a bit of that sauteed onion and garlic with fresh herbs type of impression right after the initial citrus juice impression, but it fades on the finish.

Got this on my trip up to Vermont to sample the wonderful beer that has come out of Vermont's booming beer scene. 
A - Pours murky and cloudy with hues of amber and orange. Voluminous frothy two finger head. This is not a filtered beer and will not be losing any points for that. This is what a hoppy pale ale should look like - stunning. 
S - What can be said about something that is near perfection. Juicy, punchy, dank, and substantial. The aroma of this beer hits all the right hop notes - pine, citrus, and herbal. A harmonious blend that tempts you to dive right in. 
T - The promise on the nose is upheld in the taste. A harmonious(using this word again) blend of all the right hop notes. The C-hops are front and center here, but at just the right blend. A citrus punch if I have ever had one in a beer, and that is right not wrong. You get a tight juicy delivery that is just so...legit. This beer is delivering on all accounts for me. 
M - Smooth and slightly effervescent. This drinks well for a 'double' pale ale. You could drink this all night, but it would begin to pack a punch after your 2nd or 3rd beer. Nothing harsh, nothing over the top. 
O - Hill Farmstead prides themselves on making hop forward pale ales, and this is a shining example of their craft. Not like many of the Imperial IPA's you see out there that seem to have either bitterness or sweetness turned up to ten. As they classify this as an Imperial Pale Ale, I see this designation most fitting. You get the best of a nice clean pale ale with the best of a Imperial IPA showing off its hop muscles. I would recommend this to anyone and everyone as this is a beer that transcends all tastes. Impeccable... 1,803 charactersnesarebad, Jun 01, 2013

A- pours a hazy, golden orange with about a finger and a half worth of white head. 
S- upfront I get aromas of pine, citrus and melon. Also, a little grassy, earthy scent. Very dank.
T- Lemon with orange peel is what comes through at the front/middle of the tongue giving way to the hop bitterness. Very well balanced and light and smooth. Very easy to drink.
M- leaves a dry finish in the mouth with a residue of the bitterness as well as a citrusy, lemon taste.
O - Abner is one of the best DIPAs I've ever had that compares and rivals Heady Topper. Definitely is worth the hype and worth seeking out. Very well balanced, smooth and very easy to drink. Hill Farmstead really has crafted a masterpiece with this beer. Will always get this when available. 804 charactersnootch23, May 31, 2013

A - This is a perfect looking Double IPA. Great thick head that goes up to one finger and leaves some spotty lacing as it diminishes to a nice cap and ring. And the hazy apricot color is beyond beautiful, its almost radiating
S - Big hit of tropical fruit and sweetness. Hop oil comes through big almost imparting a "bitter" smell similar to aspirin. Huge citrus and pine. It seems the hop profile gives this beer an awesome depth as almost all hop bases are covered just in the smell
T - Almost perfect balance between malt and hops, the malt is just barely there to bring the hop rocket back to earth. For having 170 "theoretical" IBUs this beer is not overly bittered. It is so damn smooth I would never think that the alcohol was above 5%.
M - Slightly heavy on the medium side of viscosity. I could use just a little more carbonation, but I'm just nit-picking, this is some great shit!

Huge smell. Simply huge. The beer is full of citrus and hop aroma. Tangerine, orange peel, and grapefruit are all there with a fresh, perfectly balanced floral bouquet. Some malt sweetness is surely present, but not in anyway standing out.
So drinkable and perfectly balanced. all the flavors of the smell coming together in perfect harmony. Sweeter than expected with an awesome hop resin bite after each sip.
The mouthfeel is medium, a little on the heavy side for IIPAs. The carb on this growler is a little low, but nothing generally representative of the beer. 
Overall this is one of the best IIPAs I've tried. Definitely in close competition with heady. Very different from Permanent Funeral and Hopslam. I wish it were just a tad easier to get in Wisconsin. 955 characterslunarbrew, May 30, 2013

Immediately stored in fridge and after 10 days still tastes great with good carbonation levels,(still had a small CO2 cloud upon release.) Served cold into a over-sized wine glass.
A: Pours hazy, quite cloudy, lots of carbonation bubbles trying to escape the glass and sticking to the bottom walls....beautiful finger+ head, bright white, lots of micro bubbles bursting through heavenly clouds.... dies down to frothy, sticky lace fingers all over the glass as you finish...
S: Smells like apparently all the hills in Vermont (if HF, Alchemist, etc is anything to go by...) but on a serious note.... wonderfully aromatic, the tropical fruits and florals typical of these hops really are well presented, mango and pineapple sweet sourness, hints of pine, very light citrus and a final bit of perhaps the yeast or alcohol that leaves a bit of a acidic/funky smell...
T: Starts off pretty floral again, then moves into more the citrus, lemon, grapefruit pith bitterness... and then more mango, piney resins...finishes more malty, I'd say more sweet than bitter, and again like the nose, I get a very small hint of a underlying HF yeast/water/ Appalachian magic unicorn funk in there somewhere... oh, and all very balanced in the flavour department.
M: High, natural carbonation.... sparkles on the roof of your mouth but not in an annoying way... in a attacking the extremely dry sticky hypothetical 170 IBUs sort of way that allows this beer to remain fresh and extremely drinkable.... really smooth, balanced, not really any hit of booze, and not really sticky or dry...
O: What can I say? I drove for hours into the Hills of Vermont with 3 other people wondering where the hell I was taking them.... then out of the dark clouds a beam of light lit up a small farm in the lush green Vermont Hills, where a lovely lady brought us cold samples of sweet nectar.... and on a serious note, this is a seriously good beer.... I don't want to say it is less complex than Heady, but I would say it doesn't try so hard to highlight every single hop known to man....and as my gf states "it doesn't make your face feel like its being blasted off with hops)... what it does is take a large amount of hops, balances them extremely well, keeps them in check with natural carbonation, still bursts forward with amazing aromas and adds a little of that special "ingredient" that makes HF worth that never ending drive... a very well made beer that lives up to the hype that the brewers have tried so hard to get away from....

Taste: Floral tones dominate the front, with tropical fruits galore; ruby red grapefruit dominant, with mango and just a touch of apricot adding a different edge; the malt takes a definite back seat as the bitterness builds, in the middle; after the swallow, the dextrose brings to the sugary sweetness to the finish
Mouthfeel: Medium to full bodied with moderate to high carbonation
Overall: The first time I have tried one of the acclaimed IPAs from Hill Farmstead and the hype is for real

Appearance - Slightly hazy amber colour with a large size frothy white coloured head. There is an average amount of carbonation and there is some good lacing. The head lasted for 4-5 minutes.
Smell - Malts, caramel, hops, grapefruit, lemons
Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and the taste is made up of caramel and malts and hops. It also has apricots, lemons, grapefruits, and a bit of a grassiness. I can also pick up on some dry floral/woody notes and some lemon zest. It ends with a dry very hoppy aftertaste.
Overall - Another winner from these guys. Not as good as some of their other beers that I have tried but still a way above average brew. If you like more of a floral/dry (but still with some fruitiness) DIPA, you will love this stuff. 816 charactersspinrsx, May 21, 2013

Finally, my first from what was at the time of this writing regarded as the #1 brewery in the USA.
Look - Hazy amber orange with a a nice soapy head that dissipates slowly and leaves sticky lacing all over.
Smell - Aroma is resiny hearty and juicy hops with smooth malty caramel. Super smooth but there is a hint of the bite that is in store.
Taste - So rich and smooth first comes in those super juicy almost orange or melon hops, then a wave of resin hops with a snappy bite at the end. Woo piney resin hops! Superb!
Mouthfeel - Perfect drinkability, alcohol is hidden completely, and the bitter hop linger fades quite gracefully. It doesn't get better than this. Carbonation is perfect here, the kind of brew that makes you thirsty for more.
Overall - Wow. This is one of the absolute best brews I have ever had. This has no comparison but if there is a lineup and that lineup has Pliny (Snappy crisp west coast), Heady (Floral as hell), and Dubs (Juiciest DIPA you can get), this is the higher quality version of Sixpoint Resin that further enhances what they were trying to do with that brew. A true king among brews. 1,168 charactersJMScowcroft, May 09, 2013

A - Poured cloudy dark orange with one finger of white head. Good spotty lace and a film of retention.
S - Really juicy. Mango, tangerine, pineapple. Lot's of sweet juicy fruits. Really inviting sweet hops. Spent lot's of time on the aroma of this and didn't wanna stop smelling. 
T - Some boozy pineapple and lot's of sweet tropical fruits. Bright hops again. Mango, passionfruit. 
M - Pretty strong bitterness, strong carbonation, medium body. 
O/D - I enjoyed this quite a bit. Tons of hop depth. Really nice to sip and contemplate. Hops really shine well. I can't tell if I could drink a ton of this, but it was definitely a pleasure. 689 charactersbylerteck, May 06, 2013

Imagine you're on a tropical island. The sun is setting, and the edibly humid air has cooled down to just above a little chilly as you navigate on foot through the jungle. You happen upon a field of wild fruit trees and the sweet smell of pineapple, mango, peach, apple, grapefruit, and banana permeate and saturate the early evening air. As you look closer you realize there are wild hop vines that have grown up the tree trunks, and the giant green hop buds, that appear to be everywhere, are glistening with dew. The crisp hop bud funk cuts the ripe fruit in the air in such a way that you feel more refreshed with every breath. You excitedly pluck a huge bud from the nearest peach tree and raise it to your nose with a large expectant inhale. "Oh my God," you think to yourself, smiling like a fool. "This is it. This is the freshest, crispest, ripest, funkiest, most delicious thing I have ever encountered. If only I could bottle this and take it with me..."
Well... fortunately for us, Shaun Hill did it for us, and because I don't know how he did it, I will just assume that he's some kind of wizard.
After years of drinking and evaluating beer, Abner reminds me why I loved beer in the first place. Halfway through the bottle I became angry when I realized that I couldn't have more of it without driving up there, which is easier said than done. Then I put the glass to my face and took another deep breath through my nose and the anger melted into acceptance and appreciation. Abner is an amazingly crafted beverage. I love it. 
My humblest thanks to you, Shaun and everybody at Hill Farmstead. You deserve all of the praise and respect that I can give. 1,729 charactersMrKsBeer, May 01, 2013

Poured into a tulip glass, the appearance is a honey tone with a finger of head. The nose on this DIPA has oranges, hops, sugar, a bit of lemon. Moving on to tipping it back and I taste pineapple, grass, bread malts, a general low-key sweetness. Mouthfeel is medium, near-perfect carbonation level on this. All in all, another very good-great DIPA from Hill Farmstead. 427 charactersmltobin, Apr 13, 2013

Citrusy and floral, pine and a perfect amount of funk. Sweet and bitter, perfect blend.

T~ like the nose, lots of citrus hop bitterness. lots of grapefruit and pine. the hay funk comes in on the end along with a lot of bitterness.
M~ very smooth and dry on the finish.

S -- Piney, citrusy hops. I don't get a lot of fruit or flowers. Also a fairly barnyardy IPA.
T -- Again with the cirtus hops, especially grapefruit, and a piney finish. Not much maltiness to speak of here. The funk present in the nose also comes through here, but is less prominent.
M -- It might be partially the appearance and the thick head, but it also has a fairly full body. However, it is also quite carbonated and does not seem overly heavy. No hint of the alcohol.
O -- It was great to get a chance to try this beer! Delicious and definitely worth grabbing a growler if you get the chance. 698 charactersjealousmonk, Apr 02, 2013

A: Opaque deep yellow/amber body with a pure with head of 2 fingers and good retention and lacing.
S: Packed with juicy fruity goodness, tropical fruits and citrus, floral, grassy, and piney as well.
T: Very flavorful with layers of hope taste following the nose and bitterness throughout. As with the other HF beers I've had, however, a little watery feel to it throughout and on the finish.
M: Medium carbonation, that watery feel is present, dry finish, medium body.
O: Very pleased to have this and well-enjoyed. Not the best DIPA I've ever had, and perhaps not worth an intense journey to get it, but this is a finely crafted DIPA. 713 charactersMCain04, Apr 02, 2013

Pours a brilliant, golden orange, with tons of visible carbonation. Looks like the growler made it back in good condition! Laces down the glass incredibly well.
The smell? Oh my god. My nose just got caressed by orange, grapefruit, pine, pineapple, mango, citrus zest. It's so strong, and so fresh. I don't know what hop varieties went into this beer, but I love them, no matter what.
The tastes follows very similarly to the smell. A lot of lingering hop bitterness stays throughout the session, but is covered in a sticky, dank, citrusy explosion of hop flavor. Alcohol is basically not there. You wouldn't know it's 8.2%ABV.
Lightly, but well carbonated. Medium body. So drinkable.
A true beer epiphany here. Wow. Congrats HF. 838 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 31, 2013

Hops for days hits you in the face and it hurts so good. I think of this as a perfect mix between Lawsons doub sunshine (more tropical) and Heady Topper (more citrus). I found a perfect mix between citrus and tropical fruit, however that hoppyness took the cake. I pick up on some more earthy resinous tastes that I quire enjoy, but not as much as some DIPAs- well ballanced I was fortunate to drink it fresh as hell so the carbonation was on point.

It's not overly bitter, but not even close to sweet. Mouthfeel is outstanding; Full, with real body, perfectly carbonated. Overall, this beer is all about balance.

The beer pours an effervescent, hazy yellow-orange with an inch of a dense, creamy looking white head. A vigorous swirl regenerates the head and washes away the lacing. The nose has a subtle hoppiness that's slightly floral and citrusy followed by a modest sweetness. The taste manages to pack in even more flavor that reminds me of a cleaner, more drinkable heady topper (...which seems insane to say). The beer has an absolute perfect balance between hop fruitiness, bitterness, and sweetness from the malt and added sugars. The aftertaste is slightly citrusy and bitter and finishes semi-dry as a gush of carbonation carries the beer down into the depths of my innards. This beer is certainly world class and worth trying...but I can't see it being bottled for the masses. 832 charactersThePorterSorter, Feb 08, 2013
4.5/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5This poured out as a nice hazy looking yellowish orange color with a big foamy white head on top. The Lacing was sticky and the rentention was very good as well. The smell of the beer has a large amount of floral and fruity hope aromas. The taste has a nice sharp pine flavor in there that is surprisingly balanced with the malt base. The mouthfeel is lighter and very drinkable. The carbonation was good also. Overall it's a great brew. Definitely something I could see drinking again in the future. 500 charactersKnapp85, Feb 07, 2013

This beer has a nice murky orange hue. There is a slight head to the pour and some minimal lacing. The smell is of sweet and bitter citrus. The taste starts off with some swwet hoppiness, think orange and pineapple and finishes up with some bitter lemon zest that lingers nicely. You want to repeat this all day! The carbonation is spot on and this beer is easily drinkable. Happy to have tried this! 487 charactersjimmy82063, Jan 30, 2013

This beer was delicious and definitely on par with the Heady Topper although quite different tasting. The Edward is one of my favorite beers and this tastes almost identical to me only with more body and higher ABV. The aroma was out of this world with lots of pine and citrus. Remarkable smooth and the perfect pairing with the 12 hour smoked brisket and bacon BBQ sauce. 438 charactersLakemonster, Jan 27, 2013

4.2/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had multiples on draft at Frida's in Stowe, VT while enjoying some excellent authentic Mexican.
Appeared a hazy light orange color with a two-finger white head. Left some nice lacing on the glass.
Smell is dominated by pine and grapefuit. Backed by some more citrusy notes - lemon and orange. Not as sweet smelling as I would have anticipated.
Taste starts off with a bitter punch, giving way to the more fruity sweetness in the finish. Very fresh tasting. If you let it sit on your tounge for a few, you can identify some different fruits and a maltiness to it.
Mouthfeel was nice. No heat whatsoever. Carbonation made this relatively strong, rich drink quite refreshing.
Still not quite up there with Heady and Kiwi Rising IMO, but a solid DIPA. Would like a bit more citrus to balance out the IBUs a bit. 812 charactersTWStandley, Dec 24, 2012

HUGE thank you to franklinn, my secret santa in the LNBA SS BIF for sending this!
Pour: Abner is one beautiful DIPA pouring a murky orange yellow straw color with a billowing soft white head of at least 2 to 3 fingers. Light struggles to penetrate but there is an obvious glow behind the glass when held to the light. Head settles slowly and leaves a ridiculous amount of lacing behind. The head is sticking to the glass and simply not moving. Spectacular! 
Smell: Just a wonderful pine hop aroma with citrus (tangerine, orange, grapefruit). Some floral hop and a slight yeast. I am picking out some peach and a touch of grass.
The nose is also spectacular!
Taste: Follows the nose with pine bitterness up front and then the citrus comes through. The orange, pineapple, and grapefruit are integrated perfectly here. I am getting a somewhat sticky sweetness in here too and really liking it!
Mouthfeel: This is simply too drinkable because it is to the point of being dangerous. So smooth and creamy for a DIPA that the alcohol is non detectable. There is bitterness but not over the top so it makes it one hell of a drinkable beer.
Overall: Well to be honest I am in FFF territory and so used to their hop profile that I often told myself they are hard to beat. Well this is right up there if not better than any FFF offering. Heady Topper I had the pleasure of enjoying once and loved that but let me tell you this is just as good, IMO! 1,502 characterssleuthdog, Dec 23, 2012

a - Pours a murky orange-yellow color with one inch of off white head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks pretty good.
s - Nose has that awesome Hill Farmstead hoppy nose to it. Smells of pine hops, oranges, tangerines, citrus hops, grapefruit, yeast, floral hops, some earthy notes. Loads of hops; very nice nose.
t - Tastes of pine hops, resin, citrus hops, grapefruit, floral hops, fruity malts, oranges. At first I didn't find any bitterness at all to it, and the more I drank it I felt a tiny bit of light bitterness, but much less than something like Ephraim. Very nice.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Body has some light bitterness but not much. Very nice.
o - Overall another awesome beer from HF and a great DIPA. Up there with their best beers and on par with something like Ephraim IMO, though I still prefer their Society & Solitude #4 and #5. Super hoppy and not a lot of bitterness, would love to have this one again sometime. 1,181 charactersmdfb79, Dec 17, 2012

Hill Farmstead glassware
A - Abner pours a bright peach-orange hue with a one finger head of white foam that quickly dissipates. Lacing abounds. Like all of Hill Farmstead's beers, this one is unfiltered and opaque.
S - A very nice, tropical, citrus nose, with some papaya, pineapple, and a little bit of peach, nectarine aroma. Very floral.
T - Hop bitterness, Citrus fruits and floral all in perfect balance. Pick up the tropical fruits as well. 
M - Maybe the best mouthfeel out of all the great DIPA's I've ever had. Smooth, creamy, balanced. Leaves your mouth watering which most powerful DIPA's don't. You're usually left with a puckering and dry palate but not here.
O - Heady Topper to me is the greatest IPA of all-time, but this one is right behind and it and in the same ballpark. The hop character even reminds me of Heady. I don't know how Shaun keeps pumping out world class IPA's but he does. If your a fan of IPA's this is a must try. Craftsmanship at it's best. 1,026 charactersSkiBum22, Dec 10, 2012

S: An explosion of aromas. I could smell this beer from a few feet away after popping open the growler. Tart, citrusy hop oils cling to your nostrils. It's crazy. Few have smelled better. Just a tiny booze presence but it lends a sugary and sweet quality when you dig your nose deep.
T: What can I say that hasn't been said already and as displayed in the average score. Absolutely outstanding. The hops obviously steal the show but there is plenty of malt and some booze to balance it out and make this a discernible Double IPA. 
M: Like chewing on fresh hop cones and citrus rinds. So damn hoppy. Perfectly carbonated, perfectly bitter and dry, and perfectly boozy to complement the intense hop presence. I can't get over how smooth yet properly carbonated this and Edward are. Boggles the mind. And soooo easy to drink!
O: It's such a pleasure to drink this beer. Very happy that I have 2L's. This review is based on my third pint glass over the span of a week since receiving the growler on Thanksgiving and being filled the day before Thanksgiving. Hasn't lost much since being poured fresh.

The aroma is loaded with grapefruit citrus, tropical fruit and pine. Very hoppy.
Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is chewy and creamy with moderate carbonation. The flavor is loaded with grapefruit citrus, lemon rind, mango and pine. Towards the end some sweet caramel malt appears. It finishes dry and moderately bitter. Once gone the grapefruit citrus and pine lingers on the palate.
This is a full flavored DIPA. The review is from a growler that was filled 24 hours ago. A terrific beer that's easy to drink. 684 charactersWanderingFool, Nov 10, 2012

A - Pours a hazy dark orange/yellow body very reminiscent of grapefruit juice. Thick two finger white head with loads of sticky lacing and retention. Looks perfect.
S - Grapefruit, mangos and peaches, a touch of crackery malt and pine. Juicy and fresh. Very complex and pleasing.
T - Bitter grapefruit initially leads into sweet peaches and some dry crackery malt. Finish is a bit piney with lasting bitterness. Very tasty.
M - Medium bodied with silky carbonation. Drinkability is high for such a high IBU beer.
O - A wonderful DIPA. However, having this next to the Society & Solitude 5 it loses by a bit. Still an amazing beer that I would say is quite close to Heady Topper. VT just does IPA's right! 783 charactersdavey101, Nov 04, 2012

A- Pours a slightly hazy orange with a one finger head that dissipates quickly leaving minimal lacing. 
S- Pungent, fresh citrus and tropical fruits with notes of white grapefruit, lemon rind, blood orange, pineapple and mango followed by some floral hops, caramel malt and pine needles.
T- Follows the nose with plenty of juicy fresh fruit with grapefruit, lemon rind, pineapple, mango as well as floral hops, pine needles and caramel malt. 
M- Light carbonation with a creamy mouthfeel.
O- Just another superb IPA from Hill Farmstead. Dangerously drinkable and well balanced, Hill Farmstead is setting the standard for a world class IPA. 718 charactersiadler, Oct 27, 2012

The beer pours a really hazy copper color, hints of orange and amber, almost like an orange rind when looking at it. Cloudy texture, bits of sediment floating in there with a nice thick white head rests on top of the glass, great retention, lovely thick layer of film appears when the head recedes, fantastic lacing and the head is easily resummoned with a quick flick of the glass. The aroma is incredible, huge citrus notes, orange rind, grapefruit with a touch of lemon zest. There is a great floral aspect, like sticking your nose into a lovely meadow of wildflowers and great pine elements than plays into some earthier undertones, but the vibrant bright citrus really takes this beer to a new level. Light malt presence, some sweetness from the caramel malt, a hint of biscuit from the pale malt as well, but this is a celebration of hops. The flavors are wonderful, tons of citrus right away, grapefruit, light orange zest, lemongrass, floral flavors come out really well behind the lemongrass and highlight the citrus element so well. The earthiness is not far behind and is a great counterbalance to the bright citrus and floral notes, nice piney hops, earthier malt leads to a touch of alcohol at the finish, but this is easily one of the most balanced and perfectly balanced IPAs I've ever had the pleasure of tasting. The body is perfection as well, smooth, dry, dank, bitter, coats the mouth well, goes down so easily and really amplifies all the great qualities of this beer.
Verdict: Sensational, another absolute knockout from Hill Farmstead. This is refined, balanced, artfully crafted and absurdly enjoyable, it's what every IPA should strive to be. 1,741 characterskevanb, Oct 26, 2012

4.88/5  rDev +6.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750ml growler thanks to ILOVESTOUTS, poured into a Hill Farmstead stem.
Pour: Perfect hazy orange with two fingers of nice puffy, off white head. Head recedes to a thic film, and leaves really nice sticky lacing. This beer looks perfect.
Smell: A burst of mango, grapefruit, and pineapple. A little bit of resinous pine reminds you of the hop monster this beer is, in a great way. A light touch of caramel honey malt.
Taste: Really follows the nose perfectly, with mango and grapefruit overwhelmingly controlling the palate. Some pine, and a light caramel sweetness, but really not much to speak of. Citrus lingers wonderfully. Flawless.
Mouthfeel: This beer is so dangerously drinkable. The taste is so good, you forget the ABV completely. Bitterness is fantastic, but does not linger with the citrus.
Overall: Amazing. Thank god this beer is always being made, because it is that good. 892 characterscfrances33, Oct 24, 2012

Growler to HF Stem
750ml
Thanks to RudZud for sending this my way.
App- A very peachy looking orangey haze. A very dense centered DIPA with a very large two finger white head. A very puffy and whipped cream looking head. A big amount of cling and lace down the sides of the glass
Smell- Its a very hoppy and aromatic beer A bit of a nice mix. It's creamy and a bit honey forward. A bit of a sweet cream aroma. A bit of a full citrus. More along the lines of Pineapple & Mango.
Taste- A fuller DIPA. More like the nose and retains a large creamy and dense flavor. A bit thicker than S&S and a bit more bitter vs. bright. The aroma flavors carry over to the flavor with the citrus. Pineapple & Mango. A bit hoppier and a good balance.
Mouth- A large medium body with a deep medium carbonation. A big creamy hops with dank and deep citrus hops on the residual flavors. Zest and mangos on the finish.
Drink- I will say this one is better than Ephraim. More deep citrus flavors and a bit more creamy hops. Really a bit in the middle of the other DIPAs from HF. I would say others should rang higher. 1,120 charactersFosterJM, Oct 22, 2012

Pours a pale orange colour with a finger of fluffy white head leaving only a slight smackling of lacy bubbles. There's a tinge of cat piss in the aroma, citrus and tropical fruits and some pine notes. Fairly intense bitterness, citrus and pine resins, and flowers. Crisp, medium body clean finish.

Growler pops & fizzes appropriately, & the pour is heady over a furrowed yellow brow. The nose, holy hand grenades, is just grand. LIke a Jamaican fruit salad, it actually immediately took me back to sipping banana dacquiris right off the beach, where the bartender was pulling bananas off the canopy of the bar. Plus one for sparking a good, ancient memory! 
Abner should have a Caribbean toothpick umbrella in it. Ripe fruits burst their skin at the slightest touch: papaya, pineapple, orange, citrus, banana, tangerine. Moderate bitterness stings in the middle to keep the fruitcopia from becoming to sweet or cloying. Oily presence that's so welcome in top-notch IPA/IIPAs. I can't keep my hands off the glass, or my face, & I'm wishing for another 750ML to magically appear. &lt;nod&gt; &lt;nod&gt; &lt;nod&gt;. Nope. 
I'm trying to use my words. This is bloody good. Bitter & fruity mixed with the touch of a master DJ. Excellent beer that would hold its head high among the best IPAs in the world. Thanks again, Mike. 1,194 charactersmaximum12, Oct 11, 2012

A- Abner pours a hazy gold body with fair head of foam that slowly retreats. Very sticky with great lacing clinging to the edges of the glass
S- fresh pine scents and citric aromas burst from the glass with a complete blast of tropical tones. Very fresh and dank with the hop flavors. This is the explosive scent profile I look for in a DIPA
T- Thick blast of tropical citric flavors that are meshed with grapefruit, starfruit, and pineapples. There is a sugary malt type flavor that provides some sweetness and really compliments to aforementioned hop explosion. Abner completely exhibits flavors of a hoppy citric DIPA that so many hop heads look for
M- Smooth carbonation as the citric flavors clasp at the mouth leaving the desired sticky feeling. Very good feel from all that flavor
O- absolutely fantastic DIPA from Hill Farmatead. Shaun makes no secret about his affinity to citric hop bombs. Abner completely represents just that. One of the best DIPA's out there. Try to stop by prohibition pig if you are in Waterbury so you can give this a try 1,168 characterslovindahops, Sep 23, 2012

Very hazy amber colored with an off white medium sized head. Aroma is big on weed/pine and would have been a 5/5 had it not been the hint of spicy hop character I'm getting. Tastes hoppy and bitter (duh) with a solid malt base and but drinks very easy. Some onion/garlic comes as a turn off. Smooth feel, slightly sweet taste and finish, medium carbonation. Very good and signature HF.

Pours a beautiful golden honey color with specs of unfiltered goodness suspended throughout my beer. 
The aroma is amazingly dank. Pine sap, fresh hop pellets, citrus zest. Extremely enticing and inviting.
The taste follows the nose. An absolute hop bomb in the best way possible. Dank and resinous with a citrus finish. Perfection in a growler.
Medium in body with the perfect amount of carbonation. Easy to drink, hides the ABV well and finishes sticky and wet.
Overall, this is an amazing DIPA. It excells in every category. I love the fact that it is unfiltered and this good looking. Worth finding a trading partner to get you some. I highly recommend it. 706 charactersdcloeren, Sep 21, 2012

A - Pours a very well hazed pale golden color - thick and fruit juicy looking. Three fingers of fluffy white head rises off the surface with a semi-aggressive pour into the middle of the glass. Beautiful looking DIPA!
S - From over a foot away from the glass, all I can smell is hops. Super fresh smelling, freshly peeled and cut grapefruit, mildly sweet, a touch of sweatiness, extremely faint (but definitely there) grainy and sugary malt base. Outstanding!
T - Thick citrusy and tropical up front...tons of fresh grapefruit, lots of pineapple, hints of pine/resiny and a little bit of apricots. Sharply bitter...gives a lasting impression on the tongue - the hints of sugary malt try to tame it a bit, thankfully without much success...but just enough to sooth it out a touch. I've had one of the first pints of Pliny off a fresh bright tank at the RR pub...even that didn't taste as fresh or hop forward as this. Again, outstanding!
M - A bit on thin side...definitely not watery but lacking a bit in body. Carbonation is smooth, just a touch tingly and just shy of medium. Well attenuated fermentation that leaves the beer fairly dry overall leaving only traces of sweetness behind. Mouth filling bitterness and a tropical fruity/citrusy explosion. Really good.
O - Overall, this has to be in my top 5 best DIPA's - right there with PtY, Double Sunshine, Heady Topper for me. Really great...I've had this on tap before and remember it being a really great beer, but I had forgotten how great...fresh growler from the source makes this really amazing. Definitely get this if you can and drink it fresh. 1,780 charactersportia99, Sep 15, 2012

Served with a 1 finger fluffy white head with very good retention. Beer is cloudy, dull yellow. Stringy lace that really sticks around. Clarity hurts a bit but this is still a great looking beer.
Nose is citrus, pine, tree sap, papaya. Very pulpy and aromatic. Real dank hoppiness resides in this one. Par for the course for Hill Farmstead beers... that is, amazing!
Bitter pine, tropical fruit, dank hop bitterness and pulp. Nice malt body lingers in the back with a sappy finish. Pine hop bitter aftertaste. Great complexity and balance here. 
Light to medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation. Prickly in the mouth and smooth and quenching going down. Messy finish with a lingering aftertaste. Can't believe this is 8.2%. Drinks like its 5% or lower. 
Shaun Hill may be the king of hoppy beers and he proves it yet again with this creation. An amazing beer worth moving high and hell water to try! 998 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 03, 2012

4.6/5  rDev +0.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I purchased a 750mL growler of Hill Farmstead Abner Imperial IPA at the Hill Farmstead Brewery in early August and brought it back to Massachusetts, where it was consumed in quick fashion. Served in my St. Bernardus chalice. Review is from notes. 
Appearance (5/5): Abner is gorgeous: it pours a bright peach-orange hue with a one finger head of white foam that quickly dissipates. Lacing abounds. Like all of Hill Farmstead's beers, this one is unfiltered and opaque. The peach hue to this beer is very cool, and I'd say a little mouth-watering! A beauteous example of a lighter-colored IPA. 
Smell (5/5): Abner is big on the citrus and tropical fruit notes: passion fruit, pineapple, melon, pine, grapefruit, orange. Mmmmm. A little honey sweetness can be detected in there from the malt, too. Beautiful aromas!
Taste (4.5/5): Abner delivers tons of hop flavor: it has piney, sweet fruit, and bitter grapefruit rind flavors. This complexity comes out during the ride over the tongue and down the hatch, combining to make one glorious hop explosion. While certainly fairly bitter, this bitterness is not over-the-top astringent and is balanced with some (token) malt sweetness. A slight alcohol heat adds to the flavor constructively, although a little more noticeably than in Hill Farmstead Society and Solitude #4. 
Mouthfeel (4/5): Medium-low carbonation (think this has lost a tad of its original carb. since being in the growler for a couple days). It is lightly prickly, medium-bodied, and quite smooth. Slightly creamy. The mouthfeel does everything right, though isn't out of this world.
Overall (4.5/5): Abner is a stellar example of an imperial IPA, one that is eye-catching and incredibly fruity–a Hill Farmstead trademark. Highly, highly recommended to those that favor Double/Imperial IPAs that treat hop flavor as a greater virtue than outright "bigness." 1,877 charactershagbergl, Aug 31, 2012

Really nice floral hop flavours, followed by a bitter booze hop. Some nice malt balance but the booze is really obvious, in a good way. This is a really in your face/melt your face kind of DIPA...really great all around and definitely one to have when you are staying put for a while...

4.25/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured on tap at the brewery into a Hill Farmstead wine taster glass.
Pale amber body, light lemon hues and classic creamy white head, perhaps some faint peach and orange colors as well.
Nose is a real nice mix of peach fruit, and mild melon like hop aromas. Very subtle but also quite nice too.
Lots of carbonation on the palate with mild toasty grains that seem to follow on the finish. Peach like fruit takes some nice dominance but leaves some crispness and gaseous like feeling.
Overall pretty decent but a real subtle take on a double IPA. 549 characterssmakawhat, Aug 24, 2012

A: Nice pop when I opened the growler. The beer pours a hazy orange with a 1.5 inch fluffy white head on top. Decent retention eventually leaving a very small white cap on top. Thin lacing forms all over the glass in random patterns. 
S: A very nice, tropical/citrus nose, with some papaya, pineapple, and a little bit of peach/nectarine aroma. A slight flowery and pine aroma starts to emerge as it warms. 
T: More tropical fruit on the flavor profile, hits you right away and it fantastic. More of the same fruit from the aroma, pineapple, papaya, peach, and a little bit of mango. There is some citrus rind mixed in. Slight hint of pale malts, but they are very much in the background as the citrus fruits are center stage. 
M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, extremely easy drinking. Slight bitterness, but very smooth and well balanced. No sign of the ABV whatsoever. 
O: Fantastic, certainly lives up to its reputation. Extremely easy drinking and well balanced. A beer that I could drink at any time. 1,050 charactersmdaschaf, Aug 23, 2012

Pours dark straw with a big fluffy white head. Excellent lacing and retention.
Aroma is a hop explosion. Loads of citrus, some dank pine with just a little bit of malt creeping into the picture.
Lots of rich citrus flavors up front along with a little tropical fruit. Just a touch of malt in the middle. Finishes floral and dry with some grapefruit. Just a touch of sweetness, but more than balanced out by the hops.
Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Really doesn't finish nearly as bitter as most DIPA's as most of the hops are concentrated in the flavor which is why I feel HF makes some of the best IPA's. Also no sign of alcohol.
Broken record in my HF reviews, but this beer is phenomenal. Every IPA I've ever had has been liquid gold and this right up there among my favorites. 829 charactersjmarsh123, Aug 18, 2012

3.88/5  rDev -15.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks go to Jonathan for picking these up from the source less than a week ago and sharing with me. Growler into a snifter, the brew appears a clouded golden orange color. A rich silky froth of off-white to yellowish stained head sits atop with decent powers of retention. As the cap fades, it leaves a webbing pattern of lace sticking all over the glass. A light swirl effortlessly revives the cap back to just shy of a finger's strength.
The aroma is herbal and grassy with a mild spicy to earthy yeast ester and a mild touch of solvent alcohol. There is a bit of some sulfur going on in this along with some cheesy grain and wheat aspects. At times, there is a touch of fruit and citrus hops that nearly get floral as well. As the brew warms up, it gets progressively more intense with the alcohol inclusion.
The taste has a slight amount of residual sugar that is faintly reminiscent of caramel. The sweetness is short-lived before a blast of herbal bitterness that is quite pulpy, resinous and bordering on pine-like. There is some catty elements to this similar to simcoe that mix with cheese flavoring that then gets dissolved by some solvent alcohol. The aftertaste while bitter and herbal includes a bit of straw flavoring just like the rest of the HF hoppy offerings I have tried.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is somewhat crisp but bold and aggressive with the bitterness. The alcohol is noticeable in this one but it integrates quite nicely. Of the hoppy HF offerings I have had lately, I give this one a slight edge over the others for having a bit more distinguishable character. But overall, the hoppy offerings from this brewery are so similar that I have no desire to seek them out anymore. 1,750 charactersstakem, Aug 10, 2012
4.54/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From the source, 1 week old. Looks like other Hill hoppy beers I've had. Opaque, sort of orangeish deep honey. One finger white head. Not much if any lacing. The aroma is so complex. Pine, citrus, dank wet hops, almost earthy dirty grit. Very green hop aroma. Pretty insanely complex flavour to match the complex aroma. Citrusy, pithy, and well yes bitter. Abner is a little dank. The biggening is all hops, then you get some malty quality. There is certainly a little crystal malt in here adding a hint of sweetness to balance the hop assault. On my palate this beer is full, juicy from the hops, and well rather good. Could be a hint more dry. Overall this is a tad sweet for me, but that is the only thing I could possible say to take away from how awesome this beer is. Balance, huge hops, great balance, top notch. 819 characterspmlondrigan, Aug 09, 2012

Appearance: Free pour yields a 2 inch fluffy white head that takes its time to dissipate. Pours a glowing, opaque orange. Leaves a few arches of lacing now and then.
Smell: Dank oniony hop pungency at first (from the Chinook or Columbus I would guess), with a pine backdrop and a hint of citrus. Pale malt creeps up and somehow stands with the bold, aromatic hops. 
With time and warmth, tons of citrus comes out in the aroma, overwhelming the dank elements and the malt. Eventually manifests as a citrus hop bomb with piny undertones. Beautiful throughout.
Taste: Tons of succulent hop flavor up front, predominantly tropical fruit flavors (mango, mystery tropical fruits), with some alcohol heat and pale malt through the middle, with a long citrusy aftertaste. Not fermented as clean as some of their lower ABV pale ales, with a boozy, yeasty sweetness present as in Dogfish Head's DIPAs. High hop bitterness keeps that from being cloying or clashing with all the great-but-disparate hop flavors.
As with the aroma, the taste is just a cornucopia of beautiful hops. Some notably (to me) absent tangerine-y/melon-y flavors (noticed them in every other Hill Farmstead pale ale I've tried) eventually come out, particularly in the finish. Beginning of each sip is always succulent, with a few distinct, usually fruity or occasionally citrusy hop flavors. Great cereal grain flavor that's common in top end APAs but rare in any DIPAs comes up now and then, which both impresses and delights me (as does the hop extravaganza, which is the main story of this beer).
Mouthfeel: A touch on the full side of medium bodied. Creamy feel, with a lot of alcohol heat and bitterness. Pretty dry finish, which goes great with that citrusy aftertaste.
Overall: Excellent DIPA, worthy of being in Heady Topper, Pliny the Elder, Double Sunshine conversations. This beer has a lot to suggest it, but at the moment what's striking me is how much it rises to the challenge of justifying such a high ABV. Few beers match the ABV intensity increase (in comparison to APAs / IPAs) so well with hop intensity increases, or appropriate mouthfeel. Geniusly crafted beer, as expected from Hill Farmstead. 2,285 charactersPahn, Aug 02, 2012

S- Big citrus and tropical fruit characters are right up front lemon zest and grapefruit with a nice mix of mango and pineapple. Beautiful floral notes are also present. Crisp, clean aroma.
T- Hop bitterness, Citrus fruits and floral all in perfect balance. Pick up the tropical fruits as well, with some pale malt. Absolute craftsmanship, great tasting beer. Makes you want a second sip before the first is even finished.
O- I have had this beer many times but never reviewed it. Thought I owed Abner and Shaun another big score on the board. This beer is well planned, perfectly crafted and is just what I looking for. Crisp clean amazing beer. I may be a Hill Farmstead homer but even the Negative Nancies cant knock Shaun Hills ability to again an again make some of the best beers on the planet. 918 charactersHopsHopenstein, Aug 01, 2012

Wonderfully aromatic with a big whiff of citrusy hop goodness right up front. Tropical and floral with little room left for malt aromas to come through. 
First sip brings any hop-lover into an instant state of bliss. Grapefruit and a hint of pineapple comes come foreword first before the resiny pine character packs its punch. Pleasantly bitter in the finish but well-rounded enough to keep your palate in line. 
Mouthfeel is medium-heavy and smooth with a slightly drying finish. Overall, Abner is an exceptional DIPA that deserves to be right up there with the best of them. Very reminiscent of Heady Topper, with just a bit more bitterness and not quite as fruity. 751 charactersKinsman, Jul 29, 2012

A: Pours an unfiltered copper body that glows a burnt orange against the setting sun. I normally love clear IPAs, and I mark down the unfiltered ones for a reason. But, for reasons that will become clear as you read on, I had to make an exception here. 
S: Peaches, mango, pineapple -- this is a tropical citrus smorgasbord. Having eaten nonstop tropical fruit since I arrived on this island, this beer is a liquid reminder of the excellence of my surroundings. It has a restrained pale malt nose that imparts only the lightest sweetness. 
T: Tropical citrus: mango, peach, pineapple, and the rind of orange and lemon and grapefruit. The "rind" is mentioned because there is a mild bitterness found here; it is sticky and lingering, but not overpowering or palate-wrecking. The pale malt imparts enough sweetness to give the beer heft without making it seem thin and insubstantial. This is the oxymoronic "balance" that people speak of in DIPAs. 
M: Great hoppy flavor with modest bitterness, yet a clean finish. I find myself struggling to find a flaw here. There is none. The beer hides it ABV smoothly, it carries no extra sweetness, and it doesn't ruin the palate with excessive bitterness. This is clean to a fault. 
O: I would be inclined to say I'm being generous toward this beer given the particular setting, but I also consumed a growler of HF Citra IPA, from the same box, prior to this trip, in my drab apartment. I found that one amazing, as well. I review harshly, but there's simply nothing to criticize here. This is an affordable, exceptionally well-crafted beer. It is hard to acquire in trade for a reason. I'm sorry to contribute to the hype, but this is world-class. I hope I get to drink a 2L of this in the future. 1,823 charactersArbitrator, Jul 02, 2012

Foggy medium orange with a thin egg white cover and some pleasant stick.
Smells of creamy peachy mango surprise. A white pepperyness lingers as well. 
Taste follows suit with a big bright citric presence and a dank herbal middle that finishes with a dry cutting bitterness. Fruits pop lively along the palate. Papaya comes to mind as well. Slightly oily, the hops glide along the entire sip, tap dancing all over my tasting places. 
Mouthfeel is like pureed fruit smoothie; this just slides along the tongue.
An interesting beer: for the first half of the bottle I wasn't all that impressed and didn't feel there was much cohesion. Towards the second half, however, the fruit smoothie aspects really began to present themselves. The presentation of these growlers makes the experience somehow feel unique and enjoyable. 
As always, thanks for the opportunity to drink a want and for allowing me the chance to try this. 1,056 charactersBarrytheBear, Jun 25, 2012

Served into a tulip
A: Fairly hazy golden sunset orange body with a big fluffy, creamy off-white head. Huge amounts of lacing coat the walls along with a nice retention cap all the way down.
S: Huge juicy tropical and citrus fruits. Orange, mango, peach, melon and lemon all come through. There's a bitter grassy aroma too, reminding you this is still an DIPA.
T: A bitterness blends instantly with the citrus notes, they aren't separated but work incredibly well together. More mango and peach are up front with some of the zestier citrus fruits coming in towards the mid and back palate like the orange and lemon. Grassy hop notes stick throughout and the linger ends clean with a crisp malt.
M: Creamy, smooth and almost silky. I absolutely love when my IPAs have this mouth feel. A touch sticky around the palate but the finish is so damn clean.
Truly, perhaps my favorite DIPA I've tried to date (I need to try this and Citra side by side!). Everything about this beer is remarkable. Perfect? I'm not sure if I buy into that notion in a beer, but this is damn close. 1,091 charactersShanePB, Jun 20, 2012

Great looking pour: hazy & orange, bountiful head, plenty of sticky lace. Stubborn retention on both; gorgeous! Floral, juicy, hoppy, citrusy aroma. Smells fantastic!
Plenty of malt leads the way, fresh hops aren't far behind. Very juicy and sublime from all angles. Sweetness is there, but gives way to mild piney-ness, malt, and the hoppy backbone before finishing. Creamy body approaches perfection.
Abner ranks among the best IPAs -- nay, *beers* -- I've ever tasted. Seriously, this stuff is incredible. Wish I could drink it every day :( 584 charactersbrystmar, Jun 14, 2012

Poured a hazy golden-orange color with a nice finger's breadth of white head that retained well and left soapy lacing on the glass. Aroma is a nice mix of citrus, pine, and tropical fruits. Similarly, the taste is expectedly hop-driven, fresh citrus zest, mango, pine resin, overlaid on a biscuity malt base, some burnt caramel present, mild alcohol bites here and there. Medium body, and quite enjoyable for any hophead. Still, among my least favorite from HF. 503 charactersRifugium, Jun 11, 2012

Score: 93
Three week old growler served in a Half Acre tulip and enjoyed on 04/09/12. Review is from notes.
Appearance: Pours a hazy golden-orange color with floaters. Pretty much opaque. One to two fingers of creamy cream-colored head at pour almost entirely settles -- save for the thin bubbly ring around the glass. Average laving, but awesome retention. 4/5
Smell: Bright, sticky tropical fruit citrus. Pineapple, peach, grapefruit and juicy orange. Lemonade and piney hops too. 4/5
Taste: Bitter citrus, lemon and pine. Grapefruit, spicy caramel, a touch of onion and pineapple juice. Layering prickly bitterness on the tongue. You can tell greatness was once here, but it has faded to mere "really really good"-ness. 4.25/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, medium-light carbonation. Heavy bitterness on the palate. Buttery/oily mouthfeel. Bitter finish. 4.5/5
Overall: I really regret letting this one sit around for three weeks (even though it was elegantly taped up and stuck in the fridge the whole time), but sometimes you just do not have time to get around to certain beers while they are freshest. This is one I am absolutely going to seek out again in the future because, despite the fact you can tell that it had fallen off from being something better, it was still delicious.
Recommendation: Fans of IPA's should seek this one out and drink it fresh. This is probably not the best starter craft beer for the casual drinker, however.
Pairings: Spicy/hot buffalo wings.
Cost: $10 for a 750 ml growler or $18 for a 2 liter growler (plus the deposit). 1,618 charactersjegross2, Jun 04, 2012

A- Pours a hazy opaque light yellowish orange, about a finger of white head that quickly dissipates and leaves some spotty layered lacing, about average carbonation.
S- Very fruity citrus hops that have a very strong aroma. Smells of grapefruit, mangos, papaya, citra hops, lemons, and other tropical fruits. Aroma is right up there with some of the best DIPAs.
T- Lots of sweet citrusy hops, strong taste of grapefruit, mango, and other tropical and slightly citrusy fruits. A tiny bit bitter on the finish, but nothing that impedes the taste.
M- Medium bodied, average carbonation- perfect amount in my opinion, goes down incredibly easy, extremely smooth and well balanced, abv almost impossible to detect.
O- Another fantastic DIPA out of Vermont. Definitely one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, I'd drink this over just about any other DIPA including some of those other VT ones. Everything blends perfectly with nice fruity hop characteristics and insanely easy to drink. I'll definitely be drinking this again in the future. Have to have this fresh.

4.45/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the Farmhouse in Burlington, enjoyed back to back with Lawson’s Double Sunshine. Geez there are some phenomenal hoppy beers coming out of Vermont these days. While I may have preferred the Lawson’s by a small margin, this is as good as the style gets; it’s simply a matter of hop profile and overall taste you prefer or are in the mood for at any particular moment. It would be hard to say Pliny or Heady Topper or Abrasive are better; just a bit different.
Abner pours a glowing hazy orange color with a two finger white head that settles slowly. Nice lacing remains and the overall look is quite appealing (and appetizing). Vividly hoppy aroma, led by general citrus and more specifically, orange and lemon (to a lesser degree). Some piney notes emerge late and little in the way of malt is detected.
The flavor is very well balanced and by that I don’t mean between hops and malt, because the latter is very much restrained in the west coast style and just barely makes an appearance as a bit of sugared sweetness underneath. I instead meant that the hop subtleties and bitterness are each evident while the booze isn’t at all. There’s good bitterness, particularly in the finish, which is fairly dry, but it isn’t so assertive that it outshines all that citrus fruit, floral and pine notes, and spicy, peppery highlights. I get a lot of orange, grapefruit, mango, and lemon. It drinks incredibly easily and feels much lighter than the ABV and style generally does.
Medium bodied, perhaps a little on the light side for an imperial IPA, with moderate carbonation and a smooth mouthfeel. Exceptionally well done. 1,641 characterstobelerone, Jun 01, 2012

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewed from notes - on-tap at the Three Penny Taproom in Montpelier in late February. 
Beer pours a beautiful hazy yellow-orange with a nice white head. The appearance makes me think of citrus fruit for some reason, and really is the perfect color for a DIPA. Smell is incredible - I get a blast of citrus fruits and amazing hops. The taste follows suit, it's really like a party in my mouth, bright citrus flavors take the lead, but this is incredibly balanced and easy to drink for a DIPA. Mouthfeel is pretty much perfect, medium-bodied with excellent carbonation a bit of tingling and even some stickiness. Overall, this really might be my favorite beer ever. I've had it countless times, but drinking it on tap is the way that this beer needs to be consumed. Some of the growlers have held up really well, others not so much, but it would only get this score from me on tap. When served straight from this tap, this beer deserves a perfect 5.0 score, the best score I've ever given to a beer on BA. 1,006 charactersstarrdogg, Apr 25, 2012

Filled Sat. Feb. 18th, reviewed 6 days later. 8.2% ABV.
Huge thanks to Rochefort10NH for sending this great beer, and many others, my way!
A - From the sexy screen-printed swing-top growler pours this fully hazed dirty apricot golden beer. It's topped by a dense but somewhat fleeting ivory head that decorates the tulip in tiny dots of lace.
S - The searing hop aroma is ruthlessly abounding in bitter, tooth enamel-stripping resin. Voluptuous, exotic fruits that conjure up thoughts of oozingly juicy mango, pineapple, and sharp grapefruit blend with sticky pine sap and heavy maltiness. Balancing without flaw is light toasted biscuit with abundantly sweet pils malt and a touch of caramel. This one's sure to be a tongue bruiser.
T - Hop-heavy, this beefy DIPA is loaded with plenty of citrus characteristics that merge well with pine bite but, as I was afraid of, the extreme hop use departs the aroma in an unfulfilling way. White still very good, there's almost too much here; too bitter resiny, a little over-the-top. The fruity complexity doesn't follow through although the well-balanced malt characteristics do!
M - Medium-fill-bodied, the level of carbonation is right where it should be as it tickles the tongue nicely. Despite it's high resin and bitterness levels, Abner still balances well with a little alcohol heat. A touch of dryness on the finish subtly begs for another sip. Soft wheat also seems to play a small role with the delicate mouthfeel.
O - Hill Farmstead is quickly growing to be one of the best small breweries out there and when they release bold, flavorful, and well-balanced beers like Abner, there's not question as to why. An excellent Double IPA, Abner seamlessly features of plethora of hops for a joyous outcome. 1,812 charactersBeerFMAndy, Apr 01, 2012

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed from a growler picked up at the brewery last Saturday. I've had Abner a few times, but this week it really stood out as one of my all time favorite DIPA's.
The appearance is a cloudy/hazy orange, apricot, straw color with a nice 1.5 finger head that fades to a thin coating. Beautiful color.
The nose is extremely fresh. you get this farm fresh splash of apricot, peach, grapefruit,mango and maybe apple even? In addition to the fruit, you get some nice pine notes balanced by an elegant floral presence. Extraordinary and world class. 
The flavor profile is amazing. bright and fresh fruit hops with less of the piney/resinous notes. Not the most bitter DIPA but extremely well balanced for the style. The carbonation is nearly perfect. medium carbonation in the beginning but yet so smooth and creamy towards the finish producing a tremendous overall mouthfeel. You get a hint of biscuit malt towards the finish but ever so slight and you can barely notice the 8% abv. The finish is slightly dry yet lingering. Not as dry as Hill Farmstead's Society & Solitude #3. 
Overall certainly one of my favorite DIPA's. World Class. Each sip left me in great anticipation of the next. Scary drinkable. Probably my favorite from Hill Farmstead to date. Thank you Shaun Hill. 1,278 charactersdurrrr, Mar 31, 2012

4.58/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Straight pour from 2L growler to Hill Farmstead large glassware (the oversized wine glass). No dating obviously, but that’s just fine—bought it at the brewery this past Wednesday, so three days ago. 
Appearance (5.0): Beautiful. Three finger of just off-white head, thick and tight, and fades very, very slowly. Heavy lacing all around the glass. The body is an opaque, bright orange, cloudy as hell—exactly the way I like my DIPAs. 
Smell (4.5): A strong dank note comes along first, weedy and resiny, mixed with great, sweet citrus notes—pineapple and mango. No malt or alcohol in the nose, which is just fine for the style. 
Taste (4.5): A pungent red grapefruit flavor mixed with a good pineneedliness dominates, sitting atop a biscuity, bready, cracker kind of character. This is very well balanced. There’s a little bit of alcohol heat that blends well with the hop bitterness—exactly what a DIPA should do, in my mind. The finish is long, piney and grassy, but never harsh. That’s what’s so good about this, nothing is harsh about it—just very well balanced. 
Mouthfeel (5.0): Moderate carbonation, slightly tingly on the tongue, foams well in the mouth and BEST of all, there’s just a little bit of head that still feels a bit chunky passing your lips. Body is just on the full side of medium, but not heavy in any way. Spicy, slightly tingly carb all over the mouth—really a perfect mouthfeel. 
Overall (4.5): This is a wonderful beer. It doesn’t have quite the lightning-flash bitterness that Heady Topper does, and it could stand to show a little more cereal complexity in the malt profile, but this does exactly what you want and hope it would do. It gets even better as it warms, which is just wonderful for the style, too. This is an exceptional DIPA. 1,794 charactersfmccormi, Mar 17, 2012
4.88/5  rDev +6.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Beer purchased from brewery just 2 days earlier. 
Poured into a tulip. 
Opaque rusty-orange in appearance. A 1-finger white head fades to a cap that sticks around for the whole session. Nce lacing. 
Aroma of big tropical notes (most notably pineapple and orange) outline a hoppy, dank funk. The malt profile in the center of it all is modest with notes of honey. 
The taste provides tropical sweetness and slight tartness up front. Then honey-sweet malt prevail with earthy, yeasty chewiness. 
Mouthfeel is almost creamy. 
Overall this is tremendously enjoyable and I was eager to take each sip. I wish I could regularly get my hands on this. One of the most unique DIPAs I've had. 687 charactersjbertsch, Mar 17, 2012

Thanks for pouring me this, HopHead84!
Slightly hazed, glowing apricot/orange color with a moderately sized off-white head that leaves great stick all the way down the glass.
The aroma is terrific and I knew this was a very special DIPA on first whiff. The aroma is a combination of pungent citrus flesh, tropical fruit, and floral notes. The combination is lovely.
The flavor too is wonderful. The tropical fruit, citrus notes, and floral elements combine together magnificently well. The bitterness is only moderate, which makes this beer remarkably drinkable.
Medium bodied with moderate to lower carbonation. Amazingly drinkable.

Pours a hazy light orange with an off-white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is absolutely incredible with huge tropical fruit, citrus fruit, and citrus zest aromas in perfect harmony. Taste is pretty much the same with all of the delicious fruity flavors. There is a mild bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly flat mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good fruit forward beer that I am very happy I got a taste of. 663 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 05, 2012

A: Pours a solid apricot color with a chilled haze. A thick one finger, pure white head forms on the pour. It recedes quickly into a thick collar that leaves a huge netting of lace. 
S: This smells wonderful. Fruity and grassy hops first come into play. Nice tropical fruit smells with pineapple and mango, some mild citrus, a touch of pine and a solid malt presence as well.
T: The taste is just the same. Nice pineapple, mango and papaya with some orange as well. Sweet bready malts create a nice backbone throughout the drink. The finish has a slight bitterness with a hint fresh pine. Very balanced.
M: Medium bodied with a medium carbonation. The sweet malt and fruity hop flavors linger across the palate for quite sometime and the beer is highly drinkable.

M - Great carbonation and the right malt to put this IPA above almost ever DIPA I've ever had.

very aromatic. very hoppy. pine, citrus, zest, some floral/herbal and peppery aromas in there as well. a nice mixture of very aromatic hops drown out any semblance of a malt backbone, though I wasn't expecting much of one anyways.
hops again out front and in-your-face. herbal/peppery hops are more present than in the aroma and contribute a contrast to the huge bitter and zesty citrus flavors. huge tropical fruitiness comes in bringing a bunch of mango and pineapple and some flavors of sweetened dried tropical fruits like those found in some trail mixes due to a slight malt sweetness.
medium bodied with a lot of prickly carbonation and a slightly resiny finish with a touch of booze warmth and a long-lingering bitterness.
Another VT DIPA that would put many west coast beers to shame. a great and unique blend of hop flavors/aromas attack your palate and do not let go, even after you finish. 1,084 characterssilentjay, Feb 26, 2012

Pouring a moderately hazy orange with a dense, white head with excellent retention and gorgeous lacing, this is among the nicer DIPA's I've laid eyes on. And the nose! Does it bring to mind Pliny (the Elder) or what?! The nose has such a wonderful Simcoe character, fresh, juicy, tropical fruit along with a beautiful ripe orange character! Ripe apricots, oranges and with some floral characteristics, this smells truly wonderful.The malt character is medium-low, with a little caramel, and some mild bready and cracker-like notes. A little alcohol is noticeable, but never in a detrimental way. One could even argue that the juicy hops almost make some of the fruit character appear candied.
The palate comes close to out-Plinying Pliny. That's not something I would say easily, simply because Elder (IMO) stands apart from almost every other DIPA out there due to the way that it captures both, the delicacy that hops can bring with their power. Abner, in my book, is the only other beer this big that does that. Juicy citrus with a melange of tropical fruit (ripe papayas, ripe mangoes, ripe oranges). A touch sweet on the mid-palate with a blend of citrus juice sweetness (from the hops) and some light caramel malt and honey. Drying on the finish with an exquisite blend of mellow bitterness and ripe, redolent fruit. Bitterness is moderate throughout, in balance with the fruity sweetness that the hops bring. Not particularly resiny either. Medium-light in body, this beer is a little too carbonated (initially at least), and has a wonderful finish. Of particular note is the lack of a green/leafy hop character that many hop-bombs end up having. Absolutely delicious, exceptional stuff, my favorite HFS beer yet. 1,907 charactersDefenCorps, Feb 25, 2012

Fresh growler out of my HFS glass. Picked up at the release on Saturday.
A- A glowing amber/orange color. Pours with a healthy white head with plenty of lacing. A bit murky, but is very bright and bubbly.
S- Lots of sweet citrus, grapefruit/mango and a good bit of piney hops. Some fresh grass, and plenty of pale malt.
T- Very smooth initial flavor, my mouth is then flooded with citrus and a bit of sweetness. The hoppy/piney flavor then comes in strong. The aftertaste is piney grass, and dry lemon citrus.
M- As with most HFS beers, spot on. Carbonation and body are both perfect for the style.
O- Like all the other HFS IPA's I've had, this is world class. A bit dry and piney on the aftertaste for my preferences, but there really isn't a thing wrong with this beer. YUM!

Appearance: Cloudy pale yellow in color with a slight one and a half finger head. Frothy, but sticks nicely to the glass throughout. 
Aroma: Loads of hops in the nose. Big sweet mango, pineapple, and other tropical fruit. Some bitter pine undertones. Really nice citrus character in the nose as well. Really well done.
Taste: Mango, pineapple, and tropical fruit all are there plentifully. Some bitter pine notes arrive right after the initial fruity hop burst. Really flavorful and balanced throughout.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied with really light and crisp carbonation. Very refreshing.
Overall, another spectacular DIPA from Hill Farmstead. I honestly cannot say which of their DIPAs I like best as they are all so top notch. Abner is really flavorful, yet drinkable. A really solid combination of sweet and bitter notes. I would get this anytime they have it on tap. Awesome. 1,102 charactersGosox8787, Feb 20, 2012

Taste wow, this is a Vermont style DIPA. All those flavors in the nose, more pungent then you expect, with smack of grapefruit mixed in the finish. Body is on the large side, enough carbonation, lush not dry, and crazy drinkable. Closest beer I have had with this taste is Heady Topper and I will have a side by side soon.

Appearance- poured into a hill farmstead wine glass from 750 filled at the brewery’s harvest festival. Pours a cloudy tea color- amber yellow orange- can see bubbles floating to the top of the glass- small head leaves nice lacing
Smell- tropical fruits, pineapple, juicy…fantastic aromas pouring out of this
Taste- lot like the smell…bitter on the end…hits the lips full of tropical and citrus notes…pine…ends a bitter dry
Mouthfeel- crisp and dry nice light body…
Drinkability- all night long…i can’t imagine ever getting tired of this…if only it was not for the 8% ABV
Overall- this is a world class imperial IPA. One of my favorite offerings from Hill Farmstead and that is really saying something. I can’t wait till i get a chance to have another glass. 885 charactersmyatomicpolygon, Jan 20, 2012

A: One finger or less of foamy white head that has below average retention and left only a few straggles of lace in its wake. The body is a gorgeous light and pale mango color, very hazy and completely opaque until held to light. Lacing is minimal.
S: The nose immediately after the pour was phenomenal. Mango dominated tropical fruits. Pineapple, papaya, citrus. Bright, clean, punchy. Easily a 5. As it warms, however, solventy alcohol becomes noticeable and, by the end of the glass, the nose is no better than your average DIPA.
T: The taste doesn't measure up to my initial impressions of the aroma but it doesn't drop off after warming like the nose did. A small[er] malt presence lets the strong hop bitterness shine. Some heat on the back end of the palate.
M: Shaun always delivers in the mouthfeel department (pause) but Abner falls short of high expectations here. Medium-light body, softly carbonated and thin at times.
D: [DRINKABILITY] I'll probably order Abner 9 times out of 10 when it's available on draft but there are definitely better DIPAs to be had. 1,136 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, Jan 07, 2012

*From notes
-- Many thanks to Bill for sharing such a wonderful treasure! --
A: It looks a bit like a saison, as it's a rather cloudy golden amber. It's just gorgeous. A generous pour yields little head and no lacing.
S: My God this is wonderful. Tropical pineapple and juicy fruit explode out of the snifter and attack my nose with vigor. Just incredible.
T: Liquid mango/pineapple. Really top notch stuff here. The fruit forward nature of the beer isn't out of whack, as there is a touch of firm, sturdy malt to round out the finish.
M: The only real cavet of the brew is the feel. I realize it's a growler, so I'll cut this some slack. But it's generally a bit thin. There's not enough carbonation to carry the massive amount of flavor packed into this DIPA.
O: What a sensational beer. Hill Farmstead hasn't dissapointed with Abner, which in my humble opinion, was leaps and bounds better then their more prestigious Ephraim. When seeking out one of their hoppier brews, make sure you really take your time in considering this, as it's phenominal stuff. 1,146 charactersRhettroactive, Dec 10, 2011

It poured somewhat hazy with a nice looking light orange color to it. It had a thin, white, bubbly head to it that mostly stuck to the edges of the glass. 
The aroma had a lot of juiciness to it. I got a big grapefruit citrus presence mixing with some notes of orange, peach and pineapple. It had a fantastic aroma overall to it, I love the bright and juicy hoppy flavors. 
The taste has more of the juicy, fruity flavors coming out up front with some of the peach and pineapple notes to it. In the finish I get more bitter citrus, grapefruit and pine flavors to it. It had a very nice range of hoppy flavors to it and really balanced the juicy, tropical fruit notes and the bitter grapefruit notes well. 
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a great beer. It had a very good range of hoppiness to it with some juicy, fruity, Citra hop like notes at times and some piny, resiny grapefruit flavors in the finish. Very drinkable and flavorful beer of the style. 1,100 charactersbillab914, Nov 15, 2011

Appearance: Served in Belgian 50-cl glass with huge 4-finger foamy head that slowly melts away and leaves massive lacing. Color is similar to Galaxy or Edward: hazy orange, deep and dirty and artisanal, like fresh apple cider from the farm. 
Smell: Sweetness, citrus, a bit ofpineapple syrup. Some light spice and freshly pollinated flowers. Honey. Fresh, bright, enticing.
Taste: Smooth and easy, what you get first is a wave of boozy sugar-like sweetness. Sort of like rum cake. Tropical punch follows, and some fresh and bursting hops. Nothing extreme despite the ABV. Smooth like Keith S. and well balanced. 
Mouthfeel: Did I mention smooth? Medium body, almost full flavor, good carbonation. Could use more strength (thin around the edges) but good. An utter pleasure to drink. 
Overall: Exceptionally drinkable, barely a hint of that 8.0%. And always that outrageous, fresh-from-the-farm taste you get with all of Hill’s brews. 1,001 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Nov 03, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter. Thanks to CharlieMurphy for this.
4.0 A: Opaque medium orange color. Just under two fingers of creamy white head. Retention is about average and a small ring of lacing is left.
4.5 S: Nose on this is wonderful! Tons of tropical fruits. Mango, pineapple, papaya, and orange in descending order. Grapefruit and pine to a lesser extent. Despite the haziness, there is little in terms of yeast and is super clean overall. Malts are negligible save for a touch of neutral sweetness.
4.5 T: Taste is as good as the nose. There are a lot of DIPAs that are jampacked with fruitiness in the nose that doesn't also occupy the taste, but this isn't one of them. Ample amounts of mango, orange, and pineapple. A little less papaya. The grapefruit and pine are much more pronounced. Again, some balancing neutral malt sweetness and surpringly clean. Bitterness starts out quite soft, but progresses to mild-moderate halfway into the glass.
4.0 M: Medium body. Good moderate carbonation. Moderately creamy. Good here.
4.5 D: Hill Farmstead has to be one of the best breweries in the world. Everything they make is great. After having another killer DIPA, it's safe to say that there's no question that they know what to do with hops. Solid brew all around. 1,270 charactersDavoleBomb, Oct 30, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Tap at Armsby Abbey
Huge creamy 3 finger head fades slowly with big sticky lacing, super hazy orange peach color. The head is ridiculous.
nose erupts with citrus, fruit, tropical fruits, pineapple, bit of mango and papaya, fresh musty hop resin, hop oils a bit earthy and hint of pine, some sweet malts, nice balance.
Taste brings honey at first, nectar, sweet malts and a honey comb like taste. Then bitter hops, fairly bitter, musty hop resins, tropical fruit, pineapple, orange rind, touch of grapefruit, smooth make and great balance. finishes pretty biter, a bit drier, lingering fruit, spicy chewy, hop pellets, slightly astringent.
Mouth is med to a bit heavier bodied, decent carb. Slightest hint of warming booze.
Overall awesome, but not quite as great as Edward or Heady Topper, but otherwise really nice. great hops, nice balance, a bit too much on the musty resinous hops and bitterness than it could have done with tropical fruits etc, but very good otherwise. 979 charactersjlindros, Oct 29, 2011

A - Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed snifter a hazy golden orange with a big rocky two finger creamy head that leaves an enormous amount of side lacing and a thick clumpy off white blanket.
S - Super amazing aroma here. Malts and delicious hops. Light sweetness followed by inviting hops. Aromas of pine needles, grapefruit rinds, and light citrus. Just a super fresh aroma.
T - So so so delicious. This beer jumps out at you on the first sip. Light malt sweetness swept away by nice bitter pine and grapefruit peel. This stuff is dangerously addicting.
M - Smooth light and creamy. This is incredibly dangerous. Possibly the most deceptive dipa I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. Drinks like a 4%. Nice bitter hop finish.
O - Overall this is a masterfully crafted beer. Seriously amazing stuff. Stellar appearance and delicious in the mouth. Another typical "must drink" from Hill Farmstead. 955 charactersrudzud, Oct 28, 2011

S- Sweet, tropical fruit hop aromas that carry over beautifully into the taste. Mango, guava blossoms, etc.
T- The taste is more of what's found in the nose. The complex sweet tropical fruit is the most noticeable characteristic, with just enough bitterness. Complex and delightful.
M- Incredibly smooth with little carbonation. Very nice.
O-I really loved this beer. The second or third time I've had it, and I seem to enjoy it more each time. Tied with the Double Citra as my favorite Hill Farmstead brew, and definitely one of the top DIPA's I've had. 693 characterstyamhydrogen, Oct 24, 2011
4.55/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Fresh from the keg @ Hill Farmstead Brewery, Greensboro VT (Harvest Festival).
Price - $18/Growler
Pours a hazy golden color with lots of suds. A frothy two inch white head covers the top and legs upon legs adorn the tulip glass. A gentle swirl and a creamy layer is added to an already fresh looking beer. A lack of bubbles suggests this may not be very carbonated.
The nose is all citrus and tropical fruit with mango leading the way followed by orange, peaches and white grapefruit. Very pleasent smelling.
The taste can be summed up simply with citrus and tropical fruit draped over a caramel background. The flavor is slightly faint keeping it from being exceptional. 
My first impression of the mouthfeel is complete balance. A perfect ratio of hops and malts. The bitterness is present but not biting at the tongue. The body is medium and the dryness is just enough not to cause me to need a sip of water. Low carbonation. 
Overall this example is much more drinkable IMO than Ephraim and one I prefer in the long run. It's almost reminiscent of a single IPA which makes it fun but very dangerous at the same time. Thumbs up! 1,138 characters05Harley, Oct 23, 2011

Very murky, golden yellow body. Dirty white head settles to a ring and a patchy covering. 
Lots of citrus and tropical fruit. Some spice. Great hop profile. Floral and piney. Some faint cracker malts.
Retained hops, floral and citrus flavors, with some pine. Mango flavors. Crcker malts give a dry backbone. Bitterness is restrained, and builds into a good dose of bitterness that lingers in the mouth. 
This is an easy drinking DIPA. I thought it was a pale ale at first. Great hop flavors. I could drink a billion of these. 568 characterslitheum94, Oct 22, 2011
4.13/5  rDev -9.8%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Growler shared by TurdFurgison a while back. Thanks, Eric.
Rust colored with an extremely cloudy, turbid body. Looks like the dry hops didn't settle out very well in this one. I don't mind a cloudy beer, but this is pretty murky stuff.
The nose more than makes up for the appearance. This is pretty dank, resiny stuff. Tropical fruit meets bitter grapefruit. A bit catty too, which I don't mind, and a very faint bready malt foundation.
As I've come to expect from HFS, this has a huge resiny hop bite. Very bitter and dry, though it avoids tasting astringent, and the big fruity hop flavors do a great job of balancing the bitterness. There's a dry malt backbone here that does actually provide some body and heft, though it isn't a sweet beer at all. The mouthfeel suffers a bit from all the sediment - it has a slightly chalky texture. Overall it's very enjoyable, but not as impressive as Ephraim. 904 characterslargadeer, Oct 20, 2011

4.39/5  rDev -4.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5At the Blackback Pub in Waterbury. Served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass.
Verrry cloudy and golden. Head is small and leaves little lacing. Carbonation not really evident. This looks like IPAs I've brewed at home.
Smells great--a bouquet of tropical tropical aromas out front. Mango, pineapple, and citrus aromas. 
Taste is juicy and all fruit--grapefruit and orange peel flavors, pineapple, mango, etc. Just lightly sweet and not bitter to my tastes. Don't get any malt here. The flavor is delicious, but a bit more subdued than you might think for an 8.2 percent ABV beer.
Mouthfeel is very light for the style and the ABV. The lack of carbonation make it juice-like.
This beer goes down like nothing and tastes delicious. It's not a life-changing beer, but the hop profile is great. I missed Ephraim on tap by a day; I wish I could be able to compare it to that. 873 charactersmusicforairports, Oct 19, 2011

A - Cloudy, golden-amber with little head into a 9 oz snifter.
S - Lots of pine, some citrus, nectarIne, mango and hop buds. Very nice but not as aromatic as the Ephraim.
T - Orange flesh and rind, LOTS of pineapple, nectarine, pale malt and a complex floral-basket of hop flavors. Love the bright, orange citrus aftertaste as it dances with the bitterness. 
M - Light-medium body and medium carbonation. Mildly resinous. Refreshing. 
O - Wonderful brew. Very well balanced. This is the beer that ran out first at this event at Capone's and ran out first at TJ's. I put it near the top of all double IPAs. It has a bit more pineapple flavor than their double citra. It is somewhat-like Heady Topper. 881 charactersTucquan, Oct 17, 2011

A - Pours a cloudy, medium orange with only a few white bubbles forming at the top that quickly move to the edges. 
S - The smell here is great, very citrusy. Mainly grapefruit and oranges.
T - Taste follows along nicely with the smell. Again very citrusy, orange and grapefruit, and a ever so slight honey-carmel taste.
D - Lower carbonation and a touch heavy on the body.
O - Even with the growler issues this is a nice DIPA. 544 charactersHuskyinPDX, Oct 17, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5So interesting. Received both Abner and Ephraim in a recent trade with mtardiff. (Thanks Marc!)
While Ephraim gets the top overall score of A+ vs. this beer, I clearly enjoy this beer more. No disrespect to Ephraim, but this is a superior beer in my opinion. (notice I didn’t say fact)
Pours with a thin finger of foamy head that does settle to a film of foam. Very slight haze in the golden/amber colored beer. Some splotchy lace clings to the glass.
Aroma is fantastic. Bright, bold, floral and perfume like. You can smell the fresh hop cones in your hand as if you just squeezed out all the essential oils. 
Flavor matches and compliments the aroma perfectly. While this is a hop juice special, there is also a wonderful balance here. The light cracker malt notes are toasty and provide a wonderful base to the hop bitterness. There is also a fruit explosion here that is so juicy. Mango, Tangerine come to mind. Fantastic. 8.2%?? No way. This is so well hidden it’s scary. A dangerously delicious beer!!!
Body is refreshing and bright. Carbonation is just right and brings the flavor to life without getting in the way.
One of my favorite Hill Farmstead items. Wow, I have to get more of this one! (if possible) 1,223 charactersReagan1984, Oct 12, 2011

A- really big carbonated head that has superior retention and great lacing. Theres a slight haze to the orange body and above that is foamy white head thats just kind of hanging out. This looks really nice but what else is new from HF. 
S- I could smell it once I opened it. Earthy bitterness and citrus zest are the most noticeable along with some sharp citrus scents, nice aroma
T- Nice balance of sweet and bitter hops. Nice sharp bitterness upfront that carries throughout. nice zesty citrus bitterness comes through toward the middle and has a grapefruit-y sweetness. The finish is bitter and lingers. This hits all the areas I want in an (D)IPA
M- probably a medium body but feels much fuller. moderate amount of carbonation fizzes and turns very smooth. 
O- This beer is top notch stuff. The taste is pretty close to perfect to me. Mainly bitter with some sweet citrus. It also poured beautifully and was a very enjoyable beer. 999 charactersGushue3, Oct 10, 2011

Scent is a wonderful blend of citrus and tropical fruit... orange, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, faint notes of light bready malt. Taste leads with sharp bitterness before it becomes all about the fruit, crockery malt makes an appearance at the end before the bitterness returns. Medium bodied, smooth, dry.

With the top popped, a straw colored liquid poured into my awaiting glass. Lovely carbonation levels rose near to the top and the room was filled with a bouquet of hoppy freshness. 
Pine needles, grapefruit zest, oranges and a light agave styled aroma emerged from the glass. Big and hoppy, nearly dank, it seemed as if the hops were squeezed to release their true nectar. Sticky was almost the comparison but icky isn't something I usually follow up with.
Smooth on the palate with a juicy citrus flavor taking over. The combination of a grapefruit and tangerine came close as to the initial citrus comparison. Hop bitterness came up on the finish but never made the beer feel out of balance. Some sweetness was also tasted, more to the effect of a sweetened tea which gave a nice undertone to the high citrus flavor.
I'm very happy to have gotten the chance to enjoyed Abner. With Ephraim to come, I'm really blown away at one breweries' capability to produce their quality of different hop forward recipes. Delicious and just my style. 1,137 charactersBardwashrind, Oct 10, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +1.3%750ml swingtop growler. 
Thanks for making this one possible Brendan
*note, there was partial leakage upon arrival. This was filled a week ago and in my possession yesterday. 
Pours an extremely cloudy copper. Place a laser directly behind it and shine it right at it and you wouldn't pick up even a hint of it. A small 1 finger of white head forms, but there most likely would've been more if this hadn't leaked. A decent amount of webbing a left behind.
Hill Farmstead really provides excellent aromas in all their brews. Huge bursts of ripe mango and apricot punch you right in the face. Some good earthy tones. Then in comes the hops. Not overwhelming, but definitely there. Very nice, inviting smell.
Taste follows precisely. Slightly less hops than expected, but again, that could be victim of the minor leak.
Mouthfeel is uber creamy. Slightly too creamy for the style, but again, yada yada, leakage. 
It might be unfair to rate this under the circumstances, but I felt like I got the gist of it. I don't feel like my review can hurt this at all. A's are A's. This is one I definitely hope to revisit under better conditions. 1,139 charactersDearthVader, Oct 09, 2011

4.2/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at the Harvest Festival at Hill Farmstead on October 1, 2011. Probably a six ounce pour into a HFS wine glass.
Hazy, ever-so-slightly-watered-down orange body with a nice two finger clean white head. 
Fairly bright citrus and tropical fruit [sweet peaches come to mind] hop aroma with hints of deep, dank herbal and piney bitterness mixed in. Really nice, if not a bit mellow.
Grapefruit [pith], sweet peach and tangerine fruitiness dominates with a strong serving of citrus pithy bitterness and surprisingly sweet caramel / sugary malt backbone. Lots of pine and grass make their way onto the flavor profile as the palate begins to differentiate between the sweeter fruitiness and pithy bitterness. 
Medium bodied with medium, medium-low carbonation. Fairly sticky and oily.
A good DIPA, but not as solid of a showing as batches of Ephraim. 853 charactersVerecund, Oct 03, 2011

Appearance: Out of the growler, my pour has a nice creamy froth of a white head above a cloudy tangerine beer. Pretty nice retention from a growler.
Smell: Some lightly sweet crackery malt. The aroma is full of hops. Floral, some grassy, lots of grapefruit, and a bit of spicy pine. Very nice.
Taste: A good amount of biscuity malt does its best to stand up to the hops, but fairly quickly the tidal wave of hops wins. A balanced hop presence - grapefruit citrus, some grass, and some prickly pine. The finish is fairly clean.
Mouthfeel: Balanced full body, a little bit of booze. Smooth, creamy carbonation. Lightly grainy, not much hop oil left on the tongue after each sip.
Overall: This is a well made, balanced, hop bomb. Very good, I have no qualms about finishing a decent portion of this growler. 895 charactersKickInTheChalice, Sep 28, 2011

A: I have seen reviews down the line here that have it much different then what I got. For me, it was a mildly hazy orange color. There was some sediment floating in there, but not much. Good carbonation. Faint white head that dissipated really quickly. There were some alcohol feet seeing as it is 8.2%. Some lacing, but not much.
S: It was probably up there on one of the best smelling DIPAs that I have had. Maybe it was just the freshness factor, I don't know. Tons of fruity hops and pine notes. Delicious. There was some mild breadiness at the back end from the malts though.
T: Flat out delicious tasting beer. Not overly bitter on the front of the tongue. There was a mild bite there. But it gets you in the mid-mouth. All those fruity hop flavors: grapefruit and peach and other citrus. But you also get some piney notes. And those malts are there to SOME WHAT balance out this hop bomb. Very nice finish. Very clean.
M: This is a medium bodied DIPA. With all those hops, there was bound to be some flavors lingering on the tongue for a while.
O: Just a truely exceptional DIPA. Really ranks up there for me....just like with most BAers. I'd love to sample again down there line. Cheers to Tim and Dan. 1,366 charactersinlimbo77, Sep 26, 2011

A - Pours a hazy medium orange color with a thick, even layer of creamy foam that sticks to the sides of my tulip like a viscous, sticky glue. Very active carbonation coming from the full perimeter of the glass in a very active cascade of tight, tiny bubbles.
S - Sniffing from the growler, it smells absolutely INCREDIBLE!!! As it sat in my tulip glass for (5) minutes, the aroma was 1/3 of what it previously was, it didn't hold up well. Spicy tropical fruit basket and a sweet bready malt character.
T - It doesn't get much better than this. HUGE tropical fruit basket aroma that's ozzing with oranges, pineapples, grapefruit, and a sweet tang up front with the sweet malt carrying a steady presence until the very end when it morphs into a grapefruit rind bitter finish with a little bit of spice.
M - Smooth, silky, medium body.

Hazy orange body with a poofy white foam (proper!). Loads of citrusy hops in the aroma, grapefruit and orange, the malts presenting minimal balance with maybe a light grainy counterplay. Grapefruit dominates in the flavor, with a nearly puckering hop presence in the back as well. Initially sweet then lasting bitterness.

A - Clear golden body with a bit of a white head. Sticky lacing in top, but not a lot of it.
S - Wow, hops. A great citrus hop aroma, backed up by a hint of sweetness. Smells pretty damn good.
T - A lot like the smell, but in three distinct stages. An initial great citrus hop flavor, but it seems to be gone by the time I get the taste of the malt. Caramel malt and a bit of sweetness, almost independent of the hops. Then the malt sweetness fades, yielding a bitterness in the finish. None of the flavors seem to flow together.
M - The odd distinction of flavors takes away. It makes it feel thick at points and thin at others. Strange.
O - I had this right after indulging in some Heady Topper, so poor Abner never stood a chance. It's good, but not up with the best DIPAs. 865 charactersAlieniloquium, Aug 05, 2011

Cloudy pale gold color, and the beer was very cold. Head faded quickly but decent lacing. Nose is tropical/citrus with very little bitterness. At first sight and smell, I am curious as to how old this keg is. The last time I was in this establishment was late April, when I tried HF Double Galaxy. I have to say the Abner was delicious but not as impressive overall as the Double Galaxy. I am still very impressed by Hill Farmstead; I just think this keg was a bit aged and muted for a highly rated DIPA. 605 charactersElGallo, Aug 02, 2011

A polished balance between bitterness and flavor. Dank and hoppy with a tropical fruit finish. Citrus and grapefruit all over. Bitterness lingers just long enough until you take another sip. A little more bitter than most west coast heavy hitters but think this is where Abner excels and stands out from the pack. This beer is damn near perfect. 475 charactersBearsOnAcid, Jul 28, 2011

A - I love the look of Hill Famrstead DIPAs. A nice bright hazy orange with a 2 finger white head. Sticky lacing clings to the glass as it goes down.
S - Ah, that HF hop aroma. Wonderfully hoppy, juicy, and tropical with just the right amount of dankness mixed in. 
T - So juicy. Rich with complex hop flavors. The taste lives up to the aroma here. Alcohol is very well hidden. Tropical fruits, a touch of grass and very hop forward with just enough malt backbone. So delicious. The mouthfeel feels perfect. It is creamy and juicy and so easy to drink. 
Hill Farmstead makes some of my favorite DIPAs. Abner, Galaxy, Double Citra, and Ephraim are all so fantastic. With all these other amazing DIPAS coming out of HF, I hope Abner is always a regular and not forgotten. I will continue to make the long trek up there for my fill and look forward to what comes next. 982 charactersphingdong, Jul 27, 2011

M-Big, sticky, oily and resinous. Awesome feel for a DIPA. Great carbonation. Dry and lasting. 
O/D-Nailed it. My goodness can Vermont put together a good beer. I absolutely loved this. I will give the victory to Heady Topper in a head-to-head, but its pretty much splitting hairs at that point. World class, top notch. Unbelievable. 930 charactersVelvetExtract, Jul 24, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.564oz growler, filled from the brewery yesterday. Poured into Delirium Tremens tulip.
Appearance: Moderate pour into glass provides a solid one finger of fluffy white head. Head fades quickly, but the elephant nucleation point keeps it wispy throughout the beer. Very nice but thin lacing is left all over the glass as it goes down. Dark and hazy orange color. This is a very pretty beer, though I wish it had a bit stronger head.
Smell: Grapefruit! Lots and lots of grapefruit! There are some other nebulous citrus aromas and a bit of malt in here, but the aroma is all about the grapefruit.
Taste: Unsurprisingly, Abner tastes almost exactly like he smells. Fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, a nice hoppy bitterness, and not a trace of alcohol despite the 8.2% ABV. There is some grass and a bit of malt hiding in the back, but this guy is dominated by sweet grapefruit flavor.
Mouthfeel: Moderate carbonation, medium bodied - very pleasant, but nothing revolutionary.
Drinkability: Wow. I enjoy DIPA's well enough, but tend to not go crazy with them as I find the alcohol dominates the beer more often than not. Not so here. ABV aside, this beer could be drank all night long.
Overall: Hill Farmstead makes as good of a beer as anyone out there, and they're doing it with such a wide variety of recipes. This is another killer beer in their lineup - I wouldn't say it's better than Ephraim, but it's up there. I'm off to the Alchemist in an hour for some Heady Topper, and Abner is one heck of a baseline for comparison. Bottom line - if you like a grapefruit tasting DIPA, I don't think you'e going to do much better than Abner. 1,636 characterscbeer88, Jul 24, 2011

Pours an opaque golden hue, tinted orange, and with a thin head.
Aroma of fragrant floral and extreme citrus notes that maintain their strength throughout the whole glass. Each sip a reward for the nose.
Tastes of intense grapefruit citrus and orange rind followed by an apricot sweetness and then washed with the bitterness from the hops.
Mouth feels medium bodied with a mild tartness that lingers but never overwhelms the sweetness.
Overall a surprising and uniquely balanced 2x IPA. 554 charactersflavoursaviour, Jul 23, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Drank from a 750 ml swing top growler purchased at the Hill Farmstead Brewery, Greensboro, VT
Served in a Hill Farmstead Brewery stemmed glass
The beer poured a cloudy, glowing peachy-amber color with a soapy looking, bright white head that quickly dissipated. Small droplets and thin streaks of spotty lacing trickled along the glass.
The nose was simply mesmerizing. Super hoppy with loads of sweet, smooth fruitiness. Peaches and apricots came through strongest. Lots of juicy tangerine, mango, papaya and passionfruit as well. I have never before experienced such a cornucopia of exotic fruit notes in a beer's aroma.
Strong, fruity hop flavors carried through into the taste as well. Sweet tangerines dominated. Peach and apricot notes were quite prevalent as well. Although I would assume that this beer benefited from a moderate dosage of caramel malts, its pleasant sweetness seemed to have emerged from the diverse hop profile rather than from residual malt sugars. The beer finished quite pithy and dry with a moderate, grapefruit rind-like bitterness. At 8.2% ABV, this beer masked its alcohol prowess quite well.
The mouthfeel may have been the only letdown with this beer. The body was a bit light for the style. A very fine and mild effervescence helped the liquid glide across my tongue. Somewhat creamy, fluffy and smooth.
In their short existance, the Hill Farmstead Brewery has seemed to master the art of creating hoppy beers, and this example is proof of that. Outstanding work. I cannot wait to see what comes next. 1,541 charactersDamian, Jul 22, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from tap at TJs in Paoli into a snifter glass. Keg left over from their "Scraps" event on Saturday.
A: A medium golden orange color with a half finger white head. Lacing was vertical lines that eventually recedes into the glass.
S: Sweet tropics! Huge blast of tropical fruit with pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, mango coupled with some sugar sweetness and a hint of alcohol. Nice nose.
T: Follow the nose. The tropical fruit jumps with the same flavors of pineapple, grapefruit, lemon and mango. The hops get mixed with some bready malt the turns sweeter as it warms. A slight hint of pine sneaks in before the sweetness keeps any possible bitterness in check. Finish is coating and lasting with some prickling but not very bitter. Nice finish that leaves a lasting impression of the word "balanced".
M: Full, coating, sweet and a hint of bitterness. Alcohol does come through in the end as it warms, but not overly so.
O: A real nice DIPA that is very well done. Balance is the key to this beer and makes it really drinkable. 
Overall I really enjoyed this beer as I have heard a lot about it. A top tier DIPA, but it (for me) falls short of the heavyweights in this class. Still, a really, really tasty beer that is very, very good. Really glad I got to try it. 1,275 charactersKadonny, Jul 18, 2011
4.73/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought a growler of Abner on my way to, and my way home from the Vermont Brewers Festival.
Poured into a tulip glass (over and over) from a Marshall Wharf growler.
Transparent deep amber beer with a frothy head that laces like crazy. Big hop nose, and a little sugary malt in the background. This is what a true Imperial IPA should be IMO. Big hops, with a decent amount of malt to match. A rich indulgent experience. The hops are juicy and bursting with flavor. Tropical fruit dominates, pineapple definitely, and maybe mango. Some grapefruit bitterness comes in at the end, and the sweet caramel malt balances it out. Slick, resinous oily mouthfeel, with a good amount of carbonation to make this supremely drinkable. This beer draws a line in the sand. Clearly IIPA, but not overdone.
When I think Imperial, purple velvet comes to mind. This is a beverage fit for a king.
Note: Should add that I had this with a cave aged soft cheddar that I bought at the festival. Paired terrifically! 993 charactersggilman, Jul 18, 2011
4.01/5  rDev -12.4%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4On Tap at the Black Back in Waterbury VT.
Pours a cloudy lemony amber color with a thinnish white head that seems to dissipate quickly. Smells like hops, no really it does :) Earthy spicy hops abound with that spicy oniony flair to them. Little if any malt evident in the aroma, but I'm sure they did indeed use some malts in this beer. Taste is Bitter pine and earthy. Hints of caramel malt are there for a nano second but this one is all about the hops. Finishes rather dry with a long lingering spicy bitterness. Moderate carbonation, medium thin body with a resinous tart mouthfeel. I enjoyed this one, but it wasn't my favorite of the night. One curiosity is that all of the Hill beers I had were very cloudy, not sure if that is the way they are supposed to be or if we had trouble pouring. 796 charactersjohnnnniee, Jul 14, 2011

A: The brew appears a golden to amber color with a bit of hop induced haziness. There was a massive two finger head that was built like a house, great retention and excellent lacing.
S: On the first whiff with I was blown away with the overwhelming scents of tropical fruits, mango, passion fruit, papaya, and pineapple. The hops are really dominant, but the taosted malt manages to sneak in as it warms.
T: The taste is very similar to the nose with an overwhelming wave of the tropics, quite the hop bomb. There is a bit of toasted bread that surfaces in the finish, but it is very subtle. Nice and dry with another dose of hops on the finish as well.
M: Medium bodied with great carbonation. The bubbles give the beer a much bigger mouthfeel than I would have expected.
O: This brewery never ceases to amaze with its' hop forward offerings. Another great beer. 929 charactersNeffbeer, Jul 14, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at the Memphis Taproom in Philly; served in a tulip
An apricot colored body sits underneath two+ fingers of off-white foam. Excellent retention and sticky clumps of lace all over the glass.
Loads of citrus and tropical fruit leap out of the glass. Ruby red grapefruit, mango, tangerine, and guava on top of a super clean malt bill.
On the palate, the hops explode and recede slowly, leaving a moderate bitterness in its wake. Mangoes, tangerines, ruby red grapefruit and guava lend a fruity, playful hop profile that is a delight to put back.
Medium body with active carbonation. Not as hefty as some of the other HF ipas. A little more light and playful. Finish is fruity and moderately bitter.
Overall, this is an extremely solid an delicious iipa. This is welcome in my glass any day. 799 charactersColForbinBC, Jul 10, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Growler shared by drabmuh. Thanks Matt!
The beer is yellowish to orange in color, and mildly hazy. The head is a finger or so thick and leaves a healthy amount of lacing upon the glass. The aroma...ah. Wonderful. A barrage of tropical citrus fruits, most notably mango, pineapple, and orange, fill the olfactory senses with a hop lover's dream come true. While the flavor doesn't quite live up to the expectations delivered by the superb aroma, this beer is delicious nonetheless. Remarkably drinkable and wonderfully smooth on the palate. Highly recommended. 560 charactersHuhzubendah, Jul 05, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Served in a tulip glass at Teresa's. Had this shortly after reviewing Double Citra, as I was curious as to how the two Imperial HF IPAs stacked up side by side...
Hazy and light coppery straw in color, this is capped by a quickly dissipating head that leaves a very delicate lacing pattern within the rings that form with each sip. Very pretty.
The aroma is awesome, and it leads right into the flavor, which is the star of the show here. Floral notes stand out immediately in the nose, accompanied by a light piney aroma. A slight grapefruity citrus quality hints at what may be in store once this beer hits the palate. The flavor does not disappoint, and in fact, exceeds expectations as the grapefruit not only shows, but brings with it orange zest and lemon zest to accompany the pine and the now less intense floral notes. This is less bitter and more diverse in flavor than the Double Citra, and it does a better job of handling the higher ABV. This could stand toe to toe with any DIPA and be a serious contender. One of the best I have enjoyed to date. 
This is a touch thinner than I expect a DIPA to be, as it doesn't leave the sticky hop oils on my palate. To be sure though, this is the king of HF Double IPAs. However, given the different characteristics of each, I wonder at what would happen if I blended the two... 1,333 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Jul 02, 2011

Pours a very dark, hazy and completely opaque golden orange color with dark tangerine/orange hues and a one finger frothy white head.  Decent retention slowly fading into a thick lasting cap.  Sporadic streaks, rings and chunk of soapy lacing.  
Slightly earthy aroma with dank resinous hops and lots of earthy pine balanced by sweet citrus/tropical fruit and pale malt.  Lots of grapefruit in the nose with mango, orange peel and tangerine.  Pale malt underneath with hints of biscuit and graham cracker but this thing is bursting with tropical/citrus fruit. 
Medim bodied with a blast of dry, dank, earthy hops up front with hints of pine and dry bitterness balanced by a sweet tropical/ citrus fruit presence.  Fuller bodied than expected and slightly creamy with hints of papaya ,lots of grapefruit and orange peel as well as some mango.  Dry, dank earthy hop presence balanced by the citrus.  Really dry and bitter at first but as the glass warms it becomes extremely well balanced with a ton of citrus and tropical fruit notes. 1,062 characterscorby112, Jun 24, 2011

A: Pours a rather murkey, pale orangish, yellow color. Big two finger off white head, nice retention, and big, thick lace.
A: Pine, and grapefruit. Huge hoppy nose, with a nice malt backbone to try and give this one some semblence of balance. The hops are fresh, smell great and actually give the beer a greenish tint to it.
T: Again, all about the hops, there has to be atleast 5 different varieties in there. This has got to be the bitterest beer that has ever touched my lips, but it's pretty darn good. Notes of orange peel, lemon, and pine sap. It finishes somewhat sweet.
M: Medium body, good levels of carbonation. The flavors dance around the palate nicely.
O: The nose is great, and this would be an A+ beer if not for the overpowering bitterness. I am a hophead, but this one almost pushes the envelope to far. But all in all another very good beer from HF. Skal. 949 charactersGtreid, Jun 12, 2011

A yellow, slightly orange body, kind of hazy, a few bubbles on top.
Citrusy hop notes all over the place, maybe some pine notes and a really dank hoppy aroma mixed in. Some sweetness also comes through.
Wow, what a great flavor. Big bitter notes, orange peel with a fairly big malt backbone to give a nice pale malt flavor. With that said this isn't very balanced a big nice bitterness with really nice citrusy notes. medium bodied with very little carbonation. I am guessing the long journey is what caused the light carbonation so I can't really take away too much from it.
Overall a fantastic beer. Really nice hoppy flavor and aroma. If only the carbonation was present like it should be. I gotta try this and other Hill Farmstead IPA's. I could see this being my top rated DIPA if I could try it again. 843 charactersjpmclaug, Jun 10, 2011

A - Pours hazy orange with a small half finger tall white head leaving small wisps of lacing down the glass.
S - Smells of citric hops, grapefruit, pine, bready malt, and a touch of caramel sweetness. The nose was good but when you have a Double Citra sitting right beside it there really isn't much of a comparison. Still very nice tho.
T - Starts off with a nice grapefruit kick quickly giving way to a mix of light citric hops, caramel sweetness and some dry chewiness. Very nice overall balance throughout. Finish is a touch dry with some lingering hop bitterness. Pretty good but not as good as the other hoppy HF beers.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Slick, chewy, feel with plenty of lingering hop bitterness in the finish.
O - I enjoyed this one quite a bit but when you compare it to the other hoppy Hill Farmstead beers it is clearly fourth or fifth best. Not knocking it one bit as it is still an awesome beer, just not as good as either of the Citra's or even Edward. 1,179 charactersorangesol, Jun 09, 2011

Smells of huge hops-- actually, very reminiscent of Pure Hoppiness by Alpine! Really a nice nose with notes of citrus and pine. 
Some great bitterness hits on the finish with lingering dry pine notes. The citrus hops are vibrant and fresh, and in my face awesome. Almost no malt, which is what I've come to expect from HF ipas! This is very nice.
Solid body and good firm carbonation. Excellent bitterness. This is fantastic. I could drink this all night-- as a matter of fact, I'm gonna!

A: The beer pours hazy, burnt orange in color. Nice thick 2 finger white head. Kinda thought it would have better retention based on that, but it dwindled to a frothy layer within a minute. Scattered spotted lacing
S: Dominated by citrus but has some nice accompanying minor notes. Grapefruit, tangerine and pine all greet you initially. Some flower mixed in. Also a touch of grass/lemongrass
T: Tastes a lot different then it smells. Starts with a light pine and some bitterness from this. Rather earthy in the middle. Some floral and grapefruit linger in the background. Fairly hoppy, but not the big citrus flavor I was expecting
M: Medium bodied. Soft mouthfeel. The carbonation is there but light for the style. Could be the format. Certainly doesn't distract too much though
D: Drank the shit out of this beer. Potentially dangerous at 8.2%. Don't expect to have this much given the limit distribution of Hill Farmstead but I would order whenever given the chance 1,123 charactersBrez07, Jun 05, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Tasted side by side with the double citra at Capone's, I thought this beer a tad less impressive than that great beer. Regardless, this is another fine IPA from a brewer who is clearly a master at crafting delicious IPA's.
The beer pours a somewhat hazy orange amber color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is impressive, though it doesn't compare to Ephraim or the double cirtra. Still, I get considerable dry citrus, pepper and light pine on the nose. The flavor profile replicates the nose in this dry, impressively hoppy IPA. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a fairly long, bitter finish. Alcohol is well disguised in what is another outstanding IPA from the folk at FH. Excellent beer, but I thought it paled in comparison to some of its sibling at this event.
Edit from 4/17.  Been some years since I last tried this beer, and really have nothing to add.  If anything, the most recent version of Abner I tried (both at the brewery and around town in Stowe/Waterbury) was tad less impressive than the beer I sampled at Capone's back in 6/11.  Still a nice beer, but during a recent visit to Stowe/Waterbury, I'm not sure it would make my top 10 of the different IPA's and DIPA's I tried (in fact, I thought the HF Harlan was superior to this beer).   My impression is that the rest of the world has caught up to HF in this part of the world, at least when it comes to IPA's and DIPA's. 1,404 charactersJohn_M, Jun 03, 2011

4.57/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750 mL growler from HF, served in a nonic.
Looks like a HF IPA. Color is a hazed, murky dull golden copper with a bubbly white head from a hard pour. Adequate retention and minimal lacing, suggesting this wasn't the best growler fill. Aroma is dank pine and citrus resin with biscuit malt and minimal sweetness. Very fresh and intense. Much more sweetness in the flavor which goes a long way in balancing the intense resiny bitterness and making this beer enjoyable. Hops start tropical and juicy before turning dry, raw and piney in the finish. Carbonation is a little low given this a growler, but not as bad as I expected upon initially opening. Thick, chewy and syrupy this a much denser and filling beer than my other favorite VT DIPA at the moment, Double Sunshine. In my opinion, consistently the best east coast DIPA for those seeking an intense hoppy and resiny fix. 876 charactersyourefragile, Jun 02, 2011

S: Fresh, bursting hops, and lots of them. Big tropical fruits: Grapefruit, orange, mango, pineapple. Floral notes, some slightly dank herbal notes. Tons of pine. Crystal sweetness. Huge orange, huge tropical fruits. Amazing. Might be the best nose of any beer I've had yet.
T: Wow. Huge tropical fruits with everything I picked up from the nose and more. Floral and herbal notes are there to add a little balance and depth to the hop character with lots of pine in the background. Big malt bill with lots of lightly toasted grains, plenty of crystal malt lends enough sweetness to make the citrus burst with flavor and balance the bitterness, but it doesn't come anywhere near stealing the show or being obtrusive. Finish is fairly bitter, very resinous, and linger herbal/floral notes and a touch of citrus. Has a slight white wine like flavor with alcohol esters on the finish. Unbelievable. 
M: Pretty full body, moderate to slightly high carbonation. Extremely smooth yet very resinous and sticky. Amazing how it works. Crisp and easy finish that is a touch dry (due to alcohol) but does still have residual sweetness. Luscious yet crisp and refreshing. I don't get how this can be done. Amazing.
O: I've had some great IPAs/DIPAs, but this is hands down the best I've had to date and easily one of the best overall beer's I've ever tossed back. Picture perfect appearance, a nose so good I want to take a shower in it, use it as cologne, spray it on my beds sheets, capture it in a bottle and carry it everywhere with my nose constantly propped against it. The scary part? The taste is even BETTER! How could this be possible! 9 times out of time a great nose on an IPA is led by a letdown of some degree or at least matches the nose. Rarely does it beat the nose. Never does it beat an epic nose. The body? It defies logic. 2,090 charactersSatchboogie, Jun 01, 2011

Poured into a snifter glass..nice white head slighty hazzy orange pure goodness.
The Citrus/Hops totally mask any hint of alcohol..this DIPA is awesome..so I secured 4 glass from the growler and wanted more.

4.55/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Am I drinking Pliny? I had one fresh lady night and seriously I cannot tell the difference.
I'm having this on tap at Blind Tiger. Thank you, Alan, for hooking this up. The muddy and hazy light orange appearance bears a brilliant head that dissipates but sustains well and leaves lacing all over the glass. The smell is citrus hops and sweet malts to balance - no alcohol. You know this is a hop bomb before sipping, and you know it's gonna be great. 
The taste is brilliant. Appearance is really the only difference from Pliny, and I have to wager that in representing the east coast, I'd put this up before any others. I lack the vocabulary, but the
balance is this beer's strength, and it's so freakin harmonious.
I could drink this all the time any day, and I love how it feels goij down. Abner all the way. H&F all the way. Hype machine? Validated. 856 charactersafksports, Feb 23, 2011
4.53/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up during the Hill Farmstead Winter Gathering on February 12. Tried it on tap but didn't wanna review any 4oz samples. Hops fill the room upon opening.
A- Cloudy deep gold with a nice frothy white cap that retains well. Lots of beautiful thick lace rings.
S- A good balance of fresh bread and juicy hops. A ton of peach, grapefruit and general citrus fruit notes fly out of the growler upon opening. Some caramel malt. Also floral behind the peaches. Competes with any West Coast IIPA.
T- Follows the nose for the most part. Emphasis on peach juice and floral hops. Fresh bread, pine, orange, grapefruit.
MF- Creamy foamy feel to this with a nice high end carbonation and bitterness. Goes down too smoothly.
DB- Love the citrus and peaches here. As a whole it is a very well balanced double IPA and I am only awaiting Ephraim to find out how that could possibly be much better than this. Vermont is really becoming a powerhouse of Northeast craft beer. 964 characterscbutova, Feb 20, 2011

Pours hazy orange, white head retains at a half finger and leaves excellent lacing.
Great smell - tons of peach, resin, warm bread, some grapefruit.
Taste follows the smell almost identically. Great peachy/dank/grapefruit hop profile with some citrusy tropicalness as well. Nice warm bread malt backbone as well. 
Good mouthfeel, but felt a little thin to me.
Damn! Vermont knows their hops! This is definitely comparable to Heady Topper. 495 charactersChico1985, Feb 19, 2011

4.7/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My main man from Philly procured me a growler of this fine brew because I'm pretty sure he has a man crush on me. This will be my first brew from Hill Farmstead but I've heard great things! Drank from my Ithaca nonic pint glass.
Appearance- Pours a hazy orange yellowish with a decent half finger bright white head that looks thick and creamy. A decent cap and thick collar remains with a bit of random lacing strewn about.
Smell- Loads of juicy grapefruit seem to burst out of the glass along with a touch of sweet orange peel. Not particularly 'bitter' smelling as the fruitiness has a sort of sweet maltiness behind it. A touch of pine and some earthy grass but that grapefruit is all I can seem to smell. As it warms a touch of butterscotch and a light whiff of alcohol show.
Taste- Holy grapefruit Batman!! It's like someone sprinkled a little sugar on a grapefruit, squeezed it and poured it into my glass. Perhaps a touch of peach mixed in for good measure but the grapefruit is absurd!! It's got the lightest touch of sweetness behind all that fruitiness yet still finishes light and dry. A long linger of grapefruit and orange zest lingers.
Mouthfeel- Medium body with a nice crisp bite of carbonation and an oily dry finish.
Drinkability- Really tasty brewski here. I've tried a lot of IPA's over the years and I love when I get to try something a bit different than all the rest and it still manages to be really good. Not sure what the hop profile of this beer is but it reminds me of Kern River Citra and some of those Troegs Scratch IPA's - except good. Very enjoyable, thanks much Jeff!! 1,603 charactersyounger35, Feb 13, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5on tap at eulogy in philly
Pours a clouded golden orange with some yellow hues. A decent frothed head retains for a while before leaving rings of spotty lacing around the glass.
A nice punch of citrus hops with grapefruit and orange, slight sweetness, and a bit of grainy malt in the nose. 
Plenty of juicy hops in the beginning with grapefruit bitterness. Sweetness from oranges and a touch of pineapple in between the dry hop assault. Biscuit and caramel malt stay in the background but help to balance out the hops. Finishes with another dose of staunch citrus and light sweetness. 
Medium body and carbonation, sticky and dry with an unusual yet pleasing creaminess on the palate with lingering feel. Drinks really well, the alcohol is nonexistent, and the flavors balance out nicely from top to bottom. This was my first beer from Hill Farmstead and I cannot wait to try another one. 892 charactersxnicknj, Feb 13, 2011

Growler courtesy of bring. Thanks a lot Barry. A growler of Double IPA, just the job! Poured into a snifter. 
A: Hazy yellowish orange with a soft creamy white head. Some pretty nice retention and scattered lacing. 
S: The aroma is pretty explosive, with big apricot, mango, and grapefruit notes. It's moderately floral, with a subtle candied quality. The hops are bright and juicy, and I can't take my nose out of the glass.
T: Massive fruit flavor, with mango, peach, apricot, orange, and grapefruit notes. The fruit is mostly flesh, but there's a touch of rind in there. Alcohol is well masked by the bold hop flavors. Malt provides a slight candied sweetness, but I can't really taste much aside from the hop character. The beer is moderately bitter with very little astringency.
M: Medium body with lower moderate carbonation. The mouthfeel is sticky and a bit odd - it's sort of mealy and granular and it reminds me of the texture you might find on a mango, a pear, or a peach.
Overall: Aside from the mouthfeel, I thought this was stellar. I guess Citra hops were substituted for Centennial in this batch, and they certainly leave their mark. It's ridiculously smooth and drinkable, and the hop aroma and flavor are excellent. 1,249 charactersHopHead84, Feb 12, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to jedwards for sharing. Served in a tulip. Pours a hazy caramel with a frothy, half inch, milky head that dissipates into a bubbly skim. Small spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Nose expresses citrus, a floral character and light toasted malts. Taste is earthy and floral with some light bittering at the finish. There's also a slightly tart and herbal quality in the mix. Mouthfeel is light-medium with a lively, crisp carbonation. I have to say that I found Abner to be really quite tasty and interesting, and one of the best domestic Farmhouse Ales I've had to date. That being said, I'm a bit surprised to see it characterized as a DIPA. Nonetheless, regardless of the style, it has great complexity and flavor. A truly wonderful beer. 761 charactersJwale73, Feb 12, 2011

A: The beer pours a cloudy orange color with a couple of fingers of cream colored head. Awesome sticky lacing to go with it.
S: Smells like fresh grapefruit and tons of pine. There's a slight woodiness to it, like rosemary, and a fair amount of grass. There is a bit of bread to the nose, but otherwise it's all hops.
T: Tastes like grapefruit too. Really fresh, vibrant, and juicy citrus flavor and a moderate pine bitterness on the finish. There are some grassy notes again and maybe a bit of a floral quality. A touch of bread to go with it all.
M: The body is medium with a moderate carbonation. Probably could be a bit higher, but that's what happens when you ship a growler from one corner of the country to another.
D: Hopefully all of the Hill Farmstead IPAs are similarly well done. Even with the alcohol content where it is, this is a dangerously easy to drink beer. 915 characterswomencantsail, Feb 12, 2011

Poured into a Lost Abbey tumbler, a burnt orange, slightly hazy, with a small off white bubbly head that sits at the edge of the glass. Huge grassy hop aroma, slightly resinous with a light straw like malt, only a hint of sweet malt. Taste is very hoppy and bitter, big grassy hops, pine resin, slightly earthy, some citrus, malty bread crust, some biscuit malts, sweet finish. Medium bodied with a light carbonation. A decent DIPA, but for the most part is just seems like a doubled up version of edward, which I prefer to this one. 601 charactersnkersten, Feb 11, 2011

A - Orangish body with some haze that had a nice foamy head. Decent retention as the head left some spots behind.
S - Citrus and floral hops, some earth tones, and a nice bitter quality. Slight hint of phenols or ethanol, but it's small enough that it doesn't really detract from the aroma.
T - Citrus and slightly tropical hop and sweetness notes. Pine is mostly in the form of resin, which is nicely bitter without becoming grating. Sweet caramel malts in a hop-foward beer.
M - Medium bodied with a nice dose of carbonation.
D - Pretty easy to drink, not my favorite DIPA ever, just slightly too sugary, but this is a good one that you can put down easily enough. 736 charactersAgentZero, Feb 07, 2011

A - Poured a hazy golden, orange-tinted body with a bright white pouf of foam on top that deposited some nice craggy lacing around the glass.
S - Pungent West Coast nose with a dominant grapefruit presence as well as a hint of pine and sweet malts. This sucker smells juicy! A hint of alcohol fume also creeps into the mix after the liquid warmed up a bit.
T - Juicy hops abound! Abner releases a fairly potent grapefruit blast, giving the flavor a bold citrus personality. A dousing of sticky, sweet pine complements the citrusy notes nicely. The sweet caramel notes offer a bit of balance to the otherwise full-on hop assault going on here. 
M - Medium bodied with a very oily texture and just a pinch of bristly carbonation, resulting in subtle effervescence. Finish is semi-dry with plenty of lingering bitterness on the palate and very little noticeable alcohol heat.
D - Abner is a really juicy hop bomb that hides his alcohol quite well. Great first impression of this brewery! 1,047 charactersffejherb, Feb 07, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a growler procured for me yesterday by jammalamma into a DFH shaped pint. The beer pours a hazy cloudy orange with a one finger bone white head. The head fades to a ring, leaving foamy, oily, resinous lacing. 
The smell is awesome. Sharp grapefruit, lemon rind, pine and mango. There is some candied sweetness buried way down deep, but it's completely overrun by juicy hops. 
The smell follows the hoppy nose lockstep. Loads of citrus fruit, mandarin oranges, pineapple, mango, grapefruit and lemon rind lead the charge. There's a slight break from the hop onslaught from some candied sugar sweetness, but it's quickly buried by the tangerine flavors followed by orange peel and pine bitterness. This is hops balanced by different hops and followed by more hops, and I like it. 
This one has a nice medium body and is well carbonated. It has a great dry/bitter finish that invites further drinking, the alcohol is never present and I'm definitely going to finish this growler alone. 
This is an awesome DIPA and I think it's the beer that has cemented Hill Farmstead as my favorite brewery.
**Edit. After having this on draft several times at the anniversary party I believe this is the best DIPA available. 1,224 charactersrpstevens, Feb 07, 2011

A - Pours with a few fingers of off-white foam that settle to a thin cap, leaving behind spotty lace. Hazy peach juice body.
S - This is more lemony and herbal than Edward was, with some light estery alcohol peeking through. Also some obvious citrus fruit goodness in there. Still, there's a perceivable relationship between the two (malt bill? yeast strain?). It's also much more hop-foward than I remember - perhaps the recipe has been tweaked since the summer, or perhaps this is just a fresh sample.
T - Taste is more orange and tropical fruits, with sufficient malt heft and a pleasant sugar cookie character to it. No obvious alcohol in the flavor. Bitterness is well-attenuated.
M - Smooth, hefty medium body. Pleasant carbonation, and some light alcohol warmth after a few glasses.
D - Fairly sessionable for an Imperial IPA. I liked this much better than the version I had on-tap at American Flatbread in Burlington, which tasted like Dogfish 90 Minute (which I also enjoy, but only when super-fresh). I'd certainly have this again, but I prefer Edward. 1,145 charactersMasterSki, Feb 06, 2011

Pours a super-hazy golden with a solid two finger head. Nose is blasted by grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, and hint of floral. This is like sticking my nose in a hop bag. The taste is perfectly balanced. There's a nice honey lemon sweetness up front, but the finish has a solid battering of bitter hops. This is pretty full bodied, but beautiful light carbonation. I couldn't slow down drinking of this brew. Hands down one of the best double IPAs I've ever had. 476 charactersChrisPro, Feb 06, 2011

Trying to work through a growler alone. I don't know if that is going to happen.
Poured into my new Hill Farmstead flute (thanks Steve, the glass is sic).
Pours 1/2 finger of off-white head. Decent retention leaving some nice lacing down the side. Color is a hazy burnt golden orange. A really nice hue of orange.
Aroma: Very fruity and hoppy. It has a nice mango and pineapple profile up front with a bit of grapefruit in the background. It is also very hoppy. I get a lot of pine with some floral notes as well. No malts... Oh yea!
Taste: The east coast is finally starting to pump out some good DIPAs. This has west coast flavors written all over it. All hops, no malts. Very bitter. Floral and piney. Pineapple, mangoes, and oranges all show with a touch of grapefruit citrus. Nice.
Mouthfeel: Bitter and bitter. This dipa is more bitter than a lot, but the fruits provided some sweetness to help it out. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Ends dry and sticky.
Overall, this is a great dipa. I am really enjoying all the hops and fruits and I love that it isn't malty. I thought I might be able to get through the entire growler, but I can feel the alcohol hit as I look and realize I am barely at the half way point. Still, I really like it and a couple pints is pretty easy to take down.

No hint of alcohol at all. Very tasty dipa. Great silky smooth mouth feel and perfect for the style in my opinion. I had 2 glasses and I would of had another couple if I had a DD with me.

Can't beat that with a stick! The beer pours a hazy deep straw color with about a finger of creamy white head. The aroma is simply divine. Deep blood orange and tropical fruit in the aroma with a great bitter grassy hop aroma to round out the nose. Really a nice balance of bitter and sweet on both the nose and the pallet. The flavor is a lot what the nose would lead it to be. Sweet candied grapefruit zest and orange juice to the front and it finishes nicely with a complex hop flavor. Kind of a sweet caramel finish to this one. The feel is a nice medium body with good carbonation. I'm impressed at how well this held up in the growler. Overall, it's tough to get better than this one for me. I wish this was as available as Pepsi. 846 charactersBendurgin, Feb 02, 2011

A big aroma, bursting with grapefruit, a bit of lemon and lots of pine. Even the empty growler smells good. 
Big citrusy hops taste, blending with resiny hops leading to a very pleasant bitter finish. Malt sweetness is present just to the extent of balancing but not detracting from the hops. 
Juicy, smooth and round mouthfeel with good carbonation. A bit of mild peppery character, but not at all detracting from the flavors.
This beer has very well integrated flavors that seem to take turns vying for attention. It is one of the most drinkable beers at this abv I have ever experienced. 697 charactersCliffBrake, Feb 01, 2011

Abner looks like juice with carbonation. A bright white head about 3/4 an inch up a bright white suds, semi condensed, down to a cap and leaving some stick on the side. The color is a mix of orange juice and tangerine look.
This smells incredible. It's so tropical. It's really bold. Citrus blasting out the ying yang with pineapple, mango, grapefruit, the regular cast of characters. A small malt base is detected with some warming but the alcohol isn't, lovely.
Abner is a mighty fine beer. This is certainly the best DIPA i've had from the east coast, this hits the marks. All the scents come together in the taste making way for a fruity, tropical, bitter, DIPA with class. A true winner. Im guessing a few of the c-hop varieties are in here, this is dry hopped apparently.
A bitter DIPA from the East, never in a million years did I think something on this level would be produced over here. Feel is bitter, medium, with enough malt to keep things in check, no problem on the carb, Im yearning for more. There are no coasts anymore, Abner is the one, go get it. 1,146 charactersBARFLYB, Jan 27, 2011

The flavor starts sweet and is followed by sharp pine. The finish is juicy and sweet with tropical fruit. This has a unique finish; not really crisp but juicy.
The carbonation held up well (the growler was filled three days ago). The body is light to medium. This is syper drinkable. Hope I can make the trek back to Vermont soon. 530 charactersandrewinski1, Jan 26, 2011

A- comes to me with a nice finger or so of bright white head that settles after a few to leave a nice smattering of lace around the glass and just the faintest of rings. Hazy sunset orange yellow in color with a glow that makes ya feel warm inside. 
S- wow wow we wow. This smells amazing. Mash a mango in your face then take a bite out of a tangerine, that's what were working with here. A touch of the super dank doobs for a second then a smooth roll into a floral honey like sweetness. 
T- loads of citrus and tropical fruits with mango, oranges, pineapple, finishing out with a good bite of grapefruit rind. Just about the fruitiest dipa I've had. Light touches of cut grass and a bit of a floral twist. Malts do just enough to keep things in check but never put a dent in the fruit. Dry biscuits and a bit o honey. 
M- just about perfectly mid level in the body department, like the perfect lady, just enough to hold on to but nothing more then you need. Carb is great with the bubbles hitting all the right spots but never going to far and blowing the body out of the water. 
D- that's a god damn good beer. I'd go to say its up there with the best and I've had the best. Baller as hell and so fucking drinkable. I'm in awe of this beer. 1,268 charactersoglmcdgl, Jan 26, 2011

Aroma is citrus and a hint of resin. It's a bright aroma, but not sharp. Not overbearing, but assertive.
Taste is a nice balance of citrusy hops and malt backbone with a bit of hop oil that lends a good mouthfeel. it ultimately finishes a little dry and tart with a tail end of the hop bitterness. 
Overall, a very drinkable, tasty IIPA. 521 charactersGatheringBrews, Jan 25, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4On tap at Hill Farmstead on November 4, 2010. Served in a Hill Farmstead wine glass. Thanks to Shaun for his incredible generosity for spending a good deal of time with us.
Pours a nice orange color with a bit of copper overtones. White head and some lacing. The nose is really nice with a good dose of citrus, orange, and some light pine. A touch of light grain in the background.
The flavor is nice with orange juice and a bit of rind. Some very light grapefruit as well. A touch of pine and spruce in the finish, which is nice and dry. Good carbonation levels and a nice bitterness. A really tasty brew. Thanks again, Shaun. 629 charactersThorpe429, Nov 14, 2010
4.48/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a Hill Farmstead swing top growler two days after acquisition at the Harvest Festival. Drank with a great dinner of roasted beets and Cabot cheddar alfredo Abner gave the meal complexity, refreshment, balance and completeness. 
The color is clear orange color with light gold tones. A thick white, decadent head plumes up to the top of the Hill Farmstead Euro glass and slowly resides into a sticky meringue cap. Yum. Lacing clings to the edges and pulls down throughout the rest of the drink as it follows the slowly descending cap of white foam. 
The aroma is on-the-one-hand luscious, sweet, and dank and on the other piney, ripe and citrus fresh. The smell is all about fresh, ripe hops with a warming balance of malt. 
The taste follows right behind the smell and improves on the hop party with a quenching citrus bite that moves to ripe tangerine and finishes with a piney bitterness twang. Oh Damn! That's good. 
Really nice mouthfeel. Light with just enough body to carry the weight of those hops. Super soft, smooth but very well developed carbonation.
Not since 90 Min came onto the scene has the East Coast seen such an upping-of-the-ante in hopped beers. 
Thank you. 1,196 charactersNoLiberty, Oct 05, 2010
4.54/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Growler brought back from autumn fest- thanks Scott!!! Pours a bright, clear orange with a thin white head. Smells like HOPS!!! Tons of citrus. Good god, like a west coast gem, but from the VT!!!! Taste is similar - a nice citrusy start but with a fairly bitter finish. Just wonderful! Thin, light mouthfeel. Can't wait to get more of this, along with the other HF beers! 371 charactersDrDogbeer, Oct 05, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52 liter "genie" shaped swing-top growler into an oversized tulip glass.
Pours a crystal clear copper right out of the gate, with 2 rich fingers of bright-white head. This shrinks down considerably but hangs tough with a solid ½ finger that leaves a robust cascade of spotty and foamy lacing all over the sides of the glass. The aroma is leafy and herbal smelling, punctuated with sharp pangs of pine and spice that are then layered on top of notes of grapefruit, earth, and citrus peel. Toasted bread and sugars hang on the edges, helping even things out the nose. This is all about the hop flavors though, with a bold freshness to them that are fantastic. Great DIPA aroma here. 
The bitterness of the taste starts out with a big juicy base of grapefruit but much of the sharper aspects of this are coming from some STRONG pine resins, spice, and aggressive citrus rind grittiness. More herbal tones add some soft mellowness to this, while notes of light toast and honeyed sweetness provide an awesome balance here that is right in tune with those bright hoppy flavors. Bitterness rocks the finish of this with pine and spice in particular really lying on the palate thick. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, maybe a touch fuller in the mouth, with a crispness up front that prickles the tip of the tongue before melding into a smooth slickness that rolls across the mouth. The oily slickness here really compliments that fresh hop character here. Very, very, light warmth overall for an 8% beer, basically just adding a larger presence to the body that matches those full flavors, and dishing up absolutely zero alcohol flavors of any kind. 
Wow, just another fantastic hopped-up offering here from Hill Farmstead, with bold hop flavors, impeccable balance, and a ridiculous drinkibility for the size. This took a little bit to work its magic on me but once I got into that second glass, I was a believer. I hate to sound like a full-blown mark for this new brewery, but man, I really do think that these beers are that good. 2,028 charactersKegatron, Sep 30, 2010

4.35/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Acquired yesterday fresh and poured into the Hill Farmstead tasting glass, revealing a clear deep gold body under a tall white head. Pretty colors, some lacing. Smells like serious hops with a good floral, grassy-cool citrus presence and a little honey.
Tastes appropriately bitter with a nice grassy character and a little grapefruit rind. The flavor has a nice peppery bite to it. Otherwise, a little meatiness and a slight floral nectar-type sweetness fold out at the end. The taste is overall very clean and very distinct with no unappealing anything. Mouthfeel is a little dry from the bitterness, a little smooth from the malt backbone. On the lighter side of medium-bodied. decently drinkable.
Overall I really like it. I'll try this one again. 753 charactersabuliarose, Sep 18, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Hill Farmstead tasting glass. Beautiful, slightly hazy orange body with a thin white head on top. Suds cling to the glass leaving some delicate lacing behind. Looks pretty good for a DIPA.
Swirling the glass reveals sweet citrus notes, orange wedge, a touch of pine and sweet maltiness.
Pine bitterness on the tongue with orange. Grassy hops mixed with a good bready malt backbone. Nicely balanced between the malts and hops with some good lingering bitterness after the finish. Its got everything one would look for in the style.
Mouthfeel is smooth and crisp with adequate carbonation. Lots of tasty hop bitterness in this DIPA. Slightly chewy, but still refreshing. ABV is unnoticeable. 
Drinkability is great. This is one tasty DIPA. Lots of hops, some citrus notes and a good malt backbone to hold it all together without taking away from the hops. Shaun has done a great job with this beer and Vermont is really stepping up their game in the DIPA department. With Head Topper from the Alchemist, Hopzilla from Lawson's and now Abner, I think California has some good competition. Definitely grab a growler of this if you can. Highly recommended. 1,169 characterssisuspeed, Sep 18, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -5.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz tulip at Farmhouse Tap & Grill, Burlington.
Crystal clear with thin off-white head that leaves major spotting. Aroma is dominated by pine and earthy leaf notes. West-Coast in smell. Some faint caramel peaks through.
Palate is medium-bodied and tight with killer bitterness and some residual sugar. Leafy, pine-y, citrus bomb on top of some medium caramel maltiness. It's East-Coast in style but not as much residual sugar as Dogfish 60 Minute or Southern Tier UnEarthly.
Super clean and wonderfully bitter, but balanced. The 8.2 is hidden like a Westy 12 in a carry-on bag. Dank and delightful. Well done, Shaun! 620 charactersSFLpunk, Jun 24, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours a beautiful golden color with a thin head into my glass.
Aroma is full of a bouquet of grassy, citrusy hops that don't overpower but rather hint at the taste within.
Taste is full of crisp, grapefruit-like hops with a hint of grassiness and dryness to it. They proceed to envelope the taste buds.
Mouthfeel is dry with a nice lingering of grassy hops. Nothing harsh.
Well-balanced and subtle. It takes skill to make this style enjoyable from the tap and nothing is spared in the end result. Rivals the Alchemist. 522 charactersBrad007, Jun 22, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Time to revisit this beer; my review from the first batch appears below.
Enjoyed (a couple) on tap at Frida's in Stowe.
A: Hazy light orange color with a medium size sticky head.
S: Wonderful citrusy hops with floral and dank notes in the background. Like sniffing fresh hop cones. Malt is also perceptible. A hint of alcohol, but tough to pick out from hop aroma. Very clean.
T: More of the same; powerful citrus/herbal hops held up by fairly substantial malt backbone. Clean finish with sweet malt and hop bitterness coming together. Alcohol is fairly hidden but blends well with hops when noticed.
M: Wonderful. Starts full bodied and finishes pleasantly dry. Everything blends perfectly. Could drink this all night, or at least until I lost consciousness.
O: Another world class HF beer. Shaun obviously worked on this beer and improved it substantially from its initial form (not that it wasn't pretty damn good 2 years ago...).
(OLD REVIEW, MAY 2010):
On tap at the grand opening. Pours a dark golden color with hints of orange, slightly hazy. Piney hops in the nose with a hint of malt. High hop bitterness backed up by some body and high hop flavor; slight grassy/vegetal notes. Alcohol is somewhat hidden but detectable. Finishes well and hops linger on the tongue. Tasty and enjoyable, but not quite as complex as Edward, IMO. 1,343 charactersskivtjerry, Jun 10, 2010

ORIGINAL REVIEW: 4.11
Growler received in a trade with the ever generous MtGoat thanks!
Appearance: Pours a hazy goldfish orange with honey folds and a 1 finger white crown that shows little retention or lace.
Smell: A touch of sweet malt over floral hops and citrus hops. I but more subdued than I was expecting considering how blown away I was by Edward IPA.
Taste: Grassy and herbal introduction with moderate bitterness, followed by a touch of malt sweetness, and ending with a decently bitter finish. There really isn't much citrus hop presence...just a touch of grapefruit and a dash of tangelo orange presence.
Mouthfeel: A bit undercarbonated but this growler was filled about 10 days ago so that might have played a role.
Drinkability: No real problem getting this one down.
I think this one is worth another sample (mainly to see if the age of my growler played a part in my tasting experience) but I'm not even close to liking this as much as the Edward IPA. 1,021 characterskoopa, Jun 08, 2010
