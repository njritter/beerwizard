4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12oz bottle into a Westvleteren goblet. Purchased at The Bottle Shop in Brugge, Belgium. 
Pours a muddy brown body with pretty heavy sediment and a frothy, thick off-white head that reduces very slowly, eventually leaving a one finger layer of retention and thick lacing. 
Aromas are sweet with molasses, raisins, dark fruit, toffee, a little metallic, roasty malt, and candied sugar. 
On the tongue is a lightly sweet maltyness, candied Belgian sugar, lots of molasses and brown sugar as the nose suggested, followed by lightly roasted malt and raisins, finishing with dark fruits and fig. Mouthfeel is superb, this is very drinkable for 8%, medium-low carbonation with a medium-heavy rich body. 
As good as expected, one of the best representations of the Dubbel style with no off taste whatsoever. 818 charactersgcamparone, Mar 13, 2017

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - The beer was murky brown in color with hazy highlights and mocha colored bubbles.
Smell - The beer had a smooth malty nose. 
Taste - I initially noted that the beer was somewhat perfume. I detected notes of incense, chai, and a fairly strong grape presence. The beer was not entirely malty, But had that for presence. Grapes come through more strongly in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel - The beer was smooth, going down easy with little carbonation.
Overall - I feel like this is a great tripel, not too heavy on the yeast and very smooth. Certainly worth seeking 575 charactersJohnnyHopps, Dec 23, 2016

O:	
Very good.  
This is a medium sweet beer as far as some dubbels go as far as I am concerned.  There is a noticeable woody, earthy, herbal gash in the middle of it that makes it nice and stand out from something like Westmalle (my personal favorite).  It still has the delicious cherry-mud taste that classics have.  I would be really curious to try a fresher bottle as I feel like it might be a little more cohesive and smooth.  
Good overall, though.  (4.25) 954 charactersTheDoctor, Nov 24, 2016

Taste is dark wheat and pumpernickel bread, caramel, raisin and a bit of alcohol burn at the end. The layers of flavor here are so much deeper than any other dubbel I have ever had. Sweet medium bodied, with high carbonation.  I like quads better that dubbels by nature, but this is better than Westy 12.  This is the best Belgian beer I have ever had and right up there with my all time favorites.  Get this one. 468 characterstigg924, Nov 11, 2016

Auburn copper color.  Can't really see through it.  Thin head.  
Smells amazing.  Kind of a candied plum smell.  So good.  As it warmed more breadiness and clove created in.
Taste brings in the other flavors you'd expect like cloves, banana, and bread yeast, along with the candied plums.
Smooth and well carbonated mouthfeel with a bit of a lingering finish.  
Terrific beer.  Those monks know what they're doing. 480 charactersWolberjs, Oct 02, 2016

4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Looks like it should. It's bottle conditioned so little floaty things are acceptable. Smells like heaven. Taste was sweet and fruity, with some typical Belgian banana clove stuff going on. The feel was a little sharp from carbonation, which I thought was a little over the top.
Great beer, easy to knock back, but should be respected even with the slightly lower ABV compared to other big name beers out there. 410 charactersGeeL, Aug 23, 2016
4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Appearance: brown with reddish hues and beige creamy head. Great lacing and retention. Lots of carbonation.
Aroma: when its cooler smells boozy. After it warms up, black raisins, spices, bready and caramel.
Taste: caramelized and spiced black raisins with a bready touch. Sweet and very little hops.
Mouthfeel: pretty strong carbonation. After it calms down it goes down sweet and has a spicy slightly bitter aftertaste.
Overall: after reading such good reviews I thought it was going to be a mind-blowing beer, but I think it's a very good beer, although Dubbels are not my prefered style. For what it is, I think it's overpriced, considering you can get Chimay Red 6 times cheaper, for example, and they're pretty similar beers. 734 charactersjamesroses, Aug 23, 2016

Smells like caramel, banana, dried raisins, spiced bread, slight red wine, and a slight hop bitterness.
This is another crazy good beer from those wizard-like monks at St. Sixtus. There's a lot going on here, with candied, dried fruit, spicy and sweet breadiness, dark fruit (particularly raisins), light spice, and a hint of red wine. This is wonderful- so much going on here.
This is medium bodied, fairly rich and creamy, with a good level of carbonation- not too high.
This is another amazing beer from this brewery. This isn't all that unexpected, though. 650 charactersGreesyFizeek, Aug 20, 2016

4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25A 330ml bottle with a sell-by date that has unfortunately rubbed off. Poured into a Chimay goblet glass.
Appearance: It poured a dark brown colour with some small sediment bits despite a careful pour. There was a one finger beige head that had pretty good retention and eventually settled to a nice thin but puffy cap and nice curtain like lacing.
Aroma: Strong dark fruits of plum, prunes, raisin, fig with hints of dark cherry and toffee.
Taste: Like the aroma, there is lots of dark fruit with raisin, dark cherry and prunes dominating. There’s also some plum, fig, brown sugar and a touch of alcohol that’s not overpowering.
Mouthfeel: Creamy, medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
Overall: It’s a very nice Dubbel. Great dark fruit flavours and very balanced. Interestingly though, after trying both many times, I am still leaning towards enjoying Westmalle Dubbel just that slight bit more. 910 characterskitch, Jul 10, 2016

S: Nice aroma, raisins, fig.
T: Good taste but nothing even close to Westvleteren 12. Extremely high carbonation so good idea is to let the beer in the glass for a few minutes to "calm down". Then tastes ten times better :)
F: Carbonation, carbonation, carbonation.

I know Westy ages well but my hopes aren't super high for this one.  Beautiful head and lacing.  I'm choosing not to dock the look score for the massive quantity of large, dark chunks floating around in the beer which I assume are just due to the aging.  Smell and taste are both world class, I can't think of better dubbel.  Besides the appearance it's hard to believe this is 4 years old, there isn't any noticeable oxidization and everything still tastes similar to what I'd expect it to taste like fresh.  Exceeded my high expectations. 600 charactersDactrius, May 27, 2016

Found it @ a bar in Ghent for less and drank every bottle they had. Enjoyed it more than the XII. Seek this beer out, sell your 1st born of one, it's worth it. 387 charactersd3brewing, May 14, 2016

Aroma has prominent notes of dark fruit, banana, caramel, molasses, and cola. The flavor presents much of the same but 8's golden triumph (like the rest of the Westy beers) is its ability to balance sweetness and dryness. It doesn't leave that lingering sweetness that often bothers my palate. Alcohol is very soft as is the mouthfeel. My least favorite of the three but still the best Dubbel I have ever had. 453 charactersVelvetExtract, Apr 26, 2016

Aroma and taste is very complex with lots of raisins, prunes, figs, honey, yeast, cherries, brandy, candy and apples coming through. Balance is amazing and finish is nice, with a spicy, dryness.

Raisins, dark caramel, molasses, burnt sugar, and a hint of fig on the first whiff. Unlike the XII, the alcohol is actually present on the aroma, but not in an unpleasant way. Clove, cherries, and fruity esters surface on the back end and become more pronounced with time and temperature.
Candi sugar leads the charge, followed closely by raisins and dark fruits on the palate. The booze kind of lets off an astringent peppery sensation, which again, isn't unpleasant in any way. The clove and an apple-like after taste lingers with each sip, with the dark fruits kind of fading away as you let it sit.
Medium body and moderately effervescent. Boozy but not hot to the touch, like you'd expect from a classic dubbel. 773 charactersamano_h, Feb 19, 2016

Cheers to Goblinmunkey7 for the share and big thanks to BigRedDog for throwing this in as an extra
A: Dark amber to reddish brown - murky and cloudy - pours with a creamy, fluffy, with a light tan head - large to start, fades to medium, retains a cap forever - leaves webs and streaks of lacing
S: Remarkably fruity and bready, more or less could pass for a bread with dart fruit (raisin bread, maybe) - caramel malts, dark caramel, caramelized malts, molasses, brown sugar, raw sugar - an array of dark fruits, raisins, figs, and plums - again, raisin bread - Belgian yeast, clove, banana, some musty funk - candi sugar sweetness - mostly well-rounded, not a ton of booze
T: Like drinking a holiday bread - Belgian yeast flavors, pepper, yeasty funk, clove, banana, green apple - dark fruits, grapes, raisins, figs, plums - caramel and amber malts - light and dark bread with a touch of biscuit - honey, molasses, dark caramel, candi sugar - touch of alcohol to round things out
M: On the heavy side of medium, super smooth, creamy, clean
O: Magic bread smoothie
I've been dying to try this beer for years, but apparently I was too lazy to actually trade for it. This is a supreme example of a Dubbel. It's not substantially better than more common examples of the style (Westmalle Trappist Dubbel, for example), but it's definitely special. I'm glad to have had the opportunity. 1,424 charactersangrybabboon, Jan 03, 2016

Appearance: Dark reddish brown with a slight chill haze. Head is a soft medium khaki with an initial super fluffy and creamy cap. Drops to a small fizzy cap that leaves a few wisps after a few minutes. Minimal lacing, Moderate to high carbonation on the pour. 
Smell: Typical dark fruit. Raisin, cherry, and some fig. Moderately aggressive alcohol. Slightly sharp and spicy. Some solid caramelized malt sweetness. a touch of brown bread. Hints of clove and stone. Boozy raisin and cherry. Some mild fruity esters as well. Incredibly balanced and soft.
Taste:  Brown sugar and candi sugar right up front. Gives way to a ton of raisin and dark cherry. Some fig and plum. Solidly fruity. Alcohol throws a ton of associated peppery character with some strong yeast esters. Soft apple character with some mild hints of clove. Warming throws even more alcohol. Some of the dark fruit drops out and lets the peppery character of the yeast and alcohol slide over the top. Hyper true to style if a bit aggressive with the alcohol.
Mouthfeel: Slightly creamy on the initial sip with a medium body and moderate carbonation. Clean and ever so slightly almost crisp.
Overall: Yup, it's a winner.
The biggest issue with this beer is the overpresence of the alcohol. Outside of that it's immaculately crafted and easy drinking. 1,385 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Dec 27, 2015

Body is a much lighter color than 12, but still a nice dark caramel color. What I really like about it though is the big malted barley aroma I’m getting. Also nice fresh hop smell. Taste, this beer is very balanced. Caramel malts meld perfectly with the slightly bitter hops. Not my favorite beer of all time, but probably what I would call the perfect beer. 460 characterskkleu357, Dec 15, 2015

Spritzy and sharp it delivers a lot of candied fruit and sugary fructose. Raisins, cotton candy, cherry cough syrup, black licorice, Pez candies and a bit of sassafras or Heather.  May just not be my style. 229 charactersKYGunner, Nov 26, 2015

A: Pours a dark brown with a one finger beige head. Good head retention and some lacing. There are a number of floaties. 
S: Sweet rich malt, an almost nut-like character, some vanilla, toffee, and some dark fruits (mostly raisin). Super complex.
T: Sweet malt first, then some dark fruits and yeast character - spicey. It has a slight woody flavor as well. 
M: Very smooth. Medium-light body, with medium level of carbonation, a little higher than i expected. Coats the mouth nicely. Does a very good job of hiding that 8% ABV 564 charactersBrewhemoth, Sep 11, 2015

Murky mahogany brown pour with a two finger beige head with nice retention and great lacing.  Somewhat subdued nose with hints of brown bread, dark fruit, subtle vanilla, rust, and toffee.  The taste is much bolder than the nose suggested, with hints of almond, dark fruits, vanilla, brown bread, subtle cocoa, molasses, and cloves.  The mouthfeel is medium bodied with perfect carbonation, nice balance, and good drinkability.  Overall, this has held up really well in the cellar, and I think it's actually improved.  No signs of oxidation at all, and hugely drinkable.  Definitely giving the 12 a run for its money! 729 charactersbeerdrifter, Jul 26, 2015

Another absolutely amazing beer from Westvleteren, they're two for two now & I'll hopefully get to try the third beer in the roster sometime in the near future to find out if they can manage the clean sweep. This one was quite a sweet beer with a lot of dark fruits & caramel but the balance remained great & it was a pleasure to drink with a nice alcohol kick giving the beer a warming feel towards the end; excellent stuff. 479 charactersflyingpig, May 15, 2015
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42015-05-11
330ml bottle poured into a tiny hotel glass in Brussels. Date on the cap is 30.10.17.
Pours dark brown with a huge head that fades fast and leaves a thin layer. Pretty strongly carbonated.
Smell is dark fruit and plum. Somewhat mild.
Taste is lighter than Westvleteren 12 -- bitterer. Similar taste profile, though. Like a light Westvleteren 12. Maybe more of a burnt sugar flavor.
Mouthfeel is light and pleasant. Overall, very good. 449 characterssnaotheus, May 14, 2015

Lots of sediment. Beige cap and collar on a murky brownish red colored body.
Aroma of figs and raisins. Perhaps some brown sugar.
Taste is muted when compared to the nose. Slight dark fruitiness. Signs of oxidation.
Smooth mouthfeel, low carbonation.
Enjoyed this one although I probably held on to it too long. Glad to try. 401 charactersDuff27, May 01, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This beer makes me happy. I was lucky enough to get two cases at the abbey, and have tried a few fresh and am letting the bulk age. This is a wonderfully complex beer. The nose and taste have layers of flavor including expresso, burnt caramel, dried fruit, great yeast notes, and others. Nice long finish.  It is hard to deny the challenge of getting this in the first place adds to the feeling when you drink it as well.  After tasting the 12 as well, i agree with many other that this is a more drinkable cousin. I have no issue saying this is the best dubbel out there.  Thank God I have more. 596 characterscaptaincoffee, Apr 22, 2015

The mouth is moderately carbonated and that in turn prickles your tongue, it is also dry and warming to your throat. 382 charactersFranziskaner, Mar 21, 2015

Appearance is about as perfect as it gets for the style. Nice fluffy tan head, deep mahogany colored, and a gorgeous clear body giving the impression of a deep colored jewel.
Aroma is a bit subdued compared to say the Rochefort 8. But you get those lovely rum raisin, fig, date, and gooey dark caramel notes so prized in the trappist darks. 
Taste is downright seductive. The dark fruits are very dry, you get some Caribbean Rum, soft cocoa powder, grade B maple syrup, Palo Santo wood, and hints of sherry. Such a tasty treat and not as sweet in nature as others.
Mouthfeel sports a body in the light range but the fluffy carbonation makes it feel a bit heavier. That same fluffy carbonation gives the beer a creaminess that is what elevates this to a world class mouthfeel. Just silky and glides through the plate. So dangerously smooth. 
This is outstanding. The more I drink this and Westy 12 I am convinced that they reign along with Rochefort in the trappist ale category. As well as the belgian dark category in general. Beer brewed with passion, get some. 1,106 charactersMarcWP, Nov 13, 2014

Aromas are defined by chocolate, malts, toffee and hints of coffee. 
Very warm, alcoholic, malty beginning with plums and raisins. Fitting carbonation, helping the beer from becoming too heavy. Malt, in comparison to other Brunes, isn’t too sweet, gets mixed up with an enjoyable, spicy bitterness. Earthy, bready and warm malts define this beer, wrapped up in honey, as the beer warms up. Great balance, decent complexity, smooth mouthfeel, medium body. 504 charactersaleigator, Oct 29, 2014

4.03/5  rDev -10%Bottle purchased in Bruges and poured safely back home in Florida. Pours murky dark brownish purple with a massive light khaki head that sticks around. Aroma is dry funky barnyard yeast, surprisingly grassy, light spices, with low sweetness on the nose but for some raisins and figs. Flavor begins with a punch of sweet figs and pears and raisins balanced by a crisp grassy hop finish. Plenty of dry barnyard funk here from the yeast. Medium bodied but lightened up considerably by the high carbonation, crisp, with a dry finish. Definitely lighter than its 12 counterpart. Overall a very nice brew but maybe not quite living up to the considerable price tag. Worth trying, but don't kill yourself over it. 706 charactersBMMillsy, Sep 24, 2014

4.29/5  rDev -4.2%Appearance: A chestnut brown, with a pale, eggshell-white head. Very creamy head, and it lasts a while. 
Smell: Dark fruits, dates specifically, brown sugar and pale syrup. Definitely smells sweet, and dark in the way that Belgians tend to be. 
Taste: Sweet, dark fruits, hints of caramel. Belgian sugar comes through a lot too, obviously. 
Mouthfeel: Thick, creamy, and sticky, lower carb than with the Westy Blonde. Still works beautifully for the beer though.
Overall: Another solid, exceptional example of what a Belgian dubbel should be. Those monks know what they’re doing. 585 charactersWTKeene, Aug 20, 2014

Poured into a new belgium tulip to reveal a thick, foamy head. The aroma reveals some citrus notes. It is decent dubbel that is easy to drink, but doesn't exactly stand out.
I would struggle to identify this in a blind taste test against other belgian-style beers. I can't see any characteristics that explain what makes it unique. I have a feeling that I should not have tried it alongside the other two quads as they seemed to over power it a little.
Edit: Tried it again at Abbey St. Sixtus along with the 12 and the Blonde and this was my favorite of the three. Definitely better this time around. Loved it. 686 charactersPrinceDarren, Jul 25, 2014

On the palate, it's just ever so much a disappointment. The body feels a little thin, and the metallic note comes to the fore. What's there is really excellent, a round, nutty sweetness with an herb-tinged bitterness.
One of the best aromas on a dubbel I've ever had, but not one I'd make a particular effort to seek out, and didn't love nearly as much as the quad or the pale. 524 characterserrantnight, Jul 03, 2014

A- Dark brown body. Despite it not being black, this is a very opaque and dark beer. Comes with a thick, substantial two-finger offwhite head with fair retention; it drops quickly into a thick, frothy collar that remains for a good while. Some lacing. Darker and more opaque than I expected from the style; looks an awful lot like it's bigger brother, Westvleteren 12.
S- Dark fruits galore along with a good bit of caramel and toffee. There is a strong contingent of plums and dates that is very pleasing. Some dark chocolate, Belgian candi sugar, caramel and toffee. Even a bit of a distinct yeast scent. It's a very sweet smelling beer with a lot of complexity. Very nice.
F- Similar to the nose for once; but not quite as sweet. It's just as interesting, though. Plum, date, chocolate covered cherry, Belgian candi sugar, toffee, caramel and some dark chocolate. A little bit of molasses. Sweet and even a bit spicy with some yeast esters. On the backend, there is a fascinating grape juice-like sweet finish. Very complex palate.
M- Medium bodied, smooth and silky, quite resinous but somewhat dry. Very easy drinker with a lot of complexity and plenty of bubbles. Finish is grape juice tempered by some yeast esters. 
O- Easily the best dubbel I've had. Very complex in both the nose and palate, with a very good mouthfeel. Reminds me a lot of Westvleteren 12 in its flavour profile, but quite a bit more drinkable. 1,502 charactersStevedore, Jun 19, 2014

4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance- Pours up a good amount of head which has excellent retention. The head is a light beige with hints of khaki while the body is a dark amber with hints of maroon and chestnut that shows as a hazy dark amber in the light. Leaves some lacing behind. 
Nose- Very vinous and very sweet- almost syrupy if an aroma can be that. Lots of red grapes followed by plums and other dark red fruits. Maybe some grain. Swirling doesn't add much to the picture. Maybe little bits of leather but this isn't as complex as I expected it to be. I does not lack presence, however. Light citrus notes (orange primarily). Some other stone fruit, peaches. 
Taste- Very reflective of the nose and seems to have a lot in common with its elder brother. Lots of vinosity and heavy grapes. Some plums. Spiciness on the finish. Some banana and coriander. A tiny bit of woody bitterness. Some raisins as well. Closer to the style of dubbel that I like but this does not seem to have the complexity of Westmalle (but that may be my favorite dubbel of all time.) Nice yeastiness and some cloves on the finish. A little bit of ash but I wish there was some leather, chocolate, and tobacco. A really good beer but there is nothing at the moment that indicates a great beer. 
Mouthfeel- A little less than medium bodied with light carbonation and a nice dry finish. Maybe a slight hint of syrup.
Drinkability- Very easygoing but as I wrote before, lacks the complexity I expected. And because of that I will never pay the price that I did for this beer ever again. It was worth it to check this off the list though. 
Overall- Really good beer that is one of the best in its style but just doesn't quite have what it takes to be one of the great ones. I don't even really understand this beer's placement in the top 250. But I also wasn't terribly impressed with 12 either. I'm sure some of it's the hype and some of it's differing taste buds. But if you have the money to blow, I would say give this a try. At least you'll be able to say you did. 2,025 charactersartoolemomo, Jun 15, 2014

4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.25355ml bottle poured into a Trappist Westvleteren chalice.
The beer pours a deep burgundy color, hues of dark amber with some garnet highlights, fair opacity with a soft, fizzy and foamy bone colored head that has moderate retention and leaves little lace behind. The aroma is wonderful, lots of big yeasty fruit, fig, raisin, plum and cherry with plenty of rich, malted barley, some spice character, like an allspice component with a nice helping of brown and candi sugars. The flavors match very well, plenty of fruit, predominantly raisin and plum, heaps of rich malt flavor with a nice spice layer that blends the fruit and the malt so well while brown sugar is not forgotten and sweeps over the finish with some noticeable alcohol. The body is super crisp and lively, loads of zip that coats the mouth wonderfully well and finishes softly but full of energy.
Verdict: A masterful take on the dubbel and perhaps the best in show for that style, hard to find another contender this complex and well rounded. The balance is spot on and the depth and complexity of the flavors is inspired. The monks certainly know how to make a fine ale. 1,140 characterskevanb, May 28, 2014

4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle. Pours a murky amber, topped with a thin yet bubbly tan head. This retains with some light ringing that leaves back a smattering of spotty lace down the sides of the glass. The aroma smells of ripe fruit, spice and sweet sugars. A smidge of light alcohol, roast and some darker fruit character add some edge to the nose as well. The taste pretty much mirrors the aroma, with a rich and flavorful mix of tropical and dark fruits, toffee and brown sugar. Spice works itself into the profile effortlessly, giving things a zesty edge that lingers on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a soft crispness to the carbonation. Just a touch of alcohol heft sits underneath but overall, this is extremely smooth in the mouth for an 8% beer. This is a really impeccable Dubbel, with a richness and smoothness to the flavors, which just knocks it out of the park. Fantastic beer! 892 charactersKegatron, Apr 24, 2014

Pours basically a brown (dark brown though), with totally white fizzy head and lacing. Lacing is quite resilient.
First off smell is Belgian yeast- those tropical fruit notes and mango, almost like a lighter coloured beer. There's also a strong savouriness to this beer- a similar quality that I remember the 12 having in relation to other beers of its style. Heavily yeasty like the 12 and the yeast notes again remind me of celery. A slightly sour paw paw note and strong yeasty breadiness. Little bit of alcohol. Apple. When I pour the second half of the bottle (presumably including the yeast) in, the funky meaty paw paw notes increase, making for a better beer on the whole. Definite fig.
Taste is very dry- bready, yeasty. More paw paw and general tropical fruits throughout. Finishes with quite a bit of bite, almost a little astringently alcoholic at times.
Mouthfeel improves substantially after I pour the entirety of the bottle in the glass- it becomes extremely umami-ish and satisfying.
This is certainly a well-made, solid and dry beer. I'd go so far as to say it's easily one of the best BSDAs I've ever had. Not sure it quite deserves the hype in relation to beers of certain other styles however. If/when I drink future Westys I will try to get them with more age on them, as that is supposed to improve them substantially. 1,372 charactersdanieelol, Mar 19, 2014

Deep chestnut brown; a bit murky. Aromas of sweet malts, fruity yeast, brown sugar and dark fruit -particularly raisin. The taste mirrors the aroma with some brightness in the malt from the creamy carbonation. The mouthfeel is excellent with an oily viscous feel. The only mark against this beer is some slight solvent alcohol flavor on the finish. 385 charactersbrianmandell, Mar 12, 2014

My Birthday Banger. 
This one surprised me!
Ap - Deep chestnut brown, with lighter hues shining through the edges with a light source. Head is constant, off-white that leaves nice scattered lace. There is a hint of sediment, I mean flavor sparkles, in there if you look for it. 
Ar - Simple. Perfect. Bready, light malty, subtle sweet cocoa, and dark fruit. 
T - Similar to the aroma. There is a noticeable amount of a banana taffy flavor and more raisin, or plum in the middle. So clean. 
M - Perfect. Next...
O - Wow! Completely blown away. Not expecting this quality. If you aren't a fan of Belgian style beers, this isn't for you. Perfection. This is amazing!

Has to be the biggest dubbel I have tried. The usual dubbel Belgian yeast, molasses and brown sugar morph more into almost quad territory, with christmas cake notes. Big big flavour and aftertaste. The 8% is very well hidden, and only slightly warming.
I had an open mind, and was maybe expecting the hype train to be in full swing, but was pleasantly surpised to find that everything folks say about Westy is true. Top stuff. 498 charactersheygeebee, Mar 05, 2014

4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5soft pour, huge head and tons of bubbles fizzing up from below the head. dark mahogany certainly does do the color justice as a descriptor.
I left this a bit warm, or rather, not chilled as someone recommended it to me that way. just a little bit in the frig to take it down a notch. the darker fruits come to the nose and the tongue. plum, fig, raisin. slightly spicy, but from the yeast. someone else mentioned brandied cherries and I think that is a great way to explain the aroma and taste along with the fruit. I have stayed away from the Belgian brews for quite a while as I was tiring of the rich yeastiness but this reminds me of my other favorites- the st. bernardus, and the rochefort, not quite the same as I remember now but very nice. very smooth. very stable. awesome head. beautiful tannish lace. 2nd pour is on top of the last bit in the glass is ultra creamy and thick enough to hold the sediment on top. taking a slight break I notice the head has risen toward the top of my tulip glass. it is GROWING. like bread. this is awesome! slight torch from the alcohol although it is more like a 'spirit' than a 'burn'. it seems much stronger than 8%, for sure. brown sugar, more dark fruit and more alcohol on the second half of this bottle. the liquid is not heavy, as I might expect for a higher abv. what a very wonderful brew. 
pour is simply beautiful. the taste has to be as close to perfection as I have had, although I readily admit I rate most beers higher than others (it's all good, right?). I love how the brew is light and fluid yet firm enough to hold the still floating sediment on the top thin layer. i'm not intimidated by the degree of difficulty in obtaining this brew, or at least not reflecting it in the rating. I believe this is a great specimen and I wish there were more available. 1,818 characterspkalix, Feb 23, 2014

O - Well, its a great pleasure again to drink and review this beer, in particular on xmas day. Still one of my favourite beers and although I believe it is inferior to the 12 it i s still a great complex and delicious beer to consume. Highly recommend 687 charactersPolarBear3, Dec 25, 2013

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Mostly opaque, dark mahogany color. Nice head formation with good retention. Lacing is there, but it's only spotty. Smells rich and malty but not very sweet. Dark toffee and toasted grain at first, then notes of plum and raisin.
Richly malty and only a touch sweet. Raisin and pear, maybe some ripened red grapes in there, too. Well carbonated but soft, even silky. Candi sugar is there but it's very minimal. Yeast character is present through some clove flavor. 
Excellent, but not head and shoulders above others in the style as the scores would suggest. With the robust maltiness and restrained sweetness, I find that Westy 8 is quite similar to Ommegang Abbey Ale. 671 charactersgr0g, Dec 23, 2013

Westy glass
A: Pours a hazy chestnut brown color. There is light that gets through it. Bright around the edges. Thin layer of light tan head. Mostly a collar.
S: Nice dark fruit character. Raisin. Prune. Fig. Some rum soaked raisin. Biscuity Belgian notes from the yeast.
T: This is very nice. Initially getting hints of grape juice almost. Then some of the dark fruit: raisin and fig. It's very easy to drink compared to a quad. Thinner. Finish is lingering fig and mild prune.

S: Cherries, aromatic, floral complexity, dark fruits- especially figs.
T: Now I see why its so highly rated. Cherries and dark fruits with a light sweetness, liquorice finnish with a long lasting mild bitter taste that is in harmony with the beer as a whole. 
M: Amazingly smooth, medium body, lots of fine foamy carbonation.
O: I don’t smoke but could see a cigar pairing well with this beer. I think it’s the overall composition with the mouthfeel, head retention, scent and taste that make this beer one of the world’s most sought after beers. I went to In De Verde and picked up a case of 6 less than 2 weeks ago. Love it, refined classic brew that will keep you sipping.  I tried my second of this batch in Chiang Mai, May 8th, 2017.  The BBD day was Oct, 2016, but its holding up great.  Cherry taste is muted in comparison after 3.5 years, and floral and fragrant notes leave a more complex bouquet.  Black Liquorice is much more present.  Best dubbel I can remember! 1,110 characterspatre_tim, Dec 09, 2013

Typical dubbel smell, with dark fruit, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, cake, Belgian sugars and chocolate.
Rich chocolate and caramel from the start, sweet and "lumpy", perfectly molded with dark malts, creating a chocolate cake taste. Dark fruits (like plum and figs) aren't alone here, but accompanied by red cherries, banana, red apple, red grapes and lemon rind (producing also some nice light tartness and sourness). Lots of spices, with cinnamon, vanilla, slight clove and pepper, notes of aniseseed also. 
There's an earthy-woody note also, producing an oaky taste, close to reminding of a barrel aged beer (the light tart and the musty grapes help also) . This, and taking the nice warm alcohol into consideration, produces a cognac-like taste. Especially in the finish.
Hops are present, mildly bitter, giving off some green tobacco and grass, also some dryness.
Body is chewy at first, with a prickly fizz throughout, goes down easily and keeps you asking for more.
Expectations were high, but this beer was higher even. Definitely the best dubbel i've ever had. Too bad it's hard (and expensive) to find.
Had it some time later. Big let-down, something seems to have happened here. 1,275 charactersdcmchew, Dec 03, 2013

This is one of those beers where I think the hype is bigger and better then the beer itself. Again I think it was made stylistically correct just not my cup of tea. 376 charactersvinny21bal, Nov 23, 2013

Beer smells of fresh baked bread, fig, caramel and a subtle alcohol ether. On the palate, this dubbel has a complete repertoire. Tart fruits, sweet caramel and pure earth. The finish is clean with developed carbonation. 
Anyone needs to experince Sint Sixtusabdijs. And the dubbel 8% is worth the trip. 509 characterseonbluekarma, Oct 24, 2013

Date: Best by 2014-08-19
Glass: New Belgium globe glass
Westvleteren's '8' is a fairly typical dubbel: easy-to-drink and rather sweet, with notable fruity esters. The flavor borders more on the side of a Belgian strong dark ale, and does not widely differ in flavor or quality from many other dubbels. Considering the hype and price, one I would definitely would not go out of my way to try again.
Pours a 1cm head of beige foam, made up of small-sized bubbles, creating a frothy appearance. Average head retention of around one minute. Lacing is good, though not great, some modest lines and dots adorn the inner sides of the glass. Body is a dark garnet color, nearly black-brown, with light bringing out garnet-amber hues and orange tints. Carbonation is visible throughout he slightly transparent body, substantial and quite active.
Aroma is sweet, slightly fruity with grape ester, some Belgian yeast mustiness, then raisins, light toast, and faint brown sugar. It's not a particularly impressive or robust aroma, and aside from the sweetness and fresh grape esters, one has to search with some effort to find the various components.
Taste, overall, is sweet with touches of anise, grape, and mild bittering hops. The sweetness, though prominent, is neither syrupy nor bready, just slight hints of caramel and candi sugar characters. Front of palate finds sweet and fruity flavors, with strong grape esters, slight caramel, and hints of anise and raisin. Mid-palate of anise, Belgian amber candi sugar, grape ester, light toffee, and hints of ethanol. more fruit and spice than malt and sugar. Back of palate finds richer, toffee-like sweetness with more noticeable ethanol and continued anise and grape ester flavor. Aftertaste of light caramel sweetness, lingering grape ester, slight bitterness, and ethanol.
Beer is medium weight in body, with medium-high carbonation levels. Prickly as it moves across the palete, but fairly quickly becoming foamy and smooth on the palate. Closes dryly, with light stickiness on the palate. 2,067 charactersfalloutsnow, Oct 21, 2013

4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 411.2 oz bottle. Picked up at at the brewery cafe last year. Its almost exactly one year old.
Appearance: A lot of chill haze in this now. Dark amber brown. I'm guessing it will clear with warming. Excellent tight head with good retention and lacing.
Smell: Raisin-date-fig spectrum of dark fruits. All grain toast. HInt of alcohol. 
Taste: As expected from the smell. Nice complexity of flavor. Ends with some toasty, husky grain flavors and is drier than you would expect, but seems less so as it warms. 
Mouthfeel: Lively carbonation, smooth and slightly sticky at first, but the aforementioned dryness starts to take over a bit at the end. Ultimately lasting rich flavors in the finish.
Overall: A very good beer. The flavors are a bit more like a small quad than that of a large dubbel. The dryness took me by surprise. A great Belgian, but its much better on draft at the source. 889 charactersrapidsequence, Oct 07, 2013

AP: Deep rich brown colour with a 3/4" light tan head with spots of brown that make it look like a cappuccino with cinnamon sprinkled across the face of it. Head dwindles to 1/4" with decent lacing on the sides.
AR: Brown sugar, caramel, toffee, plum, grape, brown bread, Belgian yeast, fruit cake. Not as sweet smelling as I thought it would be. 
T: Baked brown bread, brown sugar, sticky toffee, a hint of molasses, plum and grape (both dark and white), a hint of cinnamon and toasty grains. Very pleasant flavours.
M: Lighter in body than I thought it would be for an 8% Dubbel, moderate carbonation, slightly creamy mouthfeel, fairly clean finish. The ABV is well hidden.
OV: A very tasty brew that I'm glad I purchased and got to try. The flavours, while nothing really jumps out at me, are very well balanced and blend nicely together. It goes down very easy for an 8%er. A really good sipper. 942 charactersGuinnessAtRogerWilco, Oct 03, 2013

A: Pours a dark brown with a finger of dense white head. Great retention and lacing.
S: Very, very mild. A bit of dark fruit and a hint of spice. This is surprisingly mild, though.
T: Still mild, but dark fruit comes out more in the flavor than it did in the aroma. The beer stays fairly dry, but balanced with prune sweetness. Spices add some complexity to the beer.

Smell is deep, figgy, plum, raisin, bit of chocolate. Very rich and earthy. 
Taste is caramel and bread, plum, a bit of belgium yeast. Very smooth drinking. Strong mouthfeel leaves mouth coated, long lasting flavor. 
After letting it warm up for a bit, the smell is much more fruity, apple, fig, and plum. 
Taste is richer, more chocolate comes out, darker fruit and earthy. Almost a champagne style finish. 
This is an amazing beer and a great experience. Hope the 12 holds up. 609 charactersSmurf2055, Aug 03, 2013

4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Brought back from Belgium and shared with rudzud.
Decent fluffy fizzy but smaller head fades fairly quickly, murky chestnut mahogany brown color with yeast sediment chunks.
Nose is brown malts, bit syrupy like, nutty toffee, caramel, almost molasses like, nice soft aged dark fruits, aged malt too, light phenols and touch of booze, nice candy brown sugar to round it off, very light oxidation.
Taste starts with lots more brown malts, fairly thick but not really syrupy. Nutty, toffee, and light molasses, with faint toasty malts and little chewy caramel candy. Also very light are candied aged dark fruits, covered in brown sugar. Sweet candy, lead to light booze warmth and a bit of phenols, but also a light oxidation again but very light and mostly toward the finish. Very light hops. Finish is drier, not sticky at all, more candy like flavors lingering, toffee nutty caramel flavors.
Mouth is med to fuller bod, not syrupy at all, decent carb, light warming booze.
Overall pretty nice. Maybe better than westy 12 but not sure. Tasty beer aside from the oxidation which is very light on the flavor. I'm impressed how it gets the sweet characters but not syrupy at all. 1,179 charactersjlindros, Jun 06, 2013

There isn't much retention or lacing at all. The smell of the beer give off some Belgian spice notes with some cherry and vanilla in the mix. The taste of the beer is bready, spicy slightly sweet and earthy. The mouthfeel is very well carbonated and has a slight booziness in the finish. Overall it's a very good beer but it's nothing overly special. I believe the challenge of getting these beers adds to the hype which reflects the initial score of them. It's good just not as good as the score on here shows. 587 charactersKnapp85, Jun 02, 2013

A-The beer is dark, dark brown with just a hint of ruby red. The khaki/tan head of dense foam starts at about one and one-half fingers' height and drops to a thick cap. The retention is pretty good and there is a decent bit of lacing left on the glass.
S-Surprisingly aggressive alcohol on the nose...it warms you up. Otherwise, I smell brown sugar, prunes, raisins, banana, and clove spice. 
T-The taste is intense and more peppery than the nose with lots of dark, dried fruits, particularly prune. There is just a hint of hoppy bitterness at the end. The alcohol, while still aggressive, is well-mixed and complimentary to the flavor. Pretty nice.
M-The feel is plush, softly carbonated and medium to full body. The finish lasts and lasts.
O-This is a very good dubbel. The looks, in particular, are a example for others to follow. The nose is a bit too aggressive for me, but the flavor is pretty solid. Interestingly, this beer is much less sweet and more peppery than the XII. 1,023 charactersspoony, Jun 02, 2013

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a cloudy hazel hue with a thin white blanket that leaves nice lacing and light retention.

T - Taste is very pleasant with not much oxidation at all, light caramel notes, tasty toffee and not syrupy at all!
M - Mouthfeel is surprisingly light for what it is. Was expecting it to be much heavier and syrupy.

bottle cap is dated 27:09:15.
vintage 2012.
poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: medium brown bodied beer with big fluffy 2 fingers of head! Slowely drops down to a thick cap. Leaves spotty to moderate levels of lacing on the glass.
Smell: sweet malts, tons of dark fruits, caramel, chocolate pudding, brown sugar, belgian yeast, bubblegum and bananas! What a complex nose! Really fantastic smells coming from this beer. The dark fruits greet your nose before you ever get your nose near the glass.
Taste: Huge dark fruit mostly figs, raisins, and plums. Sweet caramel and bready malts with a hint of leather. Slightly spicey and fruity belgian yeast. This beer is so clean that you dont get much of an aftertaste even though the beer is quite malty and flavorful. 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Creamy and slick on the palate. Perfectly carbonated. Not a hint of 8% abv. Just a touch of dryness in the beers finish. Very well done!
Overall: This is easily the best Dubbel that I have ever drank. Its just wonderful. Benchmark for the beer style. Westy 8 is as good as they say it is!!! 1,152 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, May 24, 2013

4.78/5  rDev +6.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Anticipation grows as I work up the Westvleteren latter at Cafe In de Vrede. Already served from the bottle into glass as it arrived at my table. On to the beer;
The 8 is ruby brown colored with an inch of rocky head. The head retention is acceptable and it leaves some creamy lace around. The aroma is not only complex, but downright appetizing! Hello? Figs. How are you? Raisins. Quite well. Prunes. Thank you very much. Chocolate and pudding and yeast. 
Don't stop there. Get that palate ready for a party. The figs make their mark right away. Raisins don't trail far behind. A kiss of grass breaks the trend of sweet notes, but make no mistake, this is not sweet as in sugar sweet. A kiss of pepper adds a kick. Chocolate pudding adds a heavenly final blow to this outstanding dubbel. The beer is full bodied with a "peppery" carbonation, and it remarkably drinkable for a dubbel. 
I've had dubbels which I've enjoyed a lot. Westvleteren just topped that list with its own. With its combination of great taste and drinkability, this was my favorite of the Westvleteren family. 1,083 charactersDoubleJ, May 21, 2013

A- Really nice looking beer. One finger egg shell white head, dissipates to a nice frothy layer on top. Really nice lacing that coats the side of the glass. Dark dark brownish red color. Floaties galore, probably the most amount of sediment i have ever seen in a beer. 
S- Wow incredibly sweet/fruity aroma. Dark fruits. The raisin and plum come out very strong. Brown sugar, sweet malts. 
T- Different then the aroma. Not as fruit forward as the aroma, brown sugar, molasses in the taste. More plum then raisin, figs come out. More balanced then i was expecting. The aroma was so fruit forward and sweet, the taste differs drastically, very impressive!
M- Medium mouthfeel, dry finish. Leaves a creamy feeling in your mouth. 
O- Im really impressed. Its been a while since i had Westy 8. This was my last bottle from my trip to Belgium 3 years ago. I shed a few tears as i finished it, but really enjoyed it! 974 charactersChriscrundwell12, May 07, 2013

This beer is dark brown, cloudy appearance with medium sized and amount of CO2 bubbles. Roasted malt flavor with an alcohol end note. Notes of chocolate and coffee present, missing the dark ripe estery fruits normally found in dubbels. The mouthfeel is quite nice, creamy and heavy with a nice smoothness and drinkable. This beer ends with a dark roasted malt quality with a hint of spiciness-more hoppy than yeasty. 505 charactersdeebo, Apr 17, 2013

Appearance: This beer has a great look its cloudy, dark and creamy in appearance with a good level of carbonation and foam.

Taste: Sugars, and darker fruits for sure very smooth and rich. Can not really taste much of the alcohol. mostly tastes of fruite very clean. 
Mouthfeel: Slight amount of spice, mild carbonation and creamy.

A: Pours a very dark brown--nearing black--with a finger and a half of white head. Still manages good clarity around the edges. Medium sized bubbles which recede to a nice thick ring. Very good retention and a few dots of lacing.
S: Dark molasses, brandy-soaked dark fruit (blackcurrant, loads of fig), cherry juice, brown sugar, caramel and Christmas spice.
T: Caramelized sugar, dried fruit, cherry juice, spices (cinnamon and allspice), and a perfect level of dryness. A little booze comes through but it's mild.
M: Carbonation is on the high end, cola-like in its sharpness. Medium-full body.
O: Superb complexity that develops in the glass, and highly drinkable. 711 characterspmarlowe, Apr 09, 2013

I dropped some cash and purchased some of this from a reputably shop online and was really happy with my purchase. Some could say that it was a bucket list next to actually visting the brewery to buy my own case. Nice appearance with a bit of suspended yeast, malty malty taste and minimal hops. Truly a great beer from the "Westy Lads..."
 I prefer the 8 to the 12 purely on my own palate. Both are truly fantastic beers. 450 characterschrisgalvin, Apr 01, 2013

From the same batch, so it is over half a year old now.
A lovely dark brown beer with an offwhite head. Quality foam. Looks just great.
An extremely complex scent. Sweet but also with a certain earthiness to it and some tartness as well. Darker malts, chocolate, toffee, even some oaky vanilla stuff going on. Dark fruits, slightly boozy dark fruits. Raisins, dried figs, big dried prunes maybe cherry and some red apple (tartness). Just great smelling.
A very malt forward beer that is not overly sweet actually. A pretty big dark maltiness. The fruitiness is nice and balances out the firm maltiness. Take a sip and let it sit in the mouth for a few seconds to enjoy the complex flavours.
The body is medium and nice and smooth. Well carbonated.
Overall a great dubbel. Better than the Westmalle? I don't think so. Equal? Probably. 864 charactersIPA35, Mar 22, 2013

Smell: Brown sugar, caramel, red grape, sweet milk chocolate. There's a hint of tartness as well.
Taste: Sweetness upfront balanced out by slight bitterness in the finish. Flavors of raisins, grape, plum, bready malt, slight spice from the yeast. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, soft mouthfeel despite the medium/high carbonation. Gentle alcohol warmth in the throat and chest as it goes down
Overall: Really good beer, but doesn't live up to the hype in my opinion. Considering the great effort or cost that goes into obtaining this, I'll be sticking to more readily available options in the future. 804 charactersJonada, Feb 16, 2013

A: very very dark and opaque. small flakes of yeast suspended. Quickly dissipating head, too, dense to see any rising carbonation but there's a little something rising through the center. After sipping, it does form a pretty beautiful creaminess on the surface. Very even lacing.
S: interesting, coffee candy, cherry alcohol syrup, creamy, fiber powder, other complexities I can't describe. Pretty damn impressive.
T: Pretty crazy. I haven't had a beer like this one before. Chocolately. Really nice malt. It tastes like a dark malt and it's perhaps the first beer that I've had where the malt is such a defined flavor. Like malt coffee. And it's beautiful. With a perfect "grain" flavor on top. And while that's 65% of the flavor, sitting right under it, which is more like an unsweet cherry cola. No detection of alcohol.
M: Perfect mouthfeel. Thick and creamy with a very delicate carbonation sting. Unlike any other mouthfeel in a beer I've had, 
O: An incredibly special beer. Incredibly. I wasn't blown away with the Blonde. Actually disappointed, which made me skeptical about how this one would be. But this one lives up to it's fetishized name. With that said, I'm not jumping up and down saying, this is the most delicious beer I've ever had. Dubbels are not my style. But this one is the holy grail of Dubbels. Magical. It was worth the 10 euros I paid for it (please dont bash me!). 1,409 characterssfprint, Feb 16, 2013

A: A dulled bottle brown body with a creamy light beige head which clings to the sides of the glass.
S: Mildewy dried prunes/figs/dates and Cointreau. Nothing else.
T: Not registering any big flavour up front but it's quite crisp. Initially dry but sweetens up slightly. A tad bitter but pleasantly so and gets better with warmth but really there's not a lot to it. No interesting fruity esters, bubblegum or marzipan. Just a very fine balance of modest, conventional Belgian dark ale flavours, just like in the Westy 12. I can pick out a bit of sherry, a bit of mildew or something like an old wine cork flavour. Alcohol is very well hidden. Virtually no aftertaste. Verging on blandness if not for the crispness.
M: The balance and mouthfeel are the centrepiece. Beautifully creamy and silky and yet crisp at the same time. Also a bit sticky.
O: I thought I'd missed the point with the Westy 12 but now I've been similarly underwhelmed by the 8. If my bottle was a typical example of a two year old bottle then it tastes very ordinary with a bit of age. I'd love to try a fresh one because all these people can't be wrong. 1,221 charactersHoppsbabo, Feb 01, 2013

Cap is dated 02.12.07.
Pours a murky dark brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down either. Smell is of malt, brown sugar, grape juice, and lots of dark fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with a fruity flavor on the finish. There is a mild amount of spice bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great smell and some really tasty flavors. 639 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jan 29, 2013

Poured from an 11.2 ounce bottle into a goblet. Served at cellar temperature. 
A) It was burnt amber in color. A little bit hazy with a bit of sediment noted as well. There was nearly a finger of off-white head which quickly dissipated to a collar. 
S) A pleasant sweetness which I found to include some raisin and pear slices as well as a little bit of nuttiness probably best described as hazelnut. There were some nice spices too. This is a rich, filling aroma. This could possibly be how Ron Burgundy's apartment smells.
T) The flavor is near the nose, but what I found was a little more grape from a fruit standpoint and a hint of coffee as well. The yeast is also noted in the flavor. Sweet for sure, but also bitter enough for balance. Very, very little alcohol, actually the 8% a ABV was quite well hidden
M) A medium body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Actually more carbonation than I really anticipated, not that this was a bad thing. Really a very smooth beer. The finish is very dry, and the aftertaste is quite pleasant and clean.
O) A very nice treat on my birthday, so thanks for the bottle Dad. Met my expectations and definitely worth acquiring. Look forward to trying the Westy 12 some day. 1,253 charactersRoamingGnome, Jan 27, 2013

A: Amber or perhaps chest nut coloured liquid crowned by a white - beige head. Got som bubbles playing around.
S: Apricot, butter scotch, almond, chocolate and alcohol. It has some kind of smell that reminds me of the limestone church where I grew up.
T: Sweetness at first. Almonds, raw sugar, chocolate and syrup. The finish is bitter. It also have some fruity tastes to it, towards apricot.
M: Creamy yeat bubbely. A bit dry in the finish. 
O: Very balanced and surprisingly easy to drink. An excellent beer but it lacks the big WOW that would make it a true titan among giants. 676 charactersLinusBohman, Jan 26, 2013

The taste is mildly sweet with raisin plum, and a bit of caramel. The finish is slightly dry with a light bitterness. Medium body. Medium-low carbonation. Good.

S: Exquisite grape and dark fruit, some fruity phenolic character and a tiny touch of spice.
T/M: Incredible dark fruit and grape flavor with very low alcohol presence. The beer starts with a light bitterness and carbonation bite, followed by the dark fruit/malt flavor, and morphs into more complex drying fruit notes from the yeast. Very low phenolic astringency, the yeast blends into the flavor profile perfectly.
Overall: Extraordinary, one of the best belgian beer I have laid my hands on. I thought that all of the westy beers were just hype machines, but this is just magnificent, I cannot imagine that Westy 12 is any better. 733 charactersSiriusfisherman, Jan 03, 2013

2006 vintage, consumed Dec., 2012, shared at Funky Buddha, Boca Raton, FL.
Dark mahogany color, with a small tan head that retained as a thin layer, and left a little lacing on the glass. Absolutely loved the aroma on this. Rich scents of sweet raisins, figs, caramel malts, brown sugar, Belgian yeast. Super smooth. I almost want to give it a 5.0. The taste reflects the nose, dried dark fruits, mingled with smooth malt sweetness, dark sugars, a touch of cocoa, and a mellow but ubiquitous booziness throughout the session. Smooth mouthfeel, medium body, moderate carbonation. Complex and well-crafted. 669 charactersRifugium, Jan 01, 2013

A - A dark brown color with some red or even burgundy highlights when held to light. Slightly cloudy. Sediment in bottle got stirred during the pour and seems to contribute to the cloudiness. Head is tan and piled 4-5 cm high initially. Faded to a thin layer and big beefy ring around the glass. Serious lacing.
S - Beautiful aroma. Bready malt, molasses, raisins, and brandy-like alcohol jump out and dominate. There is a bit of spice in the background that adds complexity. There is a minty/medicinal note (could be from hops) that lightens the aroma and keeps it from giving a cloying impression.
T - The taste is well balanced and complex, but not as complex as the aroma. The warm, bready malt balances against the minty/medicinal hops flavor. Additional flavors like licorice, alcohol and dried fruits run around the edges, but the finish is dry and does not linger.
M - Medium body. Prickly carbonation lightens the mouthfeel. Alcohol burn is well-hidden. Hop bitterness is present but not overt. Some sweetness coats the mouth and offsets the generally dry finish.
O - Overall, this is an outstanding beer. No flaws. Every aspect is appealing. If I had a wish, it would be for a bit more body and complexity, but now I'm splitting hairs. 1,298 charactersRadome, Dec 18, 2012

Maybe a year old I know it knows its competition better than I. The Prior and the Pater, from just across the way at St. Bernardus. The history may be storied but I wasn't there for it, so I seek the state of the present, and as for Dubbels that is where my allegiance lies.
I pour the #8 into a large wine glass from its 330 ml. Trappistenbier bottle. Pours with a rambunctious cap of foam and shows a medium brown with a fairly clear ruby in the light. Shows strong retention and some sticky lacing.
Aroma of yeast along with light fruit and caramel. Light yet complex and never overwhelming. Such a contrast to many American Dubbels that simply try to overwhelm. Quite similar to St. Bernardus and well attenuated. Warms to offer more complex notes.
Nice flavor, unobtrusive and yet delivering a multitude as for nuance on the finish. Feel is lingering but never sweet. Lightly coarse yet dry and showing just a hint of alcohol throughout. Touch creamy with warming, quite nice, and gladly the word cloying is not even in my vocabulary tonight.
I'll have to call it a tie for now with Prior 8. 1,212 charactersHalfFull, Dec 08, 2012

A - Starts a deep brown with some light and clarity along the edges. Toward the end, more and more light comes through and it drops several shades in color.
S - Complex dates, raisins, figs and fruit. It really builds your anticipation.

The body was crisp, full and smooth. Drinkability was excellent, this would be the rare beer where I would want a large format bottle all to myself. Overall, a great beer. Worth whatever it takes to get your hands on. 699 charactersbeertunes, Oct 21, 2012

Score: 97
"Best by" 11/30/14 according to the bottle cap. Served in a Westy 12 chalice and enjoyed on 09/17/12.
Appearance: Pours a chocolate color with some yellowish-brown color atop and mild ruby highlights at the bottom. There is excellent color depth and fade to the body of this beer, which wine aficionados should appreciate.. Pours a half finger of tan head that settles to a thin layer. Good lacing and average retention. 4.5/5
Smell: Slighty "fruity" yeast, caramel, figs and apples and a little chocolate. Some spice, a "nutty" maltiness, and a hint of brown sugar. Just a hint of alcohol esters too. 4.5/5
Taste: Figs, musty caramel malt and a hint of raw cocoa bean flavor. There is a smooth weizenbock-like banana-y yeast flavor on the center of the tongue throughout, and it lightly lingers. Unlike what the nose hints, there is no "fruitiness" to the taste really -- maybe faintly as the beer warms up. Instead, there is a dried dark fruit flavor here -- primarily figs, but a little date flavor too. Westy 8 beer is not sweet at all -- instead, it is possesses a very balanced, nuanced and drinkable maltiness. There's a very faint alcohol warmth on the sides of tongue, but no boozy flavor whatsoever. What an incredibly and carefully crafted beer! I am sure there are plenty of nuances that I just cannot pick out here. 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Just shy of full bodied, and perfectly carbonated. Very creamy, slick mouthfeel. Malty, but balanced. 5/5
Overall: Easily my favorite dubbel. Call me crazy, but, at least relatively fresh, I prefer this one to Westy 12. This is such an amazing malt-dominant beer that has so much subtle complexity. I wish I had a consistent line on this stuff, cause believe me, there would always be a few of these in my fridge.
Recommendation: Seek this one out. It's at least as good as Westy 12, but without all the fanfare.
Pairings: The Mustard Seed Cafe's harvest panini (a turkey sandwich on zucchini bread with provolone cheese, slices of apples and cranberry sauce).
Cost: $12 for a 11.2 oz bottle. 2,203 charactersjegross2, Sep 18, 2012

Super smooth and just all around amazing. Although the Abbey was so over commercialized, its still worth the visit to try them at the source.

4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from that distinctive Westy bottle into a Westvleteren chalice.
Westvleteren 8 pours a dense walnut brown color with a slight cranberry tint. A creamy tan head forms gently on top with the initial pour. There was a lot of sediment in the bottom of the bottle, to the point where it was difficult not to pour it in.
Caramel malt, figs, dates, overripe red apples, brandy, and cinnamon gust up my nose.
The flavor is more of the same. The flavor is not as sweet as I would expect, though. There is a bit of caramel up front providing a slightly sweet base, but the fig, date, red apple, cinnamon, and all spice do not provide enough sweetness to overcome the boozy brandy that comes through. There is great integration of the flavors - a sign of long-perfected brewing processes.
The mouthfeel is pretty much perfect, for the style or otherwise. The body is on the full side of medium, representing the 8% ABV quite accurately. Each sip has a foamy, creamy carbonation with just a bit of a crisp, tingly bite to it to help ease the flavors down the tongue to reset after each sip. Very smooth.
This is a wonderfully balanced and drinkable beer. I am glad I finally cracked my bottle. 1,193 charactersKickInTheChalice, Aug 18, 2012

A - Dark brown body, pour yields a nice one finger tan head. Solid lacing.
S - Lots of spice, Belgian yeast, brown sugar, figs, and toffee. A bit nutty and sweet.
T - Spice and dark fruits lead into a cola syrup flavor. Notes of brown sugar, liquorice, molasses, toasted nuts, and spicy yeast as it warms up. Ample carbonation with a silky and chewy medium mouth feel.
O - Not quite as complex or intricate as the quad, but this is certainly the best dubbel I have tried. Very tasty, even being this fresh. 629 charactersdavey101, Aug 04, 2012

Ironic that my first Westy 8 is poured into the first glass I tasted westy 12 from.
A: Golden dark brown color. One finger head that lingers forever. Settles to a creamy film across the surface.
S: Very distinctive smell to Westvleteren. The 8 smells quite like the 12. Sweet, spicy aroma, possibly some roasted nuts and honey detected along with the hops
T: I still feel my tongue is not sophisticated enough for westy. My tongue is confused. Lots of flavors and spices blend together into what I call the westy taste that I can not distinguish. 
M: Nice body, thick and thin at the same time. Carbonation lingers on the tongue.
O: It lives up to the Westvleteren name, however I do not feel it is worth the effort required to seek out in the US. 811 charactersmcss, Jul 28, 2012

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Found at Belgobaren in Stockholm, SE on July 27, 2012. The very plain brown 0.33 L bottle with the blue cap identifying the beer with the date "10.11.08" -- this is an old one! This is my first experience with W8 so I can't comment on whether the age has done it well.
Poured into a Trappist Westvleteren chalice glass, beer is brown, with orange hues, but so dark it barely transmits light. Topped with a thin tan head. Small amounts of gritty sediment sinks in the glass. TONS of brown sludge left in the bottle. Intense aroma of raisins and figs -- rich and fruity. Aroma reminds me more of a barleywine or even an old ale more than any Belgian ale.
The flavor is similarly rich and "brown" with prune and raisin fruit on the palate. These fruit flavors present immediately upon sipping. The carbonation is moderate, but actually comes across as a little heavy for this style. The second wave of flavors comes across with a minor tinge of sourness and lighter fruit, apples, and so on. As with Westvleteren Blonde, there's no detectable residual sweetness, but this beer has less funkiness. The lighter fruits are followed by a heady bit of alcohol, though no burning or otherwise unpleasant artifact of the 8% ABV.
Perhaps this beer is not quite as drinkable as the Blonde, but considering the increased alcohol content, it is still fantastically drinkable. The flavor profile really is so totally different it's a toss up which is better, but the deep color and, unquestionably, the fantastic aroma, set this beer apart. 1,528 charactershreb, Jul 27, 2012

4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to randjuke for sending this one! Poured from generic Trappist bottle to brandy snifter - best by date of 18.08.13:
Pours a murky ruby brown stuffed with slow, steady beading. A few fingers of khaki head swell to create some fantastic lacing. A perfect looking beer in every way.
Mmm... overripe figs, red wine bits, some Belgian yeast far and away, a mellow blanket of tartness sort of ties everything together. Certainly not as in-your-face as its bigger brother, but it achieves a better sense of balance I think.
Leathery wood notes, dates and figs, super smooth. It's got that tobacco presence thing that bothers me in the Westy 12 but here it is more in balance with the rest of the beer. Subtle lingonberry as well.
The mouthfeel and appearance are the real highlights of this one. Super creamy with a relatively thick body.
A fantastic dubbel. 867 charactersyamar68, Jul 14, 2012

T: Plenty of grapes, raisins, and plum up front mixed with a little bit of chocolate and sweetness in the middle. There is a bit of spice on the back end, some pepper mostly.

4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle poured into a tulip glass.
Appearance - Deep, dark, rich brown with a beige foamy head and plenty of lacing
Smell - Belgian spices/yeast, earthy, with a hint of funk
Taste - Complex flavor profile with a robust malty backbone, rich belgian spices, and a hint of orange peel; flavors linger
Mouthfeel - Rich and silky with a powerful kick up front but tapers to smooth
Overall - Not usually a Belgian beer fan but this is a unique beer that is powerful without the malty sweetness one would expect from a higher ABV. Full flavored and good for sipping! 563 charactersNorfawkers, Jul 06, 2012
4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle (2011)
(Aged for 1 year)
Dark, hazed brown, with dark ruby and crimson edges and a thin khaki colored color that hangs around throughout the duration. This leaves thick sheets of lace down the glass. Gorgeous beer.
Complex aroma, though I wish things were even bolder and more expressive (perhaps things have faded a bit over the year). There's still good amounts of dark fruits (plums and plump red grapes), distinct Belgian yeast, some bread crusts, and a bit of molasses sweetness.
Fantastic, drinkable complexity wrapped up in a delicious, deceptively simple package. The dark fruits notes, bread, molasses, and bright Belgian yeast combine for a marvelously drinkable dubbel that has a distinct, earthy tobacco finish.
Medium bodied with moderate, creamy carbonation. A joy to drink. Smooth as silk. Perfect. Only the Belgian masters can seem to pull this off.

cap dated 30.09.12 (so 2007 vintage?)
a - opened the bottle and filled my trappist westvleteren chalice. brew poured a deep brown with a generous creamy head. only a true belgian dubbel could catch that big creamy head. the head hung out and moved as a unit. really attractive.
s - wonderful grape nutmeg smell with a hint of heat. great belgian candied sugar. some hints of caramel and mild spicy zest. really smells like a BSDA. wonderful!!!
t - a masterpiece. dark fruit bouquet married with some heat on the finish. the candied sweetness in the nose is also on the taste. truly a wonderful brew. dubbels at times are a bit too in your face for me, but this is tamed back with a great sweetness to even out any harshness of the style. absolutely perfect tasting.
m - the first thing that really jumped at me was the feel of this beer. SUPER silky and smooth. there is a bit of heat on the finish, but this beer just has a creamy wonderful perfect body.
o - one of the more flavorful dubbels i've had. the sweetness balances out the dark fruit and heat really rounding this one out immensely. i'll have to have my next one of these next to a westy 12 since i can't remember enjoying the 12 as much as this beer. this beer is amazing...one of the better beers i have ever tried. i was simply blown away by this beer. 1,489 characterscosmicevan, Jun 17, 2012

Arrives at the table with a dense tan head. The beer is a very dark brown (but definitely not black). There are aromas of figs and dates and a noticeable alcohol presence. On the tongue there's an explosion of chocolate and a slight bit of raisin. There's moderate alcohol bites, although the light body belies the strength of the beer. Very smooth and creamy.

A big thanks to 4thlovofbeer for sending this and a 12 over in a trade.
A: Pours a murky dark mahogany  with some sedimentation floating in the glass.  1 fingers width of light khaki head, which dissipates down fairly quickly to a thick film that remains throughout the drink.  Leaves a small amount of spotty lacing.
S: Doughy, sweet, sugary.   Like freshly baked cinnamon rolls.   Candied sugar, dark fruits including fig, really great. 
T: Dark fruits including fig and dates. Spice, lots of spice!  The faintest hint of cocoa on the aftertaste.  Some sugar sweetness but not to the degree of the nose.  Spice  is predominate but still maintains good complexity and balance. My girlfriend, who is not a beer drinker, tasted it and immediately said,  "it's like a party in my mouth".  Excellent. 
M/D: Pretty  heavy carbonation that allows the flavors to explode on the entire palate but still remains very smooth. On the heavier side of medium bodied, no hint of the ABV and drinkability is incredible.  
O: Overall, what a fantastic beer.  Hands down the best Dubbel I've ever had, and it's not even close.  Honestly, drinks like a quad, and a great one.  Flavors and aromas are a little toned down compared to the Westy 12, but I guess that's the point of a Dubbel. No doubt the epitome of the style. World Class. 1,402 characterszac16125, May 24, 2012

Pour is a very murky and opaque brown. small carbonation and really little head.
Smells sweet dark fruits (raisins and plums), candied bronw sugar, and even more plums. Hints of Belgian esters and yeast muddled in the background.
The taste is, just wow. Definitely the best Dubbel Ive had. Very thick doughy malt, and a nice dose of brown sugar and molasses. Syrupy and sweet, yet dry and balanced from the 2 years of aging. I think the balance is astounding, honestly. Nice accents of Belgian Yeast esters floating around in the background. 
Its way too drinkable, and Im not normally a huge fan of overly sweet beers. This thing just keeps so many complex flavors in check and balance. Everything is such moderation, yet every single flavor still shines. Mainly, the brown sugar and doughy roasted malt come to the front, but I really like how the molasses comes in and dries out what could be an overly sweet beer.
I love this beer, and would drink it if it werent so freaking expensive. 1,167 charactersVncentLIFE, May 07, 2012

O- Not quite as amazing as I had expected, but that is a common problem with these types of beers- they tend to be a bit over-hyped. I may have had a bad bottle, but this just didn't blow my hair back like I expected. 729 charactersIPA4LIFE, Apr 15, 2012

A. Pours a dark ruddy brown. Huge three finger cream colored head erupts even from a careful pour. Lacing is some of the thickest and most consistent I have seen. Beautiful. 
S. Fresh bread, cherry, fig, and some brown sugar. Little bit of booze as well. Very nice. 
T. Dried fruit, bready malt, roasted biscuit. Some slightly odd vegetal notes, maybe a little green pepper. Good but some weird notes. 
M. Creamy, balanced, medium bodied. 
O. Good. Much prefer the quad (12) but this aint half bad. Didnt like some of the vegetal flavors, but for the most part this was a good one. 638 characterssiege06nd, Apr 06, 2012
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.527.01.13 printed on the cap. I've personally had the bottle for a little over a year.
I wanted to keep the cap so I opened it slowly, and lost a little bit through the partially opened cap, so make sure your glass is ready.
A: Pours a murky reddish brown amber, with a huge amount of foamy tan head. A thick blanket retains and leaves good lacing.
S: Rich, malty, and deeply complex, much like an aged barelywine. Elements of clove and other spices, but it's blended into the whole rather than being starkly noticeable on its own.
T: Rich complex maltiness; nicely balanced and not overly sweet. There's just a touch of bitterness towards the finish, with a lingering slightly boozy note.
M: Medium body, medium but very prickly carbonation.
Overall, awesome. I wouldn't mind trying it younger, as it's a little less boozy than I would usually age, but it certainly held up fine. 884 charactersseand, Apr 06, 2012

Bottle to Bruery Tulip
330 Ml
Didnt save the cap, so didnt see the date
Thanks to GuruDel for sharing
App- Super dark brown with no light coming in. A mix of ambers in there as well. Huge puffy head with a good bit cling and lace.
Smell- Westy 8 has a lot going in the nose but I couldn't pick up on all of it. A bit of a small quad note really. I got a lot of dark fruits, a little sweetness and a good dose of Belgian Yeast.
Taste- A nice dubbel without overkilling it on the spice. Had a nice hidden and layered sweetness with a big dose of the yeast. The 8% is well hidden and doesnt affect the beer with respects to drinkability.
Mouth- A well layered medium body with a medium carbonation. Has a residual sweetness and a yeasty dark fruit flavor.
Drink- A very nice dubbel. Very smooth and drinkable without being too hot or too spicy as some tend to be for me. 894 charactersFosterJM, Apr 02, 2012

3.5 A: Murky dark brown color. Three fingers of frothy beige head. Retention is average I suppose and a small amount of lacing is left.
3.5 S: The aroma is very subtle. Pepper is the strongest component. Raisin and plum underneath followed by clove. Clean with a light earthiness. 
4.0 T: Taste is more potent than the nose for sure. Big peppery spiciness with clove not too far behind. Plum, raisin, date, and fig fruitiness. Warming on finish. 
4.5 M: Lighter body. Good spritzy carbonation. Good creaminess and super smooth.
4.5 D: A couple categories could have been a touch higher, so 4.5 here. This is a lot like the 12. Super well integrated, subtle, and infinitely clean. But, unlike the 12, this is perhaps a bit too subtle and you really have to concentrate to enjoy it. Still, good beer. 851 charactersDavoleBomb, Mar 18, 2012

4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5An extraordinary brew, an unusual, complex and balanced range of sour, caramel, and malt notes… and more.
Presentation: 33 cl brown custom Trappist capped bottle. Characteristic lack of label or marking other than the cap, which shows in black, silver and blue, name, seal, faintly legible date, and 8% Alc. by Vol. Served in a snifter.
A - Hazy amber brown with a towering frothy head, rich retention with nice surface memory and lacing.
S - Nose is quite a treat and the perfect show-off for the taste that will follow, long sour fruity notes covered in caramel and malt in a rare but perfectly synchronized combination...
T - …which the brew perfects and expands in the palate. The freshness of raw cider coated in caramel, those apples with vinous touches under the sugar alongside touches of dark fruits, and the caramel expanding to the notes of malt, hint of spices, and a superior blend along the whole ride.
M - Medium full body with moderately tuned carbonation offering a nice subtle tingle and holding with dexterity the complexity of the brew, both smooth and creamy with peaks of soft tart insinuation as it completes the ride.
O - A dubbel like no other, the malty profile rides over those sour and fruity notes in such a particularly beautiful way that there is little else I can think of to compare it to.
Notes: What a treat, and what a surprise, the last of the excellent Westvleteren brews to try was quite the special animal. Almost like a combination of the best of the blonde and the 10 but with its own character. The sense of balance and change of rhythm in the palate without losing a touch of its structure is something to remember… 1,672 charactersDaniellobo, Mar 13, 2012

A - Poured into my Rochefort chalice with most of the sediment. Has a deep brown color with a slightly off white head that quickly dissipated to almost nothing. 
S - delicate aromas of sweet raisins, very subtle bouquet overall
T - figs, raisins, lots of fruit and maybe a hint of chocolate? almost wine like. 
M&D - medium body, very smooth with small beeds of carbonation. The flavors linger on and on cleanly fade away leaving you wanting more. Lots of lacing left on the glass.
Overall this is a great beer. It's very flavorful and fruity and has a clean finish. Is its the best in the world? I don't know but what i do know is that I was glad to have tried it but would not trade my cellar for it. 805 characterswhitehouse50, Feb 15, 2012

4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Purchased from Tanakaya in Mejiro, Tokyo. Poured into an also newly purchased Trappistes Rochefort wide-rimmed goblet. I can't even begin to describe this wonderful brew in words that conform to a language I speak. A lovely caramel-colored head covered the black-brown brew from beginning to end, releasing all of the magical scents that again escape known words. I drank it, and it warmed my soul. Then, I drank more and it made me smile. I continued to drink and continued to grow more and more in love with it. If you have the chance (and the money) to buy this beer, do not pass on it.

4.44/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from an un dated bottle. Picked this up during a trip to Amsterdam in mid 2010. 
Appearance is a light brownish body with a fizzy thin head. 
Smell reminds me of faint grape soda, raspberries, and a slight sour characteristic, similar to what I get off Jolly Pumpkin beers.
Taste is very smooth and easy drinking. Alcohol only sneaks up a bit at the very end of a mouthful. Initial bready and fruity hints followed by roasted malt. Excellent balance between dry fruit, yeast and malt.
Feel is relatively thin with a lively carbonation which is not over the top. Goes down easy allowing the complex flavors to shine through.
Overall one of the best dubbels I've ever had. A serving size of only 330cl leaves you wanting another. 739 characterswifehatesthebike, Feb 12, 2012

The nose is caramel, toffee, fig, date, liquorice, menthol and salt. The taste is very smooth and full of dark fruit: fig, date, prune and plum. As well as: wood, caramel, vanilla, mint, bread, charcoal, toast, liquorice, toasted sesame and coffee, with a very long roasted-bitter finish. It tastes fresh, complex and is very well balanced, but still very drinkable. It deserves its place at the top. 503 charactersSc0pey, Jan 31, 2012

Pours a murky brown, ruby red edges with an off white creamy head. The nose is lightly nutty up front, sweet caramel, lightly toasted, cherries, light sherry and very fruity in the back. The taste is sweet, sugary caramel, roasted nuts, berry fruits in the back with slighlty paper oxidation falling off a bit in the back. Full body, syrupy feel, decent carbonation, thin in the back.

4/18/10
A-gushes upon opening. pours a creamy bubbly tan head that fizzles away slowly and leaves a soft creamy coating on the side of the glass. The liquid is a cloudy dark reddish copper color that doesn't really allow light to pass through. There are some lighter orange edges with light shined upon it.
S-the nose is fair in strength, light notes of darker malts, toffee and a hint of chocolate. Soft fruit sets in with notes of rum. Peaches and the nose of a screw driver. Tartness in the back.
T-the taste is similar to the nose but slightly muted. Toffee, slightly toasted malts, and notes of chocolate are up front yet subtle. Sweet soft fruits lie in the middle, again peaches with orange juice and vodka. The booziness is stronger in the taste than the nose. Hints of warming and a fair amount of tartness come in at the back with a touch of cherry. The finish does have notes of an herbal hop presence to provide a nice balance. It opens up a little as it warms with the toffee, chocolate, and cherry in the back.
M-very smooth and creamy with a good medium body. The carbonation is fair in strength and hold up the finish. Slightly crisp but still smooth.
D-this is a very tasty beer with some interesting things going on. Great mouthfeel but a little boozy in the taste compared to what I had expected with such a renowned nectar. Still extremely good! 1,809 characterscpetrone84, Jan 16, 2012

Served into a Meantime goblet to a dark rich chestnut brown with almost a finger of white head, which soon thinned out
Dark fruits, brown sugar, toffee, figs/dates on the nose
Similar tastes to the smell, very noticeable is molasses. Getting hints of a whole menagerie of dried fruits ... prunes/apricot/figs/dates, burnt sugars, only ever so slightly in the 'burnt' sense!
Mouthfeel is great, not as chewy as I was expecting, but goes down a dream and makes you wish this wasn't the only bottle you've got !
Plenty of lacing with the remnants of the head clinging to the glass
Overall - a great beer, well over 5 years old
Full of depth and character
Would love to compare it with a 'fresh' example! 1,044 charactersRuds, Jan 13, 2012

P: 11.2 fl oz bottle in to a snifter.
A: SRM is toffee/cola brown. Translucent with sediment. Head is off white, 1 in, dissipates to 1 cm. Medium carbonation. Heavy lacing.
S: Sweeter than the 12, dark fruit, light hops, caramel andmedium roast malt (a bit more than the 12), blegian yeast and light bready notes.
T: A bit more maltiness than the 12, semi sweet dark fruit, more caramel sweetness than the 12, light hops, and more of a chewy/bread taste than the 12. Aftertaste is malt, caramel and bread notes, light sweetness.
M: Medium/full body. Malt, caramel, and light dark fruit additions give a rich and full feel, the yeast adds a bit of density. Finished wet.
O: I can't believe it, but I think I might like the 8 more than the 12. Awesome malt/caramel complexity with the belgian yeast/bready aspect. Again, one of the top five beers I have ever had. A treat to try and I consider myself extremely lucky to have some great beer buddies and the chance to have tried this. 1,008 characterstsauce2, Jan 06, 2012

A: Dark brown, completely hazy with some floaties. A big 3+ finger frothy brown head that fairly quickly recedes but does leave pretty good lacing.
S: Dark fruits: Figs, dates, lots of prune, some brown sugar
T: Unlike the nose, there is a HUGE malt body with tons of brown sugar, some molasses, almost a pretzel like breadiness. The dark fruits make a strong presence with figs taking the forefront with depth of raisin and prune (though in the background enough to lose much of their 'sharp' edge). Reminds me a lot of a fig newton topped with caramel and a touch of rum. 
M: Medium to full body, extremely smooth, absolutely no alcohol is noticeable aside from the well-rounded phenols. 
O: An absolute treat for sure. I'm quite surprised just how much more depth there is to the taste than the nose lets on. I was expecting a grape/phenol bomb but was absolutely blown away by the malt depth, balance, and smoothness. This is one of the best Belgians I have ever had and would greatly recommend the Westy 8. Now I just need to see how a fresh bottle compares to this matured (nearly 4 year old bottle) bottle. 1,212 charactersSatchboogie, Dec 31, 2011

Look: Pours a beautiful coca cola brown with a 1/2 inch off white head and great retention
Smell: Great dark fruits nose. Plums and raisins with a touch of caramel and toffee
Taste: This is still to this day the most complex beer I have ever had. It starts off with just a fantastic party of dark fruits in your mouth. Figs and plums and raisins are all working together to form a perfect symphony on the palate. The beer then finishes with just the right amount of caramel toffee and tobacco
Mouthfeel: Medium body and medium to mild carbonation and a bit sticky
Overall: This is hands down the best beer that has ever passed through these delicious lips of mine. If I could only drink this beer for the rest of my life I would be content and die a very happy man. Perfection in a glass 942 charactersDarthKostrizer, Dec 29, 2011

Into a Moinette chalice, it pours a tawny dark amber, crystal clear with rapid carbonation visible at first. Lasting veil of velvety foam, that remains for the duration of the glass. 
Vinous aroma, dried fruit sweetness, yeasty doughiness.
Extremely creamy feel, medium bodied, fine carbonation. Some oxidation notes, rather bitter and oddly metallic. Some nutty malt flavors linger, bitter walnut and grassy herbs. Taste seems a bit of a letdown from what I remember years ago. Very dry and attenuated, with an overt alcohol presence. Probably won't seek out again unless it's known to be very fresh. 825 charactersemerge077, Dec 27, 2011

A. Pours a 2+ finger slightly off white head. Great retention. Thick lacing. Color is a rich chestnut brown. 
S. Nice caramel malt sweetness and dark fruit. Raisins, brown sugar, plums, figs, a little dark grape. Really impressive dubbel smell. Some quads don't smell this good. 
T. Caramel, dark fruit, raisins, figs, just a wee bit of dark grape. Nice sweet taste. Well this tastes like the best dubbel, I have ever had. Really tastes like some of the best quads out there. Just a bit lighter in flavors and mouthfeel. 
M. Creamy texture. Medium bodied. A touch of lingering sweetness. Medium carbonation. 
O. One of the best dubbels I have had. Really not all that different in smell, taste, and mouthfeel than a lot of quads. Not as flavorful or as much mouthfeel as 12 but this is an excellent beer. Westvleteren makes 3 very excellent beers, I am glad I have had the opportunity to try all 3. 993 characterssiradmiralnelson, Dec 18, 2011

A- Pours a dark brown with ruby highlights, lively carbonation, produces a thin white head that diminishes to a thin film. 
S- Very fruity, figs and dates, some caramel and malts with a bit of spice.
T- Lots of fruit again, loads of dark fruity flavors like figs, raisins and dates along with some anise spiciness and sweet alcohol. Excellent malt backbone with juicy bread, molasses, and some dry grains towards the finish. Yeast and mild hop bitterness are noticeable in the background. 
M- Medium bodied, full carbonation, slightly slick but rich feel.
O- An astonishing beer, I've never had a dubbel that can even compare with this. 798 charactersWillCarrera, Dec 18, 2011

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Unfortunately, I couldn't read the date on the cap. The first number was 23 and after that, I have no idea.
It pours a brilliant shade of chocolatey brown. It's a rich shade of dark brown, with some lighter hues around the edges. The head is offbrown and initially a work of art. It dissipates relatively quickly, leaving a thin film of creamy bubbles on top, particularly around the perimeter of the glass.
You can almost smell sweetness. It actually smells like a caramel covered apple from the fair, with green Granny Smith apples and some caramel filling the olfactories. Aside from that, nothing else stands out.
Taste is almost perfect. It's malty with the caramel that filled the nose. You can pick up some dark, rich fruits like raisins and dates. Even the apple makes a cameo. There is a slight bitter note, as well as a hoppy bite, in the finish to balance out the sweetness.
It's a tremendous symphony of sensations on the palate. Sweet initially with a creamy mouthfeel. Near the end, there is a tartness which leads to a semi-dry finish with a slight hoppy bite and just a touch of heat from the alcohol. Medium-bodied and rich throughout.
This beer is better than the sum of its parts. It's simply extraordinary. It's extremely complex, but nothing is offensive and everything complements something else. It's simply a wonderful beer.
Edit...enjoying my second bottle almost a year later. The smell has intensified. Still the same scents, only they're stronger and work together better. The taste is the same only everything has meshed, along with a bit of alcohol making more of an appearance. It's without question my favorite beer in the world. 1,667 charactersRickS95, Dec 06, 2011

S: The Belgian yeast smells of figs and cherries are really coming through.
T: Surprisingly there was a bit of a bite of bitterness and alcohol up front with some cherry and fig flavours in the finish. The alcohol presence was actually kind of disappointing, after experiencing the smoothness of the 12 yesterday.
M: Medium to thick viscosity, a high level of fine carbonation, and some drying from the alcohol.
O: Disappointing for the price tag, but must be tried. 557 charactersDaftCaskBC, Dec 01, 2011

4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured it into a Chimay chalice to reveal a dark brown brew with some ruby highlights I guess. A bubbly fluffy tan head sticks around and leaves some markings on the glass. Quite a bit of sediment is chilling at the bottom.
Alcohol, yeast/bread, fruit, rounded out by some spiciness in the nose. Very nice. 
This thing is pretty heavenly in your mouth. Medium bodied, creamy, with nice touch of carbonation. Malty, bready, and slighty fruity flavors abound. A touch of bitterness and alcohol are also there. This is a well rounded flavorful beer.
I’m not a huge fan of dubbels so I wasn’t too excited to drink this even though it’s a Westvleteren. Needless to say it blew me away. 689 charactersMattSweatshirt, Nov 29, 2011

Swirl of caramel colors with a big head in the goblet. Looks good but no way can you tell what to expect.
Really complex but fairly quiet aromas. Slight booziness and pepper.
Caramel, bittering hops, raisins in small doses, maybe some chocolate and bread in there.
Creamy, but well carbonated leading to a great sipper. I love it when these relatively heavy beers are carbonated like this. Forces you to enjoy it slowly, like a great meal. Top notch dubbel which sadly is mostly unavailable to me. 529 charactersChizoad, Nov 26, 2011

4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bought for 9 Euros at Beer Temple in Brussels.
A - Dark as hell. A beauty in my Rochefort chalice. Small head that dissipates rather quickly, but seems to hug the sides well. Perhaps I didn't pour hard enough.
S - Dried tart fruit. I'm getting apricot, plum, even strawberry. Quite aromatic for a beer. 
T - Melange up front with that brune taste of brown sugar and hints of fruitiness. Dries to a Belgian Stong Ale-like booziness as it sits in your mouth that really catches you off guard. Fantastic if you prefer bitter tastes to sweet ones. Tastes like dirt, but in a good way. Sort of like how lambics taste like dirty socks... but also in a good way.
M - This is beer. A beer drinker can tell when it's been artificially carbonated and this one is allll natural. The carbonation has a creaminess that is so hard to attain! Complements the taste of the beer exceptionally well.
O - This is why I drink beer. It's the fact that Westvleteren pays so much attention to characteristics besides just the taste that make it such a world-class brewery. I'm sad that I probably won't have this gem again for a number of years. I, personally, preferred the Blonde, but this one's a home run nonetheless.

A-Pours a clear, though chunky, cedary brown with some ruby accents. A thin ring of tannish head and a nice pool of head.
S-Bready, yeasty, lots of sweet cherry in the nose with some brown sugar.
T-Sweet brown sugar and dark fruit, a bit of booze, some fig and a hint of something almost herby. Nicely complex for a dubbel.
M-Light to medium bodied, good carbonation.
O-As dubbels go, this is about as good as it gets. Great complexity for a style I often find to be overly sweet and sugary.

Pours a light hazy brown color with light brown hues along the edge. A nice light khaki bubbly head that recedes leaving some nice lacing.
Aromas begin with a nice lightly toasted breadiness. I alos get some nice light Belgian yeast clove and spice, very light however. As it warms I get some dried fruits and some more various spice. Mellow yet very complex.
The tastes follow the nose with rich, sweet maltiness tasting of chocolate, caramel and toasted breadiness. Maybe a sprinkle of brown sugar and dark candy sugar. Flavors of figs and golden raisins and Red Delicious apples emerge as it warms. There is a slight Belgian yeastiness (spice and clove) to balance the sweeter malt flavors. 
Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied with perfectly balanced medium carbonation. Finishes sweet and resoundingly fruity with a lingering vinous dryness.
Overall this is a perfect example of what a Belgian Dubbel should be. It took all of my effort to not devour my half-a-glass because I really wanted to enjoy this. Is it worth the price tag, probably not. It is amazing, definitely. I have been trying to track one down for a while and when it if offered to you for free, you say F-Yes! Recommended and definitely worth tracking down as long as you don't break the bank or trade the cellar for it. 1,398 charactersclaspada, Nov 14, 2011

Review from notes:
Pours a dark amber/brown color w/ a beautiful two finger cocoa head. Fantastic lacing on my tulip glass, and it sticks around until I wash the glass. Fantastic for the style. Nose consists of caramel, raisin, figs, cinnamon, spice, other fruits, and yeast. Super complex nose, and constantly improving and changing. By the time this beer is fully warmed, the nose gets bumped from a 4.5 to a 5. The taste... Words can't describe the taste. It's constantly changing, swirling in a cauldron of awesomeness. The profile is similar to the nose, w/ some fresh baked bread in there for good measure. I can't think of a single thing to improve here- thus the perfect score. Feel is super silky and smooth, with different amazing things happening to your mouth as you experience this brew. Full bodied, and perfect. Overall, I was blown away by this beer. Major props to BA Huhzubendah for sharing it w/ me. Cheers! 1,019 charactersjayhawk73, Nov 12, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Found this at a bar in Brugges. I was excited to try it. It poured very nicely into a chalice. There was not much head, but the color was a beautiful brown, cloudy, with particles in it. It smelled sweet; plum, sugar and faint alcohol. The taste is excellent, very sweet but complex, fruit and sugar with slight bitterness. The mouthfeel was surprisingly crisp. That said it was not thin. I actually preferred this to the 12. One of the best beers I have ever had. Try it if you get a chance. 492 charactersmentaltraveller, Nov 10, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance. Pours a hazy, deep brown with a little amber coming through. Two fingers of thick, creamy off-white head that painst the sides of the glass.
Smell. Caramel, rum, vanilla, and dark, dried fruits. All big and bold. A little almond and spices like nutmeg, ginger.
Taste. Raisins, rum, caramel. Just a little apple, nutmeg and ginger along with belgian yeast. Finishes quite clean and alcohol is well hidden. Really nice.
Mouthfeel. Medium body with smooth, medium carbonation.
Drinkability. Very nice and the best I've tried of the style. Lots going on in here and it all works well together. Glad to have tried this. 630 charactersRutager, Nov 08, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5One year old bottle poured into my Westvleteren glass (opened to celebrate the acquisition of the "Pierre d'abbaye" box!). Time for me to review this beer!
A: Dark brown in color with mahogany glints. Retains longly at 1 finger. Very appealing!
S: Very impressive for a dubbel. Lots of dark fruits in there : plums, grapes, figs. A bit phenolic also.
T: A bit of acidity on the palate. Then it is a nice blend of sweet malts, dark fruits. It is also bready and yeasty as expected from a Trappist ale. Light bitterness of the finish. The taste is very complex for a dubbel (I would rather have listed it as a Belgian Strong Dark Ale).
M: Good attack on the palate. A bit too watery. Nice carbonation.
O: A very good beer. Marked with its Trappist seal. Something between a blue Chimay and a Rochefort 10. Love it ! 818 charactersFux, Nov 05, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Looks really nice. A tight cream head forms which really clings to the glass. Similar colour to Chimay Blue, deep brown with some golden highlights.
This actually smells pretty fresh, which I think it is. I get a remarkable amount of european spicy/herbal hop presence. Heaps of complexity, the phenolic, ester and malt profiles are all intermingled superbly. This is a very impressive smelling beer.
Balance. These guys know how to put a beer together. I can't really be bothered putting it all in to text, but the elements present here are obvious, and all come together wonderfully. It's drier than I expected, in the most wonderful way. If this is a Dubbel, this is what all other Dubbels should aim to be.
Pretty spritzy carbonation supports a lovely rich malt body. Again, just so well balanced.
Honoured to be able to try this beer. Great. 850 charactersjbowers56, Nov 04, 2011
3.76/5  rDev -16.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Got this in a BIF - my last of the main Westvleteren lineup to try. 3.12.12 on the cap
A- Body is a cloudy dark brown hue. Pours with a foamy 1-2 finger eggshell head. This retains nicely at 1 finger and leaves behind little lacing in the glass. 
S- Nose is moderate to strong in strength. Cola, raisins, and a mild to moderate alcohol strength.
T- Dry raisin and plum flavors upfront with a very mild bready backbone that has a hint of peppery spice. The spiciness slightly intensifies for the finish as the other flavors fade minimally and a bit of alcohol astringency comes through for the finish as well as a hint of cola. Left to linger are hints of plum, raisin, spice, and a big alcohol heat.
M- Medium to high carbonation and a medium weight body with a mild breadiness as well as a mild alcohol consistency.
O- 12 and 6 were fantastic, 8 is well done; but its not as good as I was expecting. It reminds me of the Rochefort lineup. 944 charactersPittBeerGirl, Oct 29, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Deep mahogany in color with a thin, beige head. Aroma of sugar and spice.
First taste is, well, very much like a Dr. Pepper, if Dr. Pepper was delicate, complex and even more delicious. Velvety smooth in the mouth, with hints of black cherry, green apple, toffee, some subtle spices, and biscuit. Finishes dry and crisp, and ever so slightly sweet.
Unique, complex and deeelicious. 383 charactersRockyTopHeel, Oct 20, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: Pours a dark chestnut brown with a strong light tan head. Relatively clear body with some sediment at the bottom. 
S: Figs , caramel, dark plum and brandy aromas coming off the top with no problems at all. This has a lot more aroma than I had expected and for a dubbel is outstanding. 
T: Strong caramel pouring off my tongue, with figs and toffee, sweet caramelized sugars and dark fruit. The aftertaste is even amazing with bold flavors that I have never tasted this strong in a dubbel. Really this impressed me above and beyond what I had expected. I really enjoyed the 12, but the 8 takes the cake for me. Much more flavorful and interesting in my opinion. The aftertaste flavors are bready, yeasty and full of caramel that is dry and candied , almost a baked cookie flavor of butter and caramel. 
M: Near perfect mouthfeel. For a dubbel, it could be a little thicker, but it is hard to argue with how drinkable it is in its current state. Easily drinkable and a medium to light carbonation.
O: Hands down best dubbel out there that I have had. Glad I hauled this back with me as a single bottle from Amsterdam. 1,122 charactersalpinebryant, Oct 19, 2011
4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle into a Delirium tulip at low altitude.
A: Pours a beautiful opaque ruby color with a creamy three-finger head. Great lacing as well.
S: A complex mix of dark fruits, spices and sweet caramel. All of the aromas complement each other brilliantly. A slight bit of alcohol comes through as it warms.
T: Incredibly complex but seamlessly constructed. Dark fruit notes up front give way to spices and malty caramel. There's a slight bit of bitterness afterwards that fades away completely on the finish. So many flavors I can't even begin to describe, but they all come together as one delicious whole.
M: Probably my favorite aspect of all of the Westvleterens I've had the privilege of trying. It has a way of delightfully tingling the whole inside of your mouth while going down silky smooth. Absolutely perfect in this respect.
D: Masterfully crafted and delicious. I really doubt I'll ever taste another dubbel this good. Obviously not the easiest beer to get, but it does not disappoint. 1,015 charactersschlimenhaumer, Oct 17, 2011
4.93/5  rDev +10%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is the third time I've had this beer, and reviewing it now seems like a good idea. It's quite an exceptional brew.
Pouring a shiny, clean brown like that of a nut shell. Looks great topped with an off-brown head that is a cross between dense and soft. Sticky lacing. 
Fruit aroma. Orchard fruits like apple, some cherry. Spice and sweet bread. This smells wonderful yet not quite a '5' as the hint of alcohol allows the apple aroma to sneak off. 
Fantastic flavor. Simple it seems, but when you try to nail down the flavor you find out that there are many. The apple, cherry, vanilla, caramel, nutmeg, some cardamon, red plum and raisin. Just to name a few. Banana comes and goes, so too does licorice. But none stand out. They blend well, and taking time to drink this beer is impossible. It just goes down great. 
Nice finish, nothing gets in the way of another sip. Superb 884 charactersMebuzzard, Oct 14, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Part of a pack bought at the Abbey a couple of years back, decided to broach one of them at last.
Poured into the glass that came in the pack (a chalice): everything went in, the sediment arriving half way through the pour.
Deep auburn brown body with a rich looking creamy head sat above.
The nose is complex and delightful, huge fruit esters, both dried and fresh, malty goodness and walnut whips (for the Brits reading this) all seem to vie for position within the aromas.
The taste follows along the same lines, with the vanilla from the walnut whip asserting it's self a little more, but not taking over in any way. What a lovely balanced Dubbel, certainly the best I've ever had in my fairly long life. I can now see what all the fuss is about, later this evening I'm having one of my Westy 12's really looking forward to that, what a night I'm having.
Rich, deep and very, very enjoyable, my sweet tooth just loves this, I thought the Westmalle Dubbel was superb, but this knocks socks off it in all departments, a wonderful beer from start to finish. 1,063 charactersBlackHaddock, Oct 13, 2011

T - absolutely brilliant. once again dark fruit sweet malts and a brilliant sour edge to it at the end thats not overpowering and offers just the right pucker.
M - low carbonation lighter bodied for the style. a bit of puckering from the sour taste at the end.

A: Murky brown pour with a nicely sized light brown head. A ton of sediment in this one, hope that's normal.
S: Boozy, caramel malts, Belgian yeasts and must candied sugar. Smells like this Dubbel has some meat to it.
T: The taste on this is out of this world. The perfect Dubbel. Musty, dark fruits, booze, candied sugar. Balanced perfectly, sweet, robust, delicious.
MF: Full body, carbonated well, bit of a dry finish.
O: Insanely drinkable, delicious, balanced. Phenomenal. 503 charactersrusswbeck, Oct 06, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5After trying the Blonde (BPA) from Westvleteren it was on to the 8. Poured into a Rochefort goblet, it's a murky brown color with a finger or so of head that dissipated pretty quickly. The color is exactly what you'd want from the style.
The nose is great, caramel and dark fruits with a sweet inviting tone to them. Very little hops and no alcohol presence at all. The yeast funk present from the blonde ale is still here but the sweeter notes push it to the background.
The taste is a great carry-over from the aroma, rich and sweet with contrarian sour notes that balance perfectly. There is still a noticeable funk from the yeast strains and a slight hop flavor but they are both minimized by the excellent taste up front.
Just like the Blonde, this one is a real treat to drink, the carbonation and body are spot on and the alcohol is barely there. 
A fantastic dubbel, one of the best I've ever drank. If I lived in Belgium I'd have these in the fridge non-stop. 972 characterstheboozecruise, Oct 05, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5As with the Westy 12, thanks to Thijs Brabander for helping me to procure this amazing beer. I opened this beauty up for my 2nd wedding anniversary (felt that drinking a great "dubbel" was appropriate for this day).
A: Poured into a Trappist Westvleteren chalice. Heavy carbonation is apparent. 2 finger thick white head that dissipates relatively quickly. Rich, dark brown in appearance. Looks similar to the 12 in my opinion.
S: Delicious yeast and sweet, dark fruits predominate. Undertones of fresh baked bread. No hop aroma detected.
T: Amazing. Like the nose, heavy yeast (although not as heavy as the Westy 12) and dark fruits predominate. Sweet on the tongue. No hop bitterness. A little brown sugary/molasses ending. Delicious.
M: Easy drinker with only the 8% ABV. Love the yeasty sweet aftertaste. My only gripe, if I have one, is that I actually wish it had a little less carbonation.
Overall, this is by far my favorite dubbel. I haven't had many that didn't leave a lot of banana aftertaste. This one doesn't...and that's why I love it. Glad I have 2 more saved up for other special occasions. Truly an amazing beer. 1,135 charactersbcostner1, Oct 03, 2011
4.34/5  rDev -3.1%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Old tasting notes from last year.
Served in a Chimay Chalice. 
Murky dark brown with a 1 finger off white head and no lacing.
Smell is much like the taste, but a little less substantial. Very warm and wintery. Dark fruits, spice, cocoa, funk.
Doughy. Baking spices. Very mild chocolate notes. Less flavorful and rich when compared to Westy 12, but still very smooth and tasty. Ultimate dubbel flavor. The yeast is very present.
Medium body. Decent carbonation.
Not quite as funky and sour as Westy 12, but also not as flavorful. Drinkability is slightly higher, but quality is slightly lower. 597 charactersaficionado, Sep 25, 2011

Cap date 10.09.13
Dark brown cloudy, sediment at bottom of my fat tulip glass. Not a big head and what there was which dissipates quickly.
Yummy bready, dark fruit flavor. Intense. Not much alcohol taste but definitely there as evidenced by the warming character. Exudes the loving dedication of its producers.
I'm wowed. I didn't know what to expect, deliberately didn't read any reviews before tasting. I'm not a big dubbel drinker but this one is definitely worth repeating if I get the opportunity. 577 charactersheymikew, Sep 20, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into a snifter.
Appearance: Pours a murky reddish brown with a finger and a half of off white head. The retention is great and it clings to the glass nicely.
Smell: A bit sweet with some dark fruit and cherry notes. Mildly tart with some Belgian yeast spice.
Taste: Not as sweet as I was expecting. There is a strong cherry note along with some other dark fruits. A very mild sour note, not sure if it is supposed to be there or not. The finish is malty with a very mild bitterness.
Mouthfeel: The body is just on the thick side of medium. The carbonation is extremely smooth with a dry finish.
Overall: A very good Dubbel, but didn't quite live up to my expectations, which were admittedly high. The cherry notes were very pleasant and everything blended together quite nicely. 804 charactersoline73, Sep 19, 2011
3.83/5  rDev -14.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Big thanks to jrallen34 for this 11.2 oz bottle. Date on the cap is August 2013. Poured into a snifter. Pours chestnut brown with good clarity and a light cappuccino colored huge creamy head. The head retention is good, and so is the lacing.
 The aroma is very sharp and almost pungent at times! More phenolic and yeasty, and less sweet smelling than 12; there is ample toasty caramel goodness from the dark sugars, and hints of fruit and chocolate, but there's a strong phenolic character too. A note or two of alcohol that I don't mind one bit.
 Fruity sweet with dark fruit on the palate with the yeast/byproducts present all along. Not quite as tannic as the bigger Quads, but still bitter and cleansing at the end. Very clean finish with some warmth lingering. The body is medium and the carbonation rather low. It's good, actually very good, but I doubt I'll have it by myself again. Considering it's tougher to come by, more so than 12, I think it'll be best shared. There are equally good or better off the shelf Quads for regular drinking.

4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into an official Westvleteren chalice glass. Much thanks to Jeffo for the trade. Cap is dated 12.05.13.
Out of the bottle she pours a somewhat mix of foamy and good retention head. The color is a very light tan but also picks up the body giving a purpleish hue. Body is clear but not see through due to is dark purple brown and walnut like appearance. While drinking this beer always leaves a solid puck on top, but doesn't really leave any lacing.
Nose is kind of small muted and subtle. Whiffs of fruit cherries and grapes, slight sweetness. Pop of the cap brings some yeast punch. The nose though becomes more obvious after a few sips when going back to it however.
Palate is diverse and complicated. A rush of cherries and fruit grape. Powdery malt comes in the middle with a tonic water tolerable qunine finish. Tannic sense feeling like from a wooden barrel, dry red table wine without the vinous character. Carbonation is noticeable but not overpowering anything and mild chocolate just a hint on the finish too. The grape sensation just takes over after some time, it's everywhere after some noticeable sips and warmth.
Overall impressive palate more than anything else. Neat even though this is not a favorite style of mine in general. These guys know what they are doing, just don't ask me how?! 1,332 characterssmakawhat, Sep 16, 2011

A –Hazy dark brown with some carbonation, the head is bubbly and vanishing fast, but a thin layer remains.
S – Strong smell of yeast some hops and fruits (cherries and raisins).
T – The taste is at first cherries and dark blue berries, there is some sweetness but very nicely balanced with the alcohol and bitterness. Sweeter than you expect after the smell. Although you smelled the cherries in the back the taste of cherries up front is quite a surprise. 
M – Very nice, a good bubble explosion in your mouth, maybe a bit to much but still very nice because it is long lasting..
O – A very good double, very good indeed. It just gets better after each gulp you take. 749 charactersMar02x, Sep 02, 2011

Pours foggy,deep amber in color with rubi hues to the light.Creamy,close & lasting froth,beige in color.An incredible all around lacing bed created by small & concentraded bubbles. Bread yeast & caramel malt aromas, prune aromas.Subtle fresh flavor hints followed by anisette notes round nose feeling.Sweet bitter at fist sip. Slightly toffee flavor wraps a medium body.Palate is fulled up by raisin & molasses. Gentle carbonation. ABV is so well camouflated that only a kindly brandy flavor reveals alcohol presence. A perfect balanced beer. Excelent drinkability. Comments: One of the best prey I´ve catched in my more than 35 years as a beer hunter.Pairing:Nothing at all. An amazing experience should not be cloudy by anything.Nevertheless if you´re lucky enough to have more than one of this, fresh bread rolls & banana will match pretty well. 918 charactersGONZALOYANNA, Aug 21, 2011

S: Dark malt and yeast, sweet fruit, some herbal and spice notes with a hint of alcohol.
T: Lots of sweet bready malt, a bit of yeast and some balancing hop bitterness. Dark fruit and herbs come through as the malt notes fade a bit. The alcohol blends in with all the other flavors so well that it is barely detectable besides the slight warmth after each sip.
M: Really rich and creamy medium body with low-moderate carbonation that puts a nice tingle on my tongue.
O: Absolutely delicious dubbel, easily the best that I have had to date. Really drinkable for 8% ABV and every sip is packed with tons of flavor. Wish I had another one. 916 charactersAzurescens, Aug 16, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Many thanks to very venerable Thijs (Brabander) for this. I've had it for quite some time now and given the recent spate of grey gloomy wet weather I figured there was no better time than the now.
Dynamite smell in the bottle before being poured into a Westvleteren glass. Looks good there too with a dark bown sparkle and orangy highlights but the 8's decent appearance really cloaks the greatness of this beer. There is no big super rocky head to disorient your senses and distract you from any shortcomings like other (supposed) 'world class' beers . Instead you're immediately hit by a near perfect roasty almost nutty smokey slightly medicinal smell. 
The taste if of some darkish chocolate earthiness with just the perfect interplay of some sweetness and just a dash of soya. Unbelievably super complex flavour which just evolves, evolves and evolves in the glass. Wicked dryness too and a very well integrated thought provoking firm strong slightly acidic backbone.
Amazed that I I almost like this as much as the 12. The 8, well, its another high octane tasty austere effort from those Westvleteren folks. Just what I would expect. And my expectations are pretty heavenly. 
Hallelujah. 1,195 charactersZimbo, Aug 12, 2011

A-Opens with a loud hiss. Pours deep burgundy with over 2 inches of thick, foamy light tan head. Deflates, leaving rings of sticky lacing and a fat cap of foam.
S-Unbelievably complex. Candied raisins, beet sugar, brown sugar, madeira and earthy hops. Can't wait to drink this.
T/M-The mouth feel on this is exceptionally smooth and mellow. Light, supportive carbonation, velvety soft texture. Can't see this getting any better with age than it is right now. It's difficult to do justice to how much is going on with this beer. Flavors of rose petal and lavender layered over a blanket of fine brown sugar and toffee flavors. Slightly oaky,with a refined estery yeast flavor. The finish is dry and warming.
O-Best dubbel I've ever had, hands down. As I see it, this is the one to beat. Good luck with that. 889 charactersDaveHS, Aug 12, 2011
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Thanks CaseyK for a chance at this one! Bottle is from 1985 and cap says "EXTRA 8" on it. Pours a medium brown with a reddish-orangey tint to it with a very slight head. Nose is a nice collection of dark fruit and caramel breadiness, including big plum. The taste is fantastic - a lot of plum, pear, prune, with a bit of breadiness. Crazy smooth and easy to drink. Very light carbonation with a pretty light body. We speculated whether this was brewed with plum puree. This dubbel held up with no problem at all and just blew us away. The only problem was that I only had a few ozs. Would love another to compare. One of the better beers I've had. In my experience, the Westy 12 wasn't worth the effort relative to other Quads (still good though). This beer, granted it has a ton of age, was totally worth the effort. 817 charactersseeswo, Aug 06, 2011

Pours a dark brown with a red tinge. The head lingers and has great lacing. 
The smell is complex, yeasty, and sweet with a little bit of booze. It is really quite a unique smell.
The taste is crazy complex. It is semisweet and bready, but the carbonation makes it lighter than you would think. It has a great mouth feel and it warms your whole body as you drink it. 
This is an incredible beer. I have one stored away for a good day and I can't wait to drink it with a little age on it. 561 charactersmsfoster77, Aug 05, 2011

A slow gusher here, so beware and have the glassware at the ready. Pours dark brown with a fluffed, off-white head. Retention and lacing are fairly decent.
Nose is an amazing blend of sourdough bread and raspberry fruitiness. So deep is the bready aspect, I thought I was drinking a loaf of dark brown bread. Caramel maltiness lends some sweetness. Wow, just an amazing smelling brew.
Toasty, deep sweetbread with a zesty yeast bite. Not hoppy, but has a drying effect similar to a spiced winter warmer. A unique, bready belgian beer that I would happily buy again were it more readily available. The questability and rarity of the beer is a bit of a turnoff for me though to actively seek out. Thanks again Dan, I really enjoyed it. 820 characterstwiggamortis420, Jul 30, 2011
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Westy 8 pours out a dark ruby color, clear initially but it grows hazier toward the bottom due to the yeast present at the bottom of the bottle. About 2.5" of very light tan head forms, that (not unexpectedly) has great retention and lacing. Very well crafted beer.
Smell: Lots of dark fruits are apparent immediately. A bit of candied sugar as well, and some yeastiness. A lot of great esters show as well....it's been a while since I've had a quality Belgian. The esters are always one of my favorite parts.
Taste: Dark fruits and candied sugar come to mind immediately when I take a sip. A bit of yeastiness as well, and a nice estery kick at the end. Extremely tasty....this is without doubt the best dubbel I have had.
Mouthfeel/Overall: Light mouthfeel....but the carbonation is so fine and so abundant that it results in a pillowy mouthfeel. Very nice. Overall, like I said, the far and away the best dubbel I have ever had. Many dubbels come across as yeast and wet cardboard to me, but this beer does much more than that. Extremely impressive. 1,067 characterszhanson88, Jul 30, 2011

Single bottle courtesy of Jeffo as part of the Great Ontarian Westy Trade of 2011. Cheers and many thanks Jeff for bringing a crate of this back to Canada to share with some eager BAs!
Poured into a Chimay goblet to show some trappist solidarity, shared with my wife as part of our anniversary celebrations. A tawny, cherry-juice coloured brew, which admittedly is not that much to look at. Big frothy head though, with some lovely visible bubbles along the side. Thin ring survives.
And then you smell it...
I don't want to exaggerate, but the nose on this...kind of a big deal. Delicious to the point where I would probably pay to sniff a recently-used glass. Lightly browned sugar, port, brandy, raisin, grape, a bit of earth and 
spices combine to make something truly special. 
The taste is every bit as wonderful as the nose suggested it would be. Port and dark fruit, a lovely sugary sweetness, but with a firm malt background and enough hops to provide a light finishing bitterness. Coffee or chocolate make appearances somewhere near the finish. The finest dubbel I have as yet come across. 
After a quick carbonation burnoff, the brew takes on a terrific mouthfeel, with lovely easy carbonation and a moderate body which coats the tongue well. A lasting bitter finish.
Sublime. I'm not going to make any bold statements about this beer's status as the "best ever" (I haven't opened the 12 yet!), but rest assured this brew is certainly worthy of the hype and is certainly amongst the very best brews the world can offer. Worth navigating the tricky ordering process (or better yet, a fortuitous trade!) Truly fantastic stuff, and I really wish I had more of this. 1,881 charactersJohnnyBarman, Jul 21, 2011
4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Tried the evening after my bottle of Westvleteren 12, and a couple of days before my bottle of Westvleteren Blond.
Pours a hazed reddish brown colour, beautifully bright and gradiented when held to light. The head, just like the 12, is insanely fine and creamy. It's an absolutely crowning joy, leaving thick sheeting lace down the inside of the glass. Carbonation is extremely fine. Again, the body is lighter than expected, but overall, this is a magnificent looking beer. I'd have to say with the brilliant gemlike colouring, this looks even better than the 12. Just phenomenal.
Nose is mild and hazed with subtle conflicting flavours. certainly hints of booze, along with hot popcorn, resin, red grape skin, quite tannic and tight, and very little residual sweetness. Nice.
On the palate, the tannic red wine comes through more, and the lack of sweetness becomes more prominent. It gains a sharp, almost raw tobacco character, with a lingering bitterness. There's a creamy feel from the brilliantly fine carbonation, but I genuinely feel I'd like more sweetness. Still, the complexity of the dark tannins is impressive, and it is pleasantly sharp and refined.
Another cracking Belgian from the little masters, and another beer worthy of seeking out. I was thoughtful I might like this even better than the 12, being as though the Dubbel is a particular favourite of mine, but there's no doubting the superiority of the Quad. This was a stellar beer; the 12 was phenomenal. 1,480 characterslacqueredmouse, Jul 20, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5330 ml bottle shared with tasting group (approx. 10 year old bottle):
Pours a slightly hazy deep amber color with some floaties and a beautiful large fluffy beige head.
The aroma on this is something to savor. Big candy like sweetness, caramel, brown sugar, port, slightly oxidized but not in a bad way, and dark fruit. I had to pause and take all of this in for a moment. 
The flavor is first class as well. There was some consensus with my tasting group that this was even better than the Westy 12 we had tasted earlier. It has a very sugary caramel maltiness , vinous and port-like, multiple fruits: plum, dates, black cherry, all well integrated with each other. The alcohol is non existent which makes this dangerous if I had more around. 
Mouthfeel is medium full and silky smooth. This was a real treat picked up in an early trade with alldaydrinker. I would rate this slightly higher than the Westy 12. 914 charactersajsdad06, Jul 20, 2011

Purchased through Cracked Kettle, Netherlands
Price - $13.49/33cl bottle (U.S.)
Pours with a two inch soapy white head and legs that crawl all over the side of the chalice. The beer is burgundy in color with a hazey appearance. Highly carbonated with streams of bubbles throughout the glass. Chunks of yeast appear as you near the end of the bottle. 
The nose is rich with dark fruit, pears, chocolate and candy sugar. The sweet smell of fruit is refreshing and not bitter. As the beer warms you can pick up the yeast aroma. 
The flavor isn't as sweet as the nose would imply. Belgian yeast, malt, dark fruit, spices and hops. 
The mouthfeel is soft and smooth with a medium body. Has plenty of carbonation without going overboard. Some earthy hops add some bitterness and dry feel to the finish.
Overall a pretty good beer. I'm not sure if I'll continue to dish out the high dollars for it though. I know of one competitor that is just as good if not better and I can purchase it right off the shelf. Still a pleasure to have. 1,050 characters05Harley, Jul 09, 2011

4.05/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Jason for bringin this along with a Westy 12! Pours a murky brown color with a medium tan-white head that sticks around for a bit. Scent is full of dark fruit with a bit of a sour apple aroma. Not nearly as much going on as the 12 has. Taste initially a tart green apple flavor which is immediately followed with a lot of lovely chocolate flavors. Dark fruits and a bit of spiciness as well. Well balanced. Mouthfeel is very dry, possibly one of the most dry dubbels I've had, which is not a bad thing at all. Drinkability is high. Overall, this is probably the best dubble I've ever had. I do enjoy the Quads and Tripels more, but this is great for what it is. Very tasty beer! 688 charactersDovaliHops, Jun 24, 2011

Cap date: 08.10.13
A: pours a beautiful hazelnut ale with exceptional clarity. 2 fingers of peanut skin skIn foam falls soo slow and even then leaves a wonderful stack of quilted equivalence of the same. Near sheet lacing. 
S: first thought: buttered popcorn and vanilla beans. As it warms some praline, raisin come thru, but nothing to save it. 
T: alcohol is very forward here. Solvent. Some graham, dark prunes, but the alcohol is very evident. Not impressed. 
M: creamy as fuck. Great resonance and the finish is silken. Really like the feel here. The carbonation is immediate, passive and constant. It's really fine bubbles that create the exceptional feel. 
O: not the worst dubbel I've had, where it disappoints is in the wrong places. 784 charactersharrymel, Jun 22, 2011

3.98/5  rDev -11.2%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5A gift my boyfriend brought back for me from Belgium.
A: Like the bottle that contains it, the color was nothing of note -- translucent chestnut color that many beers of its kind have.
S: The smell was delightful, of flan (a type of custard found in Spanish speaking countries). It was intoxicating.
T: Nutella and flan were the prominent flavors. The undertones were subtle jams and gentle bitterness.
M: Light, smooth and slightly creamy.
O: It's a light version of St. Bernardus 8, which I favor over Westvleteren 8. Way too much hype. It's a great dubbel, but there are better ones out there.
Still, it's much better than Westvleteren 12. 648 charactersheterotopia, Jun 12, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle into a Duvel tulip. Thanks to my buddy Jim for sharing this with me, my first Westvleteren.
A: Clear, deep ruby body under a perfect inch of eminently creamy tan foam. The lovely head slowly collapses into a solid cap, leaving some nice chunks of foam. A swirl reignites things easily, leaving more lace each time. Beautiful brew.
S: Sweet, fruity, and amazing. Creme bruleé toastiness, caramel, port, raisin, date, and chocolate. Complex, delicate, and incredibly smooth. Fantastic.
T: Lots of raisin, lots of caramel. Sweet candied plum. Chocolate on the finish. Delicious, but not quite as complex or delicate as the incredible nose.
M: Soft, creamy, and moderately charged with the most delicate bubbles imaginable. Perfect.
O: I'm giving this one a strong A+, but part of that is the style: this is head and shoulders above any Dubbel I've ever tried, and it just does everything that one could ask a Dubbel to do - based largely on the Westvleteren mystique, though, I expected it to do something more. Perhaps it was impossible not to be disappointed. All expectations aside, the beer is terrific, and the pairing of it with a delicious Neuhaus chocolate was, in a word, divine.

4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought at the Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam.
Appearance: Pours a nice, dark color with a thick, creamy head.
Smell: At first, it smells like a sour-dough bread (just like Westvleteren 12). Then you notice other fruits in the smell. I also noticed hints of chocolate.
Taste: Definitely 1st class. Extremely delicious. I actually enjoyed this more than Westvleteren 12. Definitely a noticeable hop presence, but it is complemented by dark fruits. I drank this much faster than I expected to -- given its 8% ABV. The beer definitely masks the strong alcohol content. 
Mouthfeel: No complaints. Just enough carbonation. A nice medium body.
Overall: If it was more readily accessible, I would drink this fine beer daily. If you have a chance to buy it, DO IT. 757 charactersmcguirmn, Jun 02, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle into Westvleteren goblet at In Da Vrede Cafe, Westvleteren, Belgium. I had me fair share of these while I was there; I was waiting to pick up me reservation of 48 Westvleteren blonde, which I managed to do on foot with a photocopy of a USA car registration. At least it saves you the cost of the crate deposit. 
A: Two fingers of marvelous cream and thickness. Dark amber-caramel colour, almost black. Very appealing. 
Sm: Caramel and nuts. Hoppy. A moderate strength scent, but certainly a wonderful one. 
T: Dark fruit and some nuts. The dark fruit is a bit like the Westy 12, but lessened to accomodate the nuts. A sour fruit finish with notes from the nose. Very complex. Plum and cherry come through. I love the fruit undertones. Perfectly balanced. Well built for the style. 
Mf: Silky smooth and wonderful. Very delicate and soft. Exquisite cream. Again, very similar to the Westy 12. I don't know how they make the mouthfeel of such a complex and high ABV beer so fragile and delicate; it's just beyond me. It's truly masterful brewing. Perfect. 
Dr: I'll pound it all night like it's Megan Fox. Not as good as the 12, but still an amazing beer. I think too often this beer gets compared with the 12 unfavorably, which is so difficult to avoid. Taken out of the shadow of the 12, it's a magnificent beer in its own right. This beer can almost have a tendency to feel like its a step on the staircase towards the 12, but it ought to be considered outside this context, as in terms of the Dubbel style, it's hard to do better. An amazing beer all things considered. Very affordable when purchased at the abbey and not from the douchenozzle ebayers. Obviously its availability is a constraining factor. 1,719 characterskojevergas, Jun 01, 2011

A: Deep, dark, muddy mahogany color with a nice ruby tint. Creamy almond-colored head.
S: Cave water. This one really took me back to a tour that I was on of Howe Caverns many years ago. Also got raisins, figs, plums, dark sweet malts and some floral notes.
T: Mostly the same as the smell with some yeast flavor and slight bitterness. Alcohol is well masked but the warmth is noticeable during the finish.
M: Medium-bodied with good carbonation. Smooth, silky and creamy. 
O: I have severely underestimated Westvleteren and I will be sure to seek out as much of this as possible. This one is definitely the benchmark that I will be comparing all dubbels to.. until something else blows me away of course. 831 charactersmonsterzero, May 18, 2011
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle at In de Vrede. My second time having this beer there. From notes.
A - Poured a dark brown with red notes. Creamy one finger beige head. Some slight filmy lacing was left and typical head retention that looked really good.
S - Good dark fruit aroma. Quite nice. Some hop and yeast as well. 
T - Spice fairly obvious. Yeast, booze, and more yeast. Dark fruit dominated by the yeast character and spice mixed in. A little sweet.
M - Medium to full body and good carbonation with a slight alcoholic note in the finish.
O/D - Good beer. Nice dark fruit flavour mixed with other well represented elements. I think this is the weakest of the Westvleteren beers with the Blonde being my second favourite but this was still very drinkable and very tasty. And like all the other Westy beers, so smooth and extremely easy to drink 3 before you notice you finished 1. 868 charactersbylerteck, May 17, 2011
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4330mL from In De Vrede. I'm not a big Westy 8 fan. 12? Yes. Blonde? Even more so yes.
A- Pours a cloudy mahogany to deep, hazed amber with a thin, khaki head. 
N- Bready, yeasty, lots of boozy caramel, brown sugar, dark fruits. 
T- Sweet, lots of candi sugar, plums, figs, brown sugar. 
P- Soft, mild carbonation, milk chocolate rich, slightly oily. 
Really not any better than your normal Dubbel. Prolonged aging seems to give this more lemon, chalk, and mustiness whereas the 12 gains oil, ganache, heavy butter, and melted chocolate. 
Definitely my least favorite of the Westy bunch. 592 characterstarheels86, May 04, 2011

Nice estery yeast flavors. Really no hint of the alcohol in this beer. Little bit of nutty quality. Dryer mouthfeel than anticipated but some flavor sticking around.

S - For the record, I could smell this beer from two feet away. Sweet with a little spice with lots of malt. Rich.
T - Very similar to the twelve especially in the mouthfeel. Not quite as intense in flavor but by far the best dubbel I've had.
M - Not as dry as the 12 but still a faint dryness lingers in the finish and aftertaste. Westvleteren beers have the best mouthfeel I've ever encountered. Perfect balance that compliments the flavors on all three. 
O - Another mind blowing beer from Westvleteren. 606 charactersloobear, May 02, 2011

Appearance - Dark clear ruby black body. A bit lighter than the Westy 12. Frothy offwhite silky head. Also with great lacing. no visible sediment for the first pour. During the 2nd bottle, I took the 3rd pour and got all the sediment. It was considerably darker than anyone elses pour, due to the sediment. It was basically black even when held directly to the lightbulb.
Smell - Smells like a cross between the westy 12 and the blonde. a bit corny and a bit medicinal. Not in a bad way. That's just the best i can describe it. pretty exotic for the style, but that's a westy for you. 
Taste - Wow. This is the 3rd westy i've had tonight. Another A+ from me. These guys really know what they're doing. this is a bit more bitter than the other westy's but only but a slight amount. And unless you had them back to back you might not even notice.
Mouthfeel - Great mouthfeel. Creamy with great carbonation. 
Overall - juset a superb beer. I cannot overstate how satisfied i've been with the westvleteren experience tonight. I know overhyping something is the best way to ruin it, but as long as you come to this beer with the proper mindset, you're sure to enjoy them. 1,333 charactersZenAgnostic, May 02, 2011
3.85/5  rDev -14.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Murky brown body but a perfect tight head that grows aggressively , settles, then retains very well with red hot lace down my wine glass.
The nose unfortunately is dominated by acetaldehyde. Just underneath is warming aclohols, christmas fruits of raisins and figs and faint dry dark malt and hop notes. As it warms, the acetone gives out a touch to the other flavours.
Brown sugar, fig and raisins, caramel, dark grain, carob, and warming alcohol all obvious. Drys out through the middle with more cereal grains and a delicious chewy body with good carb levels.
I'd started righting a negative review. Beer was too cold. School girl error. Although it wasnt really THAT cold, this if far better at around 15 degrees C. I think I enjoyed this more drinking in big chewy mouthfulls rather than dainty sips as well. 816 charactersTrizzle, Apr 26, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.511.2oz bottle poured into a Trappist Westvleteren chalice.
A - Pours a dark brown, less murky and purple than other Belgium dubbels. A big, frothy, 2.5-finger head grows exponentially in the goblet. It's active and noisy, and you can see the carbonation sticking to the glass. The high carbonation keeps the head going for ages and there's a lasting cap that rivals the head for some beers. The lacing quickly breaks apart and slowly slides down the glass.
S - The smell is a little sweeter than other dubbels I've had and is actually surprisingly simple. The main components I'm getting in this beer are grapes, candied sugar, and some alcohol.
T - Thankfully the taste is more complex. The darker fruits come through much more strongly here, including plums, prunes, raisins and grapes, which when combined with the candied sugar, gives it a nice sweetness that lasts throughout the taste. There is a hint of alcohol in the finish but its not astringent at all.
M - Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with good carbonation. Leaves a sweet aftertaste in the mouth and the head gives it some silkiness.
D - Drinkability is high. The nose is a little underwhelming but the taste more than compensates. It's a great dubbel, but not as much as a standout as the Westvleteren 12 is for the Quad category. 1,297 charactersnhindian, Apr 24, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5WOW!
Drank this at the cafe directly across from the abbaye itself so it was super fresh! 
Let me start by saying it is probably close to perfect and I do prefer it over its big brother the 12. It has all the flavours of the 12 without the extra sweetness and is more well rounded.
The balance is impeccable considering the complexity of the brew. The only thing that lets it down is the exclusivity of the beer. This may add to its charm but I may never get to try it again and that really pisses me off!!
If you are lucky enough to get the chance to try it, do not pass it up. A true world class belgian, worthy of its reputation. 633 charactersBisho, Apr 19, 2011

Brown sugar and molasses with notes of spiciness, honey, and bready dark malt. Fainter notes of floral and fruit from yeast. Overall, quite pleasant.

Where to start! So deliciously full of flavor, with amazing combination of dark malt, molasses, spiciness and warmth of alcohol. This is a complex and rich combo, but so so good! The beer definitely lived up to its hype for me. Finishes with a mild bitterness from hops too.
Mouthfeel: 4.5
Creamy soft carbonation with nice moderate viscosity. Very enjoyable.

Such a great beer. So full of flavor that it leaves me a little speechless. I would definitely pay another $30 for it again. Highly recommend. 868 charactersEnemyWithin, Apr 19, 2011

A - Pours a really nice clear Mahogany colour, with a tanned head that does not move and laces the glass.
S - Plenty of stewed dark fruit that includes plum, raisins and a hint of cinnamon. 
T - Very full flavours of dark fruits so perfectly balanced with dark sugars, maybe some lighter fruit present as well. The finish os sublimely smooth and long.
M - Medium to full bodied with medium carbonation and you will struggle to beat the smoothness.
O - I ca see why people prefer this over its big brother, because its even more gentle and almost as complex. Its just so damn smooth and like the 12 takes you on a journey of flavours. 673 characterseric5bellies, Apr 16, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a snifter glass from a bottle with a freshness date of 12.05.13 on the cap. Glass of cold water on the side to sip from periodically. 
Appearance: As poured the beer is a clear dark reddish brown color tinged with orange highlights. The creamy light tan head is ¾” thick as it foams up and then begins to recede slowly leaving lots of lacing on the sides of the glass. Sipping creates a layer of foam that turns into a ring and some leggy lacing as it slides back down to the ring around the glass. The active carbonation feeds a thin layer of foam that coats the surface of the beer.
Smell: The aromas in this beer include caramel tinged with dark fruits (e.g., raisins and plums). There is also a light spiciness (cinnamon?) and a faint touch of alcohol.
Taste: The flavors are rich, complex, and filled with spices and fruits. There is cinnamon, apples, figs and even a trace of pears. They all are woven together in a complex pattern that shift and changes over time.
Mouthfeel: The mouth feel is medium to full bodied and very smooth with moderate carbonation. The finish begins in the fruity flavors from the yeast and malt and then slides into a growing bitterness from the hops, some gentle spiciness and a tail off into dryness. Even after the flavors completely fade the roof of the mouth continues to tingle.
Drinkability and Overall Impression: One word to help understand this beer is “complex.” Another is “smooth.” The drinkability is great here. I could sip on this one all night and would hope someday to have more. My overall impression is that this beer deserves its reputation as a well-made dubbel and that it sets the bar to such a height that others may aspire but don’t really achieve. 1,739 charactersdrtth, Apr 13, 2011

Poured into the Westy trappist glass. 
A: Dark muddy brown hue with a small pinky of tannish head and great lacing around the glass. Pretty ruby highlights also shine through.
S: Great smell with figs, cinnamon, ginger, chocolate tinged cocoa malt, belgian signature yeast strains, licorice notes, caramel and just a touch of banana sweetness. Some flutters of a farmhouse Saison dirtiness in there. 
T: Beautiful taste with a well balanced mix of savory flavors to mix well with meat or cheese, bittersweet middle of the palate, licorice and ripe fruit in the front (beautifully done), and caramel and plum with molasses to boot. Luscious overall. Excellent.

4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I had the opportunity to drink this beer at a local beer bar, and despite it's 12€ price i decided to taste it. It was sure worth the money. 330ml bottle obviously
A- An intense dark burgundy. Head is not big but is extremely dense and shows great retention and lacing
S- Very big but not at all arrogant malty aroma. Malts are on the bread side, but a strong and rich alcohol smell, that is perfectly matched with yeast sweetness to avoid excessive spiciness, brings more complexity. Some dark fruits and prune notes add to the amazing mix
T- After such a complex aroma you may expect a letdown in taste. This is not the case, it's all there. The beer has a strong malty taste as the smell suggested, and this time you may also find some chocolate and liquorice notes underneath. The fruity notes are stronger than in the aroma, with prune and dark fruits as suggested. Alcohol is to be felt, but it has that awesome delicate spicy character that brings even more complexity. The end is dry and cleans the mouth, and leaves you demanding for more. What is amazing with such a great range of flavours is that they are all in the right place at the right time
M- Quite strong body for 8%ABV but still an amazingly smooth creamy feel. A delicate crispness brings some freshness, or otherwise the beer would start feeling heavy
D- Every sip demands another. The beer is amazingly rich, but it leaves a light, sweet and clean aftertaste that leaves room for more and more sips. I finished this much quicker than i would ever expect for an 8%ABV
All so rich and powerful but still so delicate. This is a beer that nears perfection 1,635 charactersCozzatoad, Mar 25, 2011

Appearance: Full carbonation with a wonderfully thick head. Almost cream like.
Smell: Sweet tart granny smith apple (as mentioned by others) almost cider like with some thick sour-dough bread maltiness.
Taste & Mouthfeel: A wonderfully sour crispness blends with a creamy phenol and spiced flavor. Hard to put a name on what I sense. Very complex, almost like a double with hints of a lambic. Very very mild wild yeast overtones. Sourness drifts away into a bitter bite that ends crisp, just like it began
Overall, i like and see why this brewery is known for their complex beers. I hope i get to try the 12 next time. 741 charactersjbonapar, Mar 21, 2011

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to wyoming for a bottle of this brew, the guy who sends me all sorts of crazy stuff from the plains. I have no idea why it's taken me so long to crack open this bottle. Celebrating the return of winter to MN, yeah, that's why. 
Once popped, the foam slowly rises out of the neck. Pour is bark brown with lighter brown flairing out at the edges. Smells of figs, raisins, bootleg booze. An almost sherry-like quality underpins the aroma. 
Westy 8 is a beaut. The sherry in the nose carries over strongly, as a decadent, after-dinner, fruity taste that seems more appropriate to a 3 oz. snifter. More of the dark fruits noted in the nose, plus banana, candied sugar, baking spices. End with a tingly overcarbonation. Makes the beer lighter on its feet, but it's goosed enough to be distracting & a bit on the fizzy side. On the other other, probably raises the drinkability quotient. I find it in my mouth quite often, like, after every other sentence or so. I do need my strength. 
Excellent beer. I hate comparing, but this is much better than the blonde & pretty damn close to being as good as the 12. Fruity, light, drinkable, & different enough from your run-o-the-mill dubbel to put it at the head of the class. I can see why this is highly sought after. 1,267 charactersmaximum12, Mar 13, 2011

Pours a deep dark chestnut brown color which is completely opaque with a one finger off-white head that slowly fades into a thin lasting ring. Minimal spots of lacing left behind.
Spicy, estery aroma with lots of vinous dark fruit, zesty pepper and earthy hops. Complex nose with lots of plum, grape, raisin, fig, date and dark cherry. This is complimented by a nice roasted malt presence with hints of chocolate and caramel and subtle earthy pine. Peppery with coriander as well as hints of yeast/bread, sweet alcohol phenol and licorice. 
Medium bodied with a prominent spicy and hoppy flavor that lingers over the roasted malt body and sweet dark fruit notes into a dry finish. Dry, earthy and slightly bitter with some piny hop flavor which is complimented by the zesty, peppery spice. This is countered mid palate by a slightly roasted chocolate malt backbone with hints of caramel, toffee, biscuit and licorice. Hints of slightly chalky, bready yeast add complexity and fullness to the body. Toward the end of the swallow there is a very prominent vinous dark fruit flavor with hints of fig, raisin, plum, grape and dark cherry. The hops have held up surprisingly well and are very prominent in the flavor profile. The malt and dark fruit notes are enhanced as it warms, balancing things out a bit. ABV is excellently masked with subtle alcohol sweetness but no heat whatsoever making this pretty quaffable. 
Overall, this beer is one of the most interesting trappist beers I've had. It's well balanced but much hoppier than any Belgian beer(in this style) that I have encountered. The malt and dark fruit notes really start to shine as it warms so I highly recommend drinking it at cellar temperature or letting it warm up considerably to enjoy it at it's fullest potential. Not as complex, flavorful or easy to drink as the 12 but it's still pretty good. 1,938 characterscorby112, Mar 04, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A-Pours dark, hazy chestnut color with a thick off white head.
S-Very fruity with notes of pear and apple, maybe just a hint of dark fruits. There was also some alcohol and chocolate present on the nose.
T-Like the nose, fresh fruits such as apple/pear, a hint of chocolate and dark fruits as well. The Belgian yeast is present and it is a little on the sweet side. It is very delicious.
M-Thick with a little carbonation. It really has a nice body to it.
D-Complex and delicious with a just above average abv. make this an enjoyable ale to savor. It is not too heavy so one could enjoy a few bottles in a session.
Overall, this is a truly great beer and very unique. It tasted much fruitier and light than I expected. I really appreciate my friend for sharing part of a bottle with me. Truly a great beer drinking experience and I hope to get some for myself in the future. 879 charactersthegodfather2701, Mar 02, 2011

paired beside a Chimay Red, Westmalle Dubbel, Rochefort 8
A: Pours a dark brown with a hint of reddish tint to it, a small white foam quickly dissipates after pour is finished.
S: Smells like a Belgian. As with most trappist beers, it has that belgian yeast quality to it, it also has some fruity scents, with apple being most prevalent.
T: Surprisingly, a plum-like flavor is most noticeable to me, with some apple in there as well. It finishes with a sweet maltiness to it.
M/D. This beer was pretty light on carbonation, but was still really smooth as it finished. 597 characterscpmichael, Mar 01, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle as part of Westy Wednesday at Volo. Served in a flute.
Poured a dark maroon, opaque with a finger or two of off-white head. Nose of sharp alcohol initially, but then some raisin, ripe green apple skin, ripe plums and some date appears. Taste kicks off with a quick glimpse of the alcohol on the palate, mixed with some stone fruits. Light apple comes through again, hints of brown sugar, vanilla. Alcohol present and prevalent throughout each sip, but only adds to the complexity of this. Light tannic finish. Warming mouthfeel, great body with a finish that lingers forever. Solid drinkability, and an exceptional beer. Best dubbel I've ever had. 655 charactersliamt07, Feb 27, 2011

Pours a murky brown, huge 4 finger head, that leaves nice lacing. Dark fruit is primary on the nose, some spices. The flavors of plums, dates and apples meld very nicely, not overly sweet. The beer is very smooth, it has a slightly sweet finish. The body is medium, smooth, well carbonated. A very smooth, easy drinking beer, I can see why it is a classic. 439 charactersbonkers, Feb 23, 2011

Big thanks to Brad. Amazingly, a darker pour than the 12, really deep brown, a creamy beige head. Aroma of prunes, figs, some maple syrup. Not really a massive burst of fruits and sugars like the 12. Flavor has that really rich, elegant, clean alcohol sugar purity, fresh and exciting. There are a lot of figs, and a slight bittering component of hops on the back end that isn't necessarily welcome here. A little too much carbonation, but still creamy and smooth. Over-ripe bananas play a role as the beer warms. The comparisons to the 12 are inevitable -- this is less of everything but still delicious. 617 charactersJAXSON, Feb 22, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a mud puddle brown color with a moderate dense off-white head that settles into a solid ring.
The aroma is of plums and raisins with some brown sugar. The aroma is on the sweet side of the dubbel spectrum. Not very strong but good.
The flavor also has plum and raisin characteristics, perhaps a hint of fruit punch and clove. There is also a strong earthy quality to this beer. A bit of char and tobacco, carob. The earthy flavors aren't strong but do a good job offsetting the sweetness. Balanced, I would like to perhaps see some chocolate notes as I like that in my dubbels.
The feel is moderate and spritzy. Again, great balance. Sweet on the palate as most Belgians are but the earthy characteristics keep everything in check. ABV well hidden. 757 charactersGmann, Feb 20, 2011

Really nice head retention. I had this after the taster of the Westy blonde and the head was still there. Lots of lacing on the glass. Smells of plum and cherry with brown sugar and candy sugar. Alcohol is a little bit noticeable in the flavour. Quite sweet flavour, very nice. Very nice mouthfeel. I think this is easily the best dubbel I've ever had. 464 characterskwjd, Feb 18, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz into an Orval chalice.
A- Brown, 90% opaque with a lacy, decadent head fueled by densely propagating carbonation.
S- Molasses and brown sugar plus a tiny bit of sour apple are filled in by a mild bready grain character accentuated by yeasty notes at finish.
T- Silky bready grain character with hints of dates, and brown sugar/molasses. Very crisp while being so full. It is pretty complex and has a lot of minute subtleties like hints of coriander, clove and even some pepper. Yeast character is subdue at first but presents itself more when warm and livens the beer with wonderful estery harmonies to the dark fruit notes. Has a faint bitterness in the finish reminiscent of weak black tea, along with a lingering bready echo.
M- Silky, smooth, full, active with carbonation.
D- For me, incredible. I cannot get enough, such a great flavor and feel. For someone else, I won't decide.
O- Home run. Hands down best double I've had... sorry Westmalle. It has all the awesome grain character you want, plus even more amazing things happening. It's just plain delicious. This beer makes me wish they distributed so much more than I did before. 1,154 charactersDPFRD, Feb 18, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Pours mahogany with ruby, orange and brown showing up in the light, nice lace on the glass, tight white to off white head. Smells of alcohol, burnt sugar, dark cherry, apple, caramel, raisin, dark fruit, toffee. The nose on this is extremely complex and inviting. Taste is dark fruit, raisin, candy like sugar, apple, a very pronounced sharp warming alcohol is present upfront that pushes this along but isn't overpowering and a tannic presence in the finish. Mouthfeel is solid with a great weight and a subtle but present carbonation, very solid. Drinks really well, starts off as a slow sipper but as it opens up and warms it drinks much quicker, truly excellent stuff. 672 characterspeensteen, Feb 17, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Reviewed from notes/memory from trip to Belgium this summer (I have a few more on hand, will update if my impression changes.)
Pours a hazy caramel color with a swirl of suspended yeast; carbonation is surprisingly brisk (more so than its big brother) and recedes to about half a finger of off-white head.
Like the Westy 12, the aroma is winey--this vinous note seems to be a hallmark of the Westvleteren beers. There is a background of esters and spicy phenols, as well as some dark fruit. The esters are noticeably muted compared to others in the style (particularly American imitations.)
The flavor opens up with caramel malts, which give way almost immediately to fruity notes-- the dark fruit from the nose is present but there is also a strong apple flavor. The fruit hangs on and doesn't fade entirely as the beer finishes with muted noble hops. Others have noted an alcohol note here but for the life of me, I can't find it.
Mouthfeel is appropriately viscous but definitely on the lighter side for the style, and there is a pleasant dryness. Westy beers seem a bit more attenuated than some of the other Trappists, and this definitely helps drinkability. 1,167 characterskajerm, Feb 14, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy brown with orange-ish hints, with a light tan head. In the aroma, dark candi sugar, yeast, dark fruits like candied figs and dates, chocolate, hops, and earth. In the taste, a lot going on at once, candi sugar is obvious, cocoa, toffee, sugarplum, maple, dark chocolate with a slight touch of anise and ginger. Smooth and medium bodied mouthfeel, with a sweet to dry little bit of everything in the aftertaste. It might be the most complex thing I have ever had. 475 charactersOWSLEY069, Feb 11, 2011
4.36/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Poured from a 33cl bottle into my Westvleteren chalice. It poured a beautiful, murky, dark caramel color with a thick, frothy, cappuccino like head filling the top inch of the glass. Fantastic head retention to it and the sides of the glass were a solid sheet of lacing by the time I was done drinking it. 
The aroma shows a lot of raisin to it along with some grape, plum and fig notes at times. I get a moderate amount of Belgian yeast spiciness coming through as well. It has a bit of a sweet, dark fruit boozeiness to it that adds some nice complexity. The aroma feels a bit on the sweet side at times, but overall a pretty nice aroma overall.
The taste starts off with some big malty flavors with some of the Belgian yeast spice coming through. It starts to get a lot sweeter midway with some of those booze soaked raisin, plum and fig flavors. In the finish the bitterness shows up and helps balance out the sweet dark fruits, the yeast spice comes back to linger a bit as well. 
The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with low carbonation. The frothy head gives it some nice frothy texture as I drank it as well. Can't really ask for anything else in a mouthfeel for the style. 
Drinkability is very good, the flavors were great and it had some nice depth and complexity. The dark fruit flavors really stood out and added some very pleasant sweetness. Very nice beer overall and a great example of the style. 1,414 charactersbillab914, Feb 11, 2011
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark brown murky with a nice big head that thined quicker than expected. A glimmer of amber coming through in the light. Smells of dark fruits, apple, yeast and spices. Dark Fruit, malt and the zesty yeast combine to flavor the beer, it is rich and full bodied yet not heavy on the tongue. Could drink this all day, just a wonderful beer.
This bottle was bought in Brussels about a year ago and kept in my cellar. 422 charactersthepeter, Feb 06, 2011
4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Beautiful deep brown, pulled back on the pour for clarity (my preference). Wonderful sweet smell that's hard to pin down. It's just awesome. Tasted slightly sweet with full flavor mix of perfectly combined malt and yeast, again very hard to describe accurately without going too far down any one road. Plum notes show up in the flavor, but don't linger too long. Very nice going down in full-flavored swallows. If there's a downside here, which is hard to find, it might be too sweet to drink all night. 503 charactersWegomlegging, Feb 06, 2011

Poured into my new Westvleteren chalice.
A: Pours a murky brown with plenty of carbonation and floaters. 1 full finger of frothy head fills the glass to the rim. Color turns a very subtle burnt orange when held to the light. A thin ring of head remains, but very little lacing on the glass.
S: Rich, dark fruits: cherries and figs. Highlighted by some cinnamon spice. Port like and brandy scents bring out a little heat in the nose. This one is incredible on the nose - with both sweet and subtle tart characteristics.
T: A perfect crisp and dry display of the smell. Dark fruits, green apple, caramel, and cinnamon. Some wine characteristics break through as the beer warms. 
M: Light and crisp in the feel - which leaves me anticipating the 12 I have ever more. Elevated level of carbonation adds to this feel.
D: The feel of this one makes it highly drinkable. A little warm towards the end of the beer limits it slightly. Smell was fantastic, with the taste only leaving me wanting slightly more - but I guess that would be a style preference. 1,082 characterskirkpjr, Feb 05, 2011

A: The beer pours a murky brown and has a ½ finger off-white head. There is no ruby red aspect as in the 12. The head is relatively short-lived and there is only minimal lacing.
S: The smell is of dark fruits and roasted malts. It also has a little bit of what smells like coca-cola.
T: There was a lot more roasty malts than I expected. The middle consisted of some dark fruits, but nowhere near to the level of the 12. In the finsh was a little bit of hop bitterness followed by alcohol.
M: The carbonation in this bottle was much higher than in the 12. It was actually quite a bit more carbonated than I would have liked. Otherwise, it's light-bodied like the 12 and has a pretty good aftertaste.
D: Pretty good drinkability, but a lot less interesting than the 12. It was nice to try this, but I won't seek it out again. 852 charactersglazeman, Feb 05, 2011

Poured into a tulip glass a clear, deep ruby red brown color with a large fluffy 3 finger light tan head that slowly recedes. Head leaves some nice lace as it settles. The aroma is pretty nice with a subtle dark fruit smell along with some banana. Medium/light mouthfeel with some good carbonation. First taste yields flavors of dark malt, dark fruit, and some alcohol notes. Some lingering bitterness as well. The taste is actually a little more subdued than I thought it would be. The carbonation seems a little high for me as well and detracts from the flavors. Overall, I'm just ok on this beer, it isn't exactly what I thought it would be and isn't as good as I wanted. 730 characterskbutler1, Feb 03, 2011

Date on bottle 12.05.13
A- Pours a really dark reddish brown with a nice 1 1/2 finger white head with huge bubbles. Spotty lacing with slight alcohol feet but nothing crazy.
S- Really sweet candy sugar with a steong belgian yeast profile. Tons of breadiness, strong banana, and spice. Not really getting much else, just tons of sweet notes and slight alcohol. Maybe some dark fruits in there as well.
T- Tastes just like it smells, nice strong banana and breadiness up front with a complex spice profile in the middle. After it goes down you get a mixture of toffee and malts with dark fruits like raisins, fig, and maybe some licorice. Pretty complex for sure. 
M- medium bodied with moderate carbonation and a nice wet bubbly finish. Slight sourness from the yeast.

S: Candi sugar, figs. Pretty sweet smell overall. 
T: Candi sugar, figs...a raisin flavor. This is the first Dubbel that I can remember being able to pick out a hops flavor, grassy. Familiar Belgian yeast flavor.

Poured a very nice pecan brown. Soft hues of autumn in the light, topped with an off-white head that gave wonderful lacing. I would expect nothing less from the most esteemed Belgian brewery/monastery in the world. Lovely caramel of a darker type, along with figs and bread. Extremely well made, offering caramel, touch of sweet chocolate, dates, figs, and yeast. No alcohol is detected at all. Well carbonated, as it should be, and quite smooth. Maybe too smooth, in fact, because I can't seem to stop pouring more samples for myself.... 598 charactersDmanGTR, Jan 27, 2011

Body is an opaque dark reddish brown. I poured a half inch head of luscious bumpy clouds of foam, which quickly dissipated to a veil and ring, leaving some clouds of lacing on the glass. 
Aromas of bread, ginger, coriander, candi sugar, and toffee. 
Tastes of bready malt, dark fruit, coffee, dark chocolate, toffee, and coriander and ginger spice. There is some metallic cola taste as well. Sweet on the front palate, it develops a slightly bitter hop theme in the back palate and ends with a super clean refreshing finish. All these elements blend into a practically seamless, complex and delectable beer. After each sip, you just want another sip of this. 
Body is medium and carbonation is just fizzy enough to produce a creamy mouthfeel. 
This is a great dubbel that I am lucky to be enjoying on my b-day. The alcohol is not noticeable, and the beer is so delectable and smooth, that you could drink a lot of this, if bottles weren't so hard to get ahold of. This is not just a good tasting beer, but it produces a warm fuzzy bodily feeling that is unusually pleasant as well. 1,158 charactersBeerenauslese, Jan 26, 2011
4.78/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz Bottle poured into a Duvel tulip, a fitting beer for my 100th review.
Appearance: Rich dark brown with a big billowy head which hangs around. Perfect sticky lacing sip after sip throughout the beer. 
Smell: Rich complexity and fragrance, dark fruit up front with malt in the background.
Taste: Another excellent beer from St. Sixtus, dark fruit, rich malt, sweet up front but with a wonderful hop bitterness to balance the brew. So many flavors again all working together. 
Mouthfeel: Smoothness beyond compare, a hallmark of the Westvleteren beers. 
Drinkability: Delicious beer. I would love to have an endless supply.
This beer is an excellent complement to its better known brother and an excellent beer all around, once more deserving of its reputation. 771 charactersBobZ, Jan 22, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served from bottle into a Bruery tulip glass. Bottle acquired 4/29/2010, consumed 1/17/2011. Best by date on cap is "12.02.12"
Appearance - dark brown with a hint of ruby. Fizzy head quickly subsiding to a heavy lace. 
Smell - raisin and caramelized candi sugar. Sweet fruits. 
Taste - richer than 8% would lead you to believe, but not cloying. Complex. Much of the time, dubbels are overwhelming with the sickly sweet candi sugar flavor, but this is well balanced. Slightly earthy.
Mouthfeel - tingly! A good aftertaste lingers. 
Drinkability - a subtle alcohol note. I could quaff this for a while and still discover new notes. 
High in subtlety and a great mouthfeel. I had a bottle of Maredsous 8 yesterday, and this restores my faith in the style! I just want to leave this in my mouth and swirl it around for a while. 829 charactersmlaroche, Jan 18, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Beer pours a dark reddish-brown with a little bit of white head. Smell is nutty with some raisins and sweet malt. Taste follows the smell, it's malty and raisin-y with a good, but not overwhelming, amount of sweetness. It also has some caramel to it as well as something a bit grassy that I can't quite put my finger on. Beer is very carbonated and very much on the dry side of things, which makes for very little finish. It's extremely drinkable, and there's no way I'd know this is an 8% ABV beer if it wasn't in the name. It goes down very smooth.
Overall this is a very enjoyable beer, but one that I don't think quite lives up to the hype. Westy 12 is a flat-out excellent beer, but I worry that the 8 is kinda riding the coat-tails of its big brother. It's a good beer, but not one that's worthy of being in the top 10 beers in the world, if you ask me. 860 charactersstarrdogg, Jan 18, 2011

S- Big time cherries with that slight cherry sourness. This is on complex smell though. Darker fruits come in behind that with a bit of malt heat. 
T-Not all that similar to the smell. The taste has a good bit of malt breadiness too it mixed in with dark fruits and some heat that numbs the mouth slightly. Not nearly as complex as the smell
M- pretty creamy for a Dubbel which I like. Thin is not in and this beer knows it. 
D-I could pound these puppies but I am also excited to see this one aged for a few years to see if it becomes more complex as the heat dies down a bit. 724 charactersdrink1121, Jan 14, 2011
4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 58% ABV. Tasted on self-proclaimed "Westy day" 01/06/11 with my beer aficionado buddy. This wonderful dubbel trappist beer was bottled in 2010 (with date stamped 15.01.13 on cap). After pouring, the beer gave off a cloudy brown/bronze appearance, left a very nice foamy head. The smell was initially subdued probably because it was too cold, then the flavors started coming out when above room temperature... with the love the St. Sixtus monks put in this beer. This is a definitely complex and mysterious beer, one I truly embraced. It gave off a bitter mouthability, then soothed out at the end. This smooth taste consisted of caramel, sweet malts, subdued raisins, Belgian candy sugar. The Westy 8 is a well-balanced beer and one that I will gladly drink any day. 765 charactersCuriousMonk, Jan 11, 2011

Wasn't 100% positive this was the holy grail because I'm not as into the beer scene as my brother, but a quick cell phone call later, his joyous shrieks assured me I had found the treasure.
What can I say that hasn't been said, it doesn't live up to the unbelievable hype, but how could it? If you drink this beer and don't think it is insanely well crafted and one of the finest of it's type, you are crazy. The drinkability is amazing, the different flavors that get hit are awesome.
If you get one, you'll be happy, but don't pay $100 for one unless you are rich. Can't wait to try one of the 12's 667 charactersSwiftyMcBeer, Jan 10, 2011
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Heffe and Shaun for an unbelievable 30th bday present. Cheers!
I was to excited to look at it so I'll skip right to the good stuff.
Smell: Wonderfully full and complex nose. First sniff hits you with so many aromas I wasn't sure what's what. A cornucopia of smells, yet even in the nose nothing seemed overwhelming or out of balance. Definite hit of sweet caramel and bread like maltiness. Some chocolate/toffee/licorice sweetness probably from the belgian candy sugar. Some dark fruits like a bit of prunes, figs and raisins, maybe even some apple too. Surprised to find the slightest bit of refreshing vinegar/oakiness rise up, a bit reminiscent of a flemish red. 
Taste: By the smell of it you'd think that something would rise up and hog the stage, but that's not the case. Just like the nose, everything is in an amazing balance. Beautiful malt backbone takes hold right away and rides throughout giving off a toasty, slightly nutty flavor accentuated by the candy sugar imparted flavor of molasses. Nice slick and creamy mouthfeel. The fruitiness gets a just a bit tart and again reminds me ever so slightly of a bit of flemish red (how are they doing this???). A bit of alcohol spiciness at the end. Finishes super dry and clean. Vanishes as though it was never there, leaving you immediately ready for the next sip.
I always wondered if it would live up to the hype and indeed it did and more. The impression I was left with was the unbelievable robustness and complexity, yet perfectly balanced and smooth. 1,529 characterssentomaster, Jan 03, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5First of all big thanks to my brother for bringing this and a 12 back from Amsterdam. I'm giving this one a try first. 
02.10.13 date on the cap. 
Deep brown/bronze color. Nice 1" fine bubbled tan head that drops quickly to a nice cap that is maintained by the high carbonation. A few splotches of lace hang on to the glass. 
The first impression on the nose is the yeast. Dark fruits and raisins. Caramel maltyness kicks in on the first taste but it is surprisingly dry. The finish is beyond dry and smooth, not sure if it's the carbonation level or what but this finishes like a dry merlot. Some plum and cherries slip into the taste.
So does it live up to the hype? I'm not sure but it is a great beer no matter how you look at it. This one shows that you don't have to be over the top with ABV or IBU to be world class. Very understated and solid in every aspect. I would put it at the top of the style. I'd take one of these any time I get the chance. Hopefully some day I'll get to taste it at the source. 1,015 charactersbeermanbrian, Jan 03, 2011

Pours a muddy plum color with a hazy clarity. Head was a rocky and cream-colored and half an inch in height. A couple large swaths and a few residual spots of lacing adhered to the sides of the glass during the tasting. Head was refreshed with a swirl. Big yeasty nose with a figs, prunes and a bready quality following behind. Taste follows nose; completely style consistent, but a bit dull. There's also a slightly herbal/chemical character present, probably attributable to the yeast strain. The mouthfeel kills this beer for me. Carbonation is very aggressive and the burn lingers between quaffs. Consistency is light-medium (but closer to light) and finish is semi-dry. I have to say that I was expecting a bit more from this beer. Perhaps it could stand some aging, and I will definitely procure another bottle if the opportunity presents; however, the carbonation completed detracted from the experience. It did improve slightly by gently swirling the glass to dissipate the gas, making it an almost pleasant sipper; however, I suspect it might be too young. 1,151 charactersJwale73, Jan 02, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a Portsmouth tulip.
A - Pours a dark brown...dirty, yeasty with a finger of tan head that has good staying power - lingers for several minutes before falling to a thin collar with some streaks of lacing.
S - Malty, a bit of a sourness, sweet, candy sugar, a bit of alcohol.
T - Sweet and malty, burnt sugar, caramel, light alcohol, yeasty.
M - Thinnish medium body with a hint of alcohol warmth. Low carbonation that still yields a bit of a tingle. Full malty aftertaste.
D - Too smooth...very easy drinking. Didn't leave the lasting impression of Westy 12, but definitely not a disappointment at all. 618 charactersportia99, Dec 27, 2010
4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Celebrating the end of 1st semester of grad school for a second time. 1 down, 7 to go. Bottle should be ~ 8-12 mos old.
Held up to the light in a chalice, the color is roughly about the same color as the brown bottle and accompanied by a huge off white head. Exceptional head retention.
A swirl of the glass gives heavy belgian yeast aromas, dried raisins and figs, a little tart apple, light caramel malt. Flavor opens with a good dose of yeast with dried fruit, green apple and honey. Sweet caramel malt is a little more evident here than in the aroma and contributes to a little toffee flavor that picks up as the beer warms.
Mouthfeel is on the lighter side, with full carbonation that releases perfectly in your mouth - very impressed with this attribute. Finish is slightly dry and clean.
I don't drink a lot of dubbels, but that would change if I could get this more easily. Was expecting very good, but this was really a beautiful beer.
Much thanks Thjis! 968 charactersGeezLynn, Dec 22, 2010

Poured a dark brown with a reddish tint to it with a nice white to off-white head to it.
Smells sweet, with a bits of light fruit, cherry.
Light malt, easy on the sweetness and just awesome. Plum and great fruitness to it but its not over the top. Well balanced.
This beer is super smooth. I was surprised as to how the carbonation was perfect and not overbearing.

4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I felt EXTREMELY privileged to share a bottle with some CouchSurfing friends of mine in late-July 2010 while staying with them in Pittsburgh. I attended their wedding a couple of years ago and they received some bottles as a wedding present and held them for one of my visits. My Facebook page shows us drinking this beer on a hot, humid night as took the best notes possible.
This was an extremely difficult bottle to pour! There were lees evident along the sides of the bottle as well as in the kick. My gentle pour created only wisps along the center of the beer. Color was a deep amber, almost brown and with NE-quality clarity in the first glass (of two) that was poured. The second glass picked up some of the less, despite my best efforts to avoid it. I did my best to warm it from the refrigerator to get the nose to come forward. The first thing that I got were notes of dark, dried fruit - raisins, plums and cherries; caramel/butterscotch; and and earthy birch beer/cola scent. Wow! Mouthfeel was effervescent with a minty quality to accompany the hazelnut/astringent/drying taste on the tongue. The finish was extremely dry, leaving me literally gasping. The glass with the lees was also passed around and that had a quality of oily sludge with a taste of bitter coffee and dark chocolate. With the glass nearly empty, we combined the lees and the clarified pour for another, different taste that seemed to combine all of the flavors previously noted. Zounds! 1,472 characterswoodychandler, Dec 18, 2010

I cracked this one to share with the guys standing in line at the Troegs Splinter Black release.
A: Poured a hearty and thick reddish-brown color, with the head forming a cloudy beige pillow over the liquid. The appearance was frothy, yeasty, and definitely bubbly.
S: Deep, lush smell of dark fruit such as red cherries and plums, plus some brown sugar and nuts, particularly almonds. This was all held together by a cushion of yeast that resembled a Yankee candle "Clean Cotton" scent.
T: Everything I got on the nose, only more intense. I was simply amazed at how few spices were used, yet the resulting taste was this complex. Not too fruity, and the toasted malts and yeast had an addictive earthiness. The aftertaste had an amazing cherry and filtered water quality.
M: I couldn't image a better carbonated beer for the style. The frothiness accentuated the fruit, malts, and yeast like no other brew I've ever tasted.
D: The booze was in there somewhere, but I certainly couldn't find it. I see the appeal of this brew, and am a true believer in it. 1,216 charactersChaney, Dec 16, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Nice brownish opaque color with some red hues. The head is foamy and robust. It sticks to the glass and has a nice cream color.
S: Nice acidic aroma with some hints of oak or piney. Slight tangy maltiness.
T: Initial tanginess is met with some nice rich mat flavor and slight hoppy flavor. All the flavors balance on a knifes edge in perfect harmony. It has some nice undertone of dried fruit and a good bready flavor.
D/M: Crisp and good weighted beer. These beers always give me the sense of a church...like drinking a pew or something. Not bad a all. Really great present to get. 585 characterspzrhsau, Dec 12, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.512.05.13 cap date.
Murky brown with ruby highlights. Head is at first copious, with large bubbles, and then dies down to a modest layer.
Aroma is fruity and typically Belgian, with a somewhat tart component similar to a Flanders Red.
Flavor is at first quite dry and simple. Some toasted malt, typical fruitiness. This beer never seems sweet or malty, but there's a lot of interesting stuff going on: phenols, light acidity, caramel, and dark cherry. The dryness and subtly acidic/tart character are worth noting. Never overpowering, with a fantastic mouthfeel. The bubbles are plentiful and perpetual, but always soft and smooth. As a Dubbel, this beer has few peers, if any.
Westy 8 is balanced and subtle. It didn't knock my socks off the way the 12 did, but it deserves its reputation. Understated and elegant. 818 charactersdasenebler, Dec 12, 2010
4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Beautiful, clearish red colour with a thick, fluffy light tan head. Great head retention.
Rich and rounded cherry aroma with notes of clove and anise. Apples and pear come through as well. Really nice and complex.
The flavours here are really amazing. There is a complex malt character with the dark candi sugar notes coming through as well as rich dark fruits, deep red cherries and nutmeg. I get a hint of other spice and a moderate bitterness.
The medium body and moderately-high carbonation are good and the carbonation is well integrated. The only downside is a mild astringency.
A wonderfully crafted Belgian ale with lots of character. The alcohol is well hidden and this is just really good. What I really like is that I get lots of the notes I love in Flanders Reds in this without the sourness which makes it like a great blend of Flanders and Dubbel. 865 charactersdgilks, Dec 05, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Generously opened by BucketBoy on 12.01.10. Bottled on date: 08.18.10.
A massive four finger head settles to a creamy, frothy head. There's an island of foam in the form of a heart. Dark almond body.
Smells softly of concord grapes, brown sugar, toasted nuts, and raisins. Quite luscious. 
Caramel and toasty malts, Belgian candy sugar, and dark fruitiness. This is fairly young and the earthy hops are quite apparent, providing a nice contrast to the sugary, vinous sweetness. The yeast adds a nice spiciness, which comes through most clearly on the finish as clove. There's the smallest amount of rich booziness. 
Medium and lush. Medium to medium-high carbonation, with a long, slightly dry finish.
Drinkability is killer. I drank my half of the bottle in around ten minutes. I think I was expecting more overt complexity, but that was mere foolishness, and this was a bit of a (well-deserved) slap in the face. Masterfully balanced and nuanced; a reminder of what beer can and should be. 995 charactersVerecund, Dec 03, 2010

S - Sweet pilsner malts with a little bit of dark fruity essence. Prunes, plums, raisins, etc. Rummy boozy aroma is quite nice.
F/M - Sweet candy-like pilsner malts with noticeable dark fruity melanoidins. Rum and complex alcoholic notes with a medium light bitterness. Medium body with moderately high carbonation. Dry, clean finish. Lingering sweet raisiny flavor.
D - Excellent. The dry and clean finish make this beer super easy to put down. Tasty and satisfying. 559 charactersdomtronzero, Dec 01, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.533cl bottle poured into a Delirium Tremens snifter. I cannot thank ipa247 enough for this FREE bottle of beer that he just handed me because he is the definition of a BA. Thank you. The cap reads 20.12.09 which means this was bottled in December 2006. 
A: Pours an extremely dark ruby red with about a finger of dark tan head made of up very small tight bubbles. Head receded slowly into a fuzzy film that left a pretty solid sheet of soapy soft lacing down the glass. 
S: Big malty notes of caramel, raisins and red grapes. Very vinous smelling and wonderfully complex. I also pick up notes of whole wheat bread crust, toasted nuts, faint warm alcohol and hints of dark fruits including figs. 
T: Exponentially rich and creamy. Flavors are very similar to the nose with the addition of brandy and sweet fruits as well. The nuts come through strong and remind me of chopped walnuts, and there are golden apple notes, dark cherries, and rye crust.
M: Full bodied with more than ample carbonation that has no problem frothing up on your pallet. Alcohol has some rich flavor but no burn. Mouthfeel is viscous and slightly sticky with enough chewiness to keep me from taking too much into my mouth at any one time. 
D: Wonderful wonderful beer. I would have to concur that this could possibly be the best for its style. 8 is however, not quite as decadent as the 12. Hardly anything is, even from the same brewery. Again, I cannot thank you enough ipa247 for letting me try this brew. 1,481 charactersscottfrie, Nov 30, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Review from notes taken on 11/12/10. Bottle code of 12-5-13. A big thank you to Brabander for sending me this and giving me a chance to not only try this brew but share it with some friends. 
Poured into a snifter, Westy 8 appears a faintly hazy amber brown color that displays some deep ruby hues and a yellowish tanned head. A finger's worth of creamy foam appears and recedes slowly clinging all around the glass with a webbing of patchy lace. A light swirl revives the head back to a finger's strength.
The smell of this brew is initially sweet and candy-like. In the background is a twinge of green yeastiness and some prevalent alcohol stings the nose but in a pleasant way. A light touch of earthy hops emerges taking this brew off in another direction.
The taste is again yeasty with a sort of green character showing the youth of this offering. There is an earthy mild bitterness and a smooth dark candy-like sweetness before the onset of the solid alcohol presence. The aftertaste is earthy, herbal and sort of dry and candy-like. The alcohol really has a solid character to this brew but it is quite unlike other belgians I have had. Very enjoyable.
This is a highly carbonated offering that somewhat exaggerates the alcohol with a sort of evaporative quality when it hits the tongue. It is medium bodied, super smooth and very drinkable. I have only had this brew on one other occasion and that experience was better than this one. Perhaps it was a bottle with a little bit of age on it. Regardless, a fantastic brew. 1,533 charactersstakem, Nov 16, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4A Tale of Two Beers 
Courtesy of BA mduncan, I had the opportunity to try two vintage Westvleteren 8 back-to-back:
First, Beer 1: Purchased two years ago, Best By Date of 4/5/2011.
Second, Beer 2: Purchased recently, Best By Date of 1/15/2013. 
The First (Older) Beer:
A: Coloring of the darkest brown, visible floaters. 
S: Cellar aged for two years, this beer has the aroma of a Port Wine or Madeira in its raisiny sweetness. 
T: The aged version takes the younger beer (see below) and ages it, bringing out raisin and plum flavors, finishing with a tempered smoothness that contrasts with the younger beers' carbonation. 
Mouthfeel is yeasty and 'volume' is spectacular - aging this changes the whole character of what is already an excellent beer. 
The Second (Younger) Beer:
A: Lighter than the older beer, this beer had amber edges 
S: Sort of a musky hoppiness and a caramel sweetness - if you can imagine an apple orchard in October and overripe fruit, this captures some of that essence. 
T: Very dry and fruity, quite carbonated. You capture a lot of the alpha acids from their hop mixture here, which gives it an almost citrus freshness. But this is a good, complex, well made Dubbel. 
Overall: The newer beer is good, but the aged beer is spectacular. Put this one on your shelf for a year or two and taste the difference - older beers will loose a lot of the hoppy tanginess of the younger beers, but instead develop an enveloping raisiny richness. 1,473 charactersrsgcwhite, Nov 09, 2010
4.36/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5One of the 4-pack i got for my 23rd birthday. Served very slightly chilled in a Bodum Double-walled glass.
A - Pours an impeccably clean, almost jet black brown with a finger or two of airy yet resilient head.
S - Oaky dried fruit and brown sugar backed up by an alcohol haze and an almost peppermint note way in the back. Not a very strong aroma, but what i did get was pleasant.
T - Roasty bready malt, slight sugar/dried fruit sweetness, slight coffee bitterness, alcohol fairly upfront. It's not an overpowering drink, but subtle and complex, actively challenging you to slow down, sip, and savor.
M - Lighter than I thought, but oh so smooth and velvety on the palate, with surprisingly active carbonation, converging to make this ethereal, tingly mouthfeel that really elevates the experience.
D - It's like liquid velvet, even with the 8% ABV. Actively remind yourself to sip this one, because it's amazingly drinkable.
Overall - I'm starting to believe that Trappist Monks are proof of god existing. Seriously, this beer was a joy to drink, and for the first time in a long time, I'm sad now that my glass is empty. I want more. Oh god do I want more. 1,165 charactersDannyS, Nov 08, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into a branded chalice at In De Vrede.
A: The beer is a pure brown color. No light coming through.. Head was 1.5 fingers, light tan, and with low retention.
S: Rich aroma but hard right now to pick out specifics. Berry notes coming in and out of a dark malty backbone. Brown sugar and dark cake.
T: Deep and malty with touches of oak, vanilla, rum, and some roasted malt. Dark fruits - plum an raisin. Finishes with a big yeasty character and hints of roasted malts. Excellent.
M: Smooth and slightly drying.
D and Notes: I've heard from many people that this is better than the 12. I don't quite agree, but it was a great pair with the pate and the abbey cheese. very drinkable for the strength as well. 732 charactersBucBasil, Nov 05, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed on one of a few BA/Rare Beer Night Tastings during the month of September 2010. I was not able to take detailed notes on this one, but I did make some shorthand and took mental notes in order to prepare a small review. I plan to take more detailed notes on my next opportunity to try this rare find.
Thanks to Don Lowman for sharing 3 of Westy 8s & 12s with the group, a very generous gesture indeed.
Appearance is dark brown/chestnust in color with a thin but fluffy tan head. 
Complex aromas of dark fruit and dark malts, followed by Belgian yeast spice notes. 
Tastes as it smells with and amazingly smooth and well rounded flavor profile. Raisan and fig flavors sneak in.
Medium body with medium+ carbonation and smooth velvet mouthfeel. 
Surprisingly drinkable at 8% abv. I personally enjoyed the Westy 8 better than the 12, but I am curious to try both again and take some detailed notes, hopefully I get this rare chance again. 
Most grateful indeed. A sacred brew worthy of sacred appreciation given this rare opportunity. 1,044 charactersunclejimbay, Nov 04, 2010

A murky brown with plenty of sediment and a thumbs width of dense foam that slowly falls to a thin film that leaves some patches of lace
S brown sugar, spice, raisin, fig, a little licorice, some green apple and some hard toffee, saying this is complex would be an understatement 
T thankfully it tastes like it smells, a fair bit going on in the glass and as it warmed the flavors seem to all blend together in harmony
M creams up from the carbonation fairly well but not quite as thick as I was expecting 
D smells and tastes great, I finished it well before I got a real feel for the beer and I may not see another for a while 
I gotta thank Matt for cracking this one I know you were saving it for some time now. Overall I can't wait to try a 12, this one was close to a 5 in one or two departments if a 4.75 was a option it would have been dropped here. 908 characterswordemupg, Oct 30, 2010

A - poured gently, yielding a solid inch of frothy and puffy light tan colored foam with some specks of brown sediment. the beer is hazy, dark brown/muddy in color. the foam settles to a solid layer and retains through the whole lovely experience.
S - just slightly musty, with some dark fruits...plums and raisins. other notes of sweet toffee, candi sugar, doughy bread and a kiss of silky milk chocolate. 
T - sweet off the bat, with belgian candi sugar melding with raisins, red grapes, apple skins, and plums. turns a bit spicy at the middle as slightly yeast ethers chime in. almost has a cola-like sweet finish, along with tobacco, bread, vanilla, and noble hops. complex and delicious.
M - lightish body with frizzy and fuzzy carbonation, makes the beer just dance in your mouth. finishes slightly dry, yet lingering sweetness remains with a wonderful aftertaste. 
D - it doesnt get much better than this. pair it with some creamy and pungent cheese (a must with this one) and you'll experience a flavorgasm. this beer is quite deserving of the respect it receives, and it a stellar example of the style. cheers to the St. Sixtus brothers for this masterpiece! 1,212 charactersStigs, Oct 10, 2010

a - Pours a mahogany brown color with 2 fingers of off white head that has great tention. The head lasted for several minutes and left some nice lacing on the glass. Moderate carbonation and a little bit of sediment evident.
s - Smells of Belgian yeast, spices, dark fruit, especially raisins and plums, light sweet fruity malts, and bready malts. Also a little brown sugar. Smells like a great dubbel.
t - Tastes of dark fruit, bready malts, Belgian yeast, spices, and alcohol.Still very good, but a step down from the smell.
m - Medium body and low carbonation. The body is very creamy and smooth; it's perfect.
d - Overall I thought this was an amazing dubbel. I thought it looked and smelled amazing, and the mouthfeel was perfect. While I think the taste was very enjoyable, it was probably the weakest part of this beer. I would have liked a little less alcohol in the taste. That being said the taste is still great, it's just that the smell and mouthfeel are pretty much perfect. Would love to get some more of this. 1,099 charactersmdfb79, Oct 10, 2010

Wasn't that impressed and imho this one is more undeservedly hyped than the 12... my friend loves this one, prefers it over the 12, but I don't find it nearly as complex, full, sweet and creamy as the 12. But to each his own. Dark fruit, a bit on the light side, and a bit too much of an alcohol taste. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but not as good as I expected. Then again, it was a fresh one, If I can age a couple of bottles, maybe I can upgrade this one. 536 charactersyapi, Oct 08, 2010

4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Review #500
03.06.12 date on cap
George Forman once said "Boxing is like jazz. The better it is, the less people appreciate it." Perhaps the same is true about beer.
For review #500, I decided to get in the ring with a true heavyweight - the only beer in the current BA top 10 I haven't rated.  While pouring this gem into my Leffe chalice, I am blown away - the beer looks great. A 2 finger eggshell colored head sits atop a prune/mahogany colored body with subtle red and brown highlights around the edge.  I can see a few bubbles rising, replenishing the head, but when I gaze any distance past the edges, all light is swallowed by the dense looking body. Just about as perfect as a dubbel can get.  A great entrance, now let's get to the main event!
Right away I know this is a rich and unapologetic beer, but it's not just a bruiser. There are yeasty esters leading the charge, giving out touches of spiced nuts and creating a fascinating interplay with the dark malt. The malt gives impressions of raisin, prune, and perhaps even a touch of chocolate and walnut. While I normally go for the yeast forward, bubblegum notes in dubbles, this is impressive in it's depth and unique for sure. Sophisticated but just a touch less expressive than perfection.   Just an amazing first round.
 
The taste is equally impressive and picks up where the smell left off  Sweet on the tip of my tongue, the luxurious liquid travels backwards and coats my mouth with sugary plums, raisins, dates, and walnuts.  There's a touch of alcohol which holds back the perfect score. Yeast adds spicy notes. Touch of bitterness from hops. Impressive, cohesive, sophisticated. And, as it warms and opens (or my palate becomes accustomed), the booze becomes less of an issue. 
Westvleteren 8 is creamy with just enough bubbles to keep it moving. The body feels medium but may be heavier, it's just coming off lighter due to the great carb. Finishes clean with a touch of sweet malt lingering on. A work of art, certainly a contender for the crown.
How do you even judge this?  It's like an orgasm in liquid form. A truly exceptional, amazing beer. Hands down one of the most delicately crafted beers I've ever had. Just shy of perfection due to slight booze.  An absolute knockout!  I'm already looking forward to the rematch! 2,321 charactersjampics2, Sep 28, 2010

4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A fairly fresh bottle of Westvleteren 8, dated with a best by date of 12.05.13 poured into a tulip glass. Really insane amount of carbonation initially that I can see through the bottle after popping open the bottle cap. Carbonation calms down a little after the beer has spent some time in the glass, but there is still very ample amount of bubbles. I poured carefully and left most of the residual yeast in the bottom of the bottle. 
Very dark brown, with some dark red at the edge of the glass. Initial three fingers of head forced me to stop pouring out the bottle after about 250 ml. The very high carbonation is streaming from the bottom of the glass, feeding a light khaki colored cloud of head at the top. The head is clinging tightly to the edge of the glass, despite the middle beginning to recede five minutes after the pour. A very impressive pour and a nice looking beer in the glass. 
Nose is pretty surprising. I get a small hint of funk initially, that somewhat reminds me of a lightly brett infected beer. Not full on funky, but enough to make the aroma really interesting, when combined with the dried dark fruits (plums and figs primarily), cloves, and a bit of malt. Nicely balanced aroma, with the sweet and sour playing nicely with each other. 
Taste follows through with a balance of dried fruit, spice and a mellow slightly sweet but dry finish. Not as fruity as I was expecting it to be, but the flavors play very well with each other. 
Medium bodied beer drinks very easily, finishing cleanly on the tongue. Carbonation is gentle in the mouth despite my initial worry after pouring, but it really calms down the longer it is in the glass. Halfway through drinking the glass, the Westvleteren 8's head is almost all gone, and the mouthfeel turns a little creamy. 
Very easy to drink, but it demands to be sipped so that you can enjoy the well balanced flavor profile. Worth acquiring a bottle to try, and drinks really nicely when it is young. 
I have two more bottles of Westvleteren 8 that I'll try to keep and age until it's best by date and try one in a 1-2 years and one in 3 years. Looking forward to it. 2,141 charactersnataku00, Sep 26, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from my tasting notes of a decent sized sample I consumed at an epic tasting event held with the members of the SMBDC.
It has a brown hue, like caramel, and is translucent. There is a good tan bubbly head. I can smell caramel, plums, brown and crystal sugars. The flavor has notes of a fine chocolate, but also some plum and other dark fruits. The yeast imparts an interesting aspect that is hard to summarize from my pour (I have a bottle of this in my cellar that I hope will help me expand this review). Overall, the taste is sweet and effervescent. The sweetness lingers. It has a medium body and low carbonation. The coat isn't very big, which I found slightly surprising. It is a very drinkable beer. Having a bottle or two in a session would be perfect. 770 charactersToasterChef, Sep 14, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Again, thanks to Don (digital7693) for obtaining this gem for our epic beer tasting!!! 
A: poured a medium amber, brown with a nice white head.
S: A bit fruitier than the 12. I get notes of raisins and plums. Also caramel, molasses, and brown sugar.
T: the fruit notes follow through in the taste. Plum dominates the pallet. No alcohol taste at all. Also not too sweet, but just a perfect balance of hop, malt, and fruit.
D: Wow...this is perfection in a bottle. I prefer this to the 12 as it's more drinkable. It's not so much the sipper that 12 is, thus I have to score this higher in my book. I would love to sit down with a few bottles around a fire pit on a cool winter evening! Eh, maybe someday! 706 characterscbak999, Sep 10, 2010

A- Dark chocolate tones, hot cocoa-esque body, pure white head, minimal carbonation.
S- Heavily anise, sweet caramel malts, and a faint yeasty like bread.
T- Alcohol tinge melded into all the flavors. Strongly sweet that matches the aroma perfectly. It has flavors that remind me of butter. Finish is a bit malty.
M- Not the best here. The alcohol makes the mouthfeel diminished. Sure it tastes great, but it loses me here. Smooth and easy to drink. Creamy, modest body make up for the alcohol burn. 
D- Without a doubt would drink it again. Makes me want to try a fresh one. 702 charactersKhazadum, Sep 10, 2010

Aroma is banana, licorice, light alcohol, plums, yeast, dried fruits and candi sugar. A bit on the non assertive side. Taste is rum, dark fruits, plum and a touch of wheat. Water like consistency, light bubbles. Very good, albeit understated beer. 368 charactersBMan1113VR, Sep 09, 2010

Clumpy creamy biege head. Dark brown body/color with light carbonation from the bottom. Large bands of biege lacing.
Thick rich sweet nut brown taste, some raison some cocoa. Almost no aroma - barely a farmhouse field aroma.
Nothing special but enjoyable in their cafe on a sunny day. 384 characterscpanossian, Sep 08, 2010

Big thanks goes out to mbrasi who threw this in as an extra!
A: Pours a white creamy head with a tinge of a chocolaty brown, head dissipates to a thin layer leaving nice lacing along the glass.
S: This beer smells great. A sweet smell, caramel, malt, a hint of cinnamon at the end.
T: Similar to the smell but it comes through stronger and with more nuance and layers. This is incredibly smooth, the three years of age on this one certainly didn't do any harm. Starts with a bit of spice, maybe cloves, also full of malt and a sweet flavor, caramel. The flavor really sticks in your mouth, great aftertaste.
M: Medium to full bodied, decent carbonation and creaminess make this beer great.
D: This is definitely smooth for the ABV, I could drink a few of these if given the chance.
Overall: This is really a great beer. Glad I finally got the chance to try it, I will certainly seek it out again in the future. 942 charactersCaseyK, Aug 28, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Shared with me by a great BA, thanks Thijs.
A- Dark hazy ebony wood brown with a 2 finger fluffy off white head with a nice layer of head that retains for the duration of the beer leaving clumps of lace all over the glass.
S- Nice sweet caramel scents followed by nice dark fruits and a load of spice on the backend, loads of cinnamon and nutmeg, almost smells like a cigar on the backend, with a nice belgian yeast scent that is always great.
T- Wow, similar to the scent but more powerful. Nice caramel and belgian yeast up front making this a very nice sweet belgian beer followed by the dark fruit and candi sugar with a slight almond flavor and a finish that is dominated by spices like cinnamon and nutmeg and a macanudo cigar spice finish.
M- Medium/Full body with ample carbonation that attacks the tongue, very nice flavors and almost creamy body. Would have scored a 5 here but carbonation was a little too much.
D- Alcohol is hidden, you don't notice any heat. The scents and flavors are great and as this beer warms the flavors seem to explode and express themselves three-fold. Will hold my other bottle for several years and re-visit.
Thanks Thijs, a real treat. 1,182 charactersSchmaltzy, Aug 13, 2010

A-mahogany brown body, tan head (thick).
S-sweet grain, light floral aroma
T-sweet grain, raisin, light hop.
M-full flavor but light on the palate.
D-Excellent beer. Not as heavy as 12. Still has complexity and far from a disappointment after having 12. If I have the honor of drinking this again. I will. 397 charactersjneiswender, Aug 11, 2010

Poured into my Delirium Tremens chalice glass.
A- Ruddy dark brown with no light perception. 3 finger tan head which reduces quickly. Minimal to average lace.
S- Wholemeal bread and honey dominates for me. If this was actually bread i can imagine it being the extremely dense heavy kind. Some munich malt roasted notes in the background.
T- Wholemeal bread and munich malt roasted flavours are there but sweeter than the smell giving malt domination. Honey comes through again leaving a faint bitter bite and a semi dry finish. No hot alcohol bite
M- Moderate carbonation, medium to full body. Very smooth.
D- Very complex and apparent smells and flavours stand out well. You dont have to go looking for them at all. A very drinkable dubbel with a smoothness that gives a fantastic mouthfeel. Not had fresh but those 11 years did not do any harm! 897 charactersseanyfo, Aug 10, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Clear, deep burgandy tone. Nicely whipped head of light beige froth adorns the surface and has great retention and lacing ability. Initial blast of alcohol on the nostrils subsides as the sweet bubblegum and rock candy notes take over. There's also a raisiny, rummy characteristic on the nose. Very nice aroma. The flavors are complex, yet subdued. A graceful profile of dates, figs, plums, raisins, bubblegum, rum, toffee and chocolate. A spicy, alcoholic bitterness resides on the tongue after the swallow and detracts just a little from the overall drinking experience. Mouthfeel is light and airy. It almost melts in the mouth like cotton candy. Carbonation is appropriate. Good dubbel. 690 charactersAnthony1, Aug 10, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.511.2 oz proprietary brown glass bottle. Cap dated 04.06.13.
Pours a cola-brown color and is hazy. Some reddish hues along the edges. Fluffy tan head billows up and falls quickly.
Nose: Lovely dried fruits, dark candi sugar, and some dark tanned leather. Black cherry, apricot and river rocks aromas too.
Palate: Crisp yet fat and rich too. Medium bodied and creamy carbonation. Figs a plenty, some black leather, hazelnut whispers, fresh cream. A little crispness from the hops, a pleasant bitterness.
Notes: I usually don't like "Dubbels" but this is by far the best one out there...it has to be, seriously! Complex, but doesn't demand your full attention and has a nice balance between bitterness and sweet-/creaminess. 725 charactersSFLpunk, Aug 10, 2010
4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer is one of my favorites of all time. 
It smells of fruits and spices with a bit of grains. The taste is where this beer shines. It hits you with a sweet sugar taste right at the beginning, then followed quickly by the fruit. It almost taste like a grape juice for the first split second. Then it turns grainy and that beer flavor that is so important to a good beer is there. The thing that is odd for me about this beer is just as fast as all these flavors hit your pallet they are gone again. This beer had almost no after taste at all. An oddity for a beer of this complexity. 589 charactersPardishcreel, Aug 09, 2010

Smell is sugary and soapy with golden raisin and dark wheat bread present. Taste is filled with notes of darkfruits, bready and it's slightly smoky. Mouthfeel is silky smooth with a carbonated fizz at the end, it's really nice. I could have a few of these but won't because I'd be feeling like crap cause I drank them all so soon. My favorite Dubbel ever. 495 charactersSTEG, Aug 09, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Dark garnet mahogany with a deep amber hue on the edge. Huge, fluffy, creamy, thick, frothy, off-white head with amazing retention finally settling into a very thick and creamy lace.
S - Good amount of sweet, caramel, and slightly bready malt base. Dark and golden fruit on top of that with a lot of spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, some clove and allspice, amongst others). Wonderfully balanced and strong and enjoyable fruitiness.
T - Similar to the nose with a rich, sweet caramel and bready malt taste being pretty strong. Also a good amount of molasses, brown sugar, and dark candi sugar along with the spices. Fair amount of dark fruit and a bit of golden fruit (particularly apple). A touch of nuttiness is also present.
M - Medium to full body with a good amount of carbonation. Very smooth and creamy.
D - Very easy to drink. Flavors all work well and have a complex mixture. Extremely smooth and goes down easy. Alcohol is very well hidden.
Notes: Best before 30/09/12. Very good beer, and right at the same level as the 12. Very complex, malty beer. Very easy to drink, if only it was easier to get. 1,111 charactersFreshHawk, Aug 08, 2010

A- Pours a slightly murky brown/plum. Minimal haze, and the fluffy white head is reduced to a ring as the beer progresses. High carbonation.
S- Sweet. Dark belgian candy sugar dominates with plums and figs and other dark fruits in the background.
T- The dark candy sugar comes through again, but is well tempered with the dark fuit flavor. Strong malty background with some spicy notes as well. 
M- My ONLY complaint about the beer. The carbonation levels were too high, and the beer felt fizzy/zesty, which detracted from my overall enjoyment.
D- Even with the carbonation this beer drinks well and I would gladly have this as one of my staples (if it were readily available).
Overall - Despite the hype that the 12 gets, the 8 holds its own as one of the better/best dubbel's out there. My distaste for high carbonation aside, this is a great beer and a great example of the style. Thanks again, Jeffrey! 981 charactersmrandypandy, Aug 07, 2010

Aroma is yeasty with a very light fruit ester, some warmer malt comes through as it warms up.
Flavor is...well damn this is the best dubbel ive ever had. dark fruit and malt meld really well with a suprising amount of alcohol that isnt tasted in the mouth but I can definetly feel in the chest. All of the flavors simply meld amazingly well.
As I said this really has redefined the style for me, one thing that normally bugs me about dubbels is some feel really thin in the mouth, where this really fills it up and is solid through the sip. 696 charactersSShelly, Aug 03, 2010

Bottle cap dated 01.04.13
A: This trappist ale appears a dark brown color with a substantial head and generous amount of lacing on the glass. Looks very nice.
S: This beer begins to distance itself from other dubbels right away. The aroma is simply fantastic. The Belgian yeast component alone is one of the most inviting and delectable scents I have yet found in a beer. 
T: The flavor is incredible. Toffee and caramels amongst the best Belgian yeast strain on the planet. I can't imagine a single way that this beer could possibly improve. So many flavors constantly developing on the palate, all flowing seamlessly together in a work of art, this is a sublime elixir. The conclusion of every drink begs for the onset of another.
M: The feel is yet another flawless aspect of this beer. It's so smooth, it feels like water, yet coats the palate with a myriad of wonderful flavors that evolve from the moment your nose initially detects the beer. 
D: I could, and would, drink this beer very regularly, if only that were possible. This is a truly special beer and absolutely worthy of any and all praises. 1,181 charactersHuhzubendah, Aug 02, 2010

Pours a dark brown with one finger off white head that contains a dusting of brown sediment on the top. Maintains excellent lacing throughout. The aroma is comprised of mat, fruit, alcohol, and citrus. The flavor is of big fruit, alcohol, malt, and a smooth creamy followthrough. It is medium on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew is phenomenal. I was expecting it to be good, but wow... The aroma and flavor of this brew is beautiful. Definitely the best of this style I have had to date.

4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to alcstradamus for this one. Finally got around to it! Dated 1.11.11 on a blue cap. Poured from a 11.2oz. bottle into a La Trappe goblet and shared with schen9303. 
A: The cap opens with a hiss and this one turns out to be a slow gusher. Suffice to say I was left licking Westy8 off my hands and table. Pours a 2 finger brownish-off-white semi-coarse, frothy head with great retention. Beer is a slightly cloudy, dark, purplish-brown. Lacing is patchy and ample with great stick. 
S: Smell is of nuttiness, purple grape gummies, vanilla, sweet brown sugar, clove, and a touch of Belgian yeast spiciness. Aromas are very rich overall and complement each other well. 
T: Opens grape, slightly yeasty bitterness in the back, clove, brown sugar, cinnamon, gummy. Taste is very dense. Middle is prunes and plum. Good balance. Clove becomes more apparent at the middle, end. Finish is a bit dry with a spicy, yeasty aftertaste. 
M: Medium bodied with low carbonation, smooth, and a bit watery. Dry towards the end with a dry finish. Aftertaste is messy and dense. 
D: Super solid Belgian with incredible balance in both aroma and flavor. This one is very drinkable with a feel that is smooth and really serves to both meld and separate the complexities of this beer. Worth the trouble without a doubt! 1,312 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jul 31, 2010

A - Pours a very nice hazy mahogany with some nice sediment and a nice 0.75 inch head. THe head is nice and light tan colored with good density and recedes to a nice little mat with some lacing along the sides. Im already enjoying this brew. 
S - Starts off with very good sweetness and some nice fruit aromas. Apples, pears and some nice vinous characteristics. Mild yeasty and bready character as well and some mild phenols Very yummy. 
T - Starts off with a nice sweet almost cinammon-breadbready flavors. Very nice malt sweetness with some good spice and great yeasty phenols. Some nice dark fruit sweetness almost like apple/cinnamon. There is some nice mild hop character and bitterness on the back end but its not too present. 
M & D - Very nice crisp and dry. Great fluffy mouthfeel with almost perfect CO2 content. Good full body with great overall flavors. I would drink this all day, everyday even with the ABV. 997 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jul 31, 2010

S: Banana and apricot fruits, Dandelion florals and a bit of candi sugar. Lavender later. 
T: Tons of flavor, sweet molasses, currants, figs - a sipper if only to milk each fruity bit of deliciousness. Hint of licorice at the end. Dry trappist yeast finish. Subtle hop aftertaste. 
M: Smooth and thick. This was a bit overcarbonated. Creamy bubbles hid the body. 
D: Very slow drinking - this became cloyingly warm halfway through and burps very hot. A great beer with tons of flavor, but I'd rather not have more than one in a sitting. 
Best estimate is that this is a sweeter version of a Westmalle Double. Undated bottle, assumed to be brewed in '09. Had at Cafe Gollem in mid-May. 782 characterspitasoup, Jul 28, 2010

Received in a trade with JW347 on 1/12/2008. The cap reads 09.03.10., which I believe means it was bottled in March of 2007, making it three and a half years old. Stored at 55 degrees since I received it. 
Poured into my Bruery snifter. Dark brown with a crimson tinge. The head is one inch and quite frothy, with adequate retention and a little lacing.
Redolent of dried dates, plums, and raisins, the aroma displays a moderate malt sweetness with toasted notes. Light oxidation is evident and alcohol is soft. I detect candied sugar and Belgian yeast. As the beer warms up toward room temperature, I get notes of cherries and a dash of chocolate.
The flavor is more alcoholic than the nose suggested. I can taste every basis point of the 8.00%. It tastes of sweet bready malt and dried dark fruits such as dates and plums. The finish has a candied sugar quality. Malt sweetness and dark fruits linger.
Upper medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation and some alcohol warming. An enjoyable Dubbel. 1,020 charactersHopHead84, Jul 24, 2010
3.66/5  rDev -18.3%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5On a recent travel to Belgium, I smuggled home some Westy 8 and 12. Both of them are wonderful on tap and about 15% different in the bottle. 
At In de Vrede, I tried all three Westy beers, the blonde is nothing special, the 8 is exceptional and the 12 is very good. Since most consider the 8 a double, I will rate it as such. Typically, doubles have a fairly alcoholic flavor, which the westy 8 discretely masks. Westy 8 has a fair amount of chocolate/roasty notes, while still being very light and digestible. Its aroma is extremely clean with just a hint of fruity esters. The finish is very pleasant and moderately dry, and although you know you are drinking a hefty beer, it is not overwhelming. 
I find Westy 8 to be the finest offering by this Trappist Monestary and one of the best examples of the belgian double style around. 835 characterssheikyerbouti, Jul 16, 2010

Pours a dark brown with a reddish tint where light penetrates. Head was massive on the pour but settled to a skim of frothy, eggshell white. Nose is, at first bombarded by sweetness with raisins, cherries, toffee, bready yeast, brown sugar, molasses. Taste is rum, raisins, grape, caramel. Tartness comes in and the finish is a complex interplay - sweet, sour, dry. There is a nice alcohol warming as well. This beer is highly carbonated at the start but calms as it warms. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy and almost chewy, coating the tongue but very pleasantly. I am not a huge fan of Dubbels, but this truly is an exemplary beer. If you can get it, you must. 755 charactersregspeir, Jul 15, 2010

Pours a dark amber, close to brown color with a huge, foamy, off white to tan head. Great retention and lacing. An absolutely gorgeous beer. The aroma has caramel, apples, pears, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Just a wonderful aroma.
The taste is out of this world. Apples, caramel, pears, brown sugar, cinnamon, as well as several spices I am not able to pick out. This drinks like a dream.
Between medium and full bodied, smooth, easy to drink, with perfect carbonation. Try as hard as I can, I cannot find a flaw with this beer. This is so drinkable it is insane. The 8.00 % alcohol is perfectly hidden. There is nothing more to say, except that this is a perfect beer. 719 charactershardy008, Jul 04, 2010

Smell is complex with big yeasty notes and a touch of golden raisin. However whats somewhat off putting is a a funky urea smell.
Tastes fairly malt forward with caramel and raisin notes coming forward with backnotes of the funky belgian yeast and finishes pear sweet.
Mouthfeel is smooth and silky with an extremely smooth carbonation.
Overall I'm not blown away by this beer especially when it comes so highly rated. It is a solid example of the style with some funky Trappist notes. 550 charactersUA8, Jul 02, 2010

3.98/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Long night in the office punching in some waypoints for our upcoming Idaho backpacking trip. What better way to prepare than to pop a Westy 8. 28.09.11 on the cap, so this one has been sitting in my basement for nearly a year and a half. I pull out a couple a year or so. I think I have determined that I enjoy the 8 more when it is young, as opposed to the 12 which I find to be the best about 3 years in. I'm not a huge fan of the Westy 8, although I still enjoy them - however, worthy of a review, of course.
Lots of sediment in the bottom so I took my time pouring into my Westvleteren chalice. Caramel colored brown with a very nice light sandy head. Settles about one centimeter high and has left an impressive amount of thick lace on the side. This continues throughout the beer.
Fair amount of varying smells going on here. I think time has increased the amount of apple on the nose, as it is easily the most dominant smell in the glass. There is also a decent amount of spiciness coming out as well as some sweetness - raisins and caramel. 
Taste is also moved toward the apple fruitiness with the addition of the same sweetness I get on the nose. Definitely caramel, in addition to sweet raisins. Even a bit of honey. This bottle has a bit more bitterness at the finish which usually isn't as prominent. It's also significantly more dry than when consumed fresh. I can already sense that my numbers are going to be a bit lower than with a fresh bottle. I promise to re-review it the next time I open a fresh one. The mouthfeel is still as impressive as always. Smooth, velvety, medium-bodied with perhaps just a touch too much carbonation. The tastes is still just extremely complex. There is a ton going on in there and as I near the end and finish my warmed brew, there is a noticeable increase in a chocolatey and spicy component. The alcohol is a bit more noticeable as well.
I know this beer is chosen by many as the best of the Westvleteren beers. I still gotta go with a nice aged Westy 12. While this is certainly a good brew, I don't think it quite matches the uniqueness or complexity of their quadruple. Easy to drink, unfortunately it's never much more than 11 ounces when given the opportunity. One of these days we'll make it over to Belgium again and review it in quantity from the source!

4.12/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 411.2 oz bottle into a Brooklyn tulip. 15.09.07 on the cap, which I imagine means "best by 9.15.07" -- We'll see how it lasted. Purchased for $9.95 about five or six years ago. 
Appearance: Dark and cloudy brown / amber -- almost like a black and tan with dark brown on the top and the dark but lighter semi-cloudy amber color on the bottom. Lacing leaves a lot of thick and slowly dissipating drops of off-white sticking to the sides of the glass. 
Smell: The first thing I think of is honey-covered or golden raisins soaked in red wine. There are aromas of sour apples and almost barrel sourness like a Flemish Red. There's a healthy dose of earthiness that's almost like moss without the phenolic nature to it. Candi sugar or rock candy sweetness is definitely there, along with hints of sweet tobacco and tree bark. Very complex and nuanced overall. 
Taste: Initial hints of earthy sweetness, figs, prunes, raisins, a bit of sweet tobacco, black magic marker. Mild citrus hops on the back end. A good balance of darker sweet fruits also. Dark cherries definitely, maybe honey-soaked. And there's a bit of a rhubarb pie component, weirdly enough -- with its earthiness, mild sourness, and sweetness going on, sometimes at the same time. Lingering dark fruits with mild citrus hops and yeast. 
Mouthfeel: Initially somewhat watery but the carbonation comes very quickly, balancing things and adding some champagne-like bubbles to the mix (which isn't surprising considering the massive amount of yeast resting at the bottom of the bottle). 
Drinkability: I expected this, as one may assume, to be pretty amazing. And though it was good and I enjoyed it, I've had better and more complex and nuanced Dubbels in the past. Did I wait too long, since I've had the bottle for five years or more? I thought this would keep for many more years. I'm glad I finally tried it and waited, but I was hoping for more. It just feels like it's a shadow of its former self, in some ways, or that it's lost a step. Maybe someday I'll get to try a 12. 2,039 charactersasabreed, Jun 16, 2010

Is less creamy and the alcohol comes through more than with it's 12 brethren. Sweet up front. Dark fruit throughout. Nice chocolate notes on the back end. Has a Dry sweet finish. Very nice beer. 258 characterschalsk, Jun 16, 2010
4.54/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Split a single bottle with my roommates, Zach and Jorge, in honor of their graduation from college. Congrats guys!
Best before December 5, 2011 (listed as 05.12.11 on cap).
Poured into a Chimay goblet.
Appearance: Hefty carbonation created a near foam-over after I popped the cap. A slow, straight-up pour yielded a thick stack of tan foam. After a minute or so, the head descended to a 1/4 inch, uniform, foamy top; it maintained that form for the duration of the session. Body is murky and loaded with sediment; very low visibility, even when held to light. With that said, I do like the color of the body: bright amber-brown.
Smell: Purple grapes, plums, strawberries, and maybe some brown sugar (sprinkled on top). Hops add a mild, leafy, and maybe even minty, aspect. Crisp and sweet, very fruity, and balanced. The mix of aromas balance beautifully.
Taste: Follows the smell very closely: a medley of fruit flavors work together harmoniously; but this time with earth and leather round out the finish. I definitely get more molasses in the taste also. Nicely put together. Not as stunning as the smell, but close.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, spicy, and dry. Aftertaste is mild, prickly, and a bit astringent. Not gritty or hot. Not really chewy either.
Drinkability: Tons of complexity from start to finish. Easily one of the top dubbels out there. 1,359 charactersThreeWiseMen, Jun 15, 2010

date on cape - 22/09/10 , poured into a tulip
pours a deep ruby brown, lots of cola color. massive creamy pillow like head that just sits there, hiding the scents beneath.
lots of sweetness hits me first. rich raisins dominate with an underlying dark cherry and vanilla and alcohol. faint hints of malts and yeast. this is beyond complex.
wow.. tons of raisin up front. dark cherry and other dark fruits really make up a majority of the flavor. light vanilla through out the finish with a nice light malty backbone. light hints of tobacco and a nuttiness. 
tons of carbonation tingle the tongue. as this warmed up, it did calm down a bit and smooth out. this was the only flaw i found.
amazing flavors, amazing scent, and huge complexity. this never once got boring, only made me want more. the 8% is well hidden. this is a treat, and i would give anything for another. 901 charactershooliganlife, Jun 14, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Notes from a tasting in 10/08 
Bottle ordered and consumed at In De Vrede, the abbey cafe. 
Pours a murky brown topped with a creamy and thin ivory head. Leaves sheeting lace on the glass. Smells strongly of dark fruit, vanilla, oak and rich bready malt. Rum-soaked raisins and some squishy-ripe currant in the aroma too.
Just a hint of alcohol in the mouth but a lot more of that raisin and sweet bready maltiness. Yeasty.Prunes and currant, toffee and rich malt.Big and sweet body but still there is a very detectable evidence of persistent herbal hops in the finish.
It's lovely and warming as you drink it. Just as good as its big brother, just enough character to distinguish it from being Westy 12, Jr. 712 charactersViveLaChouffe, Jun 07, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 511.2oz. bottle poured into a tulip. 11-03-12 printed on the cap.
(A)- Pours a deep hazy brown/burnt sienna color that produced an awesome eggshell colored fluffy head that has superb retention; the foam is not going anywhere. Its just sticking like glue to the sides of the glass; thin lacing all over the place.
(S)- Earthy, with a heavy biscuit-like grain to it. Yeasty, with some clay. Has the tiniest hint of dark fruits with a twist of banana.
(T)- Just like the smell. The biscuit-like grain goes well with the earthy flavors of clay & yeast. Finishes dry with bits of the fruits and more earth. Almost has a roasted feel to the background.
The best tasting Dubbel in recent memory.
(M)- A high carbonation level that almost fizzes on the tongue. Has a good balance of earth, biscuit, and fruit; I wish more of the fruits came through, but I do love an earthy belgain. Not overly sweet or bitter, but is a happy medium of the two.
(D)- A superb Dubbel. I can definitely see how this has had rave reviews. A perfect example of the style and a joy to consume. I would love to have this on a more regular basis if it was not so hard to acquire. I am glad to have finally tried this! 1,190 characterssweemzander, May 30, 2010

It is so smooth you dont even notice the high alcohol content. I have a bottle of the 12 also, I will be drinking that soon and will let you know about it.
I wish I had another, it was well worth the money. 314 charactersharrmatees, May 26, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Cheers to billab914 for this one! Now where to find more... :) Review is on a pour into a tulip glass. 
Pours a deep, muddy chestnut brown. A good 2-finger toasted cream-colored head fades to a reasonably well-retained bubbly, foamy skim. Sticky rings of lace hang thickly off the walls of the glass. 
I am an aroma snob, and this beer smells fantastic. Loads of toffee, deep syrupy cherries and toasted nuts meet that distinctly, uniquely sweet candi sugar and a toasted, grainy foundation. I barely want to start drinking it because it smells so incredibly fabulous. 
Taste has a distinctly sweet overtone comprised of sticky golden raisins, caramel, toffee and burnt marshmallow. Alcohol is warming and a little hot on the tongue, but in a pleasing way that really complements the nutty, grainy flavors. The taste is very full and complex. Feel is mouthfilling and foamy without being fizzy thanks to some gentle carbonation. It creates a nice lingering, tongue-coating effect that prolongs the enjoyment of the beer. 
Drinkability is endless. It goes down so smoothly and is so delicious, with only the slightest bite from the alcohol. I definitely enjoyed this beer, and it certainly lived up to the hype. 1,214 characterskels, May 25, 2010
4.49/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to BA Kels for sharing this one with me!
A - Pours a dark brown hue with a big tan head that lasts an average amount of time and good lacing. Seemed to be unfiltered somewhat as well.
S - One of the few beers that I think smells better than it actually tastes, haha. Huge sweet flavors of raisins, sweet esters, plums, candied dates, and a faint alcohol aroma in the background.
T - A little on the tart side than what I was expecting from a dubbel. But the plum and date flavors from the aroma carried over and there was a little brown sugar flavor as well. The balance was more on the maltier side due to the sweet flavors and little hop bittering.
M/D - Medium body with a semi-sweet finish...not dry at all. Hardly any alcohol flavor and the flavor combination present in this beer makes it way too easy to drink. Great beer! 840 charactersVaTechHopHead, May 12, 2010
4.94/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 533cl bottle poured into a St. Bernardus Chalice, Date on bottle is 29.09.09, bottled in 2006. Having in celebration of finishing college!
pours a nice dark brown that's very opaque with a nice thick ad creamy head that's light brown with some very smooth lacing. Still a bit of sediment even on a careful pour but not bad. Nose is really nice, very warming and clean, lots of nuts and bready yeast here.
Honestly, I can't find a flaw with this. It is so smooth, crisp and warming, the 8% has a slight warming but it's really not harsh at all. There's a light after taste that's nice and pleasant. I'd say this is a Dubbel to perfection.
As amazing as Westy 12 is, I would have to say I enjoy this a bit more due simply to the fact that it's more drinkable. 759 characterskingcrowing, May 10, 2010

How could I not like a beer that cost over $35 for a 12 oz. bottle? Since it was a gift, I like it even better. If you have an opportunity to try this beer, please do. I actually like the #12 better though. 323 charactersjoeldp144, May 09, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Thanks to DmanGTR for this beauty.
Pours a hazy russet with lots of fine bubbles and a dense, cappuccino-colored head that settles into a thin cap. The smell is cherry, oak, papaya, and honey. The taste is complex: sweet tropical fruit, oak, some nuttiness, and a bitter mineral finish. It's a little creamy, highly effervescent, dense but light at the same time -- dreamy. It goes down easy, but I'm sipping it. Wish I had another. 433 charactersgory4d, May 06, 2010
4.66/5  rDev +4%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a murky cola-color, with the dregs from the bottom of the bottle floating about, unfortunately eliciting a comparison to a glass of pond water. The appearance is at least partially saved by the thick, frothy head that quickly develops over the murky liquid despite a slow, deliberate pour. 
Any doubts about this beer that were raised by the suspect appearance are immediately forgotten once the aroma hits. I would call it pleasantly pungent, but that still doesn't seem to convey how intensely pleasing the aroma is. Curiously, the primary characteristic I picked up was freshly juiced grapes, although there were also accents of plums, caramel, and yeast that are more expected in a Belgian Dubbel. The flavor is not quite so potent. Rather, although it is quite complex and fruity and at times it is almost tangy, it is light and not exceptionally sweet. 
Part of the reason for the apparent lightness of the flavor may be the high degree of carbonation. I would say that it masks some of the flavors, trying to be an attraction of its own, but it does seem to energize the beer, deftly concealing the moderate alcohol level, and thus helping it go down way too easily. As the carbonation settles out a bit, the flavors are allowed to shine a bit more, bringing on a kind of second stage of the drinking experience. Overall, this one is truly interesting, unique, and exceptionally drinkable. 1,404 charactersdevilben02, May 05, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Nice brownish color with a decently sized brown head that did some nice lacing on the sides.
S - Lots of dark fruits, sweet, spice, get a ton of sugar in this one, smells like a very old school brew. Bit of raisin and date smells stand out a lot to me.
T - Great dark fruit and sweetness going on in this one. I like the sugar taste in this, not overly sweet buy nice and syrupy. Carmel malts and a touch of old wood. This tastes like a candy that's just not too sweet, just right. This is very very good, can't say enough about it.
M - Chewy and smooth, a little thinner than I would have expected based on the look, but it's got some nice heft.
D - It gets too sweet and syrupy for me to session, but could drink a decent amount of this happily. Great brew. 767 charactersAgentZero, May 04, 2010

33 cl. bottle, first time I tried this. Well worth.
Nice dark brown ale, with a good pale head as well. Good lacing.
Smell is very fresh, with nice balance between malts and yeast. But there is also some real stout character in this, as well as dark fruits. Plus a bit of spice and herbs.
Taste is very mellow, it delivers the same, with also some mild coffee, and a nice milky chocolate.
Mouthfeel is silky smooth, but also slightly thin. Alcohol is well masked.
Very drinkable with it's 8%. 627 charactersRuudJH, Apr 30, 2010

Pours out medium head into my generic Belgian beer glass (almost a wine glass). Not alot of head, but just fine. Retains slight coating all the way to finish. Poured almost all the way before I stopped for the yeast. 
Dark beer with hint of ruby. Beautiful nose. Is that cola I smell? Taste is cherrys and brown sugar. Definitely a cola thing going on in the flavor as well as the nose, but this is no cherry cola. So smooth its unreal. Not a single hint of alcohol in this despite its 8%. 
Great mouth feel. Not thick at all yet creamy still. Distinct as hell. I have never tasted a beer quite like it. Despite an attempt to savor this beer slowly, its gone before I know it.
I put this beer in a category of its own. Its a winner and clearly a champion. 873 characterselvisnj, Apr 22, 2010

Many, many Thanks to Leftmindedrighty for this bottle!-poured cellar temp in my la fin du monde tulip
A -beautiful bronze, dark toffee color w/ thick cap of beige that produces a copius amount of lace slight haziness but bead is very tiny
S - The smell has plenty of dark fruit scents w/ mild date and nuts w/ slight ripe banana and caramel -this has a lot going on. There is a mild raisin and dark sugar component with light woody tinge too.
M- The feel is as great as the smell, light in body for such a big beer with smooth malt textures and lively carbonation with a dry luxurious finish
T - The flavor is not exactly mirroring the nose which through me off a little - more nutty and toasted malt than the yeast, but pretty dry with a light dried fruit flavor and slight twiggy element from the hops which are very subtle. The yeast has a mild spice element in the flavor with gentle vanilla qualities, very good flavor with only a mild warming of acohol.
D - One of the best dubbels I have had for sure, an excellent trappist - I spent some time savoring this but would love to see what it is like fresh. I think it might rate a bit higher since the age could have dried it out a bit. 1,264 charactersSlatetank, Apr 21, 2010

4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5My 500th review!
A huge thanks to BuckeyeNation for the wonderful trade that included this long-sought beer. The highest ranked of my favorite style, Westy 8 has a lot to live up to.
A 33cl brown bottle with black and blue cap, the date code appears to be 15.06.11. Served cool into my St. Bernardus Watou glass.
I pry the cap and pour the 8 slowly into the center of the glass. Towards the end, I notice a large amount of sediment so I stop before it has a chance to reach the glass. The color is a very dark brown with ruby highlights. Even holding it up to sunlight, it's mostly opaque except around the edges. The tight off-white head has good retention.
The aroma is fantastic. It's really everything a dubbel should be with pitted dark fruits, toffee, and Belgian yeast. A slight bit of red wine on the nose too.
Flavor is huge, chewy, and rich. Westy 8 has tons of that dark fruit like cherries, figs, and red grapes. There's also sweetness in the form of caramel and vanilla. A nice toasted quality comes through about half way. The wine flavor is there but it totally compliments everything else that's going on. It finishes dry with the alcohol coming though a little stronger than expected. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with ample carbonation. The latter being the only real downside of this beer. That and the finish isn't as smooth as expected.
Overall an outstanding beer. The best of the style? It's hard to say but judging by my scores, yes. Westmalle, Rochefort, Prior and Pater are all exceptional but none rate as highly as this. So, while Westvleteren is a rare treat, the others can all be had any day of the week. 
Cheers to the great dubbels of Belgium! 1,683 charactersGilGarp, Apr 17, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Tasted two days ago thanks to Madtowndmb1.
Not a gusher at all as it has been for a few others. Poured quite easily.
The appearance of the beer was a lighter brown certainly reddish hues around the edges. Different small pours had differing amounts of sediment. I was initially expecting it to be more cloudy, but in hindsight, given the amount of time it had for settling, I'm no longer surprised. Head was light brown/tan. Lingered for a long time, until I licked it off the top of the glass. 
The Aromas, I was hoping for just a little more dark fruit... I got raisins, plums, a little banana, some spices. Not unusual for a dubbel.
Taste: Similar to aroma profile. Raisins, Plums, banana, spices, a hidden breadiness. I enjoyed the play of these flavors together; a well balanced flavor palate. But nothing POPPED, and I was anticipating that this would sing of something specific.
Mouthfeel: Much lighter in body, but in a good way. Smooth all the way through. The flavors lingered when you finished your sip and you got to enjoy more of the fruits. Until we finished the beer, I wan't sure if we had gotten one with alcohol in it or not. Very well hidden. 
Drinkability: Most dubbels I've had are a bit thicker or richer, which makes this one stand out. Unbelievably drinkable. I could drink this anytime, anywhere. 1,326 charactersTPatuto, Apr 11, 2010

Upon opening: gusher! I believed this affected the overall carbonation.
A: Creamy white head sits atop a brown colored beer with ruby highlights. Similar to coca cola.
S: malty backbone of fruit breads, redolent of figs, raisons, and banana. Some rum type sugar notes, with some citrus notes. No hop aroma to speak of
T: Upfront dark fruit: raisons, figs with banana showing through as it warms. Love the understated bread notes playing with the dark fruits.
M: Some alcohol notes, but not fusels. medium mouthfeel, low carbonation, and no real stringency
O: Complex, but very drinkable. Lots of different flavors that are well balanced. Best Dubbel I have ever had and I could drink a 6 pack if I wanted to crappie flop all over the place as the alcohol is quite high! Get this beer! 812 charactersndolover, Mar 29, 2010
4.36/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Maredsous Chalice. Heads settles into a thin tan head that last almost until the beer is gone. Looks a bit like the top of a cloud. Carbonation is clearly active bubbling up past the head and producing a little beer head mountain range. Color is a deep ruby red.
Smell is of Figs, dried plums, brown sugar, cinnamon, and I'm sure some other things I'm missing. 
Wow what can I say about this beer that hasn't already been said. It's a little bit sweet, with figs, dried plums, and brown sugar throughout. A brief hint of hops. There is a nice chewiness about the beer and it has a spicy dry finish with just a touch of alcohol that tops the whole thing off making this a fantastic beer that I could drink again and agin. 736 charactersweissbierdrinker, Mar 29, 2010

A: The crack of the cap let loose a gusher all over my lap. Once I managed to get the beer into my goblet, the pour is a dark mahogany color with a fluffy tan head that sticks to the glass.
S: The nose is rich and fruity with notes of plums and raisins. There is plenty of malty and sugary sweetness and some Belgian yeast esters and a faints spice.
T: The flavor is chocolatey and sweet with hints of molasses and caramel. The raisins, plums, and figs provide fruitiness and along with the alcohol, a rum-like flavor.
M: The body is smooth and medium to full bodied with a creamy and smooth carbonation.
D: My first Westy didn't disappoint. I'm not always the biggest fan of dubbels, but this was quite complex and flavorful. I understand why it's so highly regarded. 868 characterswomencantsail, Mar 25, 2010
4.36/5  rDev -2.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Served at In De Vrede, Westvleteren, Belgium on 3/20/2010.
A- Poured from the bottle into a Westvleteren challice with a diffuse khaki colored head with little bits of lacing here and there. The little head that's there is actually well-retained. The body is a semi-opaque garnet-tinged brown. No visible carbonation from the sides of the glass.
S- Initial impressions are rich candy malt, some melanoidins, perceived molasses, some faint Belgian yeast esters, and a very faint aroma of stale hops. As the beer warmed, the bouquet really opened-up to reveal some rich caramel and chocolate notes that were not initially there. Again, as the beer further warmed, some amazing fruity esters appeared: chocolate, cherries, dried dark fruit, leather.
T- Very rich flavor right off-the-bat; big candy and roasted malts, that perceived molasses, some candi sugar, and some mild Belgian yeast esters. Some mild hop bitterness comes in midway along with some very mild nuttiness, which last through the sustained finish. As the beer warmed, some amazing fruity esters appeared: chocolate, cherries, dried dark fruit, leather. Amazing.
M- Thick, chewy mouthfeel. An amazing texture, yet the carbonation is a bit overactive... which makes you feel a bit bloated after each sip. This overcarbonation is a detractor. 
D- The carbonation issue and the associated bloatiness makes it hard to drink in volume. 1,399 charactersjgasparine, Mar 23, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4For a bottle aged just over two years.
A: Pours a one finger head that quickly dissipates into nothing. This looks exactly like coca-cola! A very dark ruby read that is as clear and glass, again, coca-cola. Vibrant and intense carbonation causes the surface to dance, I've never seen anything like it before. A subsequent pours reveals yeast that give it the classic murky brown color. 5
S: Smells like sweet nectar of malty toffee, with a hint of teddy grahams. The aroma is very bready with a bit of oak. I'm sorry, but that is the best description I can come up with. I can't describe the aroma, but it works, just trust me here. 4.5
T: The flavor starts with a sweet caramel note that quickly fades into a strong earthy and Belgian yeast extravaganza of assertive, but never overwhelming, flavors. The flavors are mildly dynamic and adjust ever so slightly while you drink. This beer is overall very dry and not sweet unlike other dubbels. I have a hard time describing the specifics of the flavors. 4.5
M: Medium bodied with a higher level of carbonation, but the carbonation is not overly carbonated. The shimmering carbonation effect visible in the appearance is unreal as the mouthfeel does not feel overly carbonated. The body is a bit thinner than I expected overall. 4
D: This beer gets easier to drink as time goes on. I didn't think I would want a second one, but I have become more open to that idea as I drink it. 4
O: A beer that is worth it's top 10 "magical" status, but I've enjoyed other beers more. The pinnacle of dubbels, probably. 1,560 charactersicetraxx, Mar 17, 2010

T: Yum. Fruit notes, with a good bit of spice as well. Very tasty, with a yeasty kick. Raisons, brown sugar, and a mouthfeel/flavor I can't figure out.
M: Medium bodied with lots of carbonation. It feels like very small bubbles, and there is a whole bunch of it. Not abnormal for the style. I like it.
D: Any day. Absolutely delicious. Tasty, fruity, yeasty, and a perfect beer for the moment, whatever the moment may be. 638 charactersBeejay, Mar 16, 2010

taste - pronounced sugar, complex fig/date/dark fruits, very subtle and mature complexity, most likely from the aging of the bottle

drinkability - goes down smooth and easy 380 charactersdjbreezy, Mar 11, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is the best dubbel I've ever had, so let me say that up front. I could just breathe in the smell all day, like putting your face in a bag of sugar, but balanced by apples and dark fruits. This bottle was 2yr old and the flavor had synthesized in a way that I do not have grammar to describe. There is a subtlety, depth, and smoothness that is unmatched by any dubble I have ever had. Westmalle is a close second, but this is the ultimate. 443 characterssquaremile, Mar 11, 2010
4.36/5  rDev -2.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Yesterday i drank the blond of Westvleteren and today the 8 stands before me. Bought it in cafe In de Vrede when i was there the last time i picked up the blond beer. Of course poured in my Westvleteren chalice. The beer is very darkbrown, like the 12.
The head is lightbrown and very bubbly. A very exeptional view of a very overhyped beer. After a few minutes the head is a few millimeter thick.
Very balanced taste, not that sweet as the 12. Very drinkable. Again i have problems with the smell. There is not much i smell but thats the problem i have with other beers.
I drank the 8 last night (july 30th 2011) after i drank a westy 12. There is a big difference between these beers, always has been. The one i had yesterday had a bit more sourness in it than i could remember. 783 charactersBrabander, Mar 07, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Impressive head that lasts a very long time. Chunky lace on the glass. Dark, dark brown color. Very cloudy. 
Strong malty presence without any sweetness. 
Sweet with an excellent light hop balance. Very easy to drink. Deceptive on the alcohol--it's well hidden. Rich body but it also has a very high level of carbonation.
This is a very easy-to-drink Trappist beer. I prefer it to the 12. 391 characterssmcolw, Mar 07, 2010

S: Lots going on here. Dark fruits are there, but the dominant scent seems to be that of fresh, sweet red/black grapes. Very nice and interesting. Quite a bit of Belgian yeast coming through.
T: Lots of red grapes, slightly-roasted doughy malt, yeast, dark fruits, a bit of earth, and some very nice all-around sweetness.
M: Complex and creamy, not too alcoholic. Perhaps a tad bit thin.
D: Amazing. Such a complex and wonderful beer. I actually think I like this better than the 12, at least while they are relatively fresh. 606 charactersThorpe429, Mar 03, 2010

4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I thought I would start my first beer review with a BANG. Thank you Flick for 06' Bottle straight from the source.
Appearance: Poured into large wine glass. Thick tan head. Nice lacing. Just beautiful dark caramel color. It is really amazing how pretty this beer looks. I am really excited. 
Smell: I dont know if it was just me but i got this tart figgy yeast smell up front. After a minute or so got this great roasted malt with figs and dates, slight alcohol. My mouth is salivating.
Taste & Mouthfeel: Smooth and almost creamy. This is actually 8% ABV. WOW. Caramel, roast malt, dates, candy sugar, toffee, slight alcohol and seems to leave a mild coffee flavor and somewhat dry finish.
Drinkability: I wish I had more. By far one of the best Dubbels I have ever had the privilege of trying. Wish this beer was easier to get I could defiantly get use to drinking this on a daily basis.
My first official beer review and my first Westvleteren 8. Great way to start things. 980 charactersstevefinny, Feb 26, 2010
4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Nicely presented. Sleek trappist bottle, blue cap. The fact that it has no label makes it even better.
When we open it the beer explodes, leaving a bit of a stain on the carpet (as stains go, though...). We suspect that there's something wrong with it, but the smell tells us that everything is all right.
It pours cloudy brown, and looks beautiful. And it smells nice, too. Westvleteren beers are generally exceptionally well-balanced and so is this. The taste is very dubbellish at first but then taste nuts... roasted almonds? 
Feels great in my mouth, the alcohol has a presence, but don't really feel it. Wow, 8%. Very drinkable stuff, by far the best of it's kind that I've tasted.
I don't usually like dubbel, but there's just nothing to say here. The key I feel is that it's so well-balanced. There's nothing extreme in this beer, but just unquestionable craftsmanship. 881 charactersohoh, Feb 25, 2010
4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottle date 03.08.12
Poured into a red wine glass, the Westvleteren 8 displays a dark rum raisin color with a foamy white head. Nice lacing on the glass.
Lots of sweet, fermented grapes and bready malts on the nose. Just a whiff of alcohol and more vinous characteristics. A little earthy. Great aroma, but not as complex as the 12.
Bread and biscuit malts on the tongue, followed by grapes. Alcohol is there, but light, slightly rum like. Raisins, sweeter malts. Overall, bready malts and fermented grapes take the center stage. Sweet, but not as sweet as other dubbels I've had.
Mouthfeel is creamy, smooth and warming. Light carbonation. Very well done.
Drinkability is good. I will have no problem finishing the glass in front of me. A great beer for a special occasion, but probably not something I would drink all the time, even if I had easy access to it.
Overall, this is my first Westvleteren 8 and it is quite good. It's not a top 10 beer in my book, but definitely the best dubbel I have ever had. The Westvleteren 12 is amazing and I guess the 8 fits in nicely as the runner up to Westvleteren's flagship beer. If you haven't had the 8, its worth buying/trading for. An excellent Belgian both in taste and style. 1,230 characterssisuspeed, Feb 21, 2010
4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a goblet to reveal effervescently tall off-white head and burnt caramel body. Looking good for a dubbel. Smells a little sweetbready and just slightly tart, like over-yeasted dough-based Belgian waffles.
Tastes like creamy carbonation, followed by thick, smooth almost mealy malts with a hint of sweetness. Carbonation is there on so many levels: from the gigantic bubbles to the small and tingly. Slightly spiced-tasting. Very rich malts and some caramel underpinning. Medium-bodied going on heavy. Quite drinkable, cold and RT.
This might be my best in style for the dubbel. If only it were more available. 622 charactersabuliarose, Feb 21, 2010
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Goblet from a 330 bottle. A friend brought it from Belgium. I am new to beers from Belgium, so it´s kind of difficult for me to make this review. What it's very easy, it's to say that this is an amazing beer, I am really impressed.
A: Cloudy brown with a big brown head and a nice lacing. The traces of the beer in the glass look great, it hangs into the glass walls.
S: Some alcohol, some fruit, grapes, funny but it's tamarind again with this belgium beers. The aroma is so complex, I wouldn't know how to make an accurate description.
T: A lot of fruit nicely blended with the alcohol. Grapes, tamarind, alcohol. Can't feel the hops in this kind of beers.
M: Big carbonation, backed up with the amazing taste and aroma. Big body, sticks into your whole mouth.
D: I could drink this wonderful beer all my life, I can see why people get so into to belgium beers.
A lot of things are sayed about trappist beers, and I am positive, the are all true. 968 charactersjazztoloc, Feb 06, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Out of a bottle this famous and highly sought-after beer was a deer brown color that was approaching black. Some ruby highlights could be seen when held up to a bright light. The retention and lacing were both impressive. The aroma was rich and bold with an array of 'dark' elements such as chocolate, plums, figs and raisins, some earth and wood, coffee and caramel malt. The flavors were just as intense and varied but I find myself compelled to add a caveat here; having tried the Westy 12 I thought this beer (the 8) to be great, yet still lacking the dimension of subtlety and finesse that the 12 developed. Don't get me wrong, many of the undeniably advanced elements that the Westy 8 possessed impressed me but I just didn't think it was as well executed as it could be. The mouthfeel was just as smooth and rich as one could want, however, and the body as full as one would expect. Equally, the carbonation was spot on. A very ,very good beer and worthy of being classified as one of the worlds best. Were it not for the fact that this same brewery produces a slightly great beer than this one, one would indeed be inclined to say it is THE best in the world. No doubt, as far as the Dubbel style is concerned, it remains an undisputed bar by which others are measured. 1,277 charactersthekevlarkid, Jan 31, 2010

T-nutty, fruity, and delicious. Such a damn good beer.
M- This to me was the most amazing part of this beer. The flavor was completley strong and intact even though there was a strong carbonation with this one.

Bright fruity yeasty aroma with intense dried fruit, apples and spice, and a light touch of roasted banana.

Excellently crafted with a perfect balance. 384 charactersbulletrain76, Jan 12, 2010
4.94/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5BBE on the cap is not perfectly readable, however both month & year of expiration are imprinted clearly enough saying 02. 2011. Assuming that the beer has been bottled 3 years prior to declared expiration date as is the case with 12, it belongs to 2008 vintage and is roughly 2 yrs old by now. Pouring into Rochefort chalice produces tan head transforming itself into thin lacy cap that lasts. Dark coppery brown with dark floaties of yeast.
Almost palpable aromas of sour cherries, dark brown sugar reach on molasses and all kind of berries powdered with cocoa or grated milk chocolate. The flavor profile consists of milk chocolate ice cream with sour cherries & berries and subtle touch of hoppy bitterness that is prolonged into lingering mild bitter aftertaste. Silky smooth, medium bodied nectar with absolutely no alcohol detectable. The smoothest, silkiest beer I've ever tasted. Perhaps less diversity in aroma/flavor profile than12, without evident vinous component and a bit more pronounced hoppiness, but nevertheless equally good as the big brother. 1,062 characterscrnipeter, Jan 11, 2010

Appearance- Very deep ruby/brown in color. Half inch of thick, soapy tan head that isn't going anywhere. Very nice lacing. 
Smell- Very nice. Lots of rich dark fruit, prunes, cherries. Maybe some dried apple as well. A rich toasted nuttiness. 
Taste- A little subtle, at least up front. Some of that cherry. A rich toffee as well. The nuttiness and a rich black bread maltiness. The cherry comes in at the end pleasantly. Very nice.
Mouthfeel- Rich and full. Creamy and delicious.
Drinkability- Goes down too easy. I'll miss it when it's gone. 
This is yet again another excellent beer. A little more restrained than the great Westy 12, but an excellent beer in its own right. 792 characterscallmescraps, Jan 09, 2010

Thanks to a061183 for sending me this in our trade. Cheers!
A- Pours a murky rum raisin color with a thick pillowy beige head that leaves some nice lace.
S- Sweet dark fruit aromas with hints of earthy hops and caramel. Loads of spice and Belgian yeast aromas are quite easy to pick out.
T- I'm not even sure where to start. This brew is loaded with complexity. Sweet brandied cherries and rum raisin flavors are most noticeable initially. After a few more sips, flavors of caramel, toasted grain, figs, anise, cinnamon, and dark fruits with a vinous like body come through in waves. A touch of alcohol in the finish creates a gentle warming effect on the way down.
M- Medium bodied with a light dryness. The spritzy carbonation helps to disperse the flavors equally on the palate.
D- World class in every sense of the word. Superbly drinkable and amazingly flavorful. Truly a brew to be sipped and savored. 1,028 charactersprojectflam86, Jan 04, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a dark brown with a nice firm tan head. 
Nose is initially all banana malt. Goes to carmel, cooked apples and spiced bread as the beer warms. 
Mouthfeel is rich and full but crisp, not creamy and with light, but perfect, carbonation. Good body however. 
Flavors are wonderfully layered, rich, bold and full. Assertive banana/carmel/creamed sweet coffee character and flavor. Cooked fruit, carmel, toffee, and banana all come in layers. A wonderfully balanced and integrated beer with underlying bitter coffee hops. 
Balance and integration is near perfect. One of the most balanced beers I've had. 
Long finish is rich malt, banana, carmel that goes to semi-sweet bitter chocolate/coffee. 
This is a wonderful beer and less "thick" than the Westvleteren 12, the number one beer in the world. This one is actually far better balanced and, dare I say it, actually may be an all around better drinking beer. But, this is my first one. I have 3 more bottles to go! 972 charactersGRG1313, Dec 23, 2009

The beer pours medium to dark murky muddy brown with a big 3 finger light tan head. The heads lasts about 5 minutes then fades to soapy head covering finish. There is decent lacing. 
The aroma is really light, to light to pull much out. Its pretty matly with some bread and light toffee. 
The taste is good not great very complex like its big brother. Its also very matly.
The feel is good pretty drinkable.
Overall, this beer is good, but not a top 15 beer. Probably not top 100, its just not super special. 573 charactersjrallen34, Dec 20, 2009

Pours out of a label-less bottle with a collar, and blue cap that has freshness date on it and says: Trappist Westvleteren 8 on it. Pours semi dark, cloudy...some yum-yums floating around. Thin head, but remains a nice size ring.
Aroma is strong and amazing. Not as solid as the Westy 12, but definitely a great smell. Lot's of fruits and sweetness.
Taste is also not a let-down. Very sweet, carbonated, raisons....malts...wow. 442 charactersShadesOfGray, Dec 02, 2009

Aroma- very good. sweet, caramel, smooth roast. dark fruit and berries but not specific. some tart character. mouth watering.
App- red. light tan head dissipates and laces. yeast chunks but otherwise clear.
Taste- complex caramel with light roast. tart drying finish. alcohol but good. some pear, subtle wet tobacco. clean pils malt. herbal/spicy hop bitterness. some burnt fruit sugar.
Mouth- full, creamy mouthfeel. fine carb. not heavy or filling. dry.
Overall- very good, clean and unique. gets too sweet and thin as it warms. not any better than westmalle dubbel or St. B 8. 692 charactershobojon, Nov 30, 2009

Poured and split into two tulip glasses the beer is a muddy chocolate brown with a full inch of tan head. After settling I'm left with a nice amount of slippery lace that slides down the edges of my glass.
The aroma is a mild mix of sweet candied dark fruits. Plums, raisins, dates. Caramel malt with brown sugar and hints of alcohol. A bit weaker then I had imagined.
The flavor is mash of sugary dark fruit along with sour cherries. Hints of caramel malt, cocoa, spices and baked bread. A definate tartness to the finish.
Medium to full body. Mild creaminess with moderate carbonation. Rather dry.
Overall a decent beer. I suppose nothing ever lives up to the hype it gets. This one wanted to. It just didn't make it for me. I will have to try it again fro comparisons sake. 843 charactersbeerwolf77, Nov 29, 2009

Again, many, many thanks to a generous friend; Todd aka Beerwolf77. Happy shared birthday Todd!
A - Westy 8 pours out a totally hazed muddy brown color from bits of sediment floating throughout. The tall pour released a huge three-finger head. It was a good multi-colored khaki head that was darker in spots that seemed to have excess yeast. The head had superb retention and thick lace that covered the glass.
S - Light tart cherries and a good fruitiness of raisins. The aroma is really mellow like its brother, 12. The malts were toasty with a good sweetness to them. A bit bready in nature and sweet with hints of molasses and dark candi sugar. No hops on the nose, and for the amount of sediment, there really wasn't any yeast aroma either.
T - The flavor is nice and mellow, but complex with flavors of sweet, dark candi sugar and raisins, grapes, and dark cherries. Again, the beer is devoid of hops. The maltiness is all over the place with a mellow flavor of breadines and very light molasses. Great flavors going on in here but it's so laid-back. I wish, like the 12, it was just a bit more upfront.
M - Very smooth and sweet with a silky feel. It leans more towards being medium-bodied and while its well carbonated, the carbonation slips by unnoticed.
D - Very drinkable for the percent in part because all the flavors are so mellow and the mouthfeel is silky smooth. Great tasting, well brewed, and a very delicious beer. I would welcome any opportunity to have this again. 1,609 charactersBeerFMAndy, Nov 29, 2009

4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I went on an adventure to get this stuff, and I ended up doing things that no person should have to do for a beer. Regardless, I acquired 4 of these (no 12s, unfortunately -- that shall be another adventure) and decided to give the first one a shot.
First, I would like to say that this beer is on par with the highly available Rochefort 10 and I believe few experienced connoisseurs would be able to consistently tell the two apart. I am hopeful that the 12 is more awe-inspiring. That said, this beer is still quite delicious and its place among the best in the world is deserved. We are here for the journey of beer enjoyment and I believe that Westvleteren is a crucial part of it. Convenience plays a minor role in the journey.
On to the beer:
This one had the unfortunate case of a gusher due to bringing it home in my backpack after miles of walking. It pours opaque, deep red/brown. Nose is raisins, cranberries, soft cloves. Flavor is more of the dark fruit, plus perhaps some banana and finishes with a hint of saltiness and well balanced phenols. The feel is nicely carbonated and a bit creamy. Given the taste, of course it is quite drinkable but if we are allowed to factor in the difficulty of acquiring the beer, I know to take my time with it and enjoy (or split) only one. 1,292 charactersgyllstromk, Nov 22, 2009

It never really goes anywhere. Its lasts as I drink it and laces beautifully. Aroma is a wonderful mixture of dark fruit. Plum, raisin, fig, some candi sugar and belgian yeast round out this gem. Prickly mouthfeel from the high carbonation. Flavors follow the nose and finish semi-dry. Alcohol is hidden well. This is a wonderful beer. 450 charactersfiver29, Nov 21, 2009
4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Poured with a smooth bubbly and foamy tan head that dissipated to a thin layer leaving very little lacing on my glass. The beer is a dark ruby red/brown color, initially poured clear but when the end of the bottle got in there it made it cloudy.
Smell: Delicious ripe dark fruit, dark cherry, ripe plum, red grapes, small amount of tartness, sweet molasses and honey. 
Taste: Sweet dark fruit, plum, cherry, raisin, some tart fruit flavor, a bit like a good red wine. Sweet roasted malt and nutty flavor. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body, nice carbonation, sweet and sticky up front then quickly becomes dry. There is a small alcohol burn. Leaves mouth clean and dry. 
Overall: Great drinkability. Nice sweet fruity and a little nutty character. Not overly sweet. Balanced with a great dry roasted flavor. A small alcohol presence, but that is expected with and ABV of 8%. All of the flavors blend well together. 919 charactersnatasharai, Nov 17, 2009
3.35/5  rDev -25.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 3.5Paid $27.99 for an 11.2 oz beer from Perry's Liquor in Livermore, CA. This is the last of the Westy line that I've tasted and my estimates put this beer as being about half a year in age. I pour into a chalice to review.
Watchout this one is a mild gusher. Have your glass ready immediately! Very fizzy and carbonated, it leaves a half inch off light beige head. Dark brown raisin color. Minimal head retention. Some sheets of lacing.
Dark fruits, red grape, belgian spice and mild yeast tones in the nose. Seems to be somewhat of a simple, yet effective formula for an overall pleasant aroma.
The fruitiness from the grapes comes more to the forefront and seems to dominate the taste. Taste is sweeter than the nose suggested.
Mouth is quite fizzy and carbonated. Medium body. The high carbonaiton/fizzy mouthfeel keep this one in the sipper category for me.
Well I picked this one up because they were selling it, but I think I should have just bought another bottle of the Westy 12 which is volumes better than this brew. Either way, for me personally, the price these bottles achieve it too high. The hype and exclusivity keep the ratings high. Don't get me wrong, they are excellent Belgian beers, but a Rochefort 8 or Abt 12 is on the same caliber for 1/3 the price. 1,277 charactersibbjamin, Nov 08, 2009

4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to dbatch for sending me a bottle of this on his Belgian expedition this year, he was bummed that they didn't sell the 12 for takeaway from the brewery. The visuals are a deep brown/red hue with a big, soapy head that recedes to a nice foamy cap. The smell is very crisp and clean with lots of belgian yeast and malt, along with traces of nuts, fruits and spices. One of the best aromas I have ever experienced. In the taste you pick up dark fruits along with a light caramel sweetness, with a return of the roasted malt and yeast from the aroma. The mouthfeel was nice and creamy, although a little bland at the finish for my taste. A very drinkable dubbel, and definitely worth the hype, although wish it was more available over here in the States. And at the end of the Rochefort - Westvleteren challenge it's...Rochefort by a nose! The mission is still on to sample the Westvleteren 12... 899 charactersIceman77, Nov 01, 2009

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pour - Pours a cloudy, slightly murky brown. Its reminiscent of instant iced tea or better yet it looks very much like a brown ale sitting in secondary fermentation. When held to the light you can see many tiny bubbles in suspended animation. Its quite a sight to behold. The head is big and fluffy and looks like cake patter or a very tiny open fermenter tank.
Aroma - Instantly takes me back to Belgium. The aroma of sweet malt and a very familiar yeast strain. Its caramel, brown sugar and sweet fruit all mixed together. It warms the nose and the soul. 
Taste - Where does one begin. As soon as the flavors all mesh together on my tongue, happiness erupts. The sweetness of the malt is like baked apples and caramel. Flavors of sweet tea come to mind, as does sweet brown bread with honey butter. Carbonation levels are perfect letting this beer sparkle in your mouth and soak your taste buds with perfection. 
Overall - World class. If you've never had a bottle of this or the 12 you will need to make the trek to Belgium yourself. Every bit as good as people say it is, by far the best Belgian Dubbel on planet earth and maybe even the universe (assuming their isn't some planet out there that has their own trappist breweries). 
Would I buy more of it? - I would love to, alas its not that easy. This is one of those beers that is very hard to get and should stay that way. 
Vintage - This beer was bottled on August 27, 2008. 1,443 charactersindiapaleale, Oct 31, 2009

I've kept this beers stored for almost three years before open it. Best before 7th of June, 2011. Consumed at 15th of March, 2012 in perfect condition. Completely alive beer :)
A: Pours a nutty brown color and a big light beige head. Fizzy and "alive" carbonation. Good retention, it never disappeared leaving a thin small bubbled head. No lacings and a lot of dark particles floating around
S: Very bready. Very yeasty. Fruity, but moderate on these regards. Caramel malts. Hints of roasted malts. Toffee. Hints of alcohol
T: Follows the nose: Brown breauud, caramel malts, toffee, dark fruits, Belgian yeasts. A bit sweet upfront and a very moderate bitterness. Alcohol sensation
M: Medium creamy and bit molasses body. Moderate carbonation
O: Honestly: Fantastic beer! Despite of the hype around Westys, there's no way to deny that, this is a just another perfect beer made by the Sint Sixtus monks 947 characterseduardolinhalis, Oct 30, 2009
3.65/5  rDev -18.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.533cl bottle served in it's logo chalice at Cambrinus in Brugge, Westvleteren 8 is a murky brown with a very tight, creamy sand head leaving light lace. 
Smell is soft, doughy yeast. 
Taste is very smooth and balanced, very light caramel and toffee malt, some clean heat on the otherwise rapid finish. Pretty simple, it's honestly a bit bland, and disappointing. My general impression is a very yeasty beer, which reminds me of how St. Bernardus Abt 12 sometimes, but not always is. Perhaps there is similar inconsistency here, and I will be wowed by the bottles I brought home sometime in the future... 
Mouthfeel is by far the best characteristic, supple, creamy and light. 
Drinkability is pretty good, as it's easy to drink. On the other hand, it's not that interesting, and, in my humble opinion, unnecessarily rare and expensive. 838 charactersccrida, Oct 23, 2009

A - Poured a very dark brown that only when you hold up to a bright light will you get hints of red. The head is a dingy off white that sticks to the glass till the bottom!
S - The fruity and yeasty flavors that define the dubbel fill the nose here. Lots of dried fruit, yeast, with a backbone of caramel, hint of cocoa.
T - A mouth filling and coating rich beer. The flavors include what I would normally call dark roast malt, dried fruit, fig, raisin, with a tart aftertaste that reminds me of the average saison.
M/D - When reviewing a world class beer like this, it seems like you never want to drink more than one for want of being mad at yourself for dipping that far into your stash. However, the clean finish on this beer makes it exceedingly drinkable, I imagine that this is what monks kill 6-8 of per night to keep the faith. The mouthfeel is basically perfect for the style! 1,003 charactersmwa423, Oct 16, 2009

S: Rich, dark fruits. Cherries, figs, raisins. Some caramel and toffee malts hide out in the background.
T: Deliciously dark. The cherries and raisins really stand out from a complex backbone of caramel and toffee. Just a hint of booze shines through. Some candi sugars make themselves known as well.
M: Medium to full bodied. Good carbonation levels carry the flavors to the tongue well. Nice lingering finish.
D: Superb. A very nice dubbel, perhaps the best? The combination of profound flavors, solid carbonation, and a good body makes this a very pleasant experience. 681 characterscallmemickey, Oct 15, 2009

It pours a dirty reddish brown. Full, tight white head. Cloudy, a bit scary. The aroma was very sweet but potent. Light alcohol in the nose. Dark fruits and brown sugar. 
The taste was huge. Complex, sweet, slight burnt sugar flavor. Figs, raisins, a touch of honey. Very vinous, especially as it warms.
The mouthfeel was thick and very creamy. Stood up well to the strong flavors. Butter smooth. 
All in all an excellent beer. Not too overwhelming. Complex but not overbearing. 
Good beer, not worth the trouble to obtain though. 629 charactersBrew33, Oct 09, 2009
4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from 330mL bottle into a tulip. 
Appearance: nice mahogany brown with a huge foamy tan head.
Smell: malty and grainy.
Taste: subtle yet complex. Starts off with malt-centric flavors like tree fruit and even a hint of citrus. Morphs into a more grain-heavy flavor toward the end. All throughout is a light but notable alcohol presence.
Mouthfeel: creamy with well-integrated carbonation. I would say this beer was almost overcarbonated, just because of the huge and persistent head, but the texture did not suffer.
Drinkability: a great flavor with a great texture; despite the alcohol this is supremely drinkable. 625 charactersflagmantho, Sep 13, 2009

A - Hazy brown color with a large, lasting tan head and great lacing.
S - Aroma of dark candied fruits, brown sugar, sweet toffeeish malt, and Belgian yeast.
T - Caramel malt, toffee, bread pudding, candi sugar, fig, raisin, Belgian yeast, and spices.
M - Full-bodied and smooth on the palate with soft but fairly substantial carbonation. Similar warming sensation as the 12 but a little less pronounced.
D - Off the charts for the style. 567 charactersnickd717, Sep 10, 2009
4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Expensive bottle at Cambrinus in Bruges.
The bottle pours a dark oaken liquid into the Westvleteren glass and immediately kicks up a couple fingers of off-white head, which laces in sheets. By holding it up to the light some ruby tones can be discerned. A sweet and spicy aroma is given off, full of dark fruit and yeasty goodness.
This is a supremely decadent dubbel, and is only kept from perfection by a slightly more apparent alcohol content than is ideal. Rich dark fruits abound, with strong raisin, date, plum and prune notes. Sweet brown sugar and vanilla provide delightful accents, while they yeast lends a spicy breadiness to bulk up the body. Speaking of which, the body is full and creamy with a warming finish, giving it the ideal profile of a sipper. In my opinion this is a superior beer to the more highly regarded 12.
For those interested, the bottle shop a few doors down had some of the 8 in their cooler. 928 charactersbobsy, Sep 08, 2009

S- Alcohol is prominent with some citrus, cloves, and white grapes.
T- Clove, yeast, big herbal/leafy hops, a bit of light roasted malt, is this a dubbel that drinks like a tripel? Interesting.
M- A bit prickly, high carbonation, a drier finish than I'd like.
D- A bit too prickly, really tasty though. Just behind the 12, but very good in its own right. 446 charactersLordAdmNelson, Sep 01, 2009

A - Poured into Boulevard goblet. Not as many floaties as the 12. 
S - Fruity and subtle yeast smells. 
T - The balance of the fruit and malt was done well. Not a lot of hop action but still a good balance. The yeast that was used tasted unique and delicious.
M/D - The most I remember about this brew was how smooth it went down. I split this bottle 3 ways and really I just wish I had 3 bottles of it. This as been one of the easiest Belgian's I have drank.
I'm going out on a limb here and saying that it is better than West 12. 604 charactersKCHopHead, Sep 01, 2009

A- Pours hazy dark broun into my St. Bernardus goblet. I thought that would be appropriate. Lacing is wonderful. 
S- I am not getting anything other than fruits hidden behind alcohol. 
T- Raisin, plum, vanilla, sour yeasty character. I dig it. 
M- Carbonation perfect. No real malt aftertaste you sometimes get with Dubbels. The alcohol comes trough the nose, little strange.

The head was great when I poured it and has lasted as I drink. The head leaves a nice lacing on the glass. The aroma is amazing. That great smell of Belgian yeast, like on the air. The carbonation is steady with tiny bubbles all over the outside of the glass. The mouthfeel is smooth, I could drink 10 of these in no time at all. The flavor is sweet and yeasty. It is a great example of a style that I am not usually thrilled with, dubbels. I really like this beer a lot. Its truly one of the great beers of the world. 615 charactersdrabmuh, Aug 29, 2009

Pours garnet/brown color with huge light tan head. There's some yeast murk even though I left a lot of it in the bottle. Even 10 minutes after pouring, there's still quite a bit of foam sitting on the surface. I don't even know how to describe this smell, since I haven't smelled many beers like it. Fresh apples, grapes, a cornucopia of other dark fruits, yeast. There's all sorts of other stuff going on that I can't identify. Same goes for the taste - the balance of fruit, malt, spice, and candi sugar is really good; and there's a very slight tartness that underlies everything. Medium body and high carbonation. Because of all the hype, I didn't want to give this beer a high score if I could help it. But the acclaim is well deserved. This is one of the best beers I've ever had, and reminds me that many American brewers have a long way to go to replicate the quality of great Belgian-style beers. 1,036 characterswaltonc, Aug 29, 2009

Smell: Little fruitiness coming through, raisins possibly. Sweet malt, caramel.
Taste: Malty full mouthfeel, smooth and creamy. Tastes kind of like cream. Definite unique maltiness and yeast. Some old fruitiness lingering around. Don't even taste alcohol.
Overall: Literature varies whether this is a dubbel or strong ale. Either way it tastes almost like nice cream ale or something, but w/unique belgian qualities. Could drink all day, and would if I could buy it locally. Delicious. 566 charactersbret27, Aug 23, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottled in September of 2008. Pours thickly veiled brown with yellow-tan highlights -- almost like the inside of an overripe plum. Modest head dissipates to a fine surface film. Smells of prune, plum, banana, a little bit of cherry-tinged funk. Comes together to smell a bit like unsweetened purple grape juice. The smell is a true harbinger of the taste: deep plum and light caramel flavors form the backbone as banana and subtle cherry tart notes take turns. The light tartness builds a bit and ends up being the last note at the finish line. Lots of subtle complexity here for the style: no one flavor dominates or speaks out of turn. Very drinkable in that you can keep discovering new flavors over multiple servings. A real standout in the Belgian brown class. 765 characterschicagobeerriot, Aug 19, 2009

Pours a deep brown with a spotty head. Not a lot of lacing with some yeast and sediment in the glass.
Smell is spicy, brown sugar and sweet candy.
Taste is that oh so sweet Belgian yeast coupled with the brown sugar, candy and spices. Hints of dried, dark fruits...perhaps prunes.
Very carbonated mouthfeel. Could drink these all day. An excellent beer. 398 charactersjdubjacket, Aug 12, 2009

A: Pours a brownish amber color with some yellowish tints at the edges and some reddish tints in the darker spots. There were a couple of fingers of white-ish colored head that settled down to a small film of bubbles while lacing the glass some in the process.
S: Smells consisting of brown sugar, molasses, raisins, dark fruits, figs, a somewhat wine like scent as well.
T: Tastes include the predominant brown sugar, molasses, and raisins, but there are hints of dark fruits and figs just not with much intensity. There's also a champagne-esque quality to it, with some yeasty flavors as well as a hint of alcohol taste.
M: Lots of carbonation with a nice bite present, very full bodied and palate coating.
D: Pretty drinkable as this beer has good flavor and the alcohol flavor isn't overwhelming, but I wouldn't put this near session beer level.
Overall, I think this is a really good beer, but maybe not to the level as it's revered. The flavor is good, although it needs a little more complexity for me to really be amazing. At face value the flavor is just too predominantly brown sugar, caramel and I wish the darker fruits would have come out more. 1,346 charactersdukedevil0, Aug 10, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5bottle with 12.02.12 on the cap. poured into the silver-rimmed Westvleteren chalice, naturally.
A - oh man, here it goes! the bottle pours perfectly into the glass, giving a 1.5 finger head, maybe two; either way the whole bottle fits perfectly. the head starts out big and pretty surely goes down to a .75 finger amount in the first minute. the color is purely off white, nowhere near a richness of cream. the head eventually settles down to a thin layer across the whole top of the beer, as is expected.full dark brown colour, completely opaque. no reds or anything else, this beer is a solid dark brown. I can find no fault with this dubbel except for the lack of lace, and the eventual rarefaction of the head down to a threadbare covering.
S - this beer isnt even really that warm yet and the aromas coming off of it are so extraordinary. sweet apples and malts, yeast, and a pinch of spice. and the nose is strong too! there is no searching for notes with this beer, they come right out and present themselves. the top notes are spice and apples, like a baked apples kind of smell where they just blend perfectly. what makes this level excelent is that the beer knows when to limit itself on sweetness and fruitiness, not going into the belgian dark regions. the midground is like a light vanilla. the bottom is a slight malty sweetness, along the lines of a sweetness found in brandy. what makes this so amazing is that not only is the nose extremely complex, with many variations on what seem to be one note, but you can clearly smell all of them; its strong enough to even satify me.
T - wow, this is amazing. the whole taste is floral, a bit ashen, and malty. such complex flavours all coming in at once, and fading into this slightly sweet oblivion. the identity of this beer as a single entity is flawless: all of it comes togather. the initial tastes are quite yeasty, and a bit wooden. then come the other flavours: herbals, some bitterness, and a raisin/prune boozy concoction. the alcohol warms the back of the throat with the raisin flavour. the finish is a bit elusive, but there is this slightly ashy, almost like tobacco flavour that quickly comes in and out; almost like a faded out latakia blend, no where as strong as nightcap. the malts make their presence here: big sweet burst followed by some yeast mustiness. the aftertaste is great
fruity sweet followed coupled with a bit of hoppy bitterness, almost like granny smith apple skin, but not as tart. the whole eventually fades out into a fuji apple like sweetness. the only thing I do not like abut the taste of this beer are the flavours I find to not be characteristic with this style: i have never experienced an ashen or wood-like character in a dubbel. I am going to attribute this to my inexperience, and simply assign them to being facets of the complexity of this brew.
MF&D - how do you describe a perfect dubbel? the feel is perfect: perfect small, crisp carbonation combine with the ample body to make a completely chewy and creamy experience. the beer is so incredibly creamy from the carbonation, and the body, coupled with the carbonation makes this rich chewy kind of feeling. simply superb! needless to say, I would drink this anytime with anything. I just cant wait to see what the 12 has in store! 3,296 characterserz316, Aug 06, 2009

A: Poured into a Lindemans glass. It showes just a small creamy head and a very dark brown color.
S: Very soft balanced smell of raisins, banana, malts and cloves.
T: I immedialetly pick up the Madeira tones in the taste, which can also be defined as nuts and spicy herbs. The taste is sweet with no alcohols. The sweetness reminds me of clover honey. Unfortunatley also a little dusty. Probably due too the caps used on a 33 cl bottle. That is the reason why I don't rate it 5 for taste. Like RvDoorn says taste and aftertaste are equal.
M: Low carbonation and very smooth.
D: WOW, a unique experience. This makes me want to store beer.... without the dusty taste of course. 811 charactersPapaEugene, Aug 05, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Poured into a Westvleteren Chalice
Body pours a deep, russet brown with an underlying purple hue. An off-white head rose to fill the glass and subsided slowly. A small touch of lace is left behind.
Aroma is of cherries, raisins, molasses, spices, sweet caramel malt, Belgian candy sugar, and hearty fresh baked bread. Loads and loads of aromas here. It's nearly perfect in this regard.
A rather sweet texture as a whole. Belgian candy sugar, cherries, raisins, dates, and plums all meld together to form a rather cohesive, smooth flavor. Not rugged and overly sweet while still maintaining a large fruit character. While the fruit dominates, there is a hearty fresh baked bread backbone that gives this a much needed shot of heartiness.
Really the only downfall this beer has is that it is a bit thin and fizzy for my tastes. I like my dubbels to be a little more lush and creamy.
Due to its fizzy, slightly thin nature, this beer is scary drinkable. The flavors complement each other so well and it is a delicious blend of sweet and hearty. There is only a faint touch of heat in the finish, but not enough to slow you down.
These beers really need to be in bombers. 1,173 charactersColForbinBC, Aug 03, 2009

Smell is grapes, orange peel, spice, clove, and rubber. Taste is rubber, apple skin, and lots of spices. Medium to full bodied with soft but plentiful carbonation. This one has a little bit of an alcohol burn which hurts the drinkability.
Well, I guess I have come to the conclusion that dubbels just are not a style I can enjoy. This is the highest rated dubbel on BA, in the top 10 overall, and possibly the best one I have had yet I still can't bring myself to give it more than a 4 for taste. I was hoping that this one would break the streak and stand out like its big brother #12 does, but alas it ends up being just a "good" beer for my palate 776 charactersalcstradamus, Aug 01, 2009

The recent vintage Westvleteren 8 is a great beer, but from previous experiences, I know that Westvleteren vintage is way better and really different compared to the fresh ones and therefore, this beer was on forehand "the king of beers" during our beer taste evening last night. Couldn't wait to try....
Poured into a Urthel glass. The beers pours a deep caramel-dark-brown color, with (for a 1998 vintage) still surprisingly decent head.
The scent is fantastic, sweet malts, sweet raisins, banana
The taste as expected, sweet!! Like Porto, or Madera wine. Very low malts, honey, raisins and other sweet fruits again. Strikingly, the taste and aftertaste are completely similar. However, there was a vague dusty taste, an indication that it could have aged just a little bit better. 
The mouthfeel is what can be expected from a 1998 vintage, very smooth, with relatively low carbonation. 
Overall, really a fantastic beer. Pity this bottle had a slightly (hidden) dusty taste. A previous bottle from the same batch was better. I think I will rate that bottle instead of this one. Anyhow, one of the better beers one can have. get it get it get it, I will drink it surely again! 1,214 charactersrvdoorn, Jul 31, 2009

DATE ON CAP: 20 12 09
Pours a dark brown with a slight golden red tint. About half a finger of creamy light tan foam forms, then dissipates to a decent covering. Lacing is full, but slick.
The nose is filled with loads of dark fruit notes. Lots of sweet caramel maltiness. Belgian candi sugars. Buttered bread with cinnamon and spices. Wonderful raisin presence.
Wonderful dark fruit flavors. Plums, raisins and a touch of cherries. Not nearly as sweet as the nose led me to expect. It's actually quite balanced, in the sweet/dry category. A mild nuttiness and a nice level of spiciness. Good malty backbone, but not over-pronounced. Light touches of caramel and candi sugars. Butterey bread, once again.
Wonderfully creamy and full-bodied. This is a beautiful example of the Dubbel style, especially in the body.
The 8.0%abv is so well hidden, I think I could drink this one all night long. Or, at least until I fall out of my seat.

A: Pours an extremely hazy/murky chestnut brown with 2 inches of tan bubbly head. I let the beer sit for nearly 25 minutes to warm up, and the head never dipped below a finger's worth. Beautiful. Some patches of lacing. 
S: Raisins are strongest on the nose, along with a dark sweetness of brown sugar and molasses. Other dark fruits include plums and dates, with some Belgian spice in the nose. 
T: Belgian candy sugar over a large assortment of dark fruits: raisins, plums, figs, dates. A more naked sweetness from brown sugar and molasses, but it's nicely offset by a toasty grain character, earthy yeast, and a slight spicy bite. While most of the components are sweet flavors, the overall effect is not cloying, thanks in part to the cleansing carbonation and the contrasting flavors. 
M: Medium bodied. High carbonation as expected from a dubbel, but it's not over-foamy - just cleansing. No trace of the ABV. Has a slightly dry finish with a hint of yeasty aftertaste. 
D: This went down really easy, despite its big beer status and strong flavors. A testament to its balance and craft. It's unfortunate that it costs so damn much, but I must honestly admit, I'd buy it again if I had the chance. 1,286 charactersArbitrator, Jul 15, 2009

T= for not being anywhere near one of my favorite styles this beer tastes wonderful. The cherry I smelled was there but not sour at all. Lots of spicey yeasty flavors as well. The dark fruits are in there just buried deeper within.just a touch of booze to finish it off.
M= awesomely coating and smooth. My mouth feels like a slip and slide.
D= great. This sipper is amazing. Truelt lives up to the hype and its a style I usually don't enjoy much of at all. 822 charactersjjanega08, Jul 14, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I had this bottle in my cellar for nearly a year after it was sent to me from abroad. It poured a fairly dark, hazy brown with a light tan head. The head dissipated a little but held a nice thin covering even after a few sips. The smell is amazing, rich aroma of dark fruits, malt and some hops. At first the taste hits with sweet caramel and dark fruit (raisin, fig?) and then some slight sting of alcohol that fades into gentle bread malts. I had to stop myself from drinking it too fast because I wanted to drink it down in one gulp it was that delicious. Even the the belching that followed tasted delightful. 613 charactersstemcell001, Jul 13, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy brown with a big foamy light tan head that resists fading. Visibly effervescent, the collar leaves excellent stringy patterns of Belgian lace. The smell is rich and earthy dark fruit and malty cocoa. Lively mouth feel with a little heat and a lighter body that works with the full rich caramel and fruit flavors. The lingering aspect adds complexity that gives it a larger presence. A really nice drinker...gone way too quickly. Many thanks to Alen for the opportunity! 482 charactersjjayjaye, Jul 08, 2009

Poured an active murky, oily, redish/brown body with an off white/tan head that lasted a while. Smells of cherry, raisin, very floral. Taste was amazing with dark fruits as in the taste. The 8% come through in the end as it warms a bit. Medium body that was fairly fizzy, 388 charactersmugglesandhops, Jul 07, 2009
3.93/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: Dark brown with a medium sized off-white/pale brown head that dissipates slowly and leaves plenty of lacings.
S: Light fruity aromas and plenty of malts - very thick and robust. Notes of fudge and toffee mixed with earthy herbal aromas. Some spicy phenols and alcohol. Rather complex and well balanced, but it's not as impressive or as powerful as I had expected. 
T: A similar balance between fruity aromas and malts as in the smell: cherries, slightly tart red currants rests upon a decent malty backbone. Fudge and caramel delivers much of the sweetness. Dark bread, a gentle note of wood and just a hint of blanket (which I find a bit odd). The finish is slightly phenolic and somewhat bitter with notes of sweet alcohol, herbs and minerals. 
M: Full bodied, smooth texture. The finish is somewhat dry. A very pleasant mouthfeel.
D: A good beer, very good actually. Complex, well balanced and tasty. But one of the best beers in the world? Perhaps not, in my humble opinion. 985 charactersricke, Jul 06, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Reviewed this evening paired with dinner and served in a snifter glass with the help of wheatman106 and Jimmy
Appearance - Slightly cloudy brown with about 1 1/2 fingers of head. The carbonation of this beer forms a nice thick, web-like frothy head that slowly dissipated as the meal continued.
Smell - On opening this holy brew I knew I was in store for something that could not have been made by the hands of laymen. The brew gives off a complex compilation of fresh concord grapes, Belgium yeast with very little traces of hop to me smelt. 
Taste - The balance of this brew is quite remarkable, from start, middle to finish the taste of Belgium yeast, dark berries and a hint of perfectly ripened apples. I can barely taste the alcohol in this beer and reminds me of a Sunday morning having a glass of cold grape juice. 
Mouthfeel - This brew is has a nice medium body that coats the taste buds on my tongue and leaves a quite enjoyable after taste which holds me over till my next sip. 
Drinkability - The drinkability of this beer is rather high because of the balance between all of the complex element in this beer.
After taking my last sip, Wheatman106, Jimmy and I cracked open the Westveleteren 12 and to say the least we all were blown away by both of this beers. Kudos to the Trappist monks, without them I would not know what the taste of perfection would be. 1,378 characterscapra12, Jun 17, 2009
3.94/5  rDev -12.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to phil7568 for this one.
Pours a dark brown with sudsy white one-finger head that fades pretty quickly. Lots of carbonation evident from the tiny bubbles rising to the surface. Full of suspended sediment...I mean FULL. The bigger pieces begin to settle out, but lots of smaller particles remain.
Smell is sweet, dark fruit. Big raisiny aroma with some prunes as well. Taste is similar to the aroma, with the alcohol being pretty forward. It's hard to pick out a lot of flavors due to the almost immediate alcohol burn.
Mouthfeel is on the heavy side of medium. I was almost expecting a chewy feel based on the look, but it's really pretty smooth. Drinkability is decent. I still think the Westmalle Dubbel is better. As far as Wesvleteren goes, I think this one is better than the blonde, but not as good as the 12. Very happy I got to try it, though. 862 charactersdaythree16, Jun 17, 2009
4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to brewsb4shrews for this one. 
Pours a dark brown with a little sediment. There's a 3-finger beige head & medium lacing. 
The smell is not real overpowering--just herbs, caramel, yeast & faint dark fruits. The taste is really complex starting with bitter herbal flavors, chocolate, and yeast, and then ending with a dryness, spices. The mouthfeel is medium-bodied, carbonated with a slight oily quality, but the sediment isn't felt at all.
This is drinkable brew, and I'm glad I had the opportunity to try it as it seems it's not the easiest beer to acquire. 569 characterstheghost3, Jun 15, 2009
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Tried this thanks to jopish17 - much obliged!
Pours a somewhat clear dark brown color with ruby and almost purple highlights and a two-finger off-white head. The head recedes slowly due to a steady stream of bubbles from the bottom of the glass into a thin pancake on top leaving thick lacing.
Smells of sugary caramel with large amounts of raisins and dates. Lots of fruit aromas without overpowering the Belgian yeast.
Tastes similar to how it smells. Sweet caramel flavors up front shortly give way to fruit flavors. The fruit flavors are as robust and complex as any, with sugar-coated raisins and dates playing a large part with hints of prunes in the background. The ending is crisp and sufficiently sweet.
Mouthfeel is great. It has a great thickness with very active carbonation that does it's job to the T.
Drinkability is good. I could drink a lot of these.
Overall this beer lived up to it's billing. The flavors weren't the best part of the beer, but rather how they entered and faded at just the right times - though the solid levels of carbonation helped things along nicely. However, I've heard many people say they liked the 8 better than the 12 and I have to respectfully disagree, though just by a hair. Give both a shot if at all possible. 1,264 charactersglid02, Jun 13, 2009

A: Pours a muddy tawny brown with a creamy and thick light tan head. The head remains throughout, excellent retention.
S: Some dark fruits mixed with some spices (maybe cinnamon).
T: It's a bit spicy with some caramel malt. Dark fruits such as figs and raisins are in there as well. Complex and delicious. It has a brandy like finish with a bit of alcohol coming through. 
M: Medium-bodied, low carbonation results in a creamy and silky smooth mouthfeel.
D: Absolutely a well-crafted beer, glad that I had the opportunity to try it. I'd definitely drink it more often it wasn't so hard to come across. Goes down very smooth and surprisingly light. 727 characterswilljschmidt, Jun 12, 2009

Malt, toffee and yeast to the nose. 
Complex, smooth and delectable. Besides elements noted in nose, the hops are mildly evident along with fruit and chocolate. Nice carbonation, a most enjoyable brew.
Great drinkability, if only this wasn't so hard to obtain. Or should I add, at a more friendly price. 420 characterstechdiver, Jun 08, 2009

Best by: 15 08 11
APPEARANCE: Pours a murky brown into my Westvleteren chalice. This one seems to developed some protein chunking in its short time aging which will hopefully settle out in my glass. The head is tightly bubbled and creamy. It started at about a finger's height and hasn't dropped much at all.
SMELL: Not terribly intense, but what's there is quite nice. Heavy on the sweet fruits especially cherry and raisin. A bit of a bready character gets through as well. Not a whole lot coming from the yeast nor is there any whiff of alcohol.
TASTE: Wow, completely different than the aroma. This has quite a bit of unmistakable character from the abbey yeast. It's really bready with a kick of alcohol that's accentuated by a significant dryness. There's not a whole lot of sweetness going on here. Just the opposite in fact, with an unexpected spicy bitterness on the back end.
MOUTHFEEL: Haven't swallowed any chunks yet, so I can give an honest answer here. The body is on the lighter side for sure, with a very piquant carbonation that's at the higher end of the spectrum.
DRINKABILITY: Good, just like the rest of the beer. The alcohol is slightly prohibitive, and there's a few unexpected twists with the beer. But I'd be glad to have one of these any time.
It feels slightly blasphemous, but I was not blown away by this beer. I do have a few more bottles, and I will happy to give it another chance every opportunity I get. I get the feeling that this could definitely benefit from aging for a good while, and I'll definitely be putting that theory to practice given the young age of this particular bottle. 1,784 charactersjmalex, Jun 08, 2009

Taste: Intense sweetness with dark fruitiness throughout. Spicy, spicy, spicy with candi sugar too. Dates, figs. This is a beer!
Mouthfeel: Slick, high carbed, effervescent.
Drinkability: Wow! Really. Just outstanding. Low apparent ABV, but it rocks, and I want another sip. And another. And another. I want to marry this beer. 547 charactersghostwalker, Jun 07, 2009

Scent of strong robust malts, sugars, sweet dark fruits, and some spiced with a touch of alcohol. Excellent, and nearly perfect, but just a touch too sweet.
Taste of spices and earthy malts start, sugars and dark fruit come in and finishes with a bit of marshmallow malts. A high quality Dubbel, but I believe the Rochefort offerings are of higher quality.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and creamy smooth with a strong biting carbonation. 504 characterspaco1029384756, May 02, 2009

Pours a dark brown color with amber highlights, a thin cap that stuck around throughout, and little lacing. Lots of sediment in the bottle that I tried to keep out. Aroma is grassy, a bit of dark fruit, lightly sweet, some brown sugar and apples, yeasty, smells great! Flavor is very nice! Hints of chocolate, candied dark fruits, brown sugar, herbaceous hops, a hint of raisins, a bit of grassiness and a hint of musty sourness. The aftertaste lingers for quite a bit and there's a faint roasted coffee and burnt caramel flavor that sticks to the tongue. Tastes fantastic. Flavor is on the higher side of medium, but still medium and nice crisp carbonation. This is a very tasty beer, but I could only see myself having one at a time, but it was great to be able to sample this rare treat. Thanks again, Jason! 903 charactersKeefD, Apr 27, 2009

Dark fruit (plums, cranberries, raisins, etc.) really sticks out on my palate along with some alcohol bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is good, light-medium in body, coats the mouth well. I prefer this Dubbel to the Quad and will drink again, for sure. 371 charactersSean9689, Apr 21, 2009
4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5(From notes - can't resist reviewing even though my input is negligible with so many reviews already)
A - Dark tawny brown color with a creamier looking, slightly off-white head. 
S - Pruney/raisiny maltiness with a bit of alcohol peeking through. Several layers of sweetness involved with candied sugar and a bit of an herbal aroma. 
T - Maltiness dominates with the raisin and dark fruit flavors from the aroma really shining in the flavor. Sweek cakiness, toffee, and a little bit of lighter fruit flavors as well. Little touch of peppery alcohol. 
M - Medium MF, but I might have expected this to be a little heavier considering the look and overall complexity. It does coat and cover the palate really well, and provided a warming finish. 
D - Wonderfully drinkable with the numerous layers of flavor that hit the palate. Even though it is a rich brew, I had no trouble savoring every last bit of it. 
Overall, I have to say that this lives up to the hype. Really fortunate to have tried this at least once, and I really hope to be able to have it again someday. Really is a shame I can't access this regularly. Wonderful brew. 1,138 charactersNickls, Apr 15, 2009
4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On to the 8.
Pours a dark clear brown with a thin creme head. Nose is Chalky malts. Flavor is malty thick. Sugar tones are there as well. Feel is fairly vibrant on carbonation (much more than the 12) and the liquid is smooth. This is a nice beer, but I think I have come to the decision that the Westy brews are a class of their own. Unique and unlike anything else around. I am glad to have been able to try them, but they are a bit too unusual...even for my palate. 
P.S. I appreciated this one more than the 12. 516 charactersRblWthACoz, Apr 11, 2009
3.45/5  rDev -23%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Big thanks to tprokop7 for helping me knock off another holy grail. Makes a while i've been holding on to this so very happy to try it. Shared this with my wife while in the background the Thirsty Traveler was playing on TV and, you guessed it, he was visiting Belgium so kind of appropriate don't you think?
Best before Sept. 22, 2010.
Poured from their standard blank bottle (11.2 oz maybe?)
Appearance: Dark mahogany brown body with tiny flecks floating in the body. A tiny bit amber in the pour. Thick off-white/beige head, easily 3 fingers.
Smell: Fruity at first with some zest. Cloves, herbs and my wife smells rosemary also.
Taste: Big time herb presence with lots of spice and some dried fruit. The spices are a little overpowering, dry and a little rough. A little harsh, almost like eating a stem or some herbs. As it warms, it calms down a little at least and has some sherry presence but i still find it a little unbalanced for my taste. Not at all what i was expecting. Where's the malt presence & the sweetness? 
Mouthfeel: Fair amount of carbonation but bitter on the palate. Again, better as it warms and a small improvement but it is still impeded by the taste.
Drinkabilty: Average, not too high. The harshness & bitterness of the herbs/spices was a little too much. I would give it another chance and it wasn't a chore to drink but wasn't a complete pleasure either.
Overall: A let down for me. A good beer but not an outstanding one from my point of view. It really felt like i was drinking liquid herbs (no other way to explain it) and really over-powered any other flavor that might have been there, not too pleasant. Still, i would like to try it again to give it another chance. 1,711 characterspapat444, Apr 11, 2009
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Got this at De Bierkoning in Amsterdam. 
From a bottle into a chalice. 
APPEARANCE: Pours a 2-finger medium looking off-white / tan head with decent retention. No carbonation evident. Colour is a very opaque deep auburn or bistre brown. Beer is very thick looking with quite a few little floaties. Head settles to a decent film and leaves some immediate lacing. A thin film remains the whole way and leaves some decent lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Caramel malt, some toffee, and a healthy dose of dark fruits, mostly grapes, cherries and dates. Nose is medium strong and quite enticing. The grapes make is slightly red-wine like. Absolutely wonderful, but could be just a touch bolder for my liking.
TASTE: Very tasty for sure. Caramel malt again, but that's soon taken over by lots of fruity and spicy components. Dark fruits abound, cherries again, but the dark grapes shine though giving it a very wine-like characteristic. A touch of brown sugar and spices near the end, along with a slight alcohol punch and some bitterness at the end. Aftertaste is mild but long lasting, sweet and spicy, and very enjoyable. I've had a lot of these dubbels, and I really like the style, and this is the best tasting one I've had. 
PALATE: Medium body, medium carbonation, velvety smooth on the palate. A cool twang in there as well. Goes down smooth, no bite, and finishes crisp. A nice job here. 
OVERALL: This one is definitely worth the hype. Easily the best all-round Belgian dubbel I've had, and I've certainly had my share. I could never wait for the next sip. The smell and especially the taste profile make this one totally worthy of its top 10 spot and a must-try for every beer lover out there. I'll certainly be picking more of these up when I happen to see them. Recommended. 1,785 charactersJeffo, Apr 09, 2009

Best Before 29.09.10, so this is about a year and a half old. Poured in a big wine glass at 56 F/ 13 C.
Dark red-brown color, dense beige head, thick rings of lace.
Aroma is fruity, malty, spicy, nutty. Along the lines of fresh white grapes, cherries, Christmas pudding, and spiced pecans, with depth and complexity, very nice.
Tastes malty, fruity and spicy. Complex dark nutty fruity caramel malt flavors, quite tasty. Some mild solvent. The flavor develops on the palate for several seconds, with deep bourbon and astringent black tea and tobacco notes emerging. Great balance. Long fairly dry finish, complex malt and black tea.
Cushy fine carbonation, with some nice tealike astringency. No problems with drinkability, this is hard to put down.
Great beer. Big thanks to ygtbsm94, I was glad to try this with a little age on it. 879 charactersBeerzebub, Mar 30, 2009

S: Belgian yeast is very prominent giving this one a pretty unique aroma. Spicy. Dark fruits and raisins. Good caramel malt component.
T/M: Everything on the smell. Yeasty, with lots of spicy notes. Big malt backbone with dark fruit and candi sugar. The mouthfeel is awesome. Lots of carbonation and a crisp relatively dry finish. Very mild lingering bitterness reminds you there are hops here too.
D: Very drinkable.
This is a very good beer that I was glad to be able to try. A benchmark as a well-crafted dubbel. But is it worthy of a top 10 rating on my list? Probably not. 714 charactersabfraser, Mar 30, 2009

Review #400
The beer poured a deep chestnut color with ruby highlights when held to the light. A dense, creamy, tan, two-finger head capped the liquid. The head faded to a thick creamy ring and a lasting film. Some trickling lacing cascaded down the glass.
The aroma was amazingly unique and complex. Semi-sweet, fruity and malty rich with indications of dark candi sugar. Somewhat boozy. A unique, floral-like, Belgian yeast strain was immediately detectable, and it became more pronounced as the beer warmed. Some red wine-like characteristics were noticeable as well.
The taste was amazingly smooth and delicate. The first thing that hit me was the Belgian yeast strain that is so apparent in both the Westvleteran 8 and 12 beers. Pungent, flowery and slightly creamy. Very intriguing. Caramel malts came through up front. Dark, fruity, plum and raisin notes appeared in the center. Brown sugar and spice notes (clove and allspice) were also quite noticeable. A touch woody. As the beer warmed, the spiciness intensified. A slight twang came through on the crisp, off-dry, somewhat cider-like finish.
The mouthfeel was initially light, creamy, pillowy and amazingly supple on the palate, but it became less appealing with time. As the beer sat, the liquid became thinner and the carbonation seemed to turn more prickly.
Drinkability was outstanding. This beer was so incredibly smooth, balanced and flavorful. Furthermore, the 8% ABV was amazingly well hidden.
If I had to use one word to describe this beer it would be "graceful." Truly world-class in every sense. 1,688 charactersDamian, Mar 07, 2009

4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours a very dark brown, hazy looking, with a cm thick off-white head, that kind of falls back and sticks around. Looks about right. The smell is immediately of sweetness. There are notes of chocolate, mixed in with just a note of coffee. There is a tiny note of alcohol, a few estery smells. There is very faintly an earthy, spicy smell. The taste has a cola/caramel sweetness, but is backed with quite a bit of complexity. There's chocolate and raisins and dark roasted malts and tamarind with a pleasant estery finish. The alcohol warms on the finish, but is barely detectable otherwise. The mouthfeel could be a bit more chewy, but there is a bit of body to it, but the carbonation provides a pleasant tickle on the way down. The drinkability of this is really what shines. I just wanted to chug it down and go on to the next (and I'd certainly feel that one on my wallet), but I knew that I needed to wait and savor this one. 930 characterstaylorhamrick, Mar 06, 2009

Looks good, legs keep running.
Smells good, as in who doesn't love Welch's grape juice?
Taste the grape juice, but also some tobacco leaves, tea leaves. Smooth stuff.
This is obviously a well crafted brew. Personally I'm not diggin it too much. Could be my lack of experience with dubbels, could be the fact that I'm an "uncultured motherfucker" as Mauerhan so poetically stated. As if that foul-mouthed sonofabitch is gonna culturize me.

Mouthfeel: Just like a nice belgian beer should be. Very well balanced.

M: Light and frothy in a sense...not sure how to describe it. Carbonation is right on the bulls-eye. 
D: Alcohol isn't there, flavor fits the style, and I could probably pound (excuse my French)...a shit load of it. 
Overall: This is above and beyond any of Dubbel I've had. A must try. Cheers! 777 charactersOlieIPA, Feb 26, 2009
4.94/5  rDev +10.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into my St. Bernardus goblet. Pours a dark raspberry red. With a light tan head that dissapated fast. No lacing in my bottle. 
Smells wonderful. Raisins, spices, carmelized sugar and their special yeast strain.
Taste is wonderful. Tastes just how it smells. The best part is the candy sugar and the yeast strain they use. Very tasty brew.
Mouthfeel is perfect for the style and in the true tradition.
Everyone should try this beer. I will always try to keep one if these around for a special treat every once in a while. 531 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Feb 26, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Deep, dark, & murky brown color with a thick & creamy off white head about 1 finger deep. Head dissolves into a sticky globs of webbing on glass.
Aroma is a swell combo of nittiness, chocolate, yeast, fruitiness complexity. Fantastic.
The taste is an equally swell combo of raisins, bready malts, toffee, sugar, date, alcohol, & some faint spice. Believe it. 
Smooth, soft, silky, medium bodied, nicely carbonated goodness.
Drinkability is great. Perfectly balanced. A world class treat I am glad to have had the opportunity to have tried. Seek it out. Obviously. 567 charactersbbothen, Feb 24, 2009
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Live review. Purchased from BelgianBeerShop.com (not to be confused with Belgianshop.com) for something like 10 Euros, received about 6 weeks ago and waiting for this opportunity to sample. I also bought a Westvleteren glass and of course I poured it into it.
A Pours a dark, dark brown, in front of direct light there is a ruby red outline, glow but the body remains very dark indeed. It reminds me a lot of the Westy 12 but this head is not as significant and long lasting (the head on the 12 never did go away but this one dissipated within a few minutes). Sediment is visible in the bottom of the glass but also sticking around in the body itself. That is also very much like the Westy 12. 
S I am really glad that I had the Westy 12 just before this one since it affords me a quick comparison. The smell has the sweet concord grape malt but it is weaker than the 12, appropriately enough. It remains inviting and I do not detect any alcohol in the nose.
T The complex malt, grains and wonderful grainy taste with barely perceptible alcohol are very much present in this beer along with the Westy 12. Something that sets this one apart is that it is a it less sticky with less than an aftertaste. 
M Full for sure but this is less smooth than the 12. It is a bit more watery but maintains its biggness due to bit malt, yeasty grain and high ABV.
D This has a high drinkability as well but it is equally expensive and difficult to get and also has a high ABV, all of which, in a practical sense, drives down the drinkability. Even through all of that, though, I enjoyed every drop of this beer. 
Notes: What a pleasure to have this beer, along with its big brother, the 12 tonight. 1,690 charactersadamette, Feb 23, 2009

4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.5Bottle of unknown age given as a Christmas present from the girlfriend.
The beer poured a deep murky brown, like dark chocolate. The head was airy and a light tan color, about a finger thick, and dissipated to 1/4 finger. After that the head stuck around for a while and left moderate lacing on the glass.
The aroma was strong, I noticed it from a distance while pouring. There was a predominant fruit quality to it as well, some cherry and some apple in the scent. Underneath were smells of chocolate, roast, a hint of coffee, and other dark fruits. It's very similar to the smell I remember Westmalle having, but much stronger, and very sweet. There's also a harder to describe earthen quality to the smell, of old wood or clay pots.
The taste was not nearly as sweet as I expected from the smell. Chocolate is present along with cherry notes, underneath is apple cider and a touch of nutmeg. There's earthy flavors as well, with a hint of smokiness and a bit of wood. I was getting a slightly bready quality to it as well, like a rye or whole wheat bread. A nicely rounded bitterness lingers on the sides of the tongue. I detected a bit of dark fruit, possible plum as well. Despite it's relatively high strength, I didn't notice any alcohol in the flavor. The aftertaste is equally pleasant, with smoked wood and grain dominant in the mouth. The overall balance and complexity of this beer is amazing.
In the mouth, the first thing that jumps out about this beer is the strong, sharp carbonation. Perhaps overly so. It has a good medium body, giving it just the right amount of substance. There's a nice smooth coating on the mouth as well. Going down it has just a bit of warmth, both from the spice and the alcohol. It's not wet enough to be considered refreshing, but it's not really dry either.
The drinkability of this beer is just incredible. It's strength is not apparent in the taste, just in the after-effects. I have no desire at all to drink this one quickly, but I feel like it's a flavor I'd never get sick of. Absolutely a drink to savor and enjoy. 2,071 charactersstageseven, Feb 20, 2009
4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I figured after many years of delaying my first review, this would be as good a beer as any to kick off with...
Ap - Rosey-brown with burgundy highlights, splotchy pattern in the head which was also noted in the Blond, small bead, persisitant head, fine lace.
Ar - dried fruits - fig, plum, raisin, some warming alcohol notes and esters with an overall perceived smoothness. More vinous notes evident as the beer warms.
T - subtle and well balanced flavours of sweeter fruits, soft malt, caramel, with a warming finish and a noticeable but smooth bitterness.
M - Creamy, slightly prickley (ethanol), with a pleasant smoothness from start to finish.
D - Very smooth and well balanced beer, a delight to drink, but not quite as overwhelming as I was expecting.
Reminds me of a lot of the St Bernardus brunes, or a fresh Westmalle Dubbel.

Appearance: Pours a deep mahogany color with a decent sized tan head on it. This beer didn't leave any lacing either on my glass.
Smell: I get a good dose of dark fruit dominated by raisins on the nose. I am also getting caramel, sugar, and a little bit of alcohol.
Taste: I am getting plenty of malt character upfront with molasses and caramel, and a prominent grape flavor, a hint of spice, and just a touch of chocolate as well.
Mouthfeel: The prickly carbonation leaves a fairly dry sensation at the back of my palate.
Drinkability: A very nice sipper, and if there beer were readily available I would purchase it often. 698 charactersTheodorHerzl, Feb 06, 2009
4.49/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Review #100 - to celebrate I opened a Westy 8 that has a best before date of August 28th, 1999 - meaning it was likely bottled in 1996. I've kept in mind the ridiculous age on this brew (it's the oldest thing I've ever had) and I'll likely append to the review after I drink a fresh one. Served in a goblet.
A - Good foam for such an old brew! One-finger of light tan head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves a tiny bit of lace. The beer itself is a murky brown color with a tinge of orange. Surprisingly free of solids.
S - Wow! This is so complex that I don't even know where to start. Apples, cherries, grapes, plums, raisins - very fruity, but also vinous with a white wine element to it. There's still a good malt backbone with caramel flavors in it. It is unbelievable that a Dubbel smells this good after so long.
T - The malt and caramel flavors come out more in the taste, but there's still a lot of fruit juice characteristics present - grapes, plums, and raisins to be specific. There's also a smoky/woody tinge to the taste that wasn't present in the smell.
M - Very smooth, with a good medium-bodied viscosity. Surprisingly there is still a little carbonation tingle present after all these years. Leaves a slightly sticky feeling after swallowing.
D - This beer was very, very, sweet and the flavor was extremely intense. While it otherwise didn't have anything to detract from its drinkability (carbonation was fine, not too boozy, etc.) the experience was so exhausting that I think having more than one of these would be utterly ridiculous. I'd also have incredible guilt over consuming more than one bottle.
I was quite worried when I decided to open this - it could easily have been utterly foul - but this beer has aged remarkably well. I suspect it'd score a little better earlier in its life (particularly in the appearance and mouthfeel categories), but I'm very glad to have been lucky enough to score such an ancient bottle - gives me hope for the 1980s Westy ABT and Westy 6 I have kicking around. 2,035 charactersMasterSki, Feb 03, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this at the Cafe "In de Vrede" near the Sint-Sixtusabdij in Westvleteren, Belgium. This brew was almost in every way a toned down version of the Trappist Westvleteren 12. 
A: Gorgeous dark brown hue with an almost syrupy consistency. Though the head isn't that thick, the lacing is very prominent and sticks to the side of the glass forever. 
S: Figs, toffee, caramel, dates. An overall molasses-like character combined with maple syrup gives this one an aromatic, saccharine scent. 
T: Very complex and layered, similar to the Westvleteren 12. A chewy molasses and caramel malt character underscore the base of this fantastic brew. Alcohol is there but less prominent than the 12. Cloves, cinnamon, and nutmeg are there to provide higher notes of spiciness. Dark, candied fruits round out the taste. 
M: Slightly more watery than the 12, leaving less of a slick, oily feeling on the palate. This was slightly off-putting as I expected it to be more prominent and full-bodied for this type of brew.
D: Great for sipping. However, you wouldn't down these as you would any other dubbel mainly because you'd want to savor the flavor and work out its complexities. 1,169 charactersthekanna, Feb 02, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Can't thank Eric enough from Novare Bier Café in Portland, ME. Special Night.
Pours a dark brown with lots of reddish/purple tones. Slightly cloudy and a small light tan/of white head. Quite foamy. Touches of lacing left in the glass. Not too much though.
Aroma was of dark fruits and some nice spices.. The whole dates, raisin thing... Fig is sweeter smelling than date to me... So I'll stick with date.
After taking my first sip I proclaimed, "There you go.." Wow the immediate reaction is about the depth of flavor. The fruits are there like the aroma advertises... and there is a slight phenolic flavor. Eric helped me identify this... I was thinking medicinal... He told me what I was tasting. Not in the way, but it was there. What shocked me was the layers of malt flavor here. Deep caramel, toffee notes that you could think about for a while...
Some nice spices and some real earthy tones.
Am I committing a BA sin by saying I might have enjoyed this as much as the Westy 12?? Maybe it was the setting... But this was fantastic.
Drinkable? Um, yes. 1,063 charactersReagan1984, Feb 01, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A beer to blow your mind, yet again. This one is at least a year and a half old, though I know not the exact date. Dates? yes, dates, and figs, but mostly grain. Fresh, dripping, sweet-mash, 145 degree grain. Glorious, steamy grain. 
The absolute best earthy, natural smells possible... a cave, the clean brook there, some dates, some syrup... biscuit, but the british kind. The figs are outlandish, as is the soft, warm alcohol. 
Oh, I suppose I got ahead of myself. Appearance, of course. A muddy dark brown, plenty of head and beautiful lacing on this one. 
Oh, but the aroma... melba toast. Baby cereal. Rose water. 
Ah, the monks, the solitude, the dank dungeons of incredible inventiveness... how does one go about producing this?
The flavour melds with the aroma, though it is not quite as sweet. It's like a fresh wort with dark fruit steeped in it, but with a warmth in the finish, the beautiful soft spice of the alcohol. 
This beer is cake. Biscuit-cake, grain-cake, date-cake. As if one could make flour from the dark fruits of all the world, and make a cake from it. Mmmm... cake.
Exceptional. Absolutely exceptional. Unbelievable. Worth every bit of hype you've ever heard. Oh... 1,193 characterskhiasmus, Jan 30, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Received this gem from my main man down in the sunshine state tpd975. This will be my first brew from Westvleteren and I'm pretty freaking stoked. Drank from my Ithaca Excelsior tulip.
Appearance- Pours a dark purple brownish with a fairly small light tan head. To be fair though when I opened the beer the head was slowly popping out of the bottle so I poured very gently. A spotty cap and thin collar remain leaving no lacing.
Smell- Fruity and somewhat sweet smelling there is plenty of prunes, raisins and figs and the lightest touch of red apple. Somewhat toasty caramel and toffee do an excellent job of hiding the light twinge of alcohol. Some dark candied sugars and cherry come through a bit more as it warms as does some of the light yeasty tones.
Taste- Starts with a light spice that is something like allspice or nutmeg and a super subtle tinge of cinnamon. It seems like it should be a bit sweeter than it is but its not. Some dried fruitiness (prunes, raisins) and candy apples are the bulk of the flavor. Slightly bitter at times with an almost kick of citric hops. The yeast is dirty and earthy and the alcohol shows just a hair toward the finish. A long lingering, almost tart, green apple like fruitiness seems to come out and last forever.
Mouthfeel- Full and viscous the body can't quite reach the velvety smoothness that hides underneath as the carbonation adds a quick sharp bite.
Drinkability- Amazing brew that I really enjoyed. I always try to go into these 'higher ranked' beers with a open mind and not let any 'hype' reflect my reviewing. As a huge fan of all beers though, it's nearly impossible to not enjoy this beer. Considering the availability of this brew and of Rochefort, Rochefort definitely makes a great substitute. Maybe not AS good, but pretty close. Big thanks to Greg!! 1,815 charactersyounger35, Jan 30, 2009
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - 4.5
Poured expertly by the barman at In de Vrede. A finger of beige head reduced to a thin layer over a dark brown body that is barely penetrated by light and amber-red around the edges. Left a little lacing on its way down.
Smell - 4.0
Very subdued when cool, aromas are hard to detect. A few minutes warming reveals an aroma that is quite dry, predominantly cocoa with a slight fruitiness in the background. I expected a more pugent aroma from a beer of 8% ABV.
Taste - 4.0
Much less sweet than its big brother Westvletern 12 - in fact this beer is surprisingly dry with quite muted flavours. Good balance of malt and hops, bitterness is moderate, tastes of burnt fruitcake, dark chocolate and a little spice. Alcohol is warming in the finish. Improves with warmth, but never approaches the richness of flavour found in some dark Belgian ales.
Mouthfeel - 4.5
Carbonation is lively but not quite so fine as to make it creamy. Feels light in the mouth, easy to sip.
Drinkability - 4.0
Lacks the cloying sweetness often found in Belgian ales, and all the more drinkable for it.
OVERALL - 4.15
Clearly a very good beer, but considering it has the Westvleteren name on it, I have to say I am disappointed. To be fair, I was close to scoring it a 4.5 for taste, which would have bumped the overall score up to 4.35. However, one telling point is that I found this beer to be much less satisfying than a Westmalle Dubbel, a less complex, but much richer tasting beer. I would love to drink this beer again one day to see if my opinion changes.
Re-Review:
An older bottle this time, it seems to have mellowed and improved. An exceptionally good beer, though not quite up to the wow factor of the Westie 12. More bitterness and hop flavour than the rest of the Trappist breweries. 1,794 charactersLittleCreature, Jan 29, 2009
4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52007 Bottle consumed today.
Appearance: Dark amber that gets more brown like as the glass is filled. Soft creamy 2 fingers of light mocha head with medium retention and some lacing. The head is more impressive than the body to me. So soft and lush looking.
Smell: Dark fruits, a touch of caramel, and a touch of toffee. Predominantly dark fruits though.
Taste: Spicy yeast and a mellowed sugar rush to the forefront with dark fruits following. A touch of hops and another touch of caramel come in the finish which is not very drawn out. Fairly clean and very appetizing. A delicious dubbel. 
Mouthfeel: Lush carbonation and a well crafted effervescence create a world class mouthfeel. Probably my favorite characteristic of this brew. 
Drinkability: One of the smoothest, easiest to drink, 8% ABV beverages that will touch your lips. 838 characterskoopa, Jan 28, 2009

This Westvleteren actually has some discernible hops on the nose and palate; a nice compliment to the sweet malt flavors. Very sweet aroma, with some cherry and brown sugar notes.
Mouthfeel is much lighter than the 12 (as expected), but great in its own right. The carbonation opens things up like any good Belgian does.
Much less intense than the 12, but a great beer nonetheless. Time to enjoy now. 499 charactersjjazz, Jan 21, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My wife and I will share a 330ml bottle just below cellar temperature split between Westvleteren chalice glasses. The cap indicates, with a faded 20.12.09, that it's just over 2 years old.
5. Not 100% opaque dark brown pour with a hint of caramel and amber. 165ml pour builds a 1.5cm head which turns to the prototypical lace. Each sip leaves some lace on the back of the glass - playing with which is half the fun of drinking these beers... ok, maybe not.
5. Smells like caramel and mollasses, and raisons, and dates, and figs. Very rich aroma which invites you to take a sip. A swirl generates mustier and yeasty smells.
4.5. The taste is incredible. A very powerful combination of the smell. The yeast is more prominent on the flavor profile than the aroma and contributes sweet biscuity flavors. This is definitely a rich, sweet beer, but there is just a hint of bitterness which balances. At times there's just a hint of alcohol warmth. Further into the glass, the hops come forward and carry some acidic flavors which adds to the complexity of this offering. The finish carries all the flavors: rich, sweet, tart, and yeasty. Last night, when drinking this immediately after Westmalle Dubbel, I was ready to give this a 5, but tonight with more focus and a cleaner palate, I'm pinning it at a 4.5 - closer to a 4.75. Many times when drinking this beer with a year or more of age on it, I thought it has to be better than Westveleteren 12. Tonight, I can imagine otherwise. The flavors are not as rich, dark fruity, sweet, or chocolatey.
5. The mouthfeel is perfect - smooth, effervescent, still quite carbonated, thick but not sticky.
5. I could drink this non-stop. Less alcohol than the Westvleteren 12, and as such easier drinking. Not quite as inviting as the 12, but this is a sipper which keeps me sipping. Again, this is one of those beers which you sip out of respect not necessity.
Umm, incredible. Thinner than the 12. We'll see if a 12 pops out of the cellar for a comparison. To end my internal debate once and for all: is an aged Westvleteren 8 better than a fresh Westvleteren 12? 2,106 charactersjpiper, Jan 02, 2009

Appearance is the weak point, and even here I am nitpicking. Pours a murky brown with creamy brown head. 
Smell.. Wait, did I open a lambic by mistake? Sweet and fruity, incredibly appetizing. 
Taste-I am blown away. In no way are these overrated. Hard to detect alcohol at all. 
Mouthfeel- just right amount of carbonation and a medium body.
Drinkability- I'd drink nothing but if they weren't so difficult to come by. 535 characterssonicdescent, Dec 24, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A- pours a very dark brown, approaching black at the center. A modest foamy cap forms, but dissipates to a rich sheet of bubbles after a few minutes, leaving splotchy lacing down the glass.
S- Complex and fruity. Dark frutis and cherries come through with a slight toasty aroma. A slight spiciness is detected as well.
T- Very well balanced. Malty, dark and rich. Toasty, bready notes come through with Belgian yeast and spice. Black cherries, fig, and plum come through without fighting for the lead, followed by a slight, but surprising hop bitterness. My only complaint is a slight booziness.
M- Very nutty texture with moderate carbonation.
D- Enjoyable and easy to drink. Perhaps this beer is somewhat overrated, but there is no argument that it is at least a really solid Dubbel. 789 charactersJoeMayo, Dec 18, 2008

Anyway, wow, is this ever a pretty beer. Head on the bigger side of medium, tiny dark bubbles, ridiculously lasting lace. Opaque brown. Smells of grass and brown sugar. Ah, well, the nose doesn't lie - brown sugars aplenty, there. Only, sugar in flavor and not in sweetness - it's pretty even and mellow. This has that Belgian astringency that is missing in the 12. It's a very good example of the style. 527 characterscharlesw, Dec 13, 2008

A - Dark nut brown in color with slightly lighter brown hues around the edges. One finger of creamy foam on top that slowly fades to a thin foam layer. Leaves rings of lacing on the glass.
S - Aroma of dark fruits dominates with figs and dark cherries coming to mind. A light nuttiness underneath. Very sweet aroma.
T - Very sweet initially. The dark fruits of the nose come through very strong in the taste as well. Lots of cherry, fig and a little hint of dates. Rich caramel maltiness begins to come through with a faint hint of spice. As the beer warms the spice becomes far stronger with lots of cinnamon, nutmeg, and allspice. Let this beer slowly warm as it just comes to life with each bump up the thermometer.
M/D - I would barely call it full bodied and very rich feel in the mouth. Well carbonated. Incredible dubbel and very easy drinking. 907 charactersckeegan04, Dec 13, 2008

Smell was cola nut. Freshly opened bag of prunes. Freshly milled grains. Grapes. Complex. 
Taste was figgy. Slight alcohol aroma. A light tangy aftertaste. Juicy raisins. Rich, intense dried fruitiness. Not cloying and well balanced between the fruity sweetness and the tangy, light bitterness. 
Mouthfeel was lively. Effervescent but not overly carbonated. Medium to full bodied. All around nice beer. I drank this one entirely too fast, so good. 660 charactersCresant, Dec 05, 2008

M- medium in body and finishes pretty dry as well.
This beer just didn't seem to have a whole lot going on. It was sweet and it tasted like the artificial grape flavoring you get from candy.

A= Much like the Westy 12, this ale poured a murky, dirty dishwater tan/brown color (albeit a shade or two off of the 12). With a gentle pour, the off-white head was about 1" and creamy looking. Nice web of lacing down the glass.
S= This was a beautiful beer to my nose. Lots of sweet malts and fruitiness combined to bring aromas of treacle, dark candi sugar, molasses, raisins, figs, and dates. Some alcohol near the end, but nothing overpowering. 
T= Very good balance of dark raisin bread and candi sugar sweetness. Caramelized sugars were front, center, and delicious. Mildly yeasty in the middle with a slightly drier finish. Comfortable alcohol in the finish. Long aftertaste of faint spice, yeast, and sweetness.
MF= Medium bodied. Feel was soft despite a mild crispness to the carbonation. 
D= Definitely a world class ale. I still cannot decide if I liked the Westy 8 or 12 better. Either way, this beer is worth the hype (but not necessarily the cost). 1,102 charactersspointon, Nov 27, 2008

S- Malty nose with a big boozy smell with it actually not that inviting
T- The taste is very good a mix of malt and semi sweetness, lots of booze in the back but very good.
M- Creamy and full with just enough carbonation, they really have the mouth feel down.
D- Drinkable and very good but not earth shattering.

Smells of rich malts, fruity hops, and Belgian yeasts. First sip is way smooth, crisp, and tangy with a lovely balance of malt, hops, and yeast. Sweet and then slightly bitter with pears being the dominate fruit. Super creamy lacing clings so happily to the sides of the glass. So very good...so very good indeed.

Appears brownish mahogany in color, relatively cloudy. Two inches of creamy off-white head that takes forever to recede. When it does it leaves some nice looking lacing down the glass.
Aroma has sweet overtones with notes of dark fruits like plums and raisins, a bit of basement mustiness
Taste has some nice sugary sweetness up front that is quickly intercepted by the plum and raisin dark fruit flavors that were in the aroma. There is moderate spiciness that comes in next but it never really peaks out and instead blends with some toffee flavors and earthy hops that linger on into the finish.
Mouthfeel is medium-light, very nice carbonation level makes it very creamy.
Much better than the Blonde. This is making me want to crack the 12. Quite drinkable for the style. 886 charactersroadhouse, Nov 15, 2008

Vintage 1997. aged 10 years before sampling 12/31/07. 
A: Poured a deep, hazy mahogany red with a beautiful fluffy light beige head that was mostly lasting leaving a thin film lacing on the sides of the glass. There were small and numerous suspend yeast particles dancing about.
S: On the nose was dark, caramelized molasses, and dried fruit (plums, raisins, cherries) with just a touch of figs. 
T: The initial flavor was miraculous, full of the rich flavors of ripe fruit (raisins, apples, dates) along with a rich creamy caramelized malting that was silky and smooth. The mouthful was full, with a rich sweet caramel and warm fruit coming through. There was a sweet spiciness (light brown sugar, maple syrup) alogn with a beautiful arm toastiness, and light woody notes. The alcohol was incredibly hidden for its abv of 8.0%abv. 
M: The carbonation was incredibly smooth and soft with a silky smooth texture. 
D: Overall a perfectly balanced beer with a rich maltiness full of caramel and maple syrup sweetness with a vast complexity of dried fruit. Drinks like a dream leaving a sweet malty lacing behind. Believe it, its not just hype, truly a standout beer amongst all others and the best beer in the world. 1,225 charactersbeerthulhu, Nov 13, 2008

4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4My visit to the cafe In de Vrede was awesome and the beer was terrific. All 3 Westvleteren beers offered there were great, to include this one.
Red brown body color...the head is not as sturdy as the blonde or the 12, but is still thick and creamy. Same boiling mash smell as the blonde and the 12, but the cereal smell is a bit sweeter. In flavor, this beer lacks the fruitiness of the 12 but adds additional sweetness and some sour. Surprisingly not malty in flavor. Mouthfeel is quite good; despite the sweetness the beer is not overly sticky.
Very good. I would highly recommend this. 590 charactersBeerBelcher, Oct 24, 2008
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5330ml bottle from the Cracked Kettle, Amsterdam... Date on cap is 26/08/09... poured into a Westvleteren chalice... 
Poured a deep burgundy red colour with some dark brown tinges... some small floaties also...
Creamy mocha head poured very tight, thick and foamy then faded slowly to good meringue like one finger covering... lots of sticky lacing lines hang round until near the end...
Aroma - Rich alcohol soaked dried fruits (raisins, dates, prunes, stewed plums) mixed with lots of typical spicy Belgian yeastiness, lots of anise / cough mixture notes, leathery, toasted nuts, muscovado sugar / treacle sweetness, some sour vinegar traces (kind of like a Flanders red), cut wet grass, some pepper and nutmeg spiciness...
Taste - Strong spicy fruits (definite raisins, figs and prunes), toffee apples, toasted malts, molasses and treacle sweetness, malt loaf, quite strong Belgian yeastiness, some warming alcohol, bitter chocolate and liquorice, peppery, light medicinal notes, spicy / peppery hops cut through the sweetness, light ginger spiciness.... outstanding... 
Feel - Very smooth and creamy with a light sharpness just coming through... medium / full bodied... unbelievably drinkable even at 8%...
Overall - Another world class brew from Brouwerij Westvleteren although i think a little more age on this would have made it even better... Outstanding and highly recommended.... 1,393 charactersmdagnew, Oct 23, 2008
4.32/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to NoonanDBarbarian for sharing this one.
Pours an unusual cloudy brown with ruby highlights. A decent fizzy white head recedes quickly and leaves moderate lacing.
Nose is all butter and dark fruit. Dried plum and raisins. Belgian yeast.
Taste follows. Very very rich, dark fruit like a goddamn quad. Dried rum soaked plum and raisin. Fig. Belgian yeast is apparent. Very rich.
Mouthfeel is a bit too thick here, quite heavy. The richness adds to this.
Drinkability is good, quite good, but i would have expected a bit more thin. The intense richness of the dark fruits makes this one a bit less drinkable. Very buttery. 
Overall a very very enjoyable and tasty dubbel. Very very rich and fruity taste. Really alot of quad like flavor in here with the dark fruit richness. Another hit from westy. 12 will always be their shining example to me, but 8 is also a very very nice beer. 893 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Oct 19, 2008
4.61/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I won this in leftmindedrighty's recent LIF!!!
Pours a murky iced-tea color with some nice ruby highlights when held to light, a crazy-dense beige head hangs around for the duration, diminishing very slowly in size, but never disappearing. Lots of sediment is suspended in the beer, and some yeast spills out of the bottle, leaving some dark brown swirls in the foamy head. Lots of fig, raisin, and apple on the nose. Red apple flavors come through a lot more as it warms, light brown sugar, some earthiness. Very finely carbonated, really creamy as it hits your lips, but the carbonation makes this one almost refreshing....this would pair with lots of dishes. This is an amazing beer, and I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to try it! 743 characterscorey0212, Oct 18, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Received this as a generous extra in a trade with tayner, tucked in there mysteriously. Thanks, Dana!
A: A very dark, tea-like brown... if I recall correctly, this seems to come across as being a little darker than the 12. I'm having this later in the evening when there's not as much light, though. Head of sandy tan forms up wonderfully with a nice creaminess to it. Retention is quite nice and it leaves a rich, liberal sheet over the beer.
S: Some nice caramel-toffee scents, some touches of date and fig, slightly leathery, and a woody quality adding a little touch. 
T: A rich, complex flavour... dark malt, a bitter chocolate note, very soft fruits - almost under the radar. Herbal notes, and a spiciness of the alcohol. The touch of tanned leather is in there, too. 
M: Medium bodied, with some good weight to it - a full, shimmering, foamy carbonation adds a nice touch without being too prickly. Crisp and finishes with a little tingle. 
D: Drinkability is great for a sipping-oriented beer. I found myself drinking it back without much second thought. Easy sailing on here, perhaps moreso than some other dubbels. Overall, a wonderful brew - able to drink it with a little more ease than the 12, but in terms of flavour and feel, the big brother still takes it for my palate! 1,291 charactersProteus93, Oct 12, 2008
4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to leftmindedrighty for this bottle and the oppurtunity to try a world class brew. This puppy was served up in goblet.
A: Pours a thick, dark brown. Probably the darkest a brown can possibly be without being black. this puppy lets no light through. A somewhat gentle pour yielded a good finger and a half of light tan head. The head is amazingly creamy. It sticks to the glass with a thickness I have never seen before. It leaves the thickest sheeting I have ever seen on a glass. Simply beautiful to look at.
S: Smell is of Belgian Yeast, I know I was shocked as well. Nice bready malt is there in force. Then infiltrates the fruit: apple, fig, raisin. The fruits are very subtle and are rounded out by a brown sugar presence. Very nice.
T: At first this beer is incredibly subtle. Then the yeast pushes through as it warms. Then comes a sweet, shortbread malt. The fruits are even more subtle, with apples really coming out and fig and raisin chilling in the background. The brown sugar sweetness is just barely there in the aftertaste rounding the beer off. This beer evolves as it warms. Very interesting.
M: This is a full bodied beer but it almost doesn't feel like a full bodied beer and that is its genius. Its carbonation is big time, making the beer crisp and refreshing, but the texture is wonderfully creamy. All the flavors coat the mouth and really let you explore what this beer has to offer. No notice of the ABV. This is really good. This beer is liquid velvet. It does for texture what Lionel Richie did for the ear drum with all those soulful classics.
D: I could drink a case of this and not blink. These monks know what the fuck is going on. This beer is damned near perfect. I want more and I want to move to Belgium. If you get the chance, do it. All of the above. 1,799 characterseveretends, Oct 08, 2008
4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 330 ml bottle into a Westvleteren glass. 09/24/08. Looks like a printed date on the cap but I can't make out the numbers.
Pours a deep dark brown color with about a finger on bubbly tan head. The head quickly dropped to a thin layer, which then turned into almost nothing. Aroma has Belgian yeast, candied sugar, all kinds of dark fruits (raisin, fig, date, plum), molasses, and brown sugar. Smells very nice.
Taste is sweet Belgian yeast and malt. Lots of dark fruit (raisin, fig) and apple. Some caramel, toffee, and brown sugar as well. Very slight warming alcohol but barely noticeable.
Feel is medium-full body and plenty of carbonation yet very smooth. Very dry finish. Drinkability is pretty good. The alcohol is well hidden.
Overall a pretty good dubbel. It's pretty tasty. Try it if you get a chance. 827 charactersbkilpatr, Sep 25, 2008
4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A : Pours a nice murky brown with a good tan head
S : A nice sweet malt aroma along with some dark fruits and yeasty aromas.
T : Very similar to the Westvleteren 12 except that the flavors are a little more toned down. Good sweet malt flavor along with some dark fruit notes. It doesn't have the slight alcohol finish that the 12 does.
M : Medium-bodied, smooth, good carbonation
D : An excellent beer just slightly under the 12 tastewise. I would rate this one as more drinkable in comparison. It was great to drink and with the lower alcohol, just makes it easier to have multiples and enjoy the goodness. 611 charactersmhewes, Sep 15, 2008
4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Somewhat murky and brown with a medium tannish head and very nice retention. Smell is somewhat light but at the same time there is a lot to it. Spices, dark fruit, candy sugar and caramel. Yeast is noticeable. Taste is great. Excellent dark fruit flavors are more prominent here. Fig, plum, and apple skin show up front but become more faint. Dark cherry and a grape flavor become more prominent. A good caramel flavor with candy sugar and the spices compliment the flavor very well. A nice, steady carbonation with light bitterness and spices, almost tickling the tongue. I could enjoy one of these at a time and not because it's tough to come by. It's a good dessert beer, one I'm very happy to have tried. 
I owe thanks to abankovich for a bottle. I think PHawk or akorsak also sent one. Thanks, guys! 805 charactersncvbc, Sep 11, 2008

Pours chestnut with 3+ fingers of tan head. Very good lacing & good head retention
S: Apple skins & orchard fruits
T: Apple skins, dryness, cinnamon, a touch of leather & green apples up front. This becomes very warming once this approaches warmer temperature, along slight charred grains, more leather & dryness & some pears as well. Finishes dry with fruittyness
MF: Light. spritzy (maybe this is fairly young bottle?) & very warming
Drinks easy enough, this must be a younger, bottle. I personally was too paranoid to sit on this bottle for too long, if you have a safe cellar. (me, I have 2 kids under 9) then age this to your hearts content. This is not close to my favorite dubbel, feel very fortunate to get to try it though 775 charactersrusspowell, Sep 10, 2008

Smell: Malty, fruit nose smelling of molasses blended with homemade caramel sauce, dark fruits, apple slices, and French vanilla.
Taste: Rich, sweet maltiness tasting of chocolate, caramel, and molasses. Maybe a sprinkle of brown sugar and dark candi sugar, too. Splash of fruity Beaujolais. Flavors of figs and golden raisins and Red Delicious apples. Pass the Baked Alaska!! A touch bready. Slight yeastiness. Rather warming alcohol presence, particularly on the finish. Finishes sweet and resoundingly fruity with a lingering red wine taste.
Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Medium-high carbonation. Smooth, velvety mouthfeel.
Drinkability: Rich, punchy and packed with a fruitastic estery character, although it lacks the depth of the yellow-capped twelve or the drinkability of the green-capped blonde. Still recommended, though. 918 charactersChainGangGuy, Sep 02, 2008

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: It's extremely hazy and a dark, nut brown color. Carbonation is very active and yields a very light mocha colored, two and a half finger head. Retention was excellent and a sticky web of lace clung to the glass.
Smell: The nose is very complex and intriguing, but just a tad light in strength. Up front, it's a little sweet smelling and features raisin, fig, and plum aromas. There's a bit of apple in there. The sweetness, in large part, seems to be attributed to a healthy dose of caramel/toffee malts. There's a hint of toasted nut that emerges late, in addition to an interesting, faint whiskey note. All in all, it's very complex and features a number of fine scents. If it were just a little stronger....
Taste: This flavor is every bit as diverse and complex as the nose. It is sweet up front and slightly sugary. Raisin, plum and fig flavors are a little less pronounced here. Caramel/toffee malts are sweet and very flavorful. They blend with a slight whiskey (or some other spirit) flavor extremely well and create a unique, very tasty flavor. Toasted nut and apple flavors emerge late contributing even more to its complexity and appetizing flavor. Alcohol is not noted. Finish is rich and sweet.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's full bodied and incredibly smooth. This is one of those rare concoctions that could be labeled "liquid silk." Despite the active carbonation, it's as smooth as can be. Drinkability is extremely high. Even at 8% abv, this is a beer I could drink all night long and ask for more...please.
Westvleteren 8 is one hell of an incredible beer. Frankly, it's slightly better than the 12. Just my personal preference. The only complaint I have is that the nose is slightly weak. Other than that, this is an extremely complex and excellent beer. Simply a "must get" for any BA. 1,820 charactersprototypic, Aug 06, 2008

Pours a semi transparent ruby brownish color. The head explodes after pouring (4 fingers) but after a minute it settles to about nothing. Has a cola type appearance at this point, no head but alot of bubbles streaming in it.
Sweet figs and cream. Velvety.
Sweetened walnuts and creamy fruit goodness. Really smooth. this beer doesn't disappoint. Better than the hype.
I mentioned this beer had a sweet aroma and taste, but the mouthfeel is light and well carbonated. Not heavy in the least bit.

4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Received in a trade from zaf88. Thanks for the opportunity!
A: pours a murky cola brown color with ruby highlights around the edges. Reasonably frothy off white almond colored head. bits of sediment near the end of the bottle.
S: incredibly fruity, sweet smell with barely any alcohol noticeable. Again, similar to Westy 12, this smells like berry pie or sweet berry punch.
T&M: lots of carbonation, very bubbly. taste is of sugary sweet malt and dark fruits both of which are dominant yet not overkill in their taste. Great balance and complexity. Alcohol completely masked and no discernible bitterness. Taste lingers for quite awhile, with the sweet fruits and malts really taking over your palate and sinking into every crevice of your taste buds. Taste is fantastic!
D: Perfect. I could drink this all night long.
What a great beer, I think I like this better than Westy 12. This is a superb beer and one that I wish I had more of. I'm just glad I was able to try this unique and rare offering. 1,004 charactersjulian, Jul 28, 2008
4.08/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance
Deep, dark brown and nearly black, sporting a towering tan head that sticks around for quite a while
Smell
Not a big component of the beer, but I detect some sour notes, minerals, brown sugar, and even orange
Taste & Mouthfeel
Flavors are subtle and hard to describem but they are smooth and balanced the whole way through; finishes with pronounced alchol heat; body is somewhat thin; fine carbonation, though does not lead to the velvety texture found in an Orval or even Duvel; light flavors of caramel, brown sugar dominate the spectrum, but there's also a presence of grain and toasted malts
Overall
It's a really good beer, but I don't believe it lives up to the hype. I find too much fault in the thin body, weak aroma, and noticeable alcohol to give it a perfect rating. Definitely a treat to try in Belgium though! 836 charactersJEdmund, Jul 27, 2008
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours caramel brown with a fluffy tan head. Plenty of yeasty floaties.
Aroma is musty and yeasty, with mild dark fruit and dry apple. Very mild overall.
Taste continues with the very musty and dry aspect, reminiscent of an old ale. Mild dark fruit soaked in alcohol. Subdued citrus character. Dry cocoa and a touch of woody, earthy hop in the mildly spiced finish. 
Mouthfeel is exceptionally smooth and soft.
Tasty and interesting. Quite smooth and dangerously easy to drink. High ABV is very well hidden. Flavor is mild and unified. I will drink more if I can get a hold of it. 583 charactersBlakaeris, Jul 24, 2008

Has a big and fruity smell with some herbal and spicy qualities. 
Flavor is very nice with a mixture of dark fruitys, figs, chocolate, toffee, and cloves with a bit of a minty bit of hops in the finish. Very balanced and mellow yet it still has a lot of flavors and deep complexity.
Mouthfeel is very creamy with a nice medium body and lots carbonation, yet finishes very dry and clean.

3.3/5  rDev -26.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Review from Inaugural Issue of Beeradvocate Magazine.
Four-year-old bottle--a gift from a friend. Poured into a silver-rimmed Westvleteren chalice, a nearly opaque, dark, rusty brown, with shimmering ruby hues, a tightly-laced creamy beige head atop, and a settled, healthy, ringed lace. Toffee in the nose, along with a suggestion of dates. On the palate, very dry up front, and incredibly complex beneath. Powdery malts, dextriny notes of carob, honey, and a spike of sherry. Similar malted milky sweetness pro&#64257;le found in the Blonde, but with more depth. Soft prune, date sugar, hint of anise, slightly roasty around the edges, carob and a brush of toffee. Light phenols, herbal. Slightly fumy alcohol on the breath. Dry, powdery &#64257;nish. 
Westvleteren 8 is &#64257;ne aged, but it's become a bit too dry and muted for our liking. Delicious fresh, and arguably better than Westvleteren 12 in drinkability. 922 charactersBeerAdvocate, Jul 24, 2008
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours hazy dark brown, perhaps amber-ish when held to direct light. Sediment crept into the glass in spite of my best efforts.
Nose is complex mixture of musty attic, apple core, unsalted walnut, and wet black tea teabag. Reminds me of scented coca-cola ink pen that I had in childhood.
Palate is noticeably creamy, high carbonation, coating the palate well - and leads into a soft caramel, ginger/cinnamon flavor that is rounded out with hop bitterness proceeding into the finish. Reminiscent of cola flavors in general. 
Aftertaste reminsicent of quality black tea. 570 charactersyemenmocha, Jul 21, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 511.2 oz bottle into my Chimay Chalice. A thick tan had rises up and gently fades to a thin, ever present covering. A constant stream of bubbles is barely visible through the murky bottle-brown ale. There is a decent amount of yeast in my glass despite my gentle pour. Bits of lace adorn my glass.
Smell is rich with the aroma of toffee, malt, raisins, light banana, Belgian yeast and spices.
Taste is heaven in a glass. Sweet, smooth, delectable malt artfully blended with toffee, chocolate, molasses, light coffee, banana, raisins, figs, and spices. Yeast plays the part of binding it together. It also brings out a brandy like aspect to the taste. The finish is lightly bitter, just enough to clean your palate and set you up for the next sip. Short and rather dry there remains a light grainy taste of graham crackers and bread in the back of your throat. Superb. I would probably add more but my glass is almost empty. There are so many layers to the taste you can find something new with each sip.
Mouthfeel is super creamy and gently carbonated. Like liquid velvet.
Drinkability is the best I have ever experienced for a dubbel. A benchmark sipping beer. If you have enough to spend the night drinking it I'm jealous.

A: Pours dark, dark cola brown with a big rocky off-white head that shows very good retention and excellent lacing.
S: Aroma is very sweet initially with candi sugar and a healthy dose of Belgian yeast in the nose as well. Dark fruits are also prevalent with a hint of spices on top.
T: Taste is a more complex version of the nose. The sweetness is toned down just slightly with caramel and toffee playing a huge role on top of the dark fruits. Molasses sweetness is there in the background.
M: Mouthfeel is truly exceptional - the perfect balance of medium to full body and high carbonation. The tastes just dance all over the tongue.
D: This is one of the better examples of a Dubbel I've ever had and the drinkability is off the charts. Big thanks again to Jason for the opportunity to try all of the Westies! 899 charactersgford217, Jul 18, 2008

The smell was amazing, just like any other well crafted beer. The taste was amazing, the flavors meshed very well with the overlying malt flavors with some nut. The mouthfeel was nice a littl different from your normal beer with all the sediment. I wish I could afford to drink this all the time 413 charactersBiggness, Jul 14, 2008

11.2 oz brown bottle with a unique blue cap
Served in a Chimay goblet
Pours a dark brown with a rocky head that forms on top. A mixture of sticky lacings and spots cling to the glassware. 
Whiffs of funky Belgian yeast, strong spices and ripe plums in the nose.
A syrupy and malty flavor dominates the palate. I think of flavors like caramel, toffee & dark fruits such as prunes and rum-soaked raisins. All of these flavors blend quite nicely with a significant sugar presence. The bitterness is quite modest overall, yet still there. I really dig the bitterness as well, the carbonation bubbles prick the tongue. The drinkability level is ridiculously good. 
Wonderfully complex and so enjoyable. I could sip this beer all night long, a phenomenal Dubbel overall. This is another world class beer from Westvleteren - highly recommended. 865 charactersHibernator, Jul 10, 2008

A: Deep reddish brown with a thin but persistent beige head. Great retention - there's a constant head until I finish! There's a fair amount of carbonation creeping up the side of the glass. Pretty.
S: Complex with a combination of figs, brown sugar, nougat. Mildly alcoholic. Excellent
T: I'm having a hard time describing this. As with the nose, it's complex and very, very subtle. Starts off mildly sweet with hints of fruit (plum and figs), honey, and then dries up fairly quickly leaving a nutty finish. 
M: Incredible. Soft and smooth despite the high level of carbonation that makes this dance on the tongue. Dry. 
D: I'd drink another if I had one. 802 charactersDefenCorps, Jul 08, 2008
4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5(poured into a goblet)
A- pours a dark, dark brown (almost black) with a tan head which dissolved in a few minutes into a thin layer but never completely disappeared.
S- wonderful fruity aroma with spices and caramel
T- evolves over a 10 second period after each sip: coffee, chocolate, spices, plum, raisin, and other indescribable sensations. Though 'only' 8% , I tasted the alcohol as it went down the throat. Interestingly, I tasted pepper when I exhaled after drinking. An occasional twirl of the glass woke up the taste as well.
D- feels thick on the tongue but smooth. Drink this slowly and savor every sip if you're fortunate enough to acquire it! Its like drinking the world's greatest dessert. 707 characterstubaguy, Jul 06, 2008
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4At Cafe in de Vrede. Pours almost black with a thick two finger, off-white head that lasts and lasts. After a few sips, the lacing is--well, not even lacing, more like a sheet of foam clinging to all sides of the glass. Held up to a light source, the 8 is a beautiful dark ruby red. The nose is fantastic; fruitiness comes through first. Banana, date, cherries, etc. Incredible malt too, along with lots of earthy and floral notes. The taste matches the richness and complexity of the smell and then some. Once again, fruit-like hints are definitely present at first, and then give way to dark complexity. Hints of spice. Hoppiness at the end. Quite sweet, overall. The mouthfeel is another great factor. This is what beer should feel like--a thickness to it that coats the mouth, though it's not syrupy. Good stuff. 816 charactersphilipquarles, Jul 06, 2008
4.64/5  rDev +3.6%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thankfully recieved a couple of "8"'s and a couple of "12"'s thanks to a family friend that just visited Amsterdam. I had asked her to pick me up some from the De Bierkoning Beershop, thanks to azorie's beer mail for guidance.
Appearance - Poured from bottle (cellared, date marked on cap 10.07.99) into a St. Bernardus chalice, deep cherry brown with 1 to 1.5 finger of eggshell white colored head, good lacing. Some flakes of yeast floating. 
Smell - Some fruit, chocolate and plum smells with an addition of a strong smell of alcohol (probably due to it's age, hence the lower mark for smell). To be honest the smell wasn't overly attractive to me, actually somewhat turned me off at first which led me to believe that this was going to be overhyped (much to my surprise).
Taste - Taste is fabulous, semi-sweet and smooth with tastes of chocolate candy, fruit, bread and a slight spiceness. Warming alcohol effect, which isn't exactly what I need on a 95+ degree day but good none the less. Incredibly smooth!
Mouthfull - Medium, creamy mouthfull with a slight dryness upon swallowing.
Drinkability - As much as I could see myself believing that this beer is overhyped, I surely tell you it is not. I could definitley see myself drinking a few of these but it probably wouldn't be practical nor very cost effective. A beer to savor and enjoy while relaxing and being able to enjoy the complexity. If you can get your hands on one, which isn't exactlly easy or cheap, I would highly recommend trying this, obviously! 1,523 characterstdt560, Jun 26, 2008

Both fantastic in their own right. I'm very impressed with how the 20 year bottle held up. Some oxidation, but it added to the flavor profile. Whomever I got if from took care of it...thank you. 
Dark reddish brown ale, with a head on the newer one. Nose brought out a lot of fruits and nuttiness. Feels fantastic in your mouth, nice thick coating feel. 
Great beers! 448 charactersDubbercody, Jun 22, 2008
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to deepsouth for the chance to savor this awesome brew...
I poured this into a Duvel tulip and it is quite dark and murky in appearance. Almost a walnut color... It quickly forms a 2-3 inch tan foamy head that slowly fades into an 1/8 or so...
The first aroma I got from this was raspberry and sweet malts... The raspberry started out faint but got more prevalent as it warmed up...I can also smell plums or some other sweet dark fruit present... Maybe a little chocolate...a touch of booze..gets way deeper and more complex the longer I let it sit...
The first sip is a doozy... Its boozy and much drier than I thought it would be, but absolutely delicious. Its quite crisp and floral and fruity with the raspberries coming in as well as some earthy leather, some funky Belgian yeast, and the merest hint of chocolate...its got one of the creamiest mouthfeels in a Belgian that I've ever experienced.. Its creamy at first then snaps off abrubtly into a dry booziness...
I'm sad to see my only bottle go but I'm thrilled to have had the opportunity to try this. I wasn't disappointed at all and to make it even more ezciting, I still have a 12 to drink. 1,169 charactersTilley4, Jun 19, 2008
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Carries the flavor of the famous Westvleteren 12, but without so much of the depth or complexity. Still an amazing beer, more drinkable in the sense that if you have 3 your head doesn't start swimming, but you cant shake the feeling that the 12 is that much better and what you really want. Similar to Dogfish 90/120 in that sense, the 90 is good in its own right but still just pales in comparison to its big brother.
Anyhow, the beer itself looks and smells excellent, extremely dark with a tan head. Definite mix of darker fruits and malts, goes down extremely easy especially for a beer with 8% alcohol. Nicely carbonated, and like its big brother best enjoyed at the cafe opposite the monastery for the full experience. 725 characterspunkindrublic50, Jun 18, 2008
4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4My sister brought this back from Belgium for me.
A: Pours very dark purplish with some ruby highlights poking through. Large 3 finger billowy head forms and lasts throughout drinking.
S: Fruity, maybe grapes or figs, subtle malt, hint of roast at the end
T: Starts off sweet. Faintly fruity. Biscuity middle. Dry, slightly bitter finish. Very complex, but not overly powerful flavors.
M: Smooth, fills the mouth with flavor. Perfect carbonation.
D: Good. Went down very easy for 8%. The finish kind of got me though.
Overall a very nice beer. I don't know if I would say it is in the top 10 beers I have ever had. Wish I had a couple more though.

4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5So I finally get to try some Westvleteren 8, and I'm pleasantly surprised. After all the hype I was sure I would be fairrly let down, even though I had a good experience with the 12. I figured that this beer would be somewhat ridding on the coattails of that beer. I was wrong. The first impression upon tasting this was Wow!, this is so fruity and lively. It was much brighter tasting than I expected, extremely floral and with some nice hop bite in the finish. The predominant flavor seeemed to be honeysuckle. Light and effervescent in the mouth, this was unbelievably drinkable and pleasant. The pour was a dark amber with little head, but the aromas immediately lure you in with fresh fruity and floral notes with a bit of metal underneath. Really a classy beer, and if it were more available one that I would probably drink more often than the 12- as much as I love that beer. 882 charactersGeorgiabeer, Jun 01, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to a fellow BA for trading this. Cap date reads 25.08.08, enjoyed 18.05.08.
Appearance - After a careful pour into a chalice, this beer produced about 1/2 finger's worth of head atop a deep mohogany body. The head is made up of millions of very tiny bubbles. plenty of lacing
Smell - the initial pop of the cap produced a hiss that expelled some gas that smelled like granny smith apples. It's more faint after being poured, but that characteristic does remain. Belgian candy sugar abounds, along with a gentle caramel aroma and a soft herbal aroma. More discrete notes include chocolate, a near oatmeal-like quality, molasses/brown sugar, mild phenols, and moderately faint alcohol esters.
Taste & Mouthfeel - Finally for the tasting part... The taste is like a volume knob starting up high, then being turned down low in the middle, then slightly up again at the finish. Somewhere mid-sip the beer almost seems to cleanse itself off your palate, but then the flavors come back strong in the aftertaste. So clean just like the other westvleteren beers. Other dubbels try to overdo the sweetness, but this one seems to be about perfect. Slightly drying/bitter at the finish after a few sips, but certainly not too dry for me. Lightly carbonated which seems just the right amount to me.
Drinkability/last word- highly drinkable, although not as much as the 6 though. Still, for the style, I've never had a beer that was more drinkable than this one. For me this is certainly the new benchmark when it comes to dubbels. As with the 12 and the 6, the hype behind this beer is well merited. 1,597 characterslpayette, May 18, 2008

Thanks a lot Vance, this could be the only chance I have for awhile to get my hands on this Gem. I'm eager to see if it lives up to the hype.
Dark mahongoney color with three fingers of light brown head. Decent retention, but not a ton of lacing.
Smells like bread mixed with some raspberry in there. A hint of chocolate too.
A little bit of fruity sweetness up front, followed by the malty choclate/toffee. Next is the bready yeasty flavor. Slight alcohol on the finish. Every flavor remains on the palate, layered and tasty. This brew is very complex yet smooth and balanced at the same time. Mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated. Definitely the best Dubbels I have ever had, hands down. One of the best beers period actually.
Great drinkability, I'm already sad this is my only bottle! 877 charactersHojaminbag, May 13, 2008

Poured into a chalice a dark deep burgundy, almost black. Carbonation is heavy.
Smells of dark raspberry, malt and hints of chocolate, toffee. 
Tastes of dark fruit, slight citrus, almost like a sparkling grape juice, although not nearly as sweet. 
Carbonation continues throught the life of the beer. Starts of robust, partially bitter, with a real sharp bite at the end. Crisp and refreshing, this beer is definetely lighter than its appearance.
I almost feel like I drank this too fast. It was so complex, yet kept in balance. This could be a session beer, just for the simple fact that it leaves you wanting more.
Def. worthy of the hype, one of the best beers I have ever had. Everything you expect a belgian to be, and then some. Amazing. 857 charactersJToad, May 10, 2008

A: pours a darkish gold settling into a dark semi-opaque ruby brown, two finger tan head with a creamy composition
S: gentle spices, tart apples, raspberry mixed with phenol, sweetness in the back
T: first impression very smooth, intricate layers of flavor underneath, chocolate and toffee mixed with dark fruit (black cherry or date?), subtle spiciness emerges from the middle, some sugary sweetness (like carmelized brown sugar) and bready yeast as it tapers, slight hoppy tang right at the end as it warms, I could probably go on forever

Aroma is simple, but nice. Sweet ripe fruits, plums and raisins. A gentle maltiness is also available.
Taste is nice. A big bready malt taste dominates. Some sweet ripe fruits, noteably plums. There is also a slight alcohol tinge, but I think the beer could stand to be a few degrees cooler.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a nice carbonation.
Drinkability is moderate. Great flavors make for easy consumption, but moderately high alcohol limit consumption. A great beer. 597 charactersGoliath, Apr 27, 2008

A - A dark crimson brown color. Very clean and clear. Two finger off-white creamy head reduces in size but never goes away. Lacing is also very good. I can not think how the presentation could be improved.
S - Molasses, brown sugar, some yeast and plum. Alcohol is noticeable in the nose but not in a bad way. Every time I raise the glass to my nose I get something new: now there is some hints of caramel and cocoa. 
T - Initial impression was a little too sweet at the start and a little too yeasty at the finish but after about 10 minutes it has really come together. I'm actually tasting a little oak here which is odd. Incredibly well balanced. Just sweet enough with a caramel finish. Alcohol is not at all forward. Slight tartness that stay with me in the sides of the mouth.
M - Initially had a bit too much fizz, but again after a few minutes settled down to "just right". Enough carbonation to be exciting but not so much as to distract. Tiny bubbles. Surprisingly full-body.
D - The only thing that stops me from having another is the expense and lack of availability.
I was a little skeptical going into this, and the first few tastes had me wondering what the big deal was. Now I get it. 1,254 charactersMed, Apr 21, 2008
4.1/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Many thanks to Jeff at TJ'sEveryday for sharing this beauty with me. This is another one of those beers I just assumed I'd never get to try.
Perhaps unrealistic expectations did this beer in, but I was not as blown away by this beer as I expected to be. This was actually the consensus of everyone trying this beer this evening, so maybe there was something a bit off with either the beer or us. Of course some of us had just come from a IPA/DIPA festival, so that might have been a factor as well. In any event....
The beer pours a dark brown color with very good head retention and fair lacing. The beer smells pretty rich on the nose, with a complex blend of citrus, chocolate malt and Belgium funk. However, the sweet chocolate malt aroma dominated this beer. On the palate, again this beer was pretty malty and sweet, with flavors of chocolate and carob. There is also some brown sugar and flavors reminiscent of German chocolate cake. It was good, but hardly mind blowing. The beer was very smooth and it finished very well. The abv. is very well disguised and it was pretty drinkable.
A very nice beer, but just not quite what I was expecting or hoping. It was good, but I kept on thinking there should be more to it. Oh well... 1,238 charactersJohn_M, Apr 14, 2008

Update: Did a mini vertical of this. A 99 06 and 07. The 99 blew the other away. It was like a really good sherry and made the other seems boozy which they were not. Definately worth holding on to for a year or two. Or 9. 775 charactersaerozeppl, Apr 14, 2008

Huge thanks to drseamus for sharing this on such a beutiful day over tales of skeksies.
A- Pours a dark, silghtly hazy, dun color with a creamy off-white head. Head slowly settles to a thin cap with patchy lacing
S- Rich malts, Belgian candi sugar and grapes. The nose is incredible. Very rich. 
T- Verty similar to the nose. Rich malt flavors of toffee & caramel of with notes of cherries and dates. Slight bittering hop finish to balance the taste. Warm & dry, brandy-like finish. No flavors dominate the others.
M- So smooth and creamy. Wow. Nice medium body with an ideal amount of carbonation. I could drink this all day.

I drank this right after I drank the 12, and it's not quite as good as the 12 is but it's still a very good beer. My opinion of this is the same as it is with the 12, it's not worth the price to drink it all the time but it's worth the price to get a couple bottles to try because it is very good (and because of the availability).

4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4At last!
This bottle, of indeterminate age, had an attractive white label and the distinctive blue Westy 8 cap. I shared this with some fine friends at a cool spring evening's tasting and all proclaimed it excellent. From notes:
Westvleteren 8 is a hazy copper, dark in the center of the glass, and sports a small lingering spotty head of foam. Good retention throughout the duration. Some sediment. Nothing unusual. But then!
The smell is, honestly and easily, the finest I've ever had from a Dubbel. The best beers of a style often make your senses stand up and take notice and say "I'd have not expected this!" Westvleteren 8 is such a Dubbel.
The initial nose is sweet and complex fruity malts. Then you get figs, faint old hops, a slight sour fruit and musty, floral smell and just a hint of alcohol. Spice and fruit, grain and booze - simply sublime! Soothing and reassuring - and tempting.
After a few sips, a classic Dubbel emerges. Musty and fruity, light toffee blended with clove and flowery esters, a hint of perhaps cinnamon and nuts. Complicated yet mild, and finishes with a fantastic sweet-dry caramel finish that leaves a calling card. The mouthfeel is perfect, creamy and smooth and relaxing.
Westvleteren gets a lot of buzz, but there's a reason. They really are THAT good. I'm happy to report that this beer nearly lives up to the hype - and given the amount of hysteria that surrounds the beer, that's astounding. 
Exceptional. Highest recommendation for the Belgian beer lover. 1,506 characterskkipple, Apr 01, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Josh from Vintage Beer and Wine for the generous hookup...I have tried the 12 and 8 due to his efforts. Sorry Josh, temptation was too great, had to open it!
I decided to do a Pepsi challenge by drinking the Westvletaren and Rochefort 8's at the same time, so I will rate the Westy and then share some comparative notes afterwards.
A--Deep brown, just the slightest red tones. Not a ton of head after a careful pour. Sticky lacing to be sure.
S--Sweet and fruity. Really nice aroma.
T--This bottle is pretty new and I can tell that it needed a good bit of time to mature and get more complex. That being said, incredibly complex and tons of things going on. Pears, apples, raisins, cherries, all seem to come out with each sip. Outstanding to be sure.
M--It is beers like this that make me understand this category a little better. So silky smooth on the palate, impressive.
D--A little difficult to give this beer a 5 in this category because of the incredible difficulty finding this beer and its general rarity. Each sip is a little depressing because I realize it gets closer to an empty chalice.
The Rochefort 8 does a pretty good job of holding up. Deeper and certainly has a little more of a punch. You can taste the alcohol more with the Rochefort. A little more head, a little more lacing. If somebody put a gun to my head and said choose, I am not sure which direction. Westy by a nosehair??? 1,419 charactersgarbercury, Mar 30, 2008

S: Belgian yeast, bread, and some dark fruits. Not much, but it's still pretty solid.
T: This is where this brew shines. Taste is full of dark fruit, yeast, bread, and nice hints of chocolate throughout. Alcohol warms a bit, but is quite pleasant. 
M: Smooth, with a nice deal of carbonation.
D: This is an easy-drinking Belgian. Quite tasty, and enjoyable. Were it not so rare, I would quite happily drink it frequently. 554 charactersYonderWanderer, Mar 29, 2008
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Westvleteren chalice. It appears brown with red highlights and an off-white head. 
Smells a bit like chocolate graham cracker and malted milk balls (a possible hint of oxidation maybe as it's not far from cardboard) with a touch of funk. Very biscuity and nutty like a brown ale at times, interesting. Not what I expected, but not out of line for the style. 
The initial flavor is of smooth Belgian chocolate with candied dates. There seems to be a sprtiz of sweet cherry and herbal hops at the end, while the finish is slightly sweet with notes of caramel and toffee.The flavors are subtle like a great English bitter and while the flavor is sweet, it's well balanced and never cloying.
The body is medium and the carbonation is light, but just enough. Overall, it's very drinkable. It just strikes me as a very well made beer. If it weren't so damned rare it'd be easy to sit down and drain a few of these bottles. I think I can settle for Rochefort 8, however. I'd like to taste those head to head.
Hype factor: Doesn't live up to it in my book, but for me, hyped beers rarely do. Maybe one of the most drinkable Belgian's I've had, and easily the best dubbels I've had. I just had the Allagash dubbel a few days ago, and while a very nice beer, I found it a bit lighter and not quite as pleasing. I must say, however, I don't think with is worthy of being considered a top 10 in the world beer. 1,416 characterstempest, Mar 28, 2008
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Now this is a great Belgian. It had miles of creamy tan head that lasted for a couple minutes. It reduces down to a silky foam floating on the top. The beer itself was a dark reddish brown. The taste of sweet, yeast, caramel does a great job of hiding the 8% alcohol that sneaks up on you. The beer is thick enough to cover your tongue with the rich taste of heavenly trappist ale you will definately remember. 410 charactersdalion037, Mar 25, 2008

Bottle poured into my chalice produced a finger worth of off white head that turned to a thin lace. The body was a burgundy color 
Aromas of a red wine in some ways tons of dark fruit 
Wow great flavors dark fruit malts and a citrus bitter
Great mouthfeel nice carbonation on the tongue 
Highly drinkable will seek out again I am enjoying this on and will continue to enjoy it with my Easter dinner as a tribute to the monks 464 charactersjoepais, Mar 23, 2008

Pours a dark auburn color with a creamy tan head that retains until the glass is empty.
Smells like cookie dough with some spice to it. Very pleasant and not overpowering.
Complex flavors that melt together perfectly. The way this beer has so much going on yet remains it's balance amazes me. I taste honey, toast, apples, Belgian yeast and a touch of alcohol in the finish.
Perfect mouthfeel. Big and bold with out being too filling. Silky smooth.
Excellent beer that lives up to the hype and just might be better than the 12 imo. 567 characterswcudwight, Feb 29, 2008

The smell is that of dark fruit and tart. Not much else to say.
The taste is that of the smell. Dark fruit and a slight tartness make up the taste of this distinct beer. 
The mouthfeel is light and creamy. Its very appealing. 
Overall, I like this beer. Its quite a treat and an honor to be my beer that achieves my Initiate status. 417 charactersiconoklaztor, Feb 27, 2008

Pours a very dark black/red. One of the best looking beers I've ever seen.
Taste is a bit tart, with subtle coffee notes. So complex, I can't quite put my finger on it. Very interesting and highly satisfying.
Mouthfeel is quite good and drinkability is amazing for such a big beer.
This is a legend; what else can I say about it. 372 charactersbassmantin, Feb 27, 2008
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a chalice. Slightly murky, deep coppery rust colour with a thin cap of beige bubbles. Decent head retention, some belgian lace. Looks nice. Fruity, bready aroma with notes of plum, raisin, crust, faint alcohol, some caramel, and a hint of spice. Very mild banana appeared as it warmed. Light alcohol up front along with sweet malts. This dissolves into a caramel and raisin sweetness, dried fruit, giving way to malt and spicy alcohol in the finish. Bready malts linger on the palate. Smooth texture, generous carbonation that feels light and airy rather than aggressive. Pretty tasty and easy to drink, though the alcohol does makes itself known. Malt sweetness really started to dominate as it warmed from just below cellar temperature. 750 charactersDrJay, Feb 22, 2008
4.64/5  rDev +3.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This is my first ever Westy. I've had all of the other Trappist products. As you may know, the Westvleteren products are unavailable in the US. Provided by the son, in the Air Force, in Germany, by mail to the US. I have to admit, I've previously been pre-occupied by the tripels and quadrupels. This dubbel is wonderful. Poured from the brown glass 33cl. bottle, into my straight sided glass tumbler. The very dark white head quickly subsides. A fruity, raisiny aroma predominates. The citrusy, malty taste predominates. The complexity of this beer is absolutely amazing. Almost no hop taste or aroma is present. Mouthfeel is appropriate for this style. As one might imagine, I had a lot of trepidation upon opening this wonderful product. Do what you can to obtain a Westvleteren beer. I have been enjoying Belgian beers for over 25 years. Not once in that time have I been disappointed.
Just a thought,

Earthy malts, dark sugars, ripe fruits, spicy yeast and citrus hops. Really grows as it warms.
Very complex and well balanced. Chocolate, caramel, honey, dried fruits and buttery malts. Also a nice presence of peppery Belgian yeasts and earthy hops.
Full and creamy up front with a much drier finish. Perfect carbonation.

A: Pours a very deep brown with very little visibility. 1 1/2 fingers of toffee head forms decently tight and has very good retention, eventually laying down to a thick fluffy skim. Decent lacing throughout.
S: Pleasantly sweet caramel malts. Great caramel smell, very nice. A little bit of cocoa in the very back with some pulpy dark fruits. Only complaint is that it's all on the subtle side.
T/M: Great caramel malts with that tiny wisp of cocoa in the back. More of the pulpy dark fruits and an underlying alcohol warmth that's barely audible. A touch of yeast in end. Body is medium and very creamy and smooth. Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect.
D: Very tasty and the 8% is nicely hidden. Two down, one to go. 803 characterspwoods, Feb 11, 2008
4.38/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle purchased on ebay as a full "souvenir" bottle. No label just the trademark blue cap from the monastery. I was a little skeptical about the purchase until I poped the cap off. Phssshhhhtttt. This brew poured a dark leathery brown with royal reddish tints. Beautiful. The head is a full two inches in the glass almost the same size of the brown liquid. A fluffy tan pile of perfection that laces the glass and thins as you drink but never disappears.
Smell is complex and enticing... world class. It is a sharp smell that has malts, candied sugar and hints of fruits. A typical belgian beer smell but above average. Nice.
Taste is smooth and rich. It has a slight green apple twinge to it with a deep malt flavor. The mouthfeel is amazingly creamy and there is a nice subtle carbonation. The flavor then flows into a superb yeasty honey flavor. There is a nice sweet candied sugar aftertaste that is reminiscent of eating fine chocolates.
This beer is world class and worth the premium paid on ebay. I now have to make a journey to the monastery in order to fully experience this beer. Does it live up to the hype? Yes. I can't wait for the 12 I have in the fridge. 1,187 charactersjbphoto88, Feb 10, 2008

The head started bit and fizzy, then settled to around a quarter inch of khaki foam. My first impression of the nose is cherries. A touch of chocolaty raisins. Some dusty yeast character. Very subtle flavors here. Light cherries, banana chips, roasted nuts, raisins. Hell, lets just call this liquid trail mix. Medium body. High carbonation. Creamy. Well, this is certainly a good beer, but it aint all that. 484 characterstjthresh, Feb 09, 2008

Aroma is subdued buttery caramel malts...very smooth...wonderfully toasted and sweet.
Taste is toasted amber malts with a burnt characteristic that mellows into a slight hop finish. Nice double however...not as impressive as the 12 is for a quad. 382 charactersIntriqKen, Feb 04, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Picked up a bottle at the Cracked Kettle in Amsterdam, along with the 12. They were serving them both across the street at Cafe Golem, but with such a sought after beer, we couldn't have our first taste of the Westvleterens after knocking back a few other belgian treats.
Poured into a snifter glass. It has a dark color and very nice lacing. Noticed a dark yeast sediment as I poured it into the glass.
Definitely could smell the yeast, almost bread like; very gentle spices.
The taste definitely evolves in your mouth. It begins a tad spiced and with the warming effect it changes to slightly peppery. The carbonation was light, but leaves a long impression in your mouth.
This certainly lived up to expectations. I'm trying to wait a bit before enjoying the 12, but we'll see how long I can hold out. 807 charactersjellycabbage, Feb 01, 2008
3.75/5  rDev -16.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Big ol' thanks to pimpp for the twofer of the 8 and 12. Pours a deep reddish brown, thick, billowy head. Smelling apples, raspberries, and mulberry. On first sip, I find the initial carbonation really jarring. Takes a bit of warming and swirling until it gets down to a less distracting level. Getting alot of raspberry on the tongue, plum, cherry, a faint hint of caramel and toffee in the middle of the very mild malt, some spicy yeast/hop notes follow. The water this is made from may have a bit of mineral bittering, but not as strong as a Burton. Nothing is to pronounced and the light mouthfeel lets one explore all the flavors, but I didn't feel it was all that well balanced - perhaps as a result of the aforementioned carbonation.
On the positive side, the finish isn't overly dry, and despite being so sweet this leaves nothing unwanted or too forceful on the tongue as it evaporates. Liking the earthy, barnyardy notes on the very tail end. 
Overall, there's some interesting flavors and its no doubt well crafted, but there's nothing really grabbing me here. I'll give this a re-review if I make my way to Belgium one of these days but don't think I'll go to the trouble of tracking down another bottle state-side. Not my favorite dubbel. 1,252 charactersgrandq, Jan 30, 2008
4.78/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The pleasure to enjoy this magical beer at the Cambrinus Restaurant in Brugge in complement to a fine late lunch is as welcome in my memory bank as profound as any I have had in all my beer drinking days.
As the beer pours into the challice, the carbonation errupts and threatens to overtak the rim. But alas, it settles into a creamy and rocky set of tightly and loosely knit foam with tremendous staying power and intricate lace to boot. The beer underneath is a dark garnet with lavender highlights carrying a modest yeasty haze. The beer just exudes prowessness.
Delicate and succulent aromas provide a candied fruit scent of powdered sugar, ripe grape, light sherry wines, cahsews, honey, mild chocolate and toast. A mild spicy note that seems somewhat of wine, wood, dried orange peel, and peppercorn come to life just as the first sip is taken.
The taste envelops the mouth, coating it with the taste of powdered sugar, dry malt, red wine, candied grapes, nuts, berries, and the background note of dried pitted fruits like dates and figs. Very well balanced with dry malt tannin, spicy peppercorn, and slight citrus- this beer captures wave after wave of flavor combination with exquisit balance and finesse.
Soft and expansive textures seem to explode in the mouth giving an airy robustness that's somewhat firm and whimsical at the same time. But the beer's ultimate dry and powdery warmth causes it to disolve on the tongue just like cotton candy, and when the beer finishes there's nothing there to swallow- only an impression of dry fruit and spice that lingers softly in aftertaste but easy on the palate and stomach. 1,634 charactersBEERchitect, Jan 23, 2008

As you can see, I've given it perfect marks in all catagories. I'm not one to give perfect scores either. In fact, of all the beers I've reviewed so far I can only recall giving a beer a perfect score in any catagory once, and that was to the Westvertleten 12 for mouthfeel. So with that in mind, here we go ...
Poured a dark brown with ruby highlights. Rich creamy two finger head which stayed through the glass and left excellent lacing.
Smelled of plums, raisins, caramel, subtle spices, and no sign of alcohol that I could detect.
Tasted much like it smelled, a perfect balance of the above mentioned fruits, caramel and spices.
Mouthfeel was superb. Smooth and creamy with just enough carbonation. Medium to thick bodied and smooth. Oh, and did I mention it was smooth?
This is as drinkable as it gets. If someone told me that from this day on I could drink only this beer, I'd say bring it on! My favorite beer on the planet, bar none. 1,034 charactersJBogan, Jan 17, 2008

4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a small capped bottle, no label, blue cap, into a goblet.
In the full glass, this is a dark reddish brown beauty with a foamy, well retained tan head. As the amount of fluid goes down, it looks quite clear, tawny-like in color with golden and amber highlights. 
Nose is malty and sweet, fruity, caramelized and actually quite spicy, peppery with some hints of alcohol in the background. 
Nice carbonation adds to the velvety mouthfeel, with a deep flavor but actually quite light for its taste, adding tremendously to its drinkability.
Its caramelized, malty sweetness is well balanced by the same peppery spiciness suggested on the aroma, and layer upon layer of fruit comes into play. Warmingly alcoholic at times, it is still quite well balanced, and incredibly pleasant. 787 charactersbrdc, Jan 07, 2008

Best before 29.09.10
A: Pours a hazy dark brown with an incredible two-finger, light khaki-colored head of a luxurious creamy consistency that leaves lace draping all over the inside of the glass.
S: Big, tangy, dark fruit aromas, right off the bat. Plums, figs, rum-raisin bread pudding. A slight berry quality as well. Vanilla bean, caramel, molassas, and dark chocolate.
T: Sweet (but not cloyingly, so) caramel malt, vanilla, and chocolate dominate at the beginning. These are followed, closely, by brown sugar, raisins, plums, figs, light hoppiness, and black pepper. Incredible!
M: So. Very. Creamy. The creaminess is complimented expertly by a dry, hoppy, astringency that makes this beer absolutely come alive on the tongue.

Smell: Very different aromatics from this one - phenolic scent of caramelized apple, rum-soaked raisins, french toast with vanilla sugar, honey and almonds
Taste: Opens with a rum-soaked raisin and caramel flavor with budding vanilla flavors by mid-palate; Amaretto, as well; after the swallow, the caramel, creme brulee takes over and additional alcohol appears on the finish
Mouthfeel: Medium body with moderate carbonation; very smooth
Drinkability: While very similar to its boozy cousin, this one is less sweet and less alcoholic and, in my opinion, much more drinkable

4.13/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.555F into a Tulip. Poured a bit lighter and with a more aggressive head than the 12. Dissipating head cratered from the middle and left a high lacing that looks like it's going to stick around. More spicy nose than big bro, with the expected candi syrup, yeast, and general dark, earthy goodness. Carbonation danced nicely on the sides of my pallete fanning the heavenly fumes back into my nose. Having reviewed the 12 first, I now understand what it will become after a good bit of cellaring. This beer is very drinkable and has a less cloying mouthfeel than 12, but does not carry the sublime messages to my brain. The fruit, raisiny, slightly phenolic notes are there, and make for an intreesting journey. This is a beer I would serve to my father in law as my best brew. 773 characterskorndog, Dec 18, 2007

Color is dark amber-ish brown, with gleams of carnelian around the edges. Nice look. Inch or so tan head, lasted a good long while. 
Smell is quite "viney", grapes, caramel, and malt/sugar. Taste is surprisingly sweet. This is a heady, carbonated brew. Sweet malt blends predominate, with some definite dark fruits, a bit of citrus, and some spices thrown in.
All in all, an excellent beer, but not truly epic. 455 charactersOverlord, Dec 13, 2007

Poured from a 33cl bottle with 26.08.09 on the cap. It was a dark ruby color with lots of yeast bits. It had a small head that quickly dissipated. The smell was sweet malts and dark fruits. Not very strong. The taste was even weaker - almost watered down. It didn't really have any dominant traits and for a dubbel was surprisingly bland. Really had no bite at all. Maybe something happened to it during shipping but this one is definitely overhyped and not worth the high scores. I got the 12 in the same shipment and it was really good so surprised by how bland this one was. Will try again during my trip to Belgium next year just to be sure but for now won't be ordering any overseas again. (3, NA, Tie, N) 837 charactersTexIndy, Nov 30, 2007

Poured into a Westmalle goblet with a good head and great lacing. I did see a small amount of dark yeast fall into the glass before I could stop the pour. Dark color almost like a light American normal stout, but it let's a purple-like color come through all over, not just the sides. Sweet malty and candy sugar tones waft into my nose. Still smell a bitter flavor inside of the sweetness. Mouthfeel gives a well carbonated, but smooth feel. Like drinking a highly carbonated pop/soda/coke without the bite. The taste is malty, slightly sweet, with spices and a lightly sweet cane sugar background. Very drinkable beer. Very enjoyable. Overall, if I lived in Belgium I would drink this more often it's so good. 744 charactersErdinger2003, Nov 29, 2007

Pours a deep tawny-ruby color that lightens when held up to the light. Creamy off-white head that settles to a thin sheet and leaves behind patchy lace.
Rich malt aroma of Belgian candy sugar, caramel and toffee, yeast, light spice, and granny-smith (sour) apple. Incredibly appealing. 
Lush malt flavors of caramel, toffee, honey and fruit with notes of chocolate covered cherries. Hops add a nice bitterness to balance the malt, as well as a tea-like quality. Gets very juicy in the middle before the alcohol steps in to add a brandy flavor to the mix. Finishes dry with lingering spice.
Ridiculously smooth and creamy. Medium-full in body but not heavy. Maintains a crispness and has the perfect amount of carbonation. 
If not for the rareness, I would have this beer on hand at all times. So easy to drink. Complex and so flavorful, but not overpowering or aggressive. 
This is my second time having this beer. I bought 2 bottles around 3 years ago. I didn't review the first bottle, but I would say this one was much more memorable. Truly a world class beer. 1,091 charactersLupe, Nov 26, 2007

Best before date of August 2008, but could have probably gone for much longer if I left it in the cellar
Poured into my Trappist Westvleteren chalice with a deep brown color that had a dark red tint when held up to the light, the head was white and lumpy, and over an inch which was impressive, left chunky lacing, expected this one to be darker and have a fuller body
Smell was fig, roasted malt, some roasted nut and barley, apple, and , definitely seemed oxidized, so maybe I did not have a good bottle of this stuff, pretty weak aroma overall and just seemed generic of a dubbel
Taste was decent but nothing to get all excited about, definitely got better as it warmed, wish I would have drank this at room temperature originally, got much easier to drink as it got warmer as more sweetness came out, surprisingly hoppy and left a dry and bitter aftertaste at the beginning, some nice apple and dark fruit at the end of the glass, reminded me of a nut brown ale when its temperature was cool, could taste small amounts of licorice and sweet cherries, this one could have used some more sweet malt unfortunately, wish it had more complexity which I expected, pretty good taste when it is all said and done but certainly not the best trappist or dubbel out on the market
Not much carbonation and the body was nothing to brag about, average mouthfeel with a taste that did not linger around too long
At eight percent, it is pretty drinkable, but it does get heavy at times and the taste gets old after a while, not bad for a beer of this style though, could drink two or three bottles of this with no problems
This was the first beer I have drank and said to myself that it was way overhyped, I understand the beer's rarity, but there is harder to find beers out there, this is actually quite easy to get now in online auctions, I much rather drink a Rochefort or St. Bernardus, especially for the amount of money you have to fork out to get one of these, it is a good beer but does not deserve to be in the top five in my honest opinion, will try this again in the future to see if I just had a bad batch, and will update my review if anything changes, other than that I recommend it if you are extremely curious like I was, but you will most likely leave disappointed 2,476 charactersFloydster, Nov 25, 2007
3.05/5  rDev -31.9%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Overhyped and overrated.
A dark brown beer with a big, frothy and creamy head and lots of yeast flakes floeating around in the beer.
Smell is not very inviting, a slight oxidized smell with strong alcoholic solvent whiffs. The expected caramel is pushed back by the alcohol and is just barely tasted.
Taste is strong spiritus alcohol combined with oxidation. The yeast still leaves it's mark and gives some spicy notes, but the higher alcohols are very aromatic. The beer is leaning towards a sherry. The alcohol and slight caramellic, candisugar and woody taste give a liquor taste like sherry or whiskey. Body is sweet and sticky. 
After my 3(!) disappointing tastings of this beer (fresh and from different lots) I really have to say that this beer is not one of the best in the world. OK, 1 or 2 bad beer can happen, but this taste and oxidation is just in the beer and I don't like it. 894 charactersAbsumaster, Nov 23, 2007

Into a Orval chalice, pours a dark brown color with a nicely proportioned, slightly tan head, fades to a nice swirling film, the swirl leaving wall of lace, which in turn leave spots and streaks down the glass. Just lovely.
The aroma and taste continues the fun, lots of stuff going on, all mysterious in it cohesion. Its one of those beers that are so perfectly balance, so well integrated are all the parts, thats its a mystery there isn't actually something magical about it. Given time, one could pick out dark fruits of raisin, plum, fig, the malts sweet with brown sugar, molasses, a doughy bready, some lovely spices. The mouth is over medium, a very fine carbonation and alcohol warming. It bitters a bit and dries toward the finish, leaving the end drawn out, lingering. Its all very much beautiful.
In sum, an excellent beer, a classic deserving of its status in the halls of beerdom. Then next question being, what will several years do to it?
Thanks to tpd975 for supplying me with this beaut. 1,031 charactersobjectivemonkey, Nov 21, 2007
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Dark, murky brown - the typical dubbel color, but with exceptionally good head retention. 
Smell: Dry and spicy; plum, fig, black licorice and herbal hops.
Taste: Bold, dry and slightly tart. The flavor notes at fig, licorice, apple and toasted nuts. Well-hopped in the finish, it ends bitter and dry. A subtle sweetness comes out as the beer warms.
Mouthfeel: Extremely smooth on the tongue. Medium-bodied with gentle carbonation.
Drinkability: The dryness really adds to the drinkability - if not for the rarity I could see myself drinking this often.
Notes: Different but nearly as good as Westvleteren 12. This is probably the best dubbel I've had, with St. Bernardus coming fairly close. 709 characterslargadeer, Nov 21, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I was fortunate to have a friend in Belgium pick this up for me as it demystified one the most storied beers I had read about in recent years. I shared it with a good friend as it poured majestically into a Trappist glass to a medium dark brown visage. The muscular aroma of apples, champagne, coffee came through in the first taste that was memorable. It reminded me of a darker version of Orval with the yeasty elements of Westmalle and the medium body of a Bier dgarde. The dry chocolaty aftertaste lingered for a long time as the 8 just capped a wonderful evening. 570 charactersbonbright7, Nov 20, 2007
4.4/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4deep dark brown beer with a light tan head that starts off pretty thick, but settles to a thick sticky film.
the aroma is very delicate it takes some work, but, i detect toffee, molasses, dark fruits like plum, black cherry, raisin. i'm also getting some rum-y booze mingled with caramel, and substantially doughy bread. peach too occasionally, beleive it or not.
the taste contains a quite peppery tinged toffee/molasses/candy sugar flavor. dark fruits dominated (maybe 60/40) by an appealing slightly tart cherry flavor show up to accompany the warming alcohol. the alcohol isn't covered up well, but doesn't take away, it adds some nice complexity. vaguely nutty, with anise, cinnamon, and some other more undefinable (at least with my lexicon) spices. cinnamon raisin bready come to mind... this doesn't seem to stop getting tastier and more complex as it's approaching room temp, though it has to have a ceiling (right?!). bitterness from most likely aged hops balances and dries out the back. with significant warmth wood notes start to develop.
medium bodied with effervescent carbonation. fine and foamy in the mouth.
good drinability due to it's unique, but awesome taste. the peppery flavors, at times sharp carbonation, and alcohol take it down a couple notches, but not enough be any source for compaint or even critique. 1,333 characterskmo1030, Nov 16, 2007
3.81/5  rDev -15%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Enjoying this for my 25th birthday. Yesterday was too hectic.
A - Cap is dated 01/09/10. Poured into a Westvleteren goblet a very murky, dark brown with ruby red highlights when held up to light. Few centimetres of beige head that hangs for a fair while. Big patchy lacing is left.
S - Raisin & prune dark fruit aromas, spicy phenols. Some savoury aroma that is hard to place. Never had it in a dubbel before. It's a bit off putting.
T - Along the same lines as the taste but without the savory smell.
M - Quite a smooth mouthfeel, medium bodied, low carbonation.
D - Would I drink it again? Yes. Would I pay the same amount to drink it again? No way. 652 charactersbrendan13, Nov 14, 2007

Poured a very dark murky, ruby, brown with a thick fluffy off white head that wont go away. Smells of grape, apple, dark fruits, and some rum. Taste of sweet dark fruits, some tart red wine, mildly light brown sugar and bitter chocolate. Flavors are mended together. There is an alcohol warming in my chest as each sip goes down. Mouth feel is creamy, full, and tons of carbonation. Drinkability is very easy for me. I restrain myself from drinking this one too quick. I will probably never have an opportunity to enjoy this fine outstanding trappist dubbel again. 
Highly recommended if you can obtain one. CHEERS! 680 charactersDavidEddie, Nov 11, 2007

Another present to drink on my b-day, the second Westvleteren of the day. This one courtesy of the very generous metallitone1, thanks for hooking me up!
Date on the cap is 20.12.08 (or 09)
Pours a beautiful mahogany color with lots of bubbles. Active carbonation in the center of the glass with a thin ring around.
The aroma is quite fruity, dark fruits mostly. I can smell some figs, dates, ripe prunes, dark candy sugar (not a fruit, I know), cherries, and a bit of alcohol. A bit of cinnamon is picked up once the beer begins to warm up and breathe. Also there are some grapes in the mix. 
The taste is in line with the aroma. Lots of dark fruits and a faint dose of alcohol, but tasty alcohol not fusel or overpowering. Its really well crafted, I dont see any one flavor overpowering in this beer. Hmm, some caramel flavors start to show up as Im finishing my beer.
The mouthfeel is fantastic; the carbonation makes it feel almost creamy and velvety. The finish is very clean and doesnt leave a trace of off flavors, just a little sweetness which is quite tasty. Great beer to just let it sit on your tongue and feel the carbonation and a foaming sensationI dig it!

Smells of caramel, dark fruits, dried fig, some spice, and pear. Taste is delicious with spice and caramel up front but brown sugar, pear, fruits and a doughy quality. So smooth with a nice tickle of carbonation on the toungue. Unbelievably drinkable and a delicious brew. 372 charactersfranksnbeans, Nov 07, 2007
4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours hazy brown with a thin tan head.
The smell is powerful - I could smell it at some distance away. Fruity (peaches?) and brandy-like. Caramel/toffee comes through strongly.
The taste is complex - mix of fruits - from peaches to dark fruits. Caramel/toffee, leaning towards chocolatey maltiness. Some spicy/woody/nutty notes blend in well. Brandy-ish. Finishes with a spicy, woody dryness. Nicely textured.
Easy to drink, esp. for abv level. Quite a bit to savor and contemplate with each sip. A great brew (though I'm not sure that it hits third highest, IMO).
Thanks to nacir69 for ascertaining this classic, hard-to-find brew for me! 643 charactersjwc215, Nov 04, 2007
4.25/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a dark ruby with a huge frothy off white head.
Smells like dark fruit (raisins come to mind) and sweet caramel/toffee malt.
Tastes like it smells. Sweet toffee malt and dark fruit. Alcohol is present on the aftertaste. Some Belgian funk.
Medium bodied and quite carbonated, almost champagne like.
Pretty drinkable for the amount of alcohol. 
Overall, I was kind of disapointed in this. Is there hype behind this beer? Hell Yes! I have had better dubbels, St. Bernys comes to mind. That said it is very true to the style and a very good beer and well worth a try if you can get your hands on one. 606 charactersMonsone, Oct 30, 2007

I have to give a great big shout out to Regine' my boy in Belgium who continues to send these babies across the pond for me to enjoy, and more importantly to share with my BA buds. On to the review!
A: It pours a rich deep dark brown color with tons of carbonation. A head builds and recedes. There is no lacing, but some yummy sediment in the bottom of my Westvleteren Chalice. (Compliments of Regine)
S: Wonderful aromas waft from the glass. Tons of deep dark fruits. Plum, raison and figs stand out front. They are matched with a wonderful sweetness. I detect brown sugar, caramel, and buttered toffee. The last time I smelled such wonderful aromas was a child at the county fair.
T: It's Westvleteren, and despite the detractors, this one is heavenly. This beer is so rich and creamy. The flavors are bold yet married wonderfully. The dark fruits are noted in the taste as is the buttered toffee. I also pick up hints of vanilla and a touch of dark cocoa. This beer is as good as advertised and worth every dollar I spend on it.
M: Bold, Rich, and Creamy. A true Masterpiece.
D: So drinkable. The cost prohibits drinking too many of these at a time, but I have been known to drink two in a sitting.
Overall: What can I say, this beer truly is a work of god. The Monks of Westvleteren make wonderful hand crafted old world beers. I am honored each and every time I drink one.
This beer is fitting of the honor of #150. Can't wait for #200 when I will review the ABYSS!!!! 1,584 characterstpd975, Oct 10, 2007
4.01/5  rDev -10.5%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I'm reviewing the beer as it warms.
Nice color: Brown and cloudy. Nice head and retention
Smell is of caramel malt, apple phenol, I smell raisin and some dark fruit undertones.
Taste: delicate and balanced. Caramel malts going on up front. Raisiny flavor comes out as well. Nice hop bitterness to follow. Some dry tannins, but not at all out of whack. This is a step up from the blonde. Still, not the best dubbel I've had. Very good though. Could use more smoothness and balance between the sweet upfront and hop bitterness finish. I'm a little disappointed by this brew. Doesn't live up to its name. Becomes smoother as it warms, but it's just not a truly all time great double. There is a lot going on in this beer, but it just doesn't come together the way I want it to. Really starts to meld as the beer warms. Wow. let this beer warm before judging it. It gets better and better and better as it warms. Becomes balanced between the sweetness and hop bitterness. Very nice. I like the brew, but not the BEST EVER FUCKING DUBBEL EVER. But i like it.
Decent mouthfeel.
Decent drinkable beer, but I'm disappointed. I thought I was going to be blown away. Not the case. 1,175 charactersjasonjlewis, Oct 09, 2007
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I have gotten a second batch of the Westvleteren 8 and the one I am having tonight seem to differ slightly from my first Westy 8; this time round, the 8 pours out with a huge tan white head which
refuses to settle; color was dark blackish brown. Smell was brown sugars, yeast, dark fruits and some syruppy nuttiness which I can't really describe. The taste was just as great as when I first had it strong dark fruitiness, caramel, malts and dark maple sweetness hit me at once. Nearing the finish I could pick up plums, berries, apples and raisins in the taste and the finish came a little bitter (this was slightly more bitter than my previous experience with the Westy 8) and with a nutty dryness with a slight sourness (the sourness was not experienced previously). The finish came leaving lot's of sweet dark fruit aromas on the nose. The after taste that kicked in had tastes of pears, apples, raisins, grapes; it was like an explosion of fruits which keeps leaving strong and pleasant fruity aromas on the nose. The finale in the after taste was somewhat grapes, raisins and brown sugar sweetness which lingered on. The mouth feel was close to full body and carbonation was at a great level; this dubbel was slightly creamy and very smooth to drink with a very slight alcohol warming. The bitterness was more pronounced this time round; not sure if it had anything to do with the huge head of yeast that developed in this pour as compared to the last
time when I hardly got a head on the pour. I did not enjoy it as much as the last time though it was just as great except for the more pronounced bitterness. 1,614 charactersbasica, Sep 26, 2007
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I poured a 330 ml bottle into a cooled challis. I sampled a Westy 8 earlier this year then set two aside for later and use in composing this review. Now the time is ripe to taste the second of three bottles. The last will remain in my stash for a follow on review sometime down the road.
A: It poured a rich deep dark brown with a hint of bright amber at the edges of the glass with backlighting. It had a moderate (about one finger) caramel colored head. The head receded quickly leaving a light covering over the beer and a lace ring that left a pretty laced down the side of the glass as I rained the challis. 
S: Nice aroma of brown sugar and molasses was detected first followed by dark fruits (ripe plums and figs). As I worked my way thought the experienced I picked up toffee and a rich dark chocolate aroma that was very pleasing to my nose. 
T: Yummyon my tongue and in my tummy. It was a rich creamy brew with a wonderful balance of coco, caramel, and an underlying spice (a hint of black pepper) that give this beer a nice refreshing bite. The balance of this beer is as amazing as its big brother. There is a subtle warm afterglow on my tongue influenced by the alcohol but my tongue feels like it has just been coated with a fondue dipped plum. 
M: It was full bodied, creamy, and rich. It smoothsilkywell balanced. It leaves a joyous aftertaste that only invites me to drink more. 
D: This is a wonderful beer with great balance, flavor, mouthfill and complexity. Beer drinkers need to say a special prayer for the fine monks of Saint Sixtus. 
Comment: I continue to be amazed at the skills tucked away in far away Belgium. I only wish I had discovered this rare corner of the world thirty years ago. I only hope my wallet can continue to afford me the pleasure of one of the worlds great beers. 1,824 charactersdnichols, Sep 20, 2007
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to my boy Greg (tpd975) for this beauty.
11.2 oz. bottle poured into my Chimay goblet with 09.08.10 stamped on the cap.
Pours a super dark, rich, amber hue with a big fluffy two finger khaki colored head that slowly dies down. There are some spots in the head that are darker than others, perhaps some sediment I should have let in the bottle. Stickiness is amazing. Holds on to all sides of the glass and doesn't plan on letting go. Smell is a huge dark fruit aroma of mainly dates, plums, and raisins. There's also a sweet molasses scent mixed with brown sugar and a hint of pears. Finally, some fresh honey mixed with a yeasty scent and some caramel malt. Wow, just like its brother Westy 12, complex on the nose. Taste starts off with a spicey sweetness which is followed by the big caramel malt flavor. All of those dark fruits as mentioned before come into play again on the tongue. That's what I like, a beer that lives up to how it smells. I also sense some floral flavors on the tongue as well. Mouthfeel is beyond perfect, if that's possible. So soft, so balanced, so fluffy, so pure. The head lightly flows over the tongue so smoothly, I think I just had a beergasm. I detect no alcohol anywhere with this brew. If God pissed, this would come out. As much as I loved the Westy 12, this easily beats it in my opinion. Perfect 5, you better believe it bitches. I need more of this stuff, NOW!! Greg, hook a brother up!! 1,437 charactersBeerTruth, Sep 12, 2007

Dark brown/orange, slightly hazy. Medium sized, light tan head. Some lacing and legs.
Citrus initially, which faded as the temperature increased, moved more towards a herbal type of flavor. Belgian funk. Honey. Raisins.
Sweet more than bitter, which increases as I drink. Alcohol. Licorice. Dark fruits and some tea flavors. Strong herbal finish.
Medium + body. Medium + carbonation -- could tone down a bit. Surprisingly dry. Slightly husky/grainy texture.
Very complex and nicely balanced. Hell of a beer. Improves a lot as it warms. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but this wasn't as good as I was expecting. 637 characters, Sep 07, 2007

Pours a dark cocoa color with a creamy head. The smell is a raisin, creamy malt, sweet sugars, fruity, molasses, its all in there. Taste is dark chocolate, rich malt, cake type flavors (like the 12), with a stronger warming alcohol presence. Slightly less carbonation than the 12. One of my fellow BA buddies said after his second sip... "Woah, I could drink this all day". 424 charactersgenog, Aug 12, 2007

Smells of raisins, spices, fruits and chewing tobacco (sound weird but I used to chew and it reminds me of a fresh tin but not nearly as strong). Very complex the alcohol just sneaks in to say hello.
The mouth is packed with flavors, some fruits, malt, spice, caramel, the alcohol sneaks in as it warms up more, and has more flavours on the finish, pepper, and the fruits come back to mind. I wish I could drink this everyday but I am glad to have two more in my cellar. They will certainly be enjoyed! A gift from the beer gods. 700 charactersirishkyle21, Aug 08, 2007
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My 301st review; and what a beer to review for #301, thanks to a fellow northern Colorado B-A who shared this with me in a side-by-side with a Westvleteren 12. What an hour! Amazing! Well, on to the review . . .
Served at about 55 degrees. 
Slow pour into a tulip glass yields a tight, thick and completely permanent half-inch tan-yellowish head over a gorgeous hazy mahogany body. Head is really pretty. 
Smell is spiced figs, pepper, walnuts, raisins, yeasty bread dough, and clover. Complex smell, and it gets better the warmer the brew. I just kept sniffing and sniffing this beer. Mmmm
Taste is yeasty-spicey, toasted raisin-bread, and then that walnut flavor is there. Dates and figs, and then a long dry peppery-spicey finish. Not a complex as its big brother, but for a Dubbel, what a set of flavors!
Mouthfeel is nice and round, full and well-spread by the long-lasting, fine carbonation.
Drinkability is superb. This is so complex, and the alcohol so completely hidden, I could drink these at length.
Once again, this beer measures up to its hyped up reputation. Certainly the world's best Dubbel.
Thanks again to my fellow (anonymous) B-A for sharing this fantastic beer. Man, you are excellent! 1,230 charactersColoradoBobs, Aug 05, 2007

Aroma: Rich molasses, spices, dark fruits, and sweet alcohol.
Taste: Opens with a mildly spicy note, followed by strong earth notes, and roasted malt, and a complex array of lesser flavors, wood, licorice, bitter cocoa, and grape skin. Finishes strongly malty, with the complex palette of flavors carry on to the end of the taste, and beyond, and with a lingering herbal hop flavor.
Mouth feel: Smooth, soft, quite full, with a small burst of carbonation.
Drinkability/notes: A wonderfully well-crafted example, well worth the high price its typically commands outside of Belgium.

Very nice looking ale here. Dark mahagony musty brown with some floaties and completely opaque. A wonderful tannish head is full and fluffy and has great retention and leaves some thin sticky lacing behind. Reminiscent of what you would think a monk would brew.
Damn fine nose that's damn hard to quit sniffing. Spicey apple tart, with sour bing cherries, candied sugar, stove top cooking caramel oozes olfactor gestures, belgian yeasts and other belgian spice, maple and brown sugar. Fig, white raisin, and dates as well. One fine fine nose on this beer. 
Very nice beer but not as nice as the nose. A little burn in the chest as well even at 8%. Not as complex as the nose but big and meaty nonetheless. Very dry finish with a dried mixed berry end. Again fig and white raisin with hints of mollasses and maple. Nice malty mid palate with dominating toffee and caramel. Dates and prune fill things out and then some more ripe flavors of cherry and red baked apple. Mouth is creamy with moderate carbonation. Very good beer but not as complex in flavor as I anticipated. 1,225 charactersmcallister, Jul 08, 2007
4.12/5  rDev -8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Special shout out to tpd975 for providing a chance to taste this special brew.
The smell was dominated by cherries and caramel. I am very impressed!
The appearance was and opaque dark amber, with about 1/4 inch of beige head.
In the taste I found caramel, butterscotch, toffee, a little bit of alcohol, and a slight bitterness at the end of the swallow. The mouthfeel was medium.
This is a very drinkable and enjoyable beer. I had expected it to be more creamy - but maybe my bottle is pretty fresh and would benefit from more aging. 545 characterswestweasel, Jul 05, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I finally scored a few bottles of this amazing beer. Poured into a goblet, the dark brown liquid was topped by a frothy head that slowly dissipated. The aroma was very complex, with hints of raisins, figs and spices. The flavor of sweet malt and candi sugar, figs, raisins, cinnamon and a slight sour note of cherries was followed by a lingering hop bitterness. Carbonation was spot on, just enough to notice without detracting from the smoothest mouthfeel I've experienced in a beer. This is a very complex tasting beer - every sip brings a new flavor, yet it's all smoothly integrated into a surprisingly drinkable brew.
Quite honestly, it's currently the best beer I've ever tasted. 688 charactersFloridaDrinker, Jun 22, 2007
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Blue cap stamped "26 08 05." Obtained via trade with Peabody, my new favorite person on earth.
Modest pour into my Westvleteren goblet (god it feels good to pour a beer into its specific glass) results in a 1.5 finger vanilla head that peaks a millimeter above the rim of the glass. The beer itself is dark brown and quite murky due to some yeast that snuck into the pour.
I get fig, raisin, sour cherry, chocolate, cocoa, yeast, dough, candi sugar, and probably a lot more on the nose.
Taste is unbelievable. Every flavor flows into the next with ease and seamlessness. A perfect level of doughy malt flavor sets a foundation upon which cocoa, rum, fig, and cinnamon frolic. I don't see how any other beer could possibly have so many flavors blended with such subtlety and balance.
I would give mouthfeel a 5.5 if I could. Smooth as the finest silk. The carbonation is absolutely quintessential, end of story.
I want to drink a barrel of this beer. Overrated? No. 979 charactersillidurit, Jun 07, 2007

12 oz bottle
Brewed 10/06, beatified 06/07
Moderate pour in a chalice and brandy snifter.
Poured a mysterious dark brown with amber red highlights with a moderate somewhat lasting frothy off white head.
Smelt of moderate candi sugar, spices ( cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, anise), dried figs and raisins, doughy yeast.
Flavor was upfront strong sweet candi sugar and sweet dark bread and bitter spices. Very reminiscent of a warm slice of buttered cinnamon raisin bread or hot cross buns. On the follow through a buzzing strong bitter grassy hops presence is felt as well as a multitude of spices, with a moderate yeasty kick and sweet bread and caramel flavors on an average to long finish.
Palate was medium bodied, oily to creamy,softly carbonated, lightly astringent and slightly alcoholic.
Overall, this is like the 12 but with a less pronounced alcoholic aspect. The 8 seemed a bit hoppier too. Great balance again, in depth, strength and length of flavors. Overall, excellent stuff. Thank you monks! 1,041 charactersxav33, Jun 05, 2007

Huge thanks go out to BillyB for hooking me up with a bottle of this rare beer.
Murky brown color..tan foam slowly recedes to leave behind plenty of sticky, tan lacing. Some dark sediment/yeast floating about if you look close.
Aroma of spices, candied malt, banana..etc, etc.. incredible.
Dark fruits are abundant..plums & raisins take center stage. In addition to that, there are more subtle, sweet fruit flavors such as apple & pear. Delicate mouthfeel, very smooth texture...drinkability is as good as it gets.
An absolute privilege to drink..if you can find this beer, take the time necessary to enjoy every last drop. 650 charactershero27, May 31, 2007

Eric, I may just always spell your name with a heart over the letter 'I' from now on...
Blue cap, brewed in 2003 and stamped best before November 12/2006...savoured slightly later on May 26 2007. Happy to report while it may not be at it's 'supposed' "best" it was still amazing! A dark brown colour with big capping head. Aroma of chocolate covered raisins, dark, ripe fruits, plums, grapes, rich desserts (tiramisu?), and all sorts of things to tickle the imagination. The flavour has become (or maybe always was?) so incredibly mellow! Notes of dates and chocolate covered raisins foremost, with no indication of the alcohol and so rich yet mellowed. This is a beer you could sip and enjoy all night. Tremendous offering. Thanks again Viggo! 844 charactersbiegaman, May 31, 2007

Viggo contributed this one, so thanks eric!
330ml bottle, best before 11-12-06.
pours reddish brown with a small dense tan head. the head drops fairly quickly and leaves spotty lace.
aroma is great. lots of dark fruit. hint of alcohol. wheat bread and biscuits. caramel and toffee.
taste is great. lots of dark fruit - date, plum, raisin. toffee and caramel. light alcohol. bready malt.
mouthfeel is great. light well-integrated carbonation. nice big body.
drinkability is excellent. well balanced and very enjoyable. the alcohol is nearly completely hidden. it's obvious that this is a lighter version of the 12, but it's very nice and good in its own way. huge thanks go out to eric for sharing this gem. 899 charactersgrub, May 28, 2007
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Split this one with my wife, & poured to a couple tasting glasses. It had been kept in the refrigerator, but warmed for quite a while before serving - temperature probably 50F. Date on the blue cap is: 10.11.09. Tasted on May 19, 2007 (the night before my 36th birthday), so this has had a little more than 6 months of age...
A: Even with careful pouring, a cloudy chestnut-brown ale roiled in the glass, tiny bits of dark yeast suspended throughout. Head is about 2-fingers high, quite fizzy & light-tan color. It ebbs slowly and leaves terrific-looking gobs of sticky lace.
S: Yeasty/malty and sweet-smelling. Spiciness of herbal black tea, cloves, raisins, candi sugar, ripe fruit (dates, plums, cherries). A more roasted grain smell develops as it sits and warms.
T: Complex flavors of dry cocoa, milk-chocolate covered raisins, nutmeg, cloves, tea and candi sugar. Some sweet toffee and a light smoked wood quality round out the flavors. Exquisitely spiced, surprisingly not as sweet and fruity as the aroma led me to expect.
M: So creamy and smooth, yet zesty with spiciness and loads of carbonation. It's fizzy, but not a heavy soda-like carbonation; a rather light, effervescent spritzy-type of fizz instead. Body is medium-full, a little sticky. Has a lengthy finish, where the dry and slightly bitter cocoa shines. 
D: How does this compare to all the dubbels in the world (or beers, period)? I don't know, but I do know this is delicious and a pleasure to drink. It appeals to all the senses and, frankly, I'm glad this one lived up to the hype. Suffice to say, I look forward to the next occasion to share a bottle. 1,642 charactersmsubulldog25, May 25, 2007
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to upsjeff for this one!
Served at 50 degrees F, in a Corsendonk tulip glass.
Careful decanting yields a mostly clear, dark shoe polish brown body with a pillowy, rocky, slightly yeast-flecked, cream-khaki head. Nose is a complex mix of rich caramel, toasted malt, raisins, figs, tangy grapes (toward being vinous), milk chocolate, and sherry, with a faint metallic twang. 
Malted milk chocolate and caramel notes up front. Slightly rummy fruit notes of raisins and figs develop. Dark candi sugar with a decidedly caramel character swells mid-palate, perfectly so. Slight woody, aged port quality near the finish. Toasty, yeasty, and warming, with lingering caramel and chocolate flavors. An absolutely delicious beer! Full-bodied with rolling, rollicking, bottle-conditioned carbonation that does a great job of lifting the dark sugar sweetness off the palate. Would love to have this readily and easily available. Maybe the best dubbel I have ever had. 970 charactersalexgash, May 18, 2007
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5An excellent beer, and a must try for all advocates. I think this beer may be better than the Westy 12. Malty, slight fruit taste, and quite the big beer for the lower alcohol level. I'm sure this beer could be aged for a few years and still be delicious. Medium sized head with great lacing, this beer pours a ruby red, dark colour. I highly recommend this beer. Chris 369 charactersDelerium, May 12, 2007
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Cap date: 28:10:09. Served in a Westvleteren chalice.
I was waiting until I had at least reached 250 beer karma points before reviewing this one, but I couldn't wait any longer. The memory and my notes were beginning to fade!
Appearance - lacey small head with a thin carbonation. A bit of lacing remaining in the tan head. Hazy dark pour
Smell - This was hard to place. Perhaps a bit of candy or fruity aroma but just slight, not overpowering. A malty aroma as well.
Taste - A wonderfully balanced malty presence with a lovely spice as well. This was hard to review due to the overall ease and balance to all of the flavors. Not one overpowering another.
Mouthfeel - The carbonation remains until the end allowing for a Crisp, clean and palate-cleansing of a finish. This was the highlight of this offering. 
Drinkability - I'm glad I don't live in Belgium. The was by far the most enjoyable experience I've had (until I sampled the Westy 12 right afterwords). If I could get more, I would indeed have more. What a wonderful experience. Yes, there is a bit of "hype" with this beer, but in my opinion, it lives up to it.
Well done. 1,153 charactersNesued, May 06, 2007

a - pours a deep dark brown with a burgundy tint, big tan head with great retention and lacing
s - big malty aroma, lots of dark fruits, prunes, raisin, very sweet smelling, no alcohol
t - big sweetness up front, lots of dark fruit just like the nose, some prune, raisin, body is solid maltiness with hints of aforementioned dark fruits, finish is slightly sweet with a lingering maltiness, no alcohol noticeable
m - medium-bodied, moderate carbonation, quite creamy, slightly dry on the finish, some warming
d - very drinkable, really the only (but major) thing limiting the drinkability is the massive costs associated with getting a bottle here in the US
Definitely an exceptional beer and one of the best Belgians I've tried. Glad I got the chance to try it, but I probably won't be having it again unless in Belgium. 948 charactersWeisGuy, Apr 30, 2007

Candi sugar and clovelike aromas.
Candi and some spice character. Maybe some hop balance in therer. Fruity with some alcohol... nothing like it's bigger brother. Slightly funny twang in the aftertaste.
Medium bodied and highly carbonated with a super dry finish. Warming for sure.
Rather unimpressed with all the hype, but it's still pretty good. The dryness makes it easy to drink despite the alcohol. 500 charactersBeerRun13, Apr 28, 2007
4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I've had this one for a bit and finally decided to crack it open. Bottle cap reads 11.12.06. Pours into my glass a deep chocolate brown with a half inch of light tan fizzy bubbles on top of the brew. I got a little over zealous and ended up with some floaties in the glass. Otherwise it does looks nice...good head retention. Aromas start off with boozy dark fruits, raisins and rich dark malts. Notes of cocoa, molasses and leather all work in. Dark candy sugar comes to mind with a yeasty twang. Really quite nice.
First sip brings a smooth dark, slightly roasty maltiness that carries flavors of raisins and dark fruits with some cherry noticeable. A touch of cocoa works in with some sweetness but it's not overpowering. Some lightly spicy yeast tones follow on the way down along with a hint of a leathery flavor yet again. The brew finishes smooth with a light caramel, fruity finish. Tasty stuff indeed.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and rather smooth with a fast paced somewhat aggressive carbonation. Quite easy to drink and goes down almost too easily. A tasty treat of a brew and I'm glad to have had the opportunity to try it. I still prefer the 12 and I'm not gonna go out of my way to find this again considering the cost and the trouble involved. If I run across it or find myself in Belgium than that will be a different story :-). 1,350 charactersorbitalr0x, Apr 26, 2007
4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Cap printed with the date 09 - 09 - 02. Enjoyed thoroughly on 04/10/07.
The first half of the bottle pours a fairly clear reddish brown. Some floating specks of sediment, but nothing too severe. Tiny bubbles float up regularly. Dense, rocky ivory head. The last bit of the bottle pours like molten chocolate, considerably darkening up the beer, making it entirely opaque. Aroma is rich, with gentle complexity, coming across as honey, almond and apple laying atop a soft, powdered chocolate malt earth. The flavor opens with a surge of carbonation, followed by a dusty, hazelnut-chocolate wash. Muted and glowing brown, like the Belgian artist Rubens' "Old Woman with a Chafing Dish". (http://www.abcgallery.com/R/rubens/rubens11.html) Medium bodied, rather sprightly on the palate. Very rounded in texture, providing a full experience. Nutty overall, the chocolate flavor blending masterfully with the yeasty characteristics. Some aged flavors, mostly dusted, papery honey. Works very well with the nutty hazelnut and almond taste. I think I prefer this to the 12. Excellent. 1,077 charactersUnionMade, Apr 10, 2007
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This bottle was labeled best before 6/8/09 (american style) and we drank it on 3/31/07 to celebrate my girlfriends birthday. I poured it into a Chimay goblet and served it at around 51 degF. It has a thick off white head that sits atop a very dark brown body. It's not black like a stout, but light doesn't get through the sides either. It's kind of weird like that. The aroma is very sweet and malty, but it isn't very strong. The taste is good, but not as good as I had hoped. Granted, my expectations were very high and it still is a good beer. It is very malty and sweet with some dark fruits in there, but there is a slight bite from something in there. The mouthfeel is dead on...perfect full bodied creaminess. The drinkability is also pretty high, although I do prefer the 12 to this. 792 charactersdrseamus, Apr 02, 2007

Solid malty flavor-trace of roasted malt. Again with the dried fruits. Moderate level of candy like sweetness at times. High level of carbonation makes it very bright on the tongue. Quite dry in the finish. Overall a good beer. I think I preferred the 12. Doesnt live up to the hype for me.

4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured out a caramel brown color, murky, with a creamy tan head and some minimal sticky lacing. The nose has some toffee sweetness, strawberry, hickory, mollasses, bbq, caramel, banana, and brown sugar. The taste is bananas, anise, chocolate, caramel, alcohol, and yeast. The mouthfeel had some tight prickly carbonation. There's a bit of cloying to an otherwise spectacular finish. My overall impression is that althought this is an amazing beer, it's riding the cotails of the 12 to its high rating. 501 charactersdherling, Feb 28, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a bottle hand-carried back from the abbey & aged 1 1/2 years. It is a very cloudy orange-tined dark brown with a thin head comprised of microscopic bubbles that create a light tan head & leave beautiful lacing. Smells of oranges, plums, and spices (nutmeg & cloves?). It also has a hint of dark maple syrup lurking in the background. The taste goes through more changes than I can count. Dry cocoa gives way to dark fruits (rum soaked oranges and plums), then a nuttiness that melds into an oak aftertaste, and then a finish like brown sugar. The mouthfeel is chewy and smooth, substantial and lovely. A bit drier at then end than I'd like, if I'm splitting hairs from split hairs. The drinkability is phenomenal, with a warmth that blooms from the alcohol but not a hint of any harshness. In fact, the smooth, melded flavors are the only thing that linger. And they beg to be repeated. Seriously, this one's drinkability is only limited by the lengths to which you have to go to get it. If you can? GET IT! 1,019 charactersroblowther, Feb 26, 2007

This beer has a sweet aroma. I detect some molasses and some caramel. It also smells a bit spicy. Some coriander and orange peal. Maybe just a touch of cloves. It smells of figs also. It has an earthy yeast aroma as well.
This beer tastes great. Every flavor is sublte, and it balances very well. Spices up front. Some fig flavor also. It tastes sweet with some caramel flavors. Plumbs and raisins also make an appearence.
This beer goes down smooth, leaving a slightly spicy aftertaste. It is carbonated perfectly. It is crisp and refreshing.
I think this beer would make a great session beer. It tastes great, and it is only a little high in alcohol.
Overall: Thank you so much HimerMan for this unexpected but definately apreciated beer. It was everything I expected and more. 936 charactersOStrungT, Feb 23, 2007
4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into my Aventinus goblet.
Very nice dark amber brown with, dare I say the biggest head I have ever seen on a beer! Good gawd, half the bottle and this thing was almost out of the goblet! Huge lively carbonation and streams of bubbles ripped through the glass, this looks like it has teeth!
The smell was very spicey at first, tingled the nose. Hints of dark fruit, pears, apples, cinnamon, figs, I could go on. The smel was tremendous and very inviting. A kind of candy sweetness almost to it as well. This is complex, am I ready, I don't know but I have to take a chance...down we gooo....
The taste cannot really be described. Pick your favorite belgian, and its not quite good enough t compare. Rich complex flavors( have I mentioned the word complex?) Spices and fruits are all over the spectrum and I don't even know where to begin. Pears, figs, cinnamon again are al over this. Cherry maybe, definatly apple. Sugars that I have nver tasted before. Yummy as hell. The taste is like nothing I have ever tasted in a beer before. 
The feel on this is extrodinary. So alive, it literally is popping in your mouth as you sip. So smooth and the taste just lingers for what seems like an eternity. Simply wonderful. I am glad I picked this up, just at the least to see if it lived upto the hype, and it does! I cannot begin to imagine what the 12 must be like, the one in my fridge will let me know soon enough! 1,428 charactersmikesgroove, Feb 14, 2007

4.95/5  rDev +10.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5330ml Bottle best by date 8/28/2006 pulled from the back of my cellar. I had six of these that were purchased in late 2004 and this is the last one.
Poured into a Westmalle chalice...deep chestnut with yeasties floating everywhere. Nice tight bubbles crawl up the side and form a nice off white head. The smell is somewhat subdued, but gives off hints of malt, yeast, candi sugar, cherry and slight lemon zest.
This is by far the best dubbel on the market. The taste is very complex with cherries, grain, chocolate and ends with a lemon zest that gives it a most refreshing flavor. All of the hops have faded away at this point, but the beer has held up very well after close to four years. The alcohol comes in at the very end of this beer in a most pleasant way. The mouthfeel is thin to medium and the flavors really coat the entire mouth. 
Drinkability is about as perfect as a beer gets. This without a doubt is one of my favorite beers. Truly world class. I have had the 12 on two occasions and still think I prefer the 8. I will truly miss having this beer on hand. 1,081 charactersddarden, Jan 31, 2007

Smell has some fruity notes and the taste is very rich and complex with somewhat dried fruit flavors of raisin and prune and a touch of carbonation. This is one excellently crafted beer and is highly drinkable but only having one small bottle of this brew is not nearly enough time to explore the complexity of this beer. 471 charactersAlkey, Jan 30, 2007
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: A Brown .331 bottle with no label or anything else on it except the blue number 8 cap. I also served this special one in the Westvleteren calice glass.
Appearance: Poured a deep dark ruby colour with a chunky cream colored head with a patch lace that stayed around for awhile. 
Smell: This brew smelled incredible. A nice blend of sugar, yeast, toffee and spices.
Taste: This is an extremely simple yet complicated brew. An outstanding malt flavor hits the tongue with chocolate, coffee, licorice overtures that whirl your tongue into frenzy. Then the honey and prune overtures kick in which was a splendid surprise to say the least. The yeast had a tea like Zen to it that balanced perfectly with the sweet and malt flavors of the brew.
Mouth-Feel: Perfectly smooth on the palate with a awesome creamy mouth-feel. The carbonation was just right and it finished very dry with a slickness you dont see from many brews.
Drink-Ability: I am going to go as far as to say this is one of the best beers in the world! I am so happy that I came across this gem and I cant wait to get my hands on this again! 1,132 charactersmnesporov, Jan 26, 2007

Best by date of 10/10/06 stamped on bottlecap. I'm not sure how old the bottle is, but judging by the date, it's got a few years on it. 
Poured into my Trappist Rochefort chalace at slight cooler than cellar temp.
Large head of HUGE bubbles, tan, thick. Good retention. Head fades eventually to a nice ring of lace. 
Burnished brown color. Slightly hazy. Almost the exact color of the bottle it was just released from. Thin layer of carbonation bubbles fill the bottom of the chalace. Layer of sediment forms towards the bottom as well. Yes I poured the yeast. I wanted to taste the ENTIRE offering. 
Where do I start with the smell? Fresh baked shortbread cookies, candy sugar, malt, slight cherry mustiness, deep fruity sweetness, some yeast aroma. Can't discern any hops character in the nose. Slight alcohol aroma, but only after twirling the chalace roughly. 
Now for the taste. Chocolatey, deep bread flavors, figs, malty, some nut-bitterness towards the back of the tongue. 
Medium mouthfeel with mild carbonation. Oh so drinkable. 
Creamy, luscious, delicious. Yes, delicioius. A very broad word used to describe something. Very few things in life can simply be described as delicious. This is one of those special things. 1,322 charactersBrewfan, Jan 25, 2007

Smell is in line with the style, very fruity, sweet, hint of alcohol. Just how I like my Dubbels to smell.
Taste is very complex, almost snobby to a point. A dry fruitiness hits your tongue first, followed by a sharp meld of berrys, bitterness, and a faint poke of alcohol. Very dry and smooth, a different road was taken making this one, far out of the way of most Dubbels.
Overall, an exquisite example of the style. Not just worth seeking out for its reputation, but worth seeking out if only to have a Dubbel like you've never had before. If you see it, trample everyone between you and this brew, you'll thank me. 722 charactersleftmindedrighty, Jan 14, 2007

A: Pours a dark, cloudy copper with a big fluffy head. Good sustain and lots of lacing.
S: Aromas of raisins, red wine, and a touch of alcohol. Smaller smell than expected.
T: Big, complex taste that saturates the mouth. Spicy with flavors of plums and currants and a warm alcoholic heat.
M: Full-bodied and heavy. For a Belgian, the carbonation in this is quite moderate, a trait that pleases me.
D: No doubt about it, this is a wonderful beer. A bit lacking in aroma, but the complexities of the flavor make up for it. I probably won't get out of my way to get this beer again, but if the opportunity is there, I'l gladly take it. 721 charactersklewis, Jan 11, 2007

Thanks goes to BitterBill on this one, for a Merry Christmas.
Used a chalice for this one, as it deserves. Pours a very dark clear amber color, nice carbonation, nice off-white almost 2 finger head which lasts quite awhile, leaves some nice islands and sticky lacing. The nose is of sweet malts, yeast, grapes, figs, raisins, slight caramel. The taste is absolutely delicious of malts/yeast, and grapes. Very tangy, a nice touch of fizzy on the tongue as it goes down, pretty carbonated. Medium body, a very complex brew. Very drinkable, ABV hidden very well, not noticeable in the nose or taste for that matter. Highly recommended. 693 charactersWasatch, Jan 10, 2007

Sour mash cherry, figs, Belgium candy cane and malts, just an unbelievable brew. Sharp, crisp, dry and tasting like a new dawn on a Caribbean beach. This is comparable to drinking a bourbon single malt fermented in an oak beer tank. Why a beer like this has to end is beyond me  but all things must pass.

Sweet belgian candied sugar with ripe plum and fig notes coupled with notes of rich chocolatey port. Beckons to be sipped.	
Taste/Mouthfeel:
Velvetty smooth mouthfeel with an overwhelming sensation of rich ripe fruit that only intensifies in sweetness as this liquid gold warms upon the tongue.	 When aerated across the tongue, sherry notes burst forth along with some subtle tinges of chocolate.

Pours a dark brown color with a creamy off-white head. The aroma consists of bready malt, cherrries, yeast, spice and brandy. The taste in one word: incredible! There is a really nice malty base that supports some dark fruits and a little chocolate. The taste finishes with a slightly spicey bitterness. Medium mouthfeel is crisp and creamy. Overall, this is truely one of the finest beers on the planet. It definately gets better as it warms so give it time to sit out before serving if serving cold out of the fridge. This beer deserves all the hype and then some. 862 characterscjgator3, Dec 25, 2006
4.58/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Another b-day gift to myself. 12/22
Man this is a pretty brew. Pours out a semi transparent black cherry color with nice tan suds rising up a full finger before quickly dropping back down. The sediment drops make the tan suds brown. I want it all.
Smell is cherry and coffee and creamy chocolate. The yeast is strong here too and it burns the nose. It smells like a Cherry cordial and I wanna take a big ole bite.
Taste is a sweet malty flavor that has a hint of fruit,like cherry or orange, at the front then following are a bitterness that goes to nothing quickly leaving not a lot of aftertaste like the blonde did.
This is a very sudsy feeling brew. Active as hell. Then the malty sweetness comes to save the day.
This is a wonderful beer that has so much to say. I wish it would say "hey, I'm cheap and readily available" 831 characterspeabody, Dec 23, 2006
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This one also was sent to me by BA dogfooddog and had a best by date of 18 Feb 2008, making this a little shy of two year old. The beer poured murky orange brown in color, and was topped with a three finger tall head that simply refused to die. Needless to say, the lacing was pretty solid around the entire goblet. Aroma was quite a bit superior to most other Dubbles, which typically underwhelm me with their yeast driven smell. This one seemed much brighter and fruity in comparison. The yeast was certainly detectable in a dusty undercurrent, but the overall smell was not dominated by it. The taste was sweet, sour, bitter, and spicy, but not complex enough to detract from the drinkability. The primary flavor impression was that of dried cherries with a light coating of chocolate. There was spicy bite to the flavor, and surprisingly there seemed to a clean bitterness in the dry finish. Not a hint of the 8% ABV to be found at all. A superlative Dubbel, which has forever ruined the other more typical examples of the style for me. 1,040 charactersrajendra82, Dec 21, 2006
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured contents into a Westvleteren chalice. It forms a milky smooth off white head. Retention is not a problem at all. Dark ruddy brown with some ruby red hue towards the edge. 
Plenty going on with the smell. Candied malts mixed with some dark fruits and then rolls back to some earthy spices.
Taste is similar, although the biggest difference to me is the addition of the toasted malt presence. I get some dry chocolate and a coffee backside. Of course the belgian yeast is ever present and displays a soft core of cloves that add to the depth. Alcohol was welcomed and combined with the spices to sharpen this bad boy up. Milky smooth mouthfeel is perfection. Some may find it a bit buttery or oily and I would concur but at the end of the day it works in this offering because the carbonation has enough fight in it to counteract the slick body. 
I loved it. A premier dubbel in the world and the best in my world that I've had to date. 
Notes: I'd go as far as saying that this is without a doubt one of the best beers on the planet. Truly a masterpiece. 1,072 charactersDogFood11, Dec 21, 2006
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 433 cl bottle shared by the house wine lover himself- I must admit that before we even tried this one, we seriously considered dumping this out, and in its place, pouring Fullers London Porter, mixed with Vodka to create a clone. Then we had an even better idea, why not buy a bottle of La Terrible, and add water to it, to bring the ABV down? Wouldnt it be the same thing? Deep chestnut, pours and emits a thin, tight bubbled beige skin. Apples, plums, prunes, fig, pear, and orages give way to spices (cinnamon) and a mildly smoky malt with subtle hops. Ohh my. Very fruity flavours, that pretty much mimic the aroma, nutmeg and other spices, very earthy and full. Dry, flavourful, lingering finish. Yes, I like it. Thanks Mr.S! 733 charactersmrmanning, Dec 14, 2006
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours dark brown with big, fluffy tan head. Creamy head settles to about 1/2". Cannot see through glass. Impressive lacing that lasts.
Smells of sweet malt and a yeasty smell. Maybe a smell of currants, too.Smells definitely change with temperature.
Tastes bitter upfront then switches to a semi-sweet chocolate taste. Also picking out sweet darker skinned fruits with a nutty aftertaste. Lingering slightly bitter aftertaste that is milder than Orval.
Medium bodied with only a hint of carbonation. Warming sensation and an excellent, smooth mouthfeel.
Very complex as the proper temperature is everything with this beer. I may have started with this one a little too cold but it really gets better as it warms. Very drinkable but too rare. 753 charactersvwcraig, Dec 06, 2006
4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I acquired all three of the Westies through an incredible trade with someone more connected and beer knowledgeable than myself. I started with the 12, which was a big let down for me. As I cozied up to watch what was going to be a Ravens destruction at the hands of the Bengals, I chilled this bottle and had a go.
Absolutely beautiful beer. Red highlighted mahogany with a pillowy head. Retention lasted forever and had beautiful lacing.
Aroma of spices, roasted malts and yeasty goodness.
Big full flavored, creamy brew. Tastes changed as I sipped and it warmed. At times, it was just about everything (spicey, sweet, peppery). Well worth having several and very nice. 673 charactersUmbra, Dec 04, 2006
3.51/5  rDev -21.7%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a ruddy brown color and murky with a large tan head that barely budges. Aroma is very light and has traces of ripe fruit, sweet caramel malt, and belgian sugars, a little bubble-gummy. Taste shows some of the sweet candy sugar and fruit flavor up front along with a little rich tobacco like flavor, these are cut mid taste by a small roasty twang and a decent pepperiness. There is some alcohol flavor and some tingly carbonation along with the pepper and then a decently dry finish. This beer improved vastly as it approached room temp. The aroma and taste were very subtle and only when it became fairly warm did the flavors start to come out. Still were subtle, but a nice drinkable beer, great mouthfeel. 714 charactershoppymeal, Nov 28, 2006
4.89/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Very nice pour. Wonderful dark burgundy with a long lasting white head that settles into a white cap. 
Smells of very intense flowers and fruity yeast. Fanstatic! This is Masla Mama of yeasty Belgians--it's not as huge with its potporri alcohol like rainbows and unicorns--but that's good. The rainbow comes without rain, and unicorns without heavy hooves and unicorn shit (which is pretty, yes, but smells MUCH worse than regular horse shit).
Slow sip. Very fizzy. Very fizzy. I taste the fizz. That moves into a dull, over ripe, and almost perfectly sweet fruit. The ending is odd but not bad--it tastes kind of like the way your whole mouth feels after a shot of novacaine. No kidding. Intense black dullness that light cannot escape. In the same way that liquid nitrogen is sold cold it can burn you, so is this dullness so dull that it's a flavor, a far drawn, negative yeast that just tastes like the anti-taste, which actually tastes pretty good. A far cry from the nose, yes, but still very nice.
This is a wonderful beer. I don't know if I'd say it was quite as good as the 12, but it surely come close.
EDIT:
Okay, here's the deal. When I first poured this, it was too cold. All the intensity remained, but it was confined. Like seventeen pitbulls in a shoebox, it was confined. Now that's it's warmed, the big fruit yeast of the nose comes in at the start, wonderfully sweet and balanced perfectly against a dryly sweet malt middle and a kick of honest to god hops. 1,491 charactersmynie, Nov 18, 2006

Appearance - Pours a dark reddish color, with about half an inch of head that sticks to the sides of the glass, giving this beer "legs"
Smell - Sweet apples and grapes, bready and yeasty smell.
Taste/Mouthfeel - Very smooth and creamy, with just the right amount of carbonation. Lots of fruitiness here, with plum and grape flavors taking the forefront. Dry aftertaste with a mild alcohol warming sensation.
Drinkability - Hands down one of the most drinkable beers I've ever had. I finished off this bottle in no time. Each sip leaves you yearning for another. Damn near perfect brew. 645 charactersdrumline, Nov 16, 2006

Deep brown. Head is multi-colored, with creamy white and stained brown patches and busy carbonation. Couldn't detect much sediment through the dark beer, but there was a layer of yeast sticking to the bottom of the bottle :-)
Sweet malts on the nose. 
Malty profile, with a notable bitterness that is soft as a pillow. Subtle sweetness that fades off before the aftertaste kicks in. Notes of dates, brown sugar, mineral water, and mild alcohol. 
Soft carbonation, that just melts on your tongue and provides a gentle spicyness.
It is quite obvious that lots of care and skill went into the making of this perfectly balanced ale. Simply the very definition of the style. Worth seeking out. Cheers! 848 charactersrayjay, Nov 08, 2006

A - Pours a chocolatey black with brownish red breaking through. Head is a light tan that is tightly woven smooth foam. Drops to an inch of thick creamy cover on the beer. Lacing is extraordinary.
S - Raisins, viney, caramel, notes of bittersweet chocolate, tangy as well, really what I had hoped for.
T - Toasted caramel, dark dried fruits, figs, raisins, dates, sugary malts, tangy hints as well, warm in the chest. This is exactly what I had hoped for.
M - Not really what I had expected. Not as viscous as I thought it would be. It is above average, but I thought it would be a bit heavier on the palate.
D - I want another, but I assume thats the usual feeling. I cant wait to try the 12. 801 charactersrsyberg01, Nov 08, 2006

I'd heard so much about this beer-- and people on the Belgian train bowed with awed reverence when they saw the bottle I was carrying. I wasn't disappointed-- only mildly so, actually-- it's a beer, not a god! ha ha
Appearance-- incredibly nice, a dark purplish-brown with some effervescence and a gorgeous stained-brown even head.
Smell-- complex, enticing, smoky.
Taste-- much like the smell, lots of complex florals, prune, apricot, malt, caramel, burnt-wood smoke, traditional Belgian flat-hops but not much bitterness, a very nice experience.
Mouthfeel-- a nice bouquet ot be savored.
Drinkability-- goes down easily, except that you are continually grasping to identify the complex flavors. Very drinkable-- if you were fortunate enough to find enough to consume in-quantity. 897 characterstherica, Nov 05, 2006
4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5out of the plain, label-free bottle and into a tulip glass. this is a very dark, nearly black beer, a.deep mahogany when held up to the black sides of BA. a great big gorgeous tan head sits at the top and refuses to go away. 
the first sniff is intriguing. there is obviously a lot to smell, but when i get closer, my first thought is not dubbel. i expect a really sweet, malty yeast bomb. but what i get is a big ale with lots of fruit and a strong hop presence. there's a wonderful mix of malt, dark fruits, some marshmallows and bubble gum. recently i have had several of the style, and although i didn't review it the st. bernardus blew me away. i am reminded of that here but at the same time this one is unique. so much character, such depth. 
jebus. this masterpiece has everything going for it. heavanly mouthfeel, perfect balance and an impossibly light, dry finish. the only thing keeping me from giving this a perfect 5 is probably the same thing that keeps quadrupels and imperial stouts at the top of the best of BA list. 8% abv is nothing to play with, this is a strong ale. but it doesn't quite have the kick your ass wow factor of the biggest and strongest. having said that, this is probably more drinkable and a better everyday beer than the much stronger ales. 1,285 charactersdavidchollar, Oct 22, 2006
4.92/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I got this one from a good friend of mine who happened to be at the right store at the right time in Brussels. Thanks Robb! This is my 400th review, and it seemed like a good time to break out such a special beer.
Appearance: Pours a clear deep red-garnet color with a huge fluffy 1" head of off white bubbles. There are tons of bubbles rising to keep the head up there, and it looks like this one is going to be here for the long haul. There is already a bit of lacing being left on the side of the glass even though I still haven't taken a sip of it yet. As I drank the beer the lace was somewhat sporatic, and by the time I got to the end of the beer it had recessed back into the beer.
Aroma: The aroma is really complex with some dark fruit and subtle spices complimenting a fresh bread like base. The yeast is a big player in the aroma of this one. This is really pleasant with some floral notes. It is hard to put your finger on any one flower in particular, but I get hints of Jasmine and maybe a tad of lavender. As the beer sits for a while and starts to warm, there is a more roasty aromatic coming out that seems like it is from sweet chocolate. The beer smells sweet, but I know that it is not and that the sweetness is just perceived due to the strong malt balance.
Taste: The flavor is amazingly complex with some sweet candy like flavors to get you in the beginning along with a defined bready presence. The evolution of flavor in this beer lasts forever and keeps changing as it sits on your palate. Somewhere after the sweetness starts to mellow a bit, you get the carbonation and what seems like dry attenuation. This lets you taste the alcohol for a second as a spicy bite just before a somewhat roasted impression sets in. Just when you think that the roast is going to be what you taste, there is a floral contribution that teases you just before you get back to the spicy alcohol to take you into the finish. Late after the sip, there is a defined alcoholic warming that coats your throat and warms you up all the way to the belly. As the beer warms, the fruit flavors are becoming much more apparent and they are taking much more plum-like or even currant-like character. Man, this is an excellent beer!
Opinion: What can I say about such an outstanding beer? This is fabulous! As I drink this beer for a while, and I am taking my time with it, I can see how there is often a comparison made between this and Rochefort. This beer does taste a bit like their #8 with all of its fruity complexity and full flavor while still coming across as well attenuated and drinkable. I think that Rochefort is a bit more dark malt driven which gives it a tad more acidity. This beer is a bit more fruity, but both are dangerously drinkable for such strong beers. 2,785 charactersSkeeterHawk, Oct 12, 2006

I liked it better than the 12. It was more subtle, refined, and although i generally like the big alcohol beers, i thought the 12 tried to do too much. this reminded me greatly of the rochefort 10 both in style and substance (and yes, i know the styles are technically different).
Pours a dark ruby with a amorphous white head. Great lacing/head retention. Aromas quickly filled the room - candied apples, banana, prune, toffee, caramel, even a bit of chocolate. Taste hits strong up front with fruity sweetness and rounds out with the dessert flavors. Mouthfeel is impecable - thick yet effervescent and tingling. Highly drinkable, aside from the difficulty to acquire. 776 charactersLnedrive14, Sep 19, 2006

Pours a lovely deep garnet with a creamy light tan head. With a lot of sticky lace and just a little hazy. Aroma was quite vinous, with a bit of green apple sourness. Lots of caramel and some chocolate surfaced as it warmed. Taste was a roller coaster of flavour, an absolutely amazing ride. Candy apple sweetness and green apples up front, changing to caramel and chocolate maltiness, changing again to a mild bittersweet chocolate peppery finish. Mouthfeel was amazingly smooth and not too heavy, the body of a red wine in a way. This is very drinkable and the flavour is amazing. Definitely something to track down. 719 characterstatterdash, Sep 16, 2006
4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4This one was a present last Christmas, so it's nearly a year old. I can't think of a better occassion other than my 21st birthday to finally crack this one open and give it a try. :) I'll be cellaring an 8 and a 12 for tasting further down the road. 
Served at room temperature, in a Westvleteren glass. Dark cola bottom that can be deceiving, as it has a dark ruby red/amber tint when held up to the light. Big, billowing, puffy head that clings and sticks to the glass. Head dissipates rather quickly, but leaves nice lacing.
Aroma is wonderful. Malty nose with a strong spice presence, nutty like banana bread. Mild phenolic character, but not overpowering. Rich, bready aroma, white peppers tickles my nose. Plums/raisins noted as well, wonderful smell.
Creamy/carbonated mouthfeel, with phenols coming into play on my tongue. Upfront hop bitterness with a brandy-like finish in both the taste and the warming alcohol. Nicely constructed malt profile, plums/raisins paired with dark chocolate lingers around in the background. 
Taste is good, but the mouthfeel falls way short of my expectations and is thus rated average at best. Medium body, substainable, but for my tastes - carbonation comes on a bit too strong and is only accentuated by the hop profile. Also, phenol properties need to be toned down in the mouth.
Now I'm just waiting for another special occassion to crack open my first 12. I can respect this brew, and I'll definitely give it a shot again once I age it for a good while. A bit hyped, sure, but I'm not totally against it. 1,565 charactersnouseforotacon, Sep 16, 2006
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: This is a beautiful beer. It is an incredibly dark tawny brown color that lets a little light rough to show off the carbonation. The head is creamy beige and big. The fingers of foams that has excellent retention and leaves tons of lacing.
Smell: The aroma is magnificent. It is loaded with currants, caramel and a hint of wet sweet bread and sour apple. Raisins brown sugar and caramelized malts along with a light sprinkling of spices tickle the senses next. This is a beer I would like to smell all the time. Give me the friken candles that smell like Trappist Westvleteren 8 (Blue Cap) over those damn vanilla one my wife burns all day =).
Taste: A spectacular web of yeast driven flavors showcases honey candied malts, hints of coco, whole grain bread and fruits, prune juice toffee and cherries. A hint of alcohol shows throw a brandy attribute but the alcohol is mostly masked until the dry finish. The aftertaste set me back a bit at first but I quickly warmed up to the lip smacking flavor that lingered and lingered seemingly indefinitely on the palate.
Mouthfeel: This beer is as smooth as I could imagine (except for the 12 which well, came from the Gods). This beer is lightly carbonated but lightly spiced to give a a remarkably gentle overall feel.
Drinkability: If monks in the abbey get to drink all they want I am going to convert to monk immediately. Mmm. I could live on this stuff. 
Hope this is helpful.

Pours a deep, dark ruby color that is almost opaque until held in the light. The head is absolutely mountainous and a caramel-tan color. It would not die. Hardcore lacing in the chalice. Nose is exceptional - sweet malt, confectioner's sugar, stewed fruits, banana bread ... gorgeous. Palate is quite sweet upfront, but is offset quickly by an almost perfect hop balance. Sweet malts and alcohol are dominent, especially as the beer warms to optimal temperature. Finish is surprisingly dry, thanks to the masterful balance in this beer. Medium mouthfeel and a lingering sugar and alcohol memory in the mouth. An excellent dubbel in every respect. The best of the type I've tried thus far. 806 charactersbeerphilosopher, Sep 01, 2006

Aroma is mostly of sweet caramel malts, with underlying spice and fruit. Raisins, figs, spice, and yeast. 
Bready malts, and strong yeast. Mild spicy bitterness with the aforementioned fruit tones coming out strong as well. Alcohol very well-hidden. Incredible.
Creamy and soft, but not too thick. Goes down very smoothly. Along with the Rochefort 10, this is the best beer I've tried. After this, I can't wait to try its big brother. 677 charactersPhocion, Aug 23, 2006

Aromatics lead off with cocoa and caramel, accented with bubblegum and spice.
Nose is complex, approachable, and sophisticted, with chocolate drizzled bannana and rum-soaked raisins following through.
Mouthfeel is medium and slickish, with a delectable creamyness and a touch of oilyness.
Pallet is lushious and has great depth of flavor.
Starts out with chocolate, toffee, and caramel, and pulls through with warming spice and vanilla.

Beautiful mahogany body with a foamy, off-white head with nice lacing. Smell is dark fruity. Maybe plums. And caramel sugar. Taste is so clean and smooth. It all comes together in this brew. I can't think of how I could make this beer taste any better. Mouthfeel is lighter than I expected and incredibly smooth. Carbonation is almost creamy. Microscopic bubbles.

At least the last beer to ever sit inside it was Ommegang's Three Philosophers. Now my main goblet is a Trappist Rochefort one. It's into this that I pour the highly coveted Westvleteren 8. (Forgive the dramatics, but I did love that goblet...)
Pours a gorgeous caramel brown underneath a super-creamy head (like an Irish stout) that lasted forever. A whole lot of carbonation. Huge walls of lace. Again: gorgeous.
Lots going on in the aroma: raisins, brown sugar, black pepper, young Concord grapes and generous alcohol.
The flavors are compelling and complex: peppery spice, juicy dark raisins, cognac, and anise. These hit first. A mild cocoa essence comes later, as does lots of dark fruits and cinnamon as it warms. Pleasant bitterness in the finish.
Mouthfeel is not all that effervescent, considering all the bubble action happening in its caramel sea. It's smooth, even buttery, delivering the minimum of carbonation needed for you to feel it.
Sounds like a spikey, exotic, too-sweet beer, right? It's not. It's purely a well-crafted, highly-drinkable, super-enjoyable indulgence for lovers of prime Belgian beercraft. Too bad the monks won't let us enjoy this more often. I respect their ways, but then again, if you've got a great thing going, let the world in on it. No? 1,350 charactersMetalmonk, Jul 12, 2006
3.18/5  rDev -29%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Don't get the hype.
Pours a murky brown in color. Nearly flat. Lots of bubbles clinging to the bottom of the goblet but none of them rising to the top. Slight ring of foam around the edges of the glass. Little dark blobs of yeast towards the bottom that sneaked past my careful pour.
All the flavors come across as flat and lifeless. There is a cherry and grape flavor but very subdued. Caramel and molasses too--but like they've been in the cupboard for years. Brown sugar, but as if it was mixed and diluted with water. Medium body with some slight heat from the alcohol. Kind of tangy. Alright for what it is, but not sure I understand how it has scored so high. 671 charactersMuddyFeet, Jul 07, 2006
4.84/5  rDev +8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Finally got my hands on some of this elusive beverage thanks to fellow BA dogfooddog. The sample I am currently drinking is 3 years of age, and it's held up spectacularly. I also have a much fresher sample that I will probably give another review of.
The appearance nice. Based solely on appearance, this beer doesn't seem any more or less great than most other brews I've had. The beer pours to a nice dark reddish brown, a little bit cloudy. Not completely opaque, but quite dark. The head does not build up too the impressive rockiness of some belgians I've had. In fact, it is quite small and doesn't last very long or lace very well. Not a big deal. This beer is still quite spectacular.
The nose is great. Has a nice roasted barley aroma with plenty of dark fruit and berry esters. Very smooth. This is a really "cut the bullshit" beer compared to most belgians, and that is very reassuring to me. I had high hopes for this beer, and I didn't want it to turn out too over aggressive. So far it's holding up to its hype.
The taste is just as wonderful. Tastes very rich and roasty. Very smooth sweetness mixed with the berry and fruit flavors. Perfect bitterness. I love the roasty flavor in this. Has a very distinct Westmalle Dubbel yeast flavor, along with a distinct St Bernardus 8 malt flavor. Like the best of both worlds, but better still.
Nice creamy and full mouthfeel. Still has some carbonation after 3 years. The finish is divine, and keeps me coming back for more. This is a very drinkable beer, particularly considering the ABV. If it were even the least bit more easily accessable or cheap, I would probably acquire more. I can't wait to finally travel to Europe. 1,695 charactersneonbrown82, Jul 06, 2006
4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I received this back in April, along with a bottle of Westvleteren Blonde. I'd been waiting until I was in the right mood to give this a try. I let this warm to around 45º F and served it in my Westvleteren Chalice.
Appearance: Pours a dark brown with hints of garnet at the edges. The excellent clarity reveals vigorous carbonation. A fluffy beige head tops the beer. The head persists well eventually fading into a thin layer leaving lace behind.
Smell: Sweet candy malts dominate, with aromas of fruit and a slight spiciness. Yeasty aromas and moderate alcohol are also evident.
Taste): Sweet candy flavors upfront with dark fruits and more subtle note of yeast and spice. The finish is significantly bitter which provides a nice balance to the sweetness. Decanting the yeast into the beer at the end increases the yeast flavors and the spiciness.
Mouthfeel: Not overly carbonated, smooth and medium bodied.
Drinkability: Easy to drink and delicious.
Overall: A very good and well-balanced beer. 1,017 charactersEPICAC, Jun 18, 2006

Appears a dark mahogany toned brown with a mild off white head that slowly fades out into a small cap and collar. Streaky lacing is left around the glass.
Smell is of yeasty bread, raisins, brown sugar, toffee, sweet caramel...much more complex than the newer bottles I've had.
Taste is equal to the aromas with the sugar and doughy yeast working well together.
Mouthfeel is super smooth, rich, and deliciously heavenly. 465 charactersweeare138, Jun 16, 2006
4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5After purchasing a single bottle of this beer at Beer Mania in Brussels two years ago, I thought I'd never find it in London, esp. after the monks announced their new policy on distribution. But by courtesy of RichLightweight's kind info., the Quinn's in Camden Town, London, has quite a few bottles sitting in the fridge!! Most importantly, the cool landlord doesn't allow it for take-away (deserves applauses) and sell it at the same price as all other Belgian beers!! (3.2quid, how about that? FANTASTIC!) I had a bottle of it on the first visit there three weeks ago with RichLightweight and Chris (axisjones), and another two bottles three days ago. Here goes the note, finally~~
BB: 18/02/09, served lightly-chilled in a "dry" tulip glass (the landlord insists on wetting all the glasses before serving all Belgian beers at his pub, bar this one on MY insistence).
A: pours a very dark mahogany colour, with some ruby glows; the beer head takes its time to build up to a incredibly tight and frothy souffle-shaped, beige chunk of air cells on the top, refusing to budge what-so-ever... the carbonation is contantly lively, as detected from the sides of the glass. Brilliant.
S: exotic fruit-esters coming from yeasts (pineapple+mango+apricot) abound, accompanied by a deeply perfumy, sour-sweet dark maltiness (with hints of Chinese red-bean paste+melted brown sugar)... Balanced with a malty theme, but rather understated, which is hard to achieve for a strong beer like this, I presume. Incredibly complex in a low-key way and very approachable.
T: upfront is an exceptionally creamy-textured flavour of black beans, treacles, black malts, backed by an interesting perfumy yeasty and metallic edge of black malts, which surprisingly reminds me of rice-vinegar marinated raw mackerel tasted with a little wasabi!! No kidding, the metallic touch is exactly like that! No offence intended, but that adds to the overall complexity for me... An intriguing sour-sweet fruitiness, like dried red-dates, develops in the aftertaste, followed by a slowly intensifying herbal bitterness which stays deeply down the sides of the tongue. As the liquid warms up a bit, the sour fruity maltiness and the profound bitter edge plays a more assertive role in the balance, but never quite too much to be overpowering.
M&D: the mouthfeel is superbly creamy and silky smooth, matching the soft body just perfectly. For all the Dubbel-style ales I've tasted, this is by far the most smooth example yet showing impressive complexity and really great flavours. This is not a big beer to make drinkers feel small, but a beer to lift up both their souls and sensations in a subtle manner... Having tried it at last, I think I'll keep my original bottle purchased in Brussels for several more years. I'm sure it'll be even more mature through the test of time~~ 2,851 characterswl0307, Jun 15, 2006
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Pours a dark cloudy mahogany with an inch-thick creamy head that barely moves. Aroma is caramel malt and that traditional Belgian yeastiness. Lacing has already started, like it's trying to climb out up the sides of the tulip.
Taste is a subdued bready malt. Some sweetness, some bitterness, nothing really grabs you at first, like the beer is circling and trying to get a feel for you. Caramel, dry toasty malt, bare traces of candy sugar. Hints of tea or tobacco, some dried leaf like a cigar wrapper. Still more bread, like a fresh whole grain loaf, not too sweet at all. More of a raisiny, dark fruit nature arises with some warmth, but the alcohol stays well-hidden at all times.
Mouthfeel is gentle, not heavy at all, a touch of biting acidity. Carbonation keeps it lively, lifts off the palate easily and cleanly. The finish is sweetish and caramelly, very gentile. I'm not getting the rich and fruity aromas that others have mentioned, so this may be a young bottle that should have sat for a couple of years. Overall, fantastically smooth and balanced. The nose could be a little more bold but otherwise flawless.
Cap dated "16:09:08," no label. Can't tell exactly how old it is. 1,197 charactersassurbanipaul, Jun 13, 2006
4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A huge thanks to Bruskiator for allowing me to try this one. I belived Bruno picked this up at the brewery in Belgium about 6 years ago. He pulled this one out of his excellent beer cellar for the Carolina Brewmasters BBQ for me and my buddy to experience. My only issue was after lots of beer, BBQ, and sun, I was not able to fully appreciate the taste and mouthfeel as one really needs. Nevertheless, I must let you know this is a beautiful beer, very deep bronze with a pretty fair amount of carbonation. Smelled of wonderful complexity of fruit and chocolate. Just a great way to top off last night. 603 charactersBacker2004, May 28, 2006
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a dark, hazy brown color with a huge tan head that is still there after several minutes and a couple of sips. The lacing is stuck fast to the snifter all the way around.
Scent is of funky Belgian yeast, dark fruits, bananas, bubble gum, sweet sugary malts and just a hint of alcohol.
Taste absolutely follows the nose. Dark fruits, bananas, maybe a bit of that bubble gum, sweet bready malts and that wonderful yeast spiciness. Finishes quite dry for the overload of malt at the front. Maybe, the spiciness from the yeast?
Mouthfeel cannot be improved upon. This is as smooth and silky as the 12 maybe even more-so. Medium to full bodied and just so creamy and smooth. NICE!!
I would drink these until stupor insued, probably 3-4. Then happily pass out in front of a late showing of Sports Center. I said it before, NICE!!
I only have one though, and it's gone. 882 characterstrumick, May 21, 2006
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4bottle, no label - just the blue cap. In a goblet.
Dark VERY murky/muddy brown with a clouded opaque color. Very interesting to look at, with a huge smell of figs, roasted nuts, malt, caramel, prunes, dried fruits...awesome. Medium head that was great to look at.
Taste - for what this is, it truly is exceptional. There is a bit of hype on the brewery due to supply and demand - however in taste, it is exceptional.
Drinkability is strange because I am not sure how much more I would have had of this in one sitting, but if you define drinkability as "should I drink this?" the answer is yes.
Get it - Absolutely worth it, don't drink it too cold. This style shines on cellar temperature.
Cheers. 712 charactersHimerMan, May 19, 2006
4.95/5  rDev +10.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5cap dated 12.06.05, this bottle is 3 years 11 months old. It was imported by D&V and bought by me in Q3 2002. I remember tasting bottles of this same-dated batch beer (as well as a batch of westv.12) when I bought them and they were quite unorganized in taste with limited complexity, but, as the seller advised upon inquiry, they would mature fabulously with time.
Pours lively 30% head in a rochefort chalice, surprising. Immediately yeasty bready odors permeate, along with something somewhat syrupy, and this is at 2 feet from the glass. Close nose is very bready and sweet, similar but not as deep as the 12.
Taste is sweet at first, then carries a curious bittersweet undernote which reminds me of something i will put in here later if i remember it. The sensation is similar to licorice, but far less pronounced. The breadyness dissapates into the finish. Having had the 12 last night it does seem a diminished version of that beer, but this beer is magnitudes beyond most things out there claiming to resemble it. It is the master of the style and probably several other categories.
As with the 12, there is almost a glow or permeating tingling in the mouth when I drink this, I have found this typical of westvleteren beers more than a year or so old and occasionally have found in very old bottle-conditioned beers (recent example King and Barnes 1994 christmas ale, though that beer did not taste great).
I think the only comparable beer per style in quality at this age is Rochefort 8. It is a masterpiece and should be bought on sight. 1,560 charactersdogfooddog, May 19, 2006
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer poured a creamy dark brown that fades to apricots with a nice sustained film of almond head. There are also a good deal of little flecks of yeast swimming around the bottom of my tulip.
Smelled of creamy pastry with some sticky brown sugar or molasses. In the background theres an earthy dry sticky yeast and a nip of alcohol. Also, theres a banana, organic cherry and a crisp and dry rhubarb.
Tasted of light and creamy caramel and pastry but pops into a sharp dry hoppy/yeast sting that then falls into a honey and hazelnut. The mouth feel is light and easy with a storm of tiny, easy carbonation. 
Very well done. I liked the pastry ideas here, like in the 12, but the dryness tragically (I use this term relatively) stole the show. Thanks to blitheringidiot for this one. 798 charactersDarkerTheBetter, May 01, 2006

4.48/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a deep brown color, with a touch of red hue, very hazy. A light tan head of 1/2 inch shortens quickly to a foam crust which then lasts awhile, looking frothy and swirly. Nice streaming bubbles, minimal lacing, however. The smell is only mildly strong, with coffee and banana notes up front. Slightly roasted nut aroma in the background, the nose is a bit raisiny and tart making it overall complex. The alcohol is barely detectable here.
The first sip is intense on malt flavor, a sweet brown sugar taste coupled with a rasiny fruit flavor, mildly tart. Slight coffee and chocolate also in the mix. There is a slight astringence down the throat, although I can't really taste the alcohol. A gentle bitterness on the tongue serves to balance out the strong malt flavors yielding a nice balance through all the complexity. 
Rich and full in body, not overly thick, but creamy enough to make it highly enjoyable. Fairly high in carbonation, it makes me let out a joyous belch after the first few sips. Drinkablility of this beer is off the charts. Not too strong, complex flavors, probably the best Dubbel I've ever had, as expected... 1,144 charactersbennetj17, Apr 11, 2006
4.43/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Jetsbeer for the trade. Pours with moderate carbonation, body is dark brown with a slight amber hue. A little swirl produces a furious frothing that is quite audible. Aroma is fruity, a little yeasty, and slight hops. There is also that same something I smell in Westy 12, though I can't put my finger on it. Their water source, or the yeast, perhaps.
 Tastes damn good. The flavors are layered and seem to repeat. Slightly fruity, some yeast, spice, and hops. Mouthfeel is full, well carbonated, but smooth. I would drink dubbels more often if I could buy this. At least I have 1 more. 599 charactersSephiroth, Apr 07, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I believe that this has held up to the legendary status surrounding it. Best before date on the cap read,"18-02-09". It poured about like any other dubbel. It appeared very slightly cloudy reddish rusty brown colour with a monster khaki coloured head. Craggy, pitted foam left lots of sticky lacing on the edges of my Konings Hoeven goblet. The smell? Unimaginable! Spice, banana bread, cherries, pumpkin pie, pizza dough. Absolutely amazing, and it didn't stop there as much of this carried over to the taste, as well. Lots of fruit on the palate, as well as yeasty dough. The mouthfeel was almost velvety as this silky dubel washes over your tongue and down the back of your throat. I don't want to say that it seemed oily, as that would sound offensive, but that is how easily and gracefully it seemed to glide about my mouth as I savoured and swallowed each sip. Even at 8% and to be a dubbel, I'm quite sure that I could have 3 of these in a sitting. I was a bit skeptical at first as to whether or not this legendary ale would live up to all it has become through all the hype surrounding it. I think the answer to that question is certainly "yes". 1,154 charactersSilentSabre, Apr 06, 2006

This beer poured an opaque, brown color with creamy, light brown foam that was slow to settle and clung to the glass, coating it. The smell was modest, but some malt came through. The taste was fruity and vinous, almost like blueberries (!). The light fruitiness was up front but the finish was dry with some hops coming through the malt. The mouthfeel was smooth and dry overall with medium body and strong carbonation. A very nice mouthfeel. This was a very nice bottle, and probably the freshest I have had this beer. The only weak point was the aroma. 617 charactersUncleJimbo, Mar 21, 2006

Mahogany with slightt red edges. Tall billowing head of light tan that just sits there and slowly falls into a rocky landscape. Thick webby tendrils of lace are left in its wake.
The nose brings those wonderful aromas of freshly baked fruit cake made with cherries and plums that I love so much. A little bit of damp earth that reminds me of a my Grandma's old cellar in Ohio that I used to play in as a kid. A ghost of alcohol hangs in the back. Not as intense as the 12, but I love it.
Full mouth with just the right tingle from the carbonation that finishes clean.
The dark fruit flavors are upfront and everything flows just like the nose promised. The spices and earthy dough are all perfectly blended and the alcohol is there but it fits in so well that you have to really search for it to find it. Peppery finish that holds on to the plums and lingers pleasntly.
With everything this beer has going for it, the drinkablity is a five. No doubt about that. Again, I'm in awe of what the brothers can do. 1,160 charactersypsifly, Mar 20, 2006

dark brown body with deep, bloody red rare highlights. catch the light the right way and the highlights glow radiantly. the surface has a brownish-yellow translucent layer as well, resting underneath a misty surface covered inadequately by cobwebby carbonation clusters. lacing dots the side of the glass gently and a ring stays around the edge.
aroma vomits forth ripe, rich fruits. raisin paste and juicy plum notes jump out of the glass from a distance. brown sugar smack and a light maltiness carries with it the sweet odor of cherry syrup. the slightest hint of raw cocoa beans top off this exotic nasal medley.
muddy and hot, slightly overcarbonated for the depth of flavor. nice caramel base although the alcohol abrasiveness and possible oxidation kills some of the subtler sweetnesses. warmth brings forth a kiss of fresh mowed grass and berry skins, saving the flavor from disappointing mediocrity. still, tastewise, there are better dubbels.
it's no 12, but it's a solid beer wrapped in an exquisite package. worth a try, glad i did. 1,065 charactersgoodbyeohio, Mar 13, 2006

The appearance is dark with a little light shinning through. The aromas are fruity and fruity that is all you smell. At a young age this is a excellent beer but age it atleast a year to enhance the flavors. At the young age it has a good fruity flavor but after a year this flavor is unbelievable, I first thought that it was not worth the drive across Belgium but now after tasting a couple more can't wait to go back. The mouthfeel is smooth with an abundance of flavor, the only thing I marked it down on was the drinkability due to the fact that it is packed full of flavors, to much of this wonderful brew and you will give yourself a headache enjoying every sip. But it is the only way to drink this beer. ENJOY 913 characterspaulaner, Mar 12, 2006

more tart, almost sour apples in the flavor. bready malts and a crisp, dry, champagne-like feel. alcohol and sour in the finish, which is a touch unpleasant. surprisingly straightforward, as i've come to expect a lot more complexity from the trappists. then again, i far prefer the rochefort 10 to the 8 or 6; maybe the westvleteren 12 will also far exceed its lesser brethren. 627 charactersPrufrock, Feb 22, 2006

Aromas of sugary candy and yeast, with subtle spicey notes and malts lingering in the background. Very enjoyable. Taste was exemplary, complex and inviting. Utterly delicious. Flavors of yeasty bread and malts, with a toffee candied like sweetness; grass and grain, dark plumbs and nectars. Wow. Mouthfeel was buttery smooth and slightly jazzy due to the mild carbonation stemming from the small, easy sips. Very high level of drinkability. If it weren't so expensive and hard to find, this would be it. Possibly better than it's quadrupel brother "12". World Class, and Highly Recommended.

4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I think that I might just like this one a touch more than the 12. The 8 has lighter aromas and flavors, a softer body and a lighter palate. The reduced alcohol gives the beer a less vinous character, which allows more delicate components of the nose and tongue to shine through. This is certainly more subtle but I dont think its lacking anything significant on the 12. Its just a different beer. One item that I must note is the body. IN addition to being generally softer, the 8 seems to be considerably more bubbly. The head is slightly more aggressive on the lips and tongue and the more assertive carbonation seems to do a better job of cleansing the palate between sips. Each next sip, is therefore closer resembling the original, full flavored, mind blowing sip. I like this about the beer. I also like that it looks, tastes, and smells just uncannily good and also that its damn near impossible to find. What a treat it is and well worth every penny, or couple thousand pennies that one must drop to get a bottle. 1,029 charactersDaPeculierDane, Feb 02, 2006

The smell is all fruity with notes of plum and peach and there's caramel tones there as well. Very complex and inviting.
The taste is firstly from the foam.(it just refuses to give up) ..huge fruitiness of plums and peaches hits my palate with a nice bitterness in the background. On to the liquid...there's the fruit blended well with a caramel sweetness and just a smidgeon of bitterness and I can *just* feel a slight warming sensation from the abv. Dang, this is sucha complex brew, my words cannot give it proper justice.
Bottom line: This is one classy and classic brew. If you ever see some around your neck of the woods, do not fail to grab some and if you can't find any locally, try your best to arrange for a trade or buy some online. It's too good to miss out on!! 984 charactersBitterbill, Jan 29, 2006

Aroma is massive and fruity, like raisins, prunes, and dried apple rings simmering in molasses and port wine. There's a good sense of yeast, subtle spice, and slightly tart over-ripe apple and red grape mustiness.
Flavor has all kinds of sticky dark fruit notes, mainly prune, raisin, and apple. It's not as sweet as the nose, and perfectly balanced by vinous wine nuances and a spicey hop finish.

Finish is so smooth that its difficult to believe there is 8% alcohol in it. Some wine-like flavors come through at the end. Easy to drink. Will try to find another bottle some time. 630 characterstgbljb, Jan 15, 2006
4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4What a beer. I have had a few of these in Belgium and brought back a few bottles as well and I am still cellaring those. This bottle I got from Kclinger's Public House in Etters, PA. Shared it with a few friends on New Year's Eve, what a treat.
The beer poured a nice rich dark mocha color with a nice tan head that stuck around for awhile. Yum.
The beer has some nice roasted caramel and fruit notes that I can't get enough of. I have to go back for a few more wiffs before starting to consume the beer.
The fruit character of this beer masks the high alcohol content but it is still there to remind you it is a dubbel and a damn good one at that. 
This is definitely a drinkable beer that I would like to have another of really soon. I think I will. 763 charactersggaughan, Jan 01, 2006
4.89/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512/29/05- Purchased at Jackson's Wine and Spirits in Lafayette, CA.
Presentation- 11.2oz bottle without any dating. Purchased over a year ago though. Consumed out of my St. Bernardus goblet.
Appearance- Dark caramel colored pour. A full inch of head which settles into a nice 1/8 inch rim throughout. Moderate lacing for a dubbel.
Smell- A dark roasted caramel malt base, followed by a sweet dark fruity smell. Plums and raisins mainly. Hits of anise also detected. Best smelling dubbel I have set my nose upon.
Taste- Almost has a grape jolly rancher kinda taste going. That combined with plums and maybe a taste of over ripe dates. Nonetheless it has a wonderful fruit barage going on. After the sweetness goes away it leaves a nice darker caramel malt flavor in the back of your mouth.
Mouthfeel- A tad thick and a tad creamy at that. Medium carbonation and slightly warming.
Drinkability- By far the most flavorful dubbel I have tried. I usually am not really a fan of dubbel's, but this one I would gladly drink all the time if it was readily available. Highly recommended. 1,096 charactersGClarkage, Dec 29, 2005
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a dark brown and leaves a 1/2in tan head. The smell is sweet fruits figs, plums, grape juice and honey. As I tasted this beer all the previous fruit flavors come out this has a great malty taste on the palate and is really smooth. As I let this beer continue to warm up I can really begin to smell and taste more of the fruitiness as well as the honey and cloves and it just compliments each other so well. This is one of the best beers I have ever had, it is well crafted and would pair well with some smoked gouda or any antipasto dish to really contrast against the sweetness of the beer. 607 charactersFranchise, Dec 04, 2005
4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5First review, so here goes...
Serving: Clean Three Philosopher's chalice. Bottle comes from a case of Westy (6, 8 and 12) purchased for Father's Day. Bottle was refrigerated prior to opening and allowed to warm to room temperature prior to enjoying.
Appearance: Robust dark brown ale with visible yeast and sediment throughout.
Smell: Incredible smell, so many different flavors mixing together.
Taste: Powerful taste, the alcohol is just under the surface but evident.
Mouthfeel: Clearly there is a party in my mouth and everyone's invited.
Drinkability: High alcohol inhibits session drinkability, but the brew is delicious (not as good as the 12, but close). 679 charactersakorsak, Nov 18, 2005
4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed again 10/30/08, same vintage: Did not seem to age very well. Still good, best to drink fresh. 
Ordered directly from Belgium. Poured into a Westy chalice.
A surpisingly dark brown with a lovely one finger light brown head. Very creamy head which lasted quite long. 
The smell was of dark chocolate, fermenting plums. Some farm qualities and yeast.
The taste is quite intense. Lots of dark fruit powering through the alcohol. Some brandy hints as well as liquorice. 
There is a fair amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a very nice dubbel. Would most likely be a good beer to cellar and let its character come through. Glad I have some more. 654 charactersatigerlife, Nov 11, 2005
4.47/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a clear, but thick deep mahogany and burgundy with a ecru head that starts fairly large but settles down quickly. Lots of lace on the chalice. 
Aroma has a definitive cough medicine alcohol pop and some sweet raisins and figs with just a twinge of dark bread and yeast.
Taste has some cofffee and chocolate with plum and dates being the most apparent dark fruit profiles.
Mouthfeel is smooth and lush yet powerful with an alcohol presence. Gracefully glides down the gullet and is delectable. This one had a far amount of age and really mellow but still tasty.
Drinkability is very high. all Dubbels should be this graceful yet powerful, still the standard bearer for the style. 688 charactersCRJMellor, Nov 02, 2005
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5For my 100th beer review, I thought the perfect beer would be a Westvleteren 8 that I have been cellaring for a couple years. My 11.2oz bottle has a date of 7.12.02 on the cap, making this beer 3 years old (or almost 3, if they use the dd.mm.yy format). Pours a deep red brown with a fluffy tan head in my chalice. Nose is spicy, with some deep caramel and some slight sour fruit notes. Up front in the taste is corainder, which is quickly followed by some caramel and a slight bit of sour fruit, perhaps brought on by its stay in my cellar, but it only improves the beer. Fascinating and complex. Very dry slightly bitter finish, and a highly carbonated champagne-like mouthfeel, with a lingering maltiness. High carbonation makes this beer extremely drinkable. 
An entirely worthy beer for my 100th review, I just hope my review is worthy of the beer. A shame this can't be (legally) purchased in the US anymore. 917 charactersColForbin, Oct 31, 2005

"trappist westvleteren" on top with their logo in the center. the number 8 is on the bottom of the cap encircled. abv is displayed at 8%. there is a best by date stamped across the cap: 10.07.
appearance: pours a deep, dense reddish-brown with crimson highlights in a chalice glass. nice light tan, creamy and tight 1.5 inch head. retention is good and lacing is excellent.
smell: aroma is sweet and lightly spicy. grainy and bready. 
taste: spicy and bready with an overwhelming alcohol flavor. almost like brandy or conac. there are touches of caramel and prunes. toasty graininess. yeasty bitterness in the finish.
mouthfeel: creamy smooth medium body with superb carbonation. very champagne-like. clean and rolls around nicely. swallow is velvet. my favorite aspect of this beer. 
drinkability: this is a nice sipper. alcohol slows, but is pleasant. tasty and the mouthfeel is truely a dream. goes down easy when you enjoy slowly.
overall: this is a very good dubbel. ranked as the number 5 beer in the world, i had quite high expectations. as good as this was, i was still hoping for a little more. i have two more that i'll have over the next two years. this brew is prime for maturation. 1,350 charactersPx2GrafX, Oct 15, 2005

The nose is brown sugary and even slightly mapel-like. Sweet dark fruits with puffs of alcohol abound. I even get a touch of cherry in there too. Very nice. Flavor is oh so nice. A ton going on here. Light dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar, slightly creamy. Shit. So smooth. This may be the best brew I have had. Hands down. The feel is velvet smooth with a very fine carbonation. Its moderate in thickness. I could sit and drink this brew all damn day. No hint anywhere of the 8%. Everything moves seamlessly into each other in the flavor, aroma and mouthfeel. Divine.

Smell is very vinous, sweet honey like aroma, chocolate, and dark cherries. Taste is alcohol and chocolate up front, rich malty middle, dark cherries, some grassiness/hay and a rich bitter finish. Mouthfeel is like butter, medium bodies, perfect carbonation, just slides down your throat. Excellent beer, as good in its own ways as Westy 12, and I'm glad I have another bottles kicking around. 527 charactersViggo, Sep 16, 2005
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5(Served in a chalice)
A-This beer pours a deep dark warm brown with a thick creamy tan head that last and last. It has a good carbonation of tiny bubbles that can only be seen on the edge of the glass. 
S-Lots of aromas blended together with a slight sweetness. The smell of caramel, faint chocolate, raisins and even a nice tobacco aroma. As it warms some smells of rose and cloves start to pop through. 
T- A nice toasted malt flavor is the base with lots of complexity but not as complex as the smell. Some raisin and clove notes in the malt but it finishes kind of dry with a slight alcohol warmth. 
M- medium mouthfeel with no astringency or alcohol warmth. 
D- This is a nice complex beer in the smell but it just doesn't have the same complexity in the taste. Very nice beer. 797 charactersrhoadsrage, Sep 08, 2005
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: Poured from 11.2 oz bottle into Watou chalice.
Appearance: Reddish brown, big pillowy head on top. The head retained really well.
Smell: The smell is the main draw for me. Completely intoxicating, with yeasty fresh-baked bread dominating, and fruity esters adding some character.
Taste: Very nice, but kind of more alcoholic flavor than the St. Bernardus Prior 8. They're both good.
Notes: This was the first time I tried Westvleteren 8. I set up a side-by-side comparison with St. Bernardus Prior 8 (served in another Watou chalice from an 11.2 oz bottle). The Prior 8 has been one of my favorites since I first tried it last December. Now I can happily say that I think it is marginally better than Westvleteren in my opinion. They are both exceptional, but the alcohol was just more present in the Westvleteren flavor than I would prefer. The St Bernardus seemed a little richer in malt flavor also. 928 charactersTurdFurgison, Sep 06, 2005

Pours a dark brown, slightly crimson color, with a tan, creamy looking head and some lacing. Smells mostly of raisins, a sweet, and lightly floral backgrounds. As it warms, I get more powerful raisiny smells. Taste is also quite raisiny, with hints of chocolate, coffee, and toffee- a stouty type thing going on. Very dry. Can't sense the alcohol at all, very sneaky. Mouthfeel is smooth and chewy and frothy- very nice. Drinkable, sure, to some extent- but I find there's something in there that would prevent me from being able to have a few of these. A solid beer to be sure, but I hope I can get another one and hold on to it for a few years... 829 charactersscooter231, Aug 26, 2005
4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Good lacing, good head, good color though not quite as vibrant as I anticipated.
The smell gets quite lively as it warms. Sweet, dark fruits... raisins mostly. I pick out some others but not clearly. A sweet smell and a pleasant one at that.
The taste is much more dry than the smell indicates, though there is a sweetness... like sweetend coffee.... perhaps coffee with a splash of raisin syrup. There's also a stouty/coffee like thing in the mouthfeel. Can't really detect the alcohol in the flavor, though I imagine it serves to liven up flavors.Very complex. This isn't my favorite dubbel out there but it's nothing to sneeze at. 635 charactersommegangpbr, Aug 26, 2005
4.12/5  rDev -8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Pours a turbid dark brown brew with a big tan head. Very nice.
Smell: The smell is probably the best part about this beer. Dark fruits, roasted malts and honey are the main attractions with some faint hints of alcohol near the end. There's something else going on there, but I can't really put my finger on it. Qiute complex and very good.
Taste: Roasty, caramelly, ... notes of honey bring a lightly sweet touch to the brew. Figs and other dark fruits carry the taste towards a slightly spicy and dry finish. Good but definitely not ground-breaking.
Mouthfeel and Drinkability: Excellent mouthfeel: smooth, creamy with a gentle and pleasant carbonation. The more it warms, the more the alcohol gets a pleasant, warming effect. Drinkability is good, as long as it's not too cold. 
Conclusion: Very 'dubbel'-like in character. It's a good and solid beer, but world class? Meh. 899 charactersPaddez, Aug 14, 2005

I don't know how they do it. There's no grapes in it, it is not a wine. Yet in the aroma and the aftertaste, the sample I recently had contained the most subtle but distinguishable GRAPE aroma and flavor. It was awesome. Grape soda anyone?
My sample was a deep burgunday color, almost brown. Left an awesome whisp of head all the way down a goblet style glass.
The aroma was of figs, caramel, clove, and of course, GRAPES.
The body was medium to full; almost silky. Very nice.
A very drinkable brew. You'd guess it was only 5% ABV. These people obviously know what they're doing. Respect. 682 charactersSixpoint, Aug 04, 2005
4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Opaque. Cloudy. Brownish. Two fingers worth of head. Thick lacing later on.
Nose has typical Belgian esters.
Taste is not near the 12, but still very good. Dark candi sugar noticeable. Typical Belgian esters stronger than in nose. Become stronger as it warms.
Mouthfeel is perfect at first. Not as good as it warms, but still excellent.
Goes down real easy, esp. for 8%.
Final thoughts: an excellent brew but don't fall prey to "you can't find it, it is sooo good." There are other dubbels out there that will keep you happy. 540 charactersGeoffFromSJ, Aug 04, 2005

I found two bottles with 05-05-2005 on cap ., at a drive in beer store that specializes in imported beer. $9.95 per bottle, but I figured , what the heck; all the raves that I have read on this forum, I might not find it again. 
Since it had been in a cooler of unknown temp, I allowed it conme warm up slightly before pouring. It poured a beautiful DARK brown with tan generous head that stayed forever. 
Smoooth!!! Alsolutely wonderful. Never have I tasted a beer so good. If the 12 is better, I might not be able to handle it. 
Caramel, raisins which very little if any hop taste. Alcohol not apparent but after this small 11 oz drink, I felt it. 
A shame that it cost so much, as I would have loved to drink the 2nd bottle, but I'll save it for a little cellaring and drinking later. 816 charactersbristerboy, Aug 03, 2005

4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The Westvleteren 8 pours from the bottle a beautiful stream of crystal-clear orange-amber. In the glass it appears darker as the volume of liquid increases, and it's mounting head of creamy, yellowed-paper foam rises. The head retention is excellent and it leaves a fortress of creamy lace about the glass. Carefully poured it remains clear, and it's a beautiful glass of beer with a dark-crimson-accented copper/chestnut body that reveals plumes of streaming bubbles within, and gleaming crimson, orange, and gold highlights towards the base of the goblet.
The nose is sweet and caramelish, with undercurrents of dark-skinned fruits (some dried, some fresh) and delicate spice; as well as the occassional waft of light alcohol.
In the mouth, it's light bodied with a lively zest due to it's effervescent, natural carbonation. As it warms, however, it becomes cottony soft and smooth across the palate; accentuating its maltiness and rounding it greatly.
Spice and caramel appear first on the palate, and leave last... but in between there's a wide variety of sugary sweet, spicy, and fruity flavors that appear. Sweet sugar-cookie dough that's been drizzled with caramel comes to mind first. Additionally, dark fruit skins quickly appear upfront and become more fruity and juicy (and even slightly vinous towards the end...) as it progresses across the palate, joined by a rising spiciness and balancing bitterness. A splash of alcohol is right on the tail (but not until you've had half a glass), and it finishes dry but with lingering doughy-caramel malt and sublime, peppery spice that fades to a muddy-spicy-dark fruit linger. 
Superb! 1,652 charactersNeroFiddled, Jul 28, 2005
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Obtained through a trade with GClarkage... thanks, Chris!
This was a dark brown, slightly hazy ale with a one and a half finger, creamy head that left tons of lace on my St. Bernardus chalice.
The aroma was fruity, with some spiciness, a little sweetness, and a touch of alcohol hovering over a dark malt background. Plums and perhaps apples?
The taste was initially of dark, slightly roasted malt. Raisins and plums then flowed over the taste buds. It was slightly vinous and a little dry. VERY good. Alcohol came through at the swallow.
Mouthfeel was smooth and creamy, but chewy and with the body needed to support the full flavors. The alcohol was present, but restrained.
Drinkability... well, DAMN hard to find, and a little too rich for session drinking... but would I have another if the opportunity arose? HELL YES! 839 charactersconnecticutpoet, Jun 17, 2005
4.44/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I am sampling a chilled bottle of this brew that I have had for at least 1.5 years. I am using a tulip/snifter for the sampling.
The beer pours a clear mahogany color with a large fluffy eggshell white head that foams up 3 cm easy. Leaves large latticework as it slowly recedes.
Aroma is fruity and spicy with apple and cloves and some yeasty biscuit scents. I also detect a bit of a hard candy sugary scent and banana.
First sip reveals a very fine yet super prickly carbonation that tingles my tongue and cheeks with each mouthful. Body is average and very smooth.
Flavor is toffee and caramel up front with some red grape and berry fruit as well. I also get a bit of non sweet bakers chocolate on the finish. 
As the beer warms the prickliness of the carbonation dies down a bit and some more complexity of flavor comes forth. a bit of biscuit/scone flavor develops and I also get a bit more spiciness.
Overall the beer is fairly sweet from start to finish and is very drinkable. I dont get any alcohol presence on nose, mouth or belly.
A well crafted brew for sure!
I would buy again if I saw it for sure! 1,117 characterssulldaddy, Jun 13, 2005

Aroma is of fruity esters, vinous, sugary sweetness and tart green apples. Nice rich caramel sweetness that grows as the beer warms. The nose is infinitely complex with various intertwining aromas. Grainy and grassy malt flavor with a bit of sugary sweetness, but not as much as in the nose. Some spicy, peppery hops mixed with some tarness and a very soft, lingering vinous quality that is especially evident in the finish. Mouthfeel is soft and pleasant with some mild carbonation tickle. Overall, vinous and dry. A little sweetness could go a long way. 630 charactersgimmehead, Jun 05, 2005
4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served in the 11.2 oz bottle into a St. Bernardus goblet. The color is the dark amber, nearly brown with a fantastic head retention 10 minutes after pouring and leaving a nice lacing on the glass. The smell is a tart plumishness with just a touch of alcohol in there. The taste has quite a bit of plum in it, with a slight tartness to it, along with a good bit of spicing and a touch of candi sugar sweetness to it, with just the smallest bit of warming alcohol. Mouthfeel is very nice and chewy. As for drinkability, this is surprisingly good and I could have quite a few of these, until the wallet ran dry.
As I did Westvleteren 12 as a landmark beer, so am I doing Westy 8 as review #700. I bought this almost a year ago, so it's had a good year to age a bit, and I like the results. As a nice dubbel, this is a fine one, with a good plum-like sweetness in the body that's just barely touched by hops, and a candi sugar sweetness and a tartness that completes the complexity of the beer. Quite nice, a fine beer, and now that the flow of these bottles are slowing down a bit, I'm glad to have had the chance to have this before Westvleteren is cut off to the US. 1,168 charactersbeergeek279, May 30, 2005
4.17/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A bottle purchased from John's Grocery (Iowa City) in Fall 2004 and consumed in May 2005. Pours a two-finger light brown head over a horribly cloudy and particulated mud-brown liquid (I poured in the sediment...was I supposed to do that?). Smells chocolate candy sugar, alcohol, sort of plumy, and a perfumy scent that carried over on the alcohol like spring flowers. Soft fruits like pears or ripe fresh strawberries. Yeasty, but also with a hint of tang. Interesting.
Taste starts with alcohol (damn, and I cellared this in hopes of clearing that up a bit) that settles to caramel and toffee. Some phenolic funk (appropriate for the style, but, yuck, I don't like funk). Fortunately, the funk is covered pretty well by candi-sugar. Licorice and black anise beneath and a still present gentle alcohol burn. What a great aftertaste. Yummy chocolate that settles to a delicate alcohol prickle on the back of my and and far back on the roof of my mouth. More tastes reveal, not quite a molasses, but more of a brown sugar. Alcohol mixed with this has a sort of brandy character. Md-thick body and a bit over-carbonated. 1,120 charactersmentor, May 30, 2005

Smell, especially as the beer warms, is a heady complex mixture of fruit (pear, raisin, and some banana) and Belgian yeast and malts. It was a shame to consume it and lose that aroma. Taste is mellow fruity candi mix of bubbly goodness. Mouthfeel is medium full and very satisfying. If this beer were reasonably available and reasonably priced, it would be a permanent fixture in the household. 467 characterspentathlete, May 22, 2005

I bought, and at $5.99 I expected great things. It did not disappoint. This is a wonderful an complex brew. Describing it is going to be a challenge but fun.
Poured a deep copper brown with a short lived wite head that faded to a persistent ring around the the inside of the glass and a few scattered clouds. I saved the yeast to add later.
Aroma was rich dark fruits (fig, plums rasins, dates) some yeast and powerful alcohol.
Taste was multi-layered and varied by sip. Some Cocoa, coffee, sour and sweet malts. Some toasted notes, charcoal, dark bread and alcohol. A short dryish finish rounds it all out.
Very drinkable. Worth the cost ? Yeah, sure. 782 charactersCitadel82, May 17, 2005
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Kind of funny that this beer has traveled more than the majority of my friends and family. She started off in Belgium, acquired directly from the source. A nice bed of foam and bubble wrap was made for her and her big sister in my backpack. I was determined to get them home safely, but with an entire month of wayfaring ahead of me I was uncertain if they would make it.
She road comfortably north into the Netherlands, where we lounged in world famous cafes and picnicked in Vondelpark. South to Paris for a night on the town before jumping on a train bound for the Cote dAzur. The beaches of Nice were a wonderful change of place for that dreary old monastery. A rickety old plane took her to visit some friends in Germany. Boring, flavorless friends in comparison to her. She was soon ready to go home. She grabbed at the chance to return to the French Riviera for one last glimpse at the those beautiful beaches and a final day in the sun. 
Her return to Belgium was a sad one, she knew she would never return again. 
The US customs agent was amazed by my tales of beer made by monks, "Holy smokes", he said "it's blessed beer!" 
How right he was, for the top to this fine brew was just popped using a papal bottle opener blessed by non other than JPII himself. 
My efforts paid off, my favorite chalice now holds a dark brown liquid topped with a creamy tan head. Held high to the midnight sun shining through my windows she shows deep ruby. A lasting head releases odors of all things dark and delicious. The smells are remembered as subtle once I begin sipping. Dense flavors dig deep into all corners of my mouth. Leaving unmatched richness lingering above, beneath, along and probably inside every last one of my taste buds. Although hefty, my chalice drains quickly. 
How wonderful that such a little piece of Belgian culture can find its way all the back to Alaska and be enjoyed with almost as much splendor as when it was had at De Vrede. 1,968 charactersMrNuggets, May 08, 2005

Dark, almost black in color. The foam it is not very thick, but it is beautiful, compact, beige in color, and quite persistent.
Smell: breadcrust, yeast. Very smooth. Less Alcoholic than the Roch8. Fruity (green apple). Cocoa and vanilla. More round, and probably a little better than the Roch8.
In the taste it it more "soft" again, more smooth. Again fruity notes (green apple again), with a very light astringency. Yeast, evident, with breadcrust. Vanilla. Then some liquorice, with chocolate nuances, slightly dusty, too. Carob.
At the taste the two are quite similar, but in the W8 the sotness is more evident. The Roch8 is more dry, more resolute.
Medium -high body, maybe just a bit lower than the Roch8.
Yeast again in the aftertaste, than liquorice and cocoa. Less resolute, and even less complex and long than the Roch8.
But in any case, two great beers. 913 charactersstcules, Apr 28, 2005

Over the last serveral months my tastes have changed, my nose has yet to pick up all that passes it and my palate follows suit, but overall this beer is sheer nirvana. There are some just as good, the Rochfort 8 which I am openning now may be one of them, the unibrue 11 which I finished earlier is close with its hit of plum but this beer is a punch in the mouth and all I can say is how on earth do they do it. Enough has been written about each of our experiences our tastes. Overall I get Plum with a hint of alcohol like plum wine yet subtle, nice bubbles with a short creamy head, a very very subtle brandy aroma and somthing sweet that stays on my palate like syrup, delicious beer may I have another please? 856 charactersKrovtar, Apr 18, 2005

The alcohol is clear and present and leaves a lasting burn as the sweet honey bitter chocolate and dry hop flavors linger on your palate. This beer is a world class and fully satisfying in one glass.

Smell: The nose is full of complexity, with hints of wood, fruit, and so much more. Candy sugar is also a huge component of the sniff.
Taste and Mouthfeel: Holy god. What a phenomenal tastying beer. So much complexity, yet it's all very balanced and very tasteful. The fruit notes are huge, with cherries, grapes and many other great characteristics. There is a sugary sweet quality to it that rounds off the incredible fruitness very well. The mouthfeel is full, creamy, and very smooth.
Drinkability and Overall: Well wouldn't you know it. This is damn near as good as the 12, if not better. It's smoother and more balanced, while not quite as complex. This beer is truly one of the world's best. Westvletern is the best of the Trappist breweries I've tried. The balance and complexity they achieve is unmatched by any other beer on the market. This is a remarkably smooth, tasty, complex, and delicate beer, that is perfect for any occassion. One of the world's best. 1,052 characterssantoslhalper, Mar 05, 2005
4.75/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Westvleteren Abt 8 pours up frothy & lacy into a Trappist-style chalice. The Irish Cream-colored head has such tightly-beaded bubbles that swirl-up nicely into a thick meringue-like top which sets-off the chestnut brown body perfectly. The aroma is truly magnificant with an explosion of dark fruits e.g. dates, figs, raisins & prunes and a gentle spice e.g. hot cinnamon roll, crystalized ginger & vanilla pudding that carries the sweet maltiness along with maybe just a kiss of Poperinge hops in the background. The flavor starts off bready & sweet with a delicous marriage of fruit & malt. The bitterness eventually dries out the brown sugary maltiness towards the finish. This is simply a World Class Belgian ale that packs just enough alcohol punch to remind you that it's worthy of your affection. Pair generously with a nice ripe Bruges cheese, crackers and fresh melon.

I have been waiting to try this for a while for some reason. Since having other dubbels recently I decided to see how this stacked up. The pours out a dark ruddy brown with a few bits of sediment floating about. About an inch of frothy tan head foams on tap that stays for some time leaving little bits of lacing around the glass. Aroma is strong with rip dark fruits and an underlying sweetness. There is a bit of candy like sugar to it and a good amount of spice. Very appetizing aroma you could sit and sniff for awhile. Sweet malt and a bit of sugar start off the flavor. A bit hit of dark fruitiness really carries the taste. A nice variety of spice it there as well. This ends on a spicy fruity note. Very flavorful and not to sweet. Just about full bodies this is as smooth and creamy as it gets. Simply marvelous feel to it. Insane drinkability as well, which could be a bad thing since it led me to drink it quicker than expected. A must try if you like dubbels. 1,066 charactersmeathookjones, Feb 11, 2005
4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours dark brown with an exeptional head filled with hills and valleys. The aroma is the most remarkable I've experienced: very earthy, brown sugar and cinammon (?). The flavor starts out a little boozy, but mellows once it aerates: cinammon, apple, pepper, brown sugar, butter and oolong tea with musty hints. The bouquet seems to fluctuate between a almost cleansing edge.The booze numbs the tongue, but oddly this one is far from a palate killer. I'm deducting the drinkability .5 just because I don't think this one is perfect, but it is damn near it. 555 charactersswamiswamu, Feb 09, 2005

Aroma: Belgian yeast aroma (with means banana, spice, and pastry aromas). 
Taste: This is a beautiful malt monster with a nice big bitterness to balance it out. Bananas, carob and yeast. I really like the fact that it is not very sweet and that the malt flavors dominate the fruity ones.
Mouthfeel: I love the long lasting flavor and full body of this monster.
Drinkability: This Blue Cap is similar to the yellow cap, however it is more balanced and less sweet. 519 charactersNaerhu, Feb 05, 2005

Aroma is sweet at first. Upon further smelling, numerous fruits show up in the malt profile with yeasty esters providing a very complex aroma. Grape juice and a whif of alcohol round out the aroma. The taste is right up there with the aroma. It is smooth, complex. I seem to find something different in every sip with vinous fruits dominating. This is one tasty brew. Mouthfeel is chewy at first, but finishes dry leaving a nice fruity aftertaste. Drinkability is insanely good for a beer this potent. 613 charactersavylover, Jan 29, 2005

 Pours a wonderful dark cherry mahogany color in a goblet glass. Wonderful foam, glass lacing. the aroma is superb, probably the best thing about this beer, a fruity, woody, malty smell. Very, very inviting. I might be able to make it through 40 days of lent on the smell alone. 
 First sip is suprisingly banal; maybe the hype had skewed my expectations. A bready, malty taste with a hint of alchohol and good hop balance. I served the beer too cold, but as I warmed the goblet with my hands the flavor profiles did come out more, again a wonderful malty blance with hint of raisins and alchohol. I found the balance to be wonderful and suprisingly the aftertaste to also be exceptional, the actual taste seemed a tad flat. Please understand this is an exceptional beer. I honestly have enjoyed others more, the St. Bernardus Pater 6 that I've had I think is superior. I also enjoyed the Chimay I had during the post-game chat more(Chimay blue). Still this is definitely damm good. I will try this beer again, but I will wait till I visit the monks in person, God willing, down the long beer -drinking road. 1,203 characterssublimesipping, Jan 28, 2005

Purchased for an outrageous price from a bar in Las Vegas (I rationalize it in that it is the ONLY time I have ever seen beer from this brewer for sale in the US- for that reason, I am thankful for the chance). I will not (I hope) let that reflect on my review.
Pours a medium muddy brown with moderate off-white head that dies quickly. Lots of dark muddy yeast at the bottom (I thought I was careful with pour- how did that happen?).
Aroma is semi-sweet, malty, milk chocolate (or is it chocolate milk?) with some dark fruits (cherry), toffee, and perhaps some coffee. A wonderful mix of aromas that I really like. It doesn't get much better.
Flavor- sharper than the aroma, more biting, but very pleasant. Flavor mellows out after a few sips. Alcohol profile is moderate-strong.
Mouthfeel is very full.
Overall, I really enjoy this, and am glad to have tried it. But to be honest, I don't get the hype. This is good, but a few others are equally good or better, in my humble opinion. 1,035 charactersDukeofearl, Jan 14, 2005

Lucky enough to snag a bottle at Spuyten Duyvil, for $12, which isn't bad considering you're at a great bar like Spuyten.
What strikes me about this beer is that it has all the characteristics one would expect of a great Dubbel, is so incredibly complex, but is so goddamn smooth. It's like great cooking. You should never be able to taste individual ingredients, just the great melded finished product. And this beer is a perfect example.
The major flavor components, to me, were chocolate, truffles, earth, clove, fig, a mixed bag of fruits and nuts. Drinkability is off the charts. 
Perhaps the most ringing endorsement: My non-BA buddy was with me, and said "I don't really like Belgian beers," then took a sip and said, "This is undoubtedly the best Belgian beer I've ever had." Word. 829 charactersbultrey, Jan 11, 2005

Dark eggplant pour revealing glints of purple light thru the base of the tulip, topped with a huge khaki sand colored head that sticks to the sides like it was painted on. This is perfection pour held to the light, some cloudy haze to the murky pour is evoked. Lace river patterns creep down the glass.
Perky brown sugar sweet and doughy, light scents overall due to a thick foamy cap that just wont quit.
First Swigs: Dark caramel red apple, cake dough. Confectioners sugar, cake icing. Slightly vinous with a dry clean finish. Almond extract, slightly detectable awl-kee-hawl. Fruity awl-kee-hawl. Fruity cornucopia, of pinapple, red apples and tangerine, followed by ginny, floral esters. 
Frothy yet gentle foamer. Nearly perfect light to medium body. Significant carbonation. Might not want to admit this, but this is gulpable! Also, craveable any night of the week.
Last Swigs: Gentle dark sugar air. Sheer delight. Intimidation factor: Done. 
Beer is good. Happy beering. 1,051 charactersblitheringidiot, Jan 07, 2005

Redid this one again 12/25/04. Done in a vertical X-mas Day tasting as a special treat from my beerbud! Thanks to the BlitheringIdiot for the Westy 6,8, and 12 that we shared for a Christmas day celebration!
-Dating 04-03-07. Dark rootbeery brown with a ton of huge, frothy, khaki head that finally reduced down to a thick ring at the edges. Saison scents in the spiciness. Banana, oranges, and cherries. So nice and dry. Smooth and creamy, but not heavy. Medium maybe. Carbination is present but not overwhelming. Can feel and taste the alcohol, very nice, I enjoy that. Tastes of vanilla and dark fruits, but not sweet. The Blithering one said he tastes almond extract, yep, you can sooo get that, and once you do, that is mostly what you taste. Can smell the almond a ton at the end. The flavors are good in this one, I find it much more enjoyable than the 6. Could djoy a few of these in a sitting quite easily. 1,385 charactersshapudding, Jan 02, 2005
4.69/5  rDev +4.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Mahogany liquid goes pouring into the goblet and raises a dirty white head that peeks just above the rim, supported by light carbonation. Head gradually dies, filming out across the surface, yet sticks moderately well. The beer is a globe of murk, but caramel-colored highlights show up at the edges. Smells of grape bubblegum come out of the bottle during the pour. In the goblet, the aroma is a bursting forth of purple fruit, especially plums, with a tangy, refreshing nosefeel. The overall suggestion is of elderberry dessert wine... with fresh-cut flower stems and VSOP cognac encrypted deep within. Now to taste. Simpler flavors than I expected, but the balance... I'll have to reconsider everything I've ever meant by "balance," because this is damn near a miracle. Chocolate malted milk, frosted grapes. Wheat bread and honey butter emerge along a separate axis. Wait, did I say this was simple? Maraschino cherries; exhalation brings tastes of amaretto. And then chocolate again: full circle. Slightly mucilaginous mouthfeel like whipped milk would be impressive in itself... but it's the alcoholic element that perfects it: never burning, it adds substance to the body, supporting the framework with its warmth.
Not quite a religious experience of a beer... just profound enough to have me licking the insides of my empty glass. 1,341 charactersNearerMyBeerToMe, Dec 16, 2004

4.97/5  rDev +10.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Yes, it IS worth $6- a bottle.
Into a big Westmalle goblet it looks beautiful but not like a sunset. It looks beautiful because of what the tobacco colored murk promises. A very active and rocky head with nooks and crannies, just like a Thomas' English Muffin.
Vigorous carbonation at first but the head does not overwhelm the glass.
The nose is cocoa and yeast with mild citrus notes, then caramel, vegetal - cabbag-ey, then cookie dough and bready malt. Later a bit port-like. Notes of black cherries get very strong as it warms. (On other occasions I have noted sweet yams, white chocolate, earthy and musty raisins, and malted milk.)
The taste is also very complex and fascinating. Cocoa, prunes, alot of fruit, currents of coffee, mocha and taffy, all with a slightly smoky finish. A mild bitterness lingers at the tail end - it all just gets better and better with every sip. A great balance.
The mouthfeel is very smooth and silky despite all that initial carbonation. 
Staggeringly drinkable.

4.91/5  rDev +9.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer poured into the chalice crystal clear deep amber brown and then the sediment decided to crawl out of the bottle and it became a chunky, hazy mess. The head was tan and small bubbled and fell slowly to coat the glass as the beer was consumed.
The aroma was deep, deep malt with caramel and dark fruits, namely raisins and prunes. Also present was a pineapple aroma if the nose was held back from the chalice and deep maltiness and dark fruits if held directly above the liquid surface. Alcohol enhanced the aromas and esters and a substantial bready/biscuit aroma was also present in the complexity of it all.
The flavor was malty with caramel and dark fruits, raisins and prunes/plums. There was also a wonderfule biscuit/breadiness to the flavor and a slight spice that added to the complexity. The deep dark caramel and candy flavors were deep and interesting and the alcohol presence added to the impression of all the flavors.
The finish was just even and dried out over time into the aftertaste but the deep dark caramel, dark fruits, and spice complexity last long into the aftertaste and linger. The body was medium full and well done. The alcohol was present in the warming, but was restrained every step of the way from start to finish and at no time did the beer reveal it's 8% secret that it kept so well.
50 cl bottle. Date code on cap 26.11.03. Price of $7.50 still on bottle. This one is still pricey, but beginning to become well worth the price of admission to see the show. 1,511 charactersGCBrewingCo, Nov 04, 2004

Foam keeps for ever though and the nose is litle hoppy and malty but more than that fruity( apricot like). Taste is full malty followed by fruit and ending very bitter and dry. One of my favorites! 442 characterspaterlodie, Nov 02, 2004

The aroma of berries rise from the glass.
My neighbors, when I was 8, had an old mulberry tree growing through a fence. We would climb the fence to reach the biggest darkest juiciest berries. I've never tasted anything quite as good until now. There is a pleasant bitterness near the end and the finish is dry and too short but then, anything short of forever would be too short.

Aroma: Some dark roasted malt with a slight bubble gum edge mixed with mild spices. Overall very mild and a touch coarse.
Appearance: Dark brown glass with a solid half finger of creamy froth of tan with an interesting ring of dirty brown where the head collapsed on itself. The head looks like it is settling in for the long haul, and it did. A smattering of lacing graced my goblet.
Flavor: First blush is the dark roasted malt, then some subtle complex flavors rush over the tongue. Anise, licorice, wet wood, grapes, powdered dry bubble gum, cola, and cocoa. Then, the dark malt rushes back in, mixed with all the flavors for a slow fading after glow. No alcohol tastes noted when chilled, but they slowly emerge as it warms.
Mouthfeel: Spritzy, a touch heavy handed with the carbonation in my view, but as the beer sits it settles down to a nice level. Very smooth with a medium heavy body, but no chew. 
Overall Impression: As the beer warms, so does my impression. Id start this beer out closer to 60 degrees to get the best effect. This is a complex, well made beer, but just didnt provide the existential, religious, sexual experience other Trappist beers have given me. It is worth seeking, but its current ranking of 6 on the Best of BA seems a touch excessive. Overall, a world class beer that Im very happy to add to my list.

4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5It's time once again to add a little beer to this mug of mine. Since the first addition to the glass was Westvleteren 12, I've decided to keep it in the family and go with Westvleteren 8, the best dubbel on the planet according to those whom I respect and admire.
Pecan shell brown that takes on more of an auburn hue with orange highlights when backlit. The voluminous toast brown head appears frothysoft, but is deceptively firm with a supernatural persistence. This beer is simply beautiful in the glass. Lovely aroma of heavily toasted caramel, dried fruit (apples, figs) steeped in brandy, and spice (cinnamon, allspice). The nose is complex to be sure, although it could be a mite stronger.
Wonderful flavor; delicious. My first impression is that, although there are many flavors to be had in this bottle, the beer is unquestionably a seamless, individual entity. As I drink, I actually have a mental image of a sphere that has multiple and varied components, but is first and foremost a perfectly smooth whole. My first bottle of exceptional wine was an eye opening experience because it introduced me to the concept of what I like to call 'volume'. This beer has an superabundance of volume. 
When a beer is this well-crafted, this flavorful, this complex and this nuanced, when it has a body that is at once full and silky smooth, each mouthful seems to completely fill the mouth, to have such a depth and breadth of flavor and body that it expands into three dimensions and push the boundaries of sensation. That, my friends, is the best way that I can devise to describe the loveliness that is Westvleteren 8.
The flavor profile is amazingly similar to the nose, but much more satisfying ('tis the taste, the actual imbibing that I crave). Sweet, dark caramel-toffee, brandy-soaked cherries, leather, good bourbon... combined with a grace and a lightness of touch that will make your very soul weep with pleasure.
Is Westvleteren 8 better than Westvleteren 12? My vote is an unqualified 'yes'. I could drink this every day for the rest of my life and not tire of its myriad charms. This is as soul satisfying and as life affirming as beer gets. 2,171 charactersBuckeyeNation, Sep 25, 2004

3.77/5  rDev -15.8%look: 5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Fairly dark brown in hue with obvious beige and auburn highlights; Id even say there is a suggestion of copper. I cant see through it. The head was russet in color and at the apex it was a shade over two fingers in height. The bubbles were tightly compacted. Head retention was excellent; it sat there motionless for a long while. A decent sized cap lasted the entire consumption. I am very impressed. It looks magnificent in my goblet. There was subsequent lacing; it was a bit spotty and unorganized. The nose is lacking in a major way. I am dumbfounded! This beer sat for 45 minutes once I took it out of the DFB (previously in the cellar). There is hardly a chill to the touch yet almost no aromas are found. The best I can say is the smells are largely neutral with only a suggestion of malt and the faintest trace of green apple. What a disappointment! There is no invitation. Hell, there isnt even an implication that it might be worth my time to take a sip. Unacceptable. The palate is much improved over the nose. Big whoop! The nose offered nothing, on the other had, the palate has taste. Still, I wouldnt call the palate noisy. It is flavorsome but nothing out of the ordinary for a Dubbel. There is really good maltiness depth; it is somewhat caramely, lightly toasty, sweet brown sugar too but more so chocolate notes. This aspect reminds me of coco powder (is that a compliment?). Astringency works well, there was even a few sips that were roasty. Again, good malt depth. Other flavors include hints of nuts, figs, green apples, a kiss of plum, peppery and then herbal qualities. At the finish there is a bust of alcohol, more fruit (this time dark), and powdery chocolate. As a whole I like the palate. It has turned the tide in Westy 8s favor. I wouldnt say this is the best Dubbel Ive had. But I would say it is tasty enough to drink again (price considering). Medium in body, modestly low carbonation but it works with this beer. The mouthfeel is fair, it does come off a little thin and, dare I say, watery. But Im not going to knock it. Well, Ive come to the end of my bottle. I can sum it up like this it is better than Chimay Red. In my mind, that is not saying much. Okay, maybe that is not totally fair. I think Chimay Red sucks. Westy 8 is good, just not noteworthy. 
Best before date of 31.01.06 stamped on the bottle cap. Purchased in Iowa City, IA for $9.00. 2,411 charactersbditty187, Sep 13, 2004
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From the first whiff, it's evident this is unique. A spicy conglomoraton of cinnamon, ground cardamom, Dr. Pepper, Raisinets, and Kahlua. Such intensity! Where the chocolate was obscure and more a ghost than a reality, coccoa powder dominates the flavor and texture of this beer. Abrasive carbonation and chocolate literally give the sensation of licking pure chocolate powder. Brown sugar. Bits of alcohol. And then there's tree bark or cracked peanut shells -- whatever it is, there's a natural, raw character to this beer despite its upbeat aroma. One of the best beers I've ever tasted. 590 charactersmarburg, Sep 10, 2004
4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Murky, rusty-brown body and a large, relentless, soft ripply beige head. Very rich, malty aroma - almost wortlike. Specific aroma notes include buttery roasted nuts, burnt caramel, barnyard and earth. Rich malty flavor followed by some very nice late bitterness. Also has a woody flavor and texture even. Mouthfeel struck me as a little chalky at first but that sensation subsided and gave way to a nice, big, smooth palate. Great stuff indeed. I wouldn't have pegged this as a dubbel. 485 charactersDoppel07, Sep 09, 2004
4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Looks just like it's big brother the 12%'er. The smell is more faint though meaning you can pick out more subtle smells, vanilla and raisin, chocolate raspberries, and a Vienna style smell. Flavors are just as many with toasted almond, vanilla, medium alcohol, overall has a much better balance than the 12%. Finish is of chocolate and coffee, reminds me of a fullers London porter in flavor and mouth feel. Overall much better than the 12% alcohol version, balance is much better. 481 charactersdanadeny, Sep 08, 2004
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours opaque deep brown with orange hints. Head is first rather large, off-white, well-laced, but diminishes to a thin cover. Sediments are dancing all over the glass. Aroma is an explosive fruity malt and yeast meadow. Tangy fruits are chewy (bubble gum, plums, pears, dates, banana, grapes, watermelon, grapefruit.. name it you have it). Huge malt hides smoky suggestions. Monstruous house yeast offers those chocolate bread characteristics a plenty. Enough complexity to lose yourself in. Incredible smooth rounded mouthfeel, silky texture, easy 5. Contemplative dry balancing bitter finish is very long and bear a small warming alcohol hint. Very worthy, I may prefer it to the 12, it seems better balanced(a bit less yeasty and less fruit juice like), but it could just be lighter. I owe it to myself to compare both side by side someday. 843 charactersRastacouere, Sep 06, 2004

Pours dark and lovely, but doesn't taste heavy at all. The fragrance is slight but rich. The taste is classic; perfect balance of savory sweetness and the epitome of precise carbonation. I'd drink this into eternity. Can I please be buried with a bottle?

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Rootbeer brown and eager to raise a tall cake of caramel foam. The aromas are reminiscent of a Turkish coffee, complete with cardamom seed, yet, at the same time, frail. Loosly wrapped with nutmeg, white raisin, dark rum, whole cream, spring branches, rainwater and black stones, the aromas are utterly seductive. 
It offers the kind of tannic grip one might associate with tamarind husks or date pits. Incense-like qualities increase through the pack passages to the sinus. There is an intersection on the palate with the resinous, herbal qualities of fine chocolate too. Raspberries and beeswax pull it toward unspoiled, comforting, Middle Earth fragrances -- up front -- while easy, sad, wilting, exotic perfumes of New Orleans close it. Full stop.
This is non-Grand Cru Grand Cru. 786 charactersputnam, Sep 05, 2004
4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 511.2oz bottle from Vienna Whole Foods, Vienna, VA. 
Poured into a Rapscallion snifter, formed a 1/2" creamy beige head over the murky (even wihtout yest poured in) chestnut brew, with red highlights. Foam is here to stay, apparently, not fading, and laces tremendously. Creamy, fruity aroma, with tremendous depth of scent, if that makes sense. Needs to be experienced to be understood, I think. 
Taste is sweet initially, with fruity notes, and then takes on a tart character. Mouthfeel is great, creamy and smooth, and drinkability is excellent, as you'd have to sit and drink a few before nailing down everything that's going on for the senses. Unfortunately, not so easy to find to have that many on hand, so this one bottle's review will have to do for now. Worth the search to enjoy... 797 charactersppoitras, Sep 04, 2004
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Appearance: pours a deep ruby/brown color with no obvious signs of co2. The head is an off white, and light textured with low retention. Lace is sticky and the head leaves a fine layer. Aroma: bread dough, with rummy fruits, preserves and a hint of alcohol. Flavor: A dry start with a sweeter middle -- caramel, raisins -- and a tart finish. Mouthfeel: medium bodied and effervescent with a peppery finish.
An interesting beer with a nice warming sensation and some relatively complex attributes. Lighter tan I had expected and surprisingly tart. Temperature should be over 60f. 581 charactersSeanChouffe, Aug 24, 2004
4.45/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Wow. Why did I wait so long to buy this? Pours a murky ruby with a huge rocky tan/brown head, that remains as a sticky lace. Aroma is of granny smiths, phenol, and some maltiness. First let me tell you about the mouthfeel: out of this world smooth medium body, with a touch of prickliness. Bitterness, phenols, and fruitiness present themselves as flavours. Toasted grains and molasses for malts. This is one of the best beers I've experienced, but unfortunately it loses points in drinkability due to price: $9.00 per bottle. Nice for a treat every once in a while. 566 charactersAdmiraldinty, Aug 11, 2004
4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Clear, deep burgandy tone. Nicely whipped head of light beige froth adorns the surface and has great retention and lacing ability. Initial blast of alcohol on the nostrils subsides as the sweet bubblegum and rock candy notes take over. There's also a raisiny, rummy characteristic on the nose. Very nice aroma. The flavors are complex, yet subdued. A graceful profile of dates, figs, plums, raisins, bubblegum, rum, toffee and chocolate. A spicy, alcoholic bitterness resides on the tongue after the swallow and detracts just a little from the overall drinking experience. Mouthfeel is light and airy. It almost melts in the mouth like cotton candy. Carbonation is appropriate. Good dubbel. 690 charactersBighuge, Aug 10, 2004
3.9/5  rDev -12.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Bottle dated 090902, courtesy of Unionmade, thanks! Pours into my glass a surprisingly clear medium shoe polish brown color, gushing with effervescent foam that quicky sizzles off leaving only a faint glaze of foam to stay. Aroma is very aged fruity, reminiscent of an English vintage ale, Fuller's comes to mind. Lots of plum, apple, and raisin in the nose along with a tantalizing caramely malt sweetness. First thing I notice upon tasting is again the carbonation, there's way to much fizz, seems to be overpowering some of the beer flavor. I actually found this beer to be much better on the second day when I was finishing the last bit in the bottle from the night before. Flavor has lots of complexity, I'm at first assaulted with brandied fuit, then some toasted malt blends easily into the fray. Finish has a nice tight bitterness that I didn't expect and definitely some alcohol warmth is noticeable. I don't think the flavor quite lived up to the nose, but it's tasty. Body is on the lighter side of medium. As the beer warms closer to room temperature, it seems to gain a lot more depth and charachter that wasn't evident when chilled, with more sweetness and maybe a hint of oak coming through. This is a respectable beer, definiely worth trying. 1,258 charactersmikeys01, Aug 04, 2004
4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Dark brown opaque color body with an intricate tan head. Small bubbles soft all the way yet arriving to a tighter capping on top. Thin, feathery lacing that shimmers as it rolls around the glass.
Smell is distinct pineapple with some apples and muscat grapes, sweet yet not overpowering. Alcohol lurks within but can easily be mistaken with the potent pineapple. Subtle clove spicing. As it warms, flavor explodes out into more tropical fruity sweetness and more cinnamon and cloves.
Taste is remarkably compact and quick. A quick burst of spice and overripe pineapple in the soft yet somehow slightly aggressive carbonation and then it is all washed away into the hop dryness that seems to last just long enough and not really seem dry either somehow, like the taste after eating a particularly crusty part of hard bread. Smooth, smooth bubbles seem incomparable.
Became easier and easier to drink as I drank. Dang good beer! 935 charactersdonnebaby, Jul 20, 2004

Pours a clear walnut brown colored brew with champagne like carbonation.
Smell is a Mozart symphony, tart yet strongly malty scent! Fruit flavors abound too, lots of apple, but grapes and cherries, lemon, Paw Paws, and pineapple!
Taste is as complex as the smell, or more complex. Mildly sweet with a complex mix of sugar flavors, like a gourmets caramel! Molasses, Brown sugar, apple juice, melon, and Maltose are in here. Fruit flavors are in this too, mostly apple but notes of plums and papaya, pineapples. Nutty flavors like Walnuts and Pecans, and almonds are in this too. The Spice layer has cinnamon and all spice as the main flavors, but not the only ones. Bit of black pepper bite and a hop bitterness in the finish. There are woody flavors in this too, mostly oak and cork.
Mouthfeel is full with champagne bubbles.
Drinkability is a masterpiece of a sippers brew! This cost $7 for one small bottle for a REASON! 966 charactersZorro, Jul 16, 2004

4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer is positively delicious. It has all the characteristics of a good dubbel but it isn't too heavy. The alcohol is there but not overbearing. The color of the beer is a deep amber/brown with a lovely tan head. A perfect pour generates the proper amount of head on the beer, and it has a good bit of carbonation to it. Upon first sip, the flavors are rich with a hint of fruitiness. There is a slightly bitter aftertaste that follows. Midway through the glass, the head is still there. Ohh this beer goes down easy. 521 charactersHopLeaf, Jul 12, 2004

Complex and getting better as the beer warms up a bit. Fruityness is there, but not overstated. Spiced flavors blend in well with the overall profile. Hop flavors are around, but remain in the background. A solid beer, but nowhere near the beer that the 12 is. 349 charactersscottum, Jun 27, 2004

4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5BubbleYum grapey on the nose and palate, W8 is more vinous even than many wines I've had, calling directly on beaujolais nouveau. Not jammy or concentrated, but fresh and Concord-like in its grape character. Even cold, the esters are loud and deep, though singular. 
Though this dubbel is almost cloying with fruit up front, it is also an exercise in grace. There are movements in this, as subtle and powerful as Beethoven's, that demonstrate what happens to beer, perhaps what happens even to us, when we leave everything to the gods. The fruit naturally calms down after coating the tongue with fresh-picked grapes. As it dries, an underlying cocoa emerges -- the chocolate we hope for with this style -- rich cocoa fresh ground from the bean. 
W8 shows you everything that goes into brewing a dubbel, from the deep malt for high gravity to the candi sugar to encourage attenuation, boost alcohol and thin the beer enough to make it drinkable. Once it comes up to room temperature, I'm left with a goblet of mocha -- almost oaky -- filled with Raisinettes. 
This beer never misses a step -- no sharp phenols, no laceless head, no inconsistencies: Nothing that could go wrong with a high alcohol Belgian beer does go wrong in this beer. The finish is eternal and ever changing -- back and forth with grapes, dark chocolate, unexplainable oak, and Hangar One Straight vodka (herbal in its alcohol). Even some spicy hops five minutes later.
Long after the conception of this beer, breweries around the world have adapted the dubbel and veritably changed my expectations of the style. Sometimes I want more body, sometimes more chocolate, sometimes a more phenolic nose. But Westvletern 8 is what the dubbel was. What's more, it actually tastes like it; there is a frank, honest rightness to this beer -- a confidence not usually bestowed upon inanimate objects. And so I take notes and listen.
Relax, relax.

The one finger beige head settles into a coat and collar of garnet fringed, foam lace. Sheet lacing effect is profound, as an excellent Belgian dubbel should be.
Aroma is subdued. Kiwi fruit and strawberry are up front, with a nice, spicy background of clove and allspice.
Mouthfeel is silky, full and rich. Carbonation is ideal.
Taste is pleasantly complex, with kiwi, strawberry, and mango fruitiness. Caramel malt flavors mingle with some noble hops to create a tasty balance. Finishes with a clean, Winesap apple note.
Drinkability is superb, as the alcohol is buried deeply in the complexity of flavors. This is certainly a Belgian classic, but at over $8 a bottle, I would prefer its big brother, Westy 10. 819 charactersmerlin48, Jun 03, 2004

Smells deeply fruity and sweet. Hard to nail down. Very pleasant.
Malts are very soft and plum like. Turn brown sugar sweet and ebb in to a slightly bitter texture of coriander. Cloves and apple linger in the background. Exemplary of the style. Notig clashes. Very harmonius in it's blending of flavor.
Silky is a good way to describe it's mouthfeel.

Aroma is quite sweet with some great mix of spice and malts. Taste is sweet with what seems like a mix between candi sugar and plum with some added roastiness.

The body is of an intense dark brown color. A nice smoky aroma. Very yeasty, the smell reminded me of some fresh cereal bread. Very nice.
The taste develops the very enjoyable bread aspect that appeared in the smell: the bread just melts in the mouth. Dark malts create a great flavor, which has some light raisin and winy notes, and maybe a hint of licorice. The hops are hidden and take time to appear. They combine harmoniously with the malts to create a very full, round and complex mouthfeel: thick but not chewy, hoppy but not bitter. Such a pleasure in the mouth. 663 characterstjd25, May 07, 2004

4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep auburn with thick but quickly dissipating head. What is left behind in chunky with thick fluffs in spots and nearly nothing in others. Fine little bubbles indicate the carbonation on the edges of the glass. 
Aroma is effervescent with apples, peaches, cherry pie with a yeasty tartness evident. This lively fruity blend is only accentuated by the yeastiness.
Flavor is crisp yet vibrant, alive with fruits, most noteably fresh grapes, apples, peaches, cherries, faint blueberries also. Finish is at first sweet with some sugary alcohol then quite dry leaving me wanting more.
Mouthfeel is slick and the body is fairly light considering the amount of flavour it is conveying, but is in no way watery. Carbonation lightly tickles the tongue.
I personally enjoyed this more than Westy 12. It paired perfectly with the first fresh homemade applesauce of the season! 886 charactersJables, Apr 25, 2004
4.62/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It pours a hazy ruby brown, like rich, melted milk chocolate. Two fingers of spongy light tan head lifts off, then settles slowly to a smooth, foamy Berber. Filigrees of fine lace snake around the inside of the glass. 
In the aroma, a mellow malt sweetness is initially paired off with a tart yeasty presence.Almost as forward are dueling notes of apple, and a more subdued chocolate. A bit quieter still is a thin vein of spice, coupled with indistinct citrus. 
Upon sipping, the first wave brings a soft malt sweetness which is soon outpaced by an intriguing swirl of caramel and chocolate. A rounded character of apples and cherries sits close at hand in the middle, in conjunction with a pleasant yeast tartness. Delicate spice hints arrive at the finish and linger along with a muted memory of cocoa. There are very brief and fleeting glimpses of an alcohol presence. This is complexity disguised as simplicity, and the flavor blends and balances artfully and cunningly. 
Medium bodied, it caresses the tongue and mouth as it flows langorously on by, coating and ebbing sensuously. The palate glows gleefully at the finish. 
It's so good, you might just wonder if you're worthy. But we are, every one of us. It's so well put-together that you could think it basic and miss a lot, but think and absorb a moment and the balance and complexity break the lull and amaze. Like silken sable on the tongue and flavorful splendor on the palate, this is something you could learn to crave. There's an ABV here, but you feel it in your head more than sense it in the flavor, so it's sneaky, but no matter, you'll have another, if you know what's good for you. The thing is, if this is only 8, will I really be worthy of 12?
I cannot wait to find out. 1,758 charactersFoxman, Apr 23, 2004

Light wine stained oak. Nice color. Mostly diminishing head that left very little lacing. Nonetheless, a very good looking beer. 
The aroma is wonderful. Raisins, plums, figs with many spices. Slighty bready with some apple skins glazed with graham crackers. Very complex. Essentially, it just smells like fresh granny smith apple juice. 
It's like dippin into a fresh bag of licorice. Fastastic flavor. Licorice laden plums and raisins, some chocolate notes, some spices, serious flavor. Wow. This is the most creamy, chewy and cleanest beer I have had in awhile. The flavor is magnificnet and that 11.2 ounces of beer could have beer the most savored liquid in the history of madkind. 
I am beginning to realize why people rave about this monastery. This beer was eye opening. The 8% alcohol tasted like 4%.
I'm glad I tried the 8 before the 12 because I am ready for that 12. 1,007 charactersCrosling, Apr 07, 2004

A caught a whiff of apples at the bottleneck on opening my 11.2oz bottle. It threatened to foam up too much, so I poured it gently. It's an earthy brown with a small head of fine bubbles that clings to the glass. The aroma is extremely fruity. Not floral hoppy. Plum, apples, cinnamon? On first taste, I have to get past the significant carbonation. Then I'm thinking of wine, maybe plum wine. Then chocolate. It gets dry and spicy towards the end. Subtle warmth at the end, way less so than Westy 12. Full bodied. So smooth. 556 charactersoggg, Mar 30, 2004
4.71/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Muddy brown trimmed by scarlet with a bountiful, dense, head of yellowed cream. 
The aroma is relatively muted, but beautiful with toffee-smothered raisins and bready plum pudding.
Sugar cookies are kissed by molasses. More of that bread-based plum pudding. Swirls of cocoa. Black pepper yeast hues, twisted with lime rinds and figs. Fruit baskets liquified, bananas and tangerines are foremost. Deeper, there are vanilla beans and sassafras stems. Gentle alcohol ebbs, kept mostly at bay with the collage of flavors. Bittered herb hop closure. 
The light-heartedness of the brew, belies its depth and strength. This is worthy of all praise. It's probably about the only dubbel that has ever had me truly screaming. 
I find writing this review difficult, as each keystroke takes my mind off of the immediate sensual experience and this is so far beyond the words above. It's akin to running an obnoxious play-by-play commentary on sex. 
At some point, it's time to shut the fuck up, and enjoy. 
So I will. 1,013 characterscokes, Mar 26, 2004
4.89/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Sampled at the Carlsbad Pizza Port 12 Hour Belgian Beer Festival. Westy 8 was what I drew on my first spin of the Belgian Beer Wheel. Sporting an opaque brown color and a creamy vanilla head that left a patchwork of lace, Westy 8 had a nose that just begged to be tasted. Abundant doughy malt, caramel, lots of dark fruits, a touch of chocolate, and a spicy hops aroma were all rolled into one package. Initially, the taste of candy sugar and well-ripened plums were evident. The malt backbone, with a bready flavor, stood up well and added to the pleasure. Chocolate and caramel notes carried on the sweetness but as I held it and moved each sip back on the palate, a lightly peppery, vaguely clove-like spiciness became more noticeable. The feel was medium-bodied, with a nice velvety creaminess and a drying finish.
Quite enjoyable. I just sat back in the sun with the glass to my nose, taking an occasional sip and relishing each one. A wondrous dubbel that sets the standard for the style, IMO. 1,000 charactersBoilermaker88, Mar 15, 2004

I tried the Westy 12 almost 2 years ago by trading and didn't really have the palate to appreciate it at the time. This being the 12's little sibling maybe I should have tried this one first. Pours a deep mahogany color with a very thick and creamy light beige head. The foam actually threatened to escape the bottle immediately after opening. The aroma is a nice bouquet of fruit, spice and sweet malt. Rich bodied and on the carbonated side, with a mild blend of dark fruit, malt, caramel, spice and a hint of sweet chocolate. None of the flavors really stands out, instead it is a nice harmony of flavors. The finish is very crisp and lively on the tongue. The flavor is a little more subdued in the finish, but this is still a well-rounded and exemplary Belgian. 854 charactersDogbrick, Mar 08, 2004

Pours a dark, earthen brown with a dense and rocky head. The head is an off-white to tan color and produces marvelous lace. 
The aroma simply bowls you away.yeast and malt, candy sugar, over-ripe fruit (apples, plums) and pine needles. Continental hops are subdues and well into the background of the smell. 
The taste and mouthfeel are simply luxurious.full, sensuous maltiness. Just the right balance of alcohol and mild, subtle hops. Spice and alcohol in the mid-taste. I love how the taste seems to bring out more aromas.sip, smell and repeat through the entire glass. Finish has a lingering spiciness and is incredibly smooth. 713 charactersSuds, Feb 21, 2004
4.05/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 433 cL bottle served at cellar temps in s St. Bernadus goblet. Bottle cap indicates a best by date of May 24, 2005.
Appearance: Murky, muddy brown liquid topped by a smallish offwhite head, which settles to a slight layer of foam after a short while. 
Smell: An intriguing mix of anise and green apples largely. Some caramelized sugars kicking around, too.
Taste: Sweet caramel malts and candi sugars. Prominent anise flavors, some modest tart green apples as well. Dusty black pepper notes on the finish.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied for the style, with an almost characteristic cotton candy presence on the palate. 
Drinkability: A rather enjoyable and well-made little brew. The anise flavors come close to overpowering the flavor profile, but thankfully back away at the last minute. I could see myself having a few more of these were it not for the pricetag. 872 charactersManekiNeko, Feb 20, 2004
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Settles a deep dark muddy brown color, pours out a softer brown with lots of brown wet dusties and chunks from off the bottom of the bottle falling into a super gorgeous tall head of cream colored girth thats thick, puffy and whipped smooth. Lacing appears in fast dripping sheets and leaves behind some larger ink blots. A very thick skim snugs the top during the entire glass. 
Aroma is a bit subdued but is layered with some nice subtleties with utmost positioning yeastiness thats creating some major fresh yet dried wood characteristics upfront mixed with dirt. Very dry overall with hints of dried, even roasty, lemon, pine, and sugars.
Taste has quite a mixture of things within, mostly dryish with some moderate dry wood and dirt mostly. That levels off and intermingling nuances of dried fruits, chocolate notes, and light mild spices fill in adding interesting little delicately refined yeasty layers which all maintains one very incredible smoothness. There's just a small twinge of hops but never is it in control or ever present for long. Its squeezed in there with some of the woodish yeast tones. Overall the flavors are mellowing and mild with very subtle tones and really becomes a treat as it warms. After a while I didn't even realize I was drinking a beer, it seemed more like cold Japanese herbal tea. Smaller chocolate tones appear a wee bit more as it warms with a waffer cookie dryness. Outstanding... very smooth yet thick with a mellowing full mouthfeel and easy-on-the-palate dryness that has a nice carbonation thats not overly lively. One very well put together beer, it went from wood and earthy to slightly fruity and spicy to chocolatey and always stays dry. Quite a nice cup of a tea, I mean glass of beer. 
Was able to get this nice brew courtesy of Gusler, Thanks! 1,808 characterstavernjef, Feb 09, 2004
4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A dark-ish red and brown mélange with little head and no other action. Despite the latter, the color was clear and shining, a tough feat with the darker brews. 
Has a scent of graham crackers that open to a more wheaty, rough cracker smell. Abundant grapes and cherries wrapped in sugar sauce, as well as soft florals of Continental hops. Warms to deep and sweet caramelized scents, akin to maple syrup.
This beer was ever-changing through the sipping session. Obviously grape-like, with fruity flavors sliding between cherries, apple, and melon, it also showed the requisite highly-complex mash of malts. Warms to a rum-like sense of warmth and rosy-ness and a whiskey-like sense of rough grains. Slight cream flavor through out. The winning-point is in the long and stellar finish, a noble and austere ending full of almost licorice notes, the soft drying of Continental hops, and a subtly and softly melded roasted quality. Mouthfeel is smooth, slick, and with just enough carbonation.
Very easy to drink, though I think this beer needs some aging. My bottle was 6 months old and still required some settling and concentrating (felt the same way about their 12, too). 1,180 charactersnomad, Feb 05, 2004
4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bought at 'de bier tempel' in Brussels.
From a label-less brown bottle, with only a discrete blue cap, sint-sixtus abdij, westvleteren 8. 
I'm not going to give you my ever unaccurate descriptions. rather my, uh, feelings about it-if descriptive, dont rely on them. 
A proper, mysterious dark caramel pour, completely opaque; dirty with small chunks of debris within (yeast?) which are actually in order, according to guides to belgian beer. A sweet, pleasant, inviting smell to be a soft prelude to the taste. By now, its comforting bittersweet combination is savoured, and invited as tried. excellent thick body. The last sips with this debris I described are the most flavourful and pleasant. Discrete for the alcohol, very drinkable, if only for the price...
Definetly one of the best beers I have ever tried. To my luck, though, I still have the '12' on standby--not for long. 893 charactersAndreji, Jan 23, 2004
4.82/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Turbid brown with orangy-copper highlights underneath a nice thicket of beige colored head. Good lacing and healthy carbonation (I've experienced a flat bottle before, kind of a bummer when forking over $10 for one beer). Lots of protein coagulation and yeast in suspension (consistent with some trappists). Aroma is outstanding. Healthy aroma of dark candi sugar, yeast, dark fruits like candied figs and dates, expensive chocolate, hops, peat or dirt, and, strangely enough, botanical, like a humid greenhouse. It gets even more complex after that. It's rather difficult to describe the taste, a lot going on at once and in singularity. Kilned candi sugar is obvious. Cocoa, toffee, sugarplum, maple, cardboard, dark chocolate with a slight touch of anise and ginger to "round it out". Silky, effervescent and smooth. If I were rich, I'd have a stockpile of it. 863 characterscrookedhalo, Dec 29, 2003
4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served at about 55F in a Westy silver-rimmed glass. It pours a deep and dark mahogany with a substantial beige head and some trailing, sliding and sticky lace. Sweet malt, fruit soaked in rum, hops, yeast and a mild pine scent make up the complex aroma. The lightly herbal malt features caramel and candy sugar sweetness in a rich velvety, nearly oily body. Beautiful symphonies of flavors mingle and harmonize. Ripe banana, plums, vanilla, fruitcake, coriander and cloves vie for attention within the dark rum-like warming alcohol background. Piney esters and an ever so slightly camphor astringency provide more interesting tastes. This wonderful brew pairs nicely with Molanari salami and Cabot Vintage Cheddar, and as can be imagined, any gourmet offering. Pure bliss! 772 charactersBeerResearcher, Dec 27, 2003

The flavors are simple, clean and elegant, much like the design on the bottle. The 8% abv is very well hidden, though this ale provides a very calming, warming quality that is very agreeable. Outstanding and very highly recommended. 418 charactersstingo, Dec 27, 2003
4.77/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured a slightly murky amber with bits of yeast. Thick, creamy and rocky beige head. Complex aromas of sticky fruits all over the place. Brown sugar, dark rum, alcohol and that lovely tart smelling Belgian yeast.
Great flavors. Malty sweet, bready and fruity. Tasted like a dark fruitcake soaked in rum and brandy with bananas thrown in for good measure. Definite alcohol presence, but not in a bad way. Nice tart yeast to cut the richness.
Rich, full medium bodied mouthfeel. Exceptionally drinkable for such a rich beer this high in alcohol.
Another heavenly (sorry) libation by those monk-type people! 608 charactersrkhaze, Dec 25, 2003

I hoped it was the yellow cap, but it was blue. I knew I had to get it. ZING!!! $5.49 for a single 11.2oz bottle!! Oh well.
I do like the label on the bottle. Simple but elegant. Not flashy liek other brews. Didn't see a date like others did, but with this type of brew it isn't an issue. Small film of sediment on the bottom. Poured a nice brown with a tan, fizzy head. 
Smelled fruity and of malt. Most definitely a yeast-like flavor in this one. Yeasty flavor prevails. There is a tinge of hops but not overwhelming at all. The 8% abv is very subdued in my opinion.
I found this beer very drinkable. Good sipping beer if you don't mind swinging the price for such a small quantity. Maybe I need to look around and find it cheaper, I certainly would love to have it again. 898 charactersAbePhroman, Dec 16, 2003

Aroma is musty with notes of caramel, chocolate, dates, and some herbal notes. Flavor is equally complex, with a slightly sweet start, some notes of toffee, dates, chocolate, musty yeast, some unidentifiable spiciness, and a lingering herbal bitterness in the finish. Moutfeel is smooth and medium bodied. Utterly drinkable, especially considering the high ABV % of this beer. This is a true gem! 492 characterszerk, Dec 15, 2003

The aroma is similar to the Westy12, spicy with fruit notes and a little yeast showing up as well. The mouthfeel here differs though and I found it to be more of a Tripel like mouthfeel. Very effervescent and crisp. Unfortunately this does not have the big flavors of the 12. Actually a bit bland in comparison. Still a decent ale with a good malty body and a subtle spiciness. 482 charactersBierReise, Dec 09, 2003

Aroma of plums smothered in dark chocolate, with a hint of bready yeast and a slight spiciness. Complex yet clean. Surprisingly, there is a noticeable bitterness in the flavor. A sweet malt and alcohol backdrop support the fruity notes and a decent amount of phenols. Lingering bitterness with a slight sugary sweetness. The mouthfeel is decent, but perhaps a bit on the thin side. Drinkability is good, although I'm not sure I'd want to drink this one very often. This is a decent beer, but there are many, many better in my opinion. This one's pretty to look at, but nothing special to imbibe. So let's see, a bottle of this or a sixer of SNCA? This will stay on the shelf almost every time. 791 charactersaaronh, Dec 05, 2003

It smelled fruity and spicy- like cinnamon/nutmeg dusted apples perhaps.. It tasted a thousand times more than it smelled. I looked at my boyfriend and said with wide eyes it's like those red spiced apple rings! But better! That is the best way I could describe the taste- red spiced apple rings. Mouthfeel was perfect and drinkability is therefore great. I can't wait til I can afford to get this again.... yes I only bought 1 bottle but it's still a bit too pricy to get too often. For now the experience lingers in my mind.... 614 characterserica, Dec 02, 2003

Malts are fruity and complex; oranges, plums and banana flavors compete with bready yeasts. Rich complex flavor. Very smooth. The flavors improve and the beers mellow as it warms. It much better at 68 degrees that 58. This is a nice beer, very drinkable. But the 12 is so...much better. Very drinkable and worth trying. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly sweet. 524 charactersbeerguy101, Nov 30, 2003

Nose is stunning. Bready with some slightly biscuity malt support an incredible array of candied fruit (cherry, lime, raisin, prune) and rum/spirity notes.
Great flavor. Very fruity and complex all supported by wonderful malt. Well-balanced, not remotely cloying, and showing no alcohol. Very long finish.
Carbonation is excellent, cutting through the richness without becoming obtrusive. Imminently drinkable, but worthy of deliberation and contemplation.
All other Trappist offerings fail in comparison to this one for me. Brilliant beer and worth every penny. 643 charactersRealale, Nov 17, 2003

4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Special thanks to Elemental for getting this one for me.
Pours a deep mahogany with the slightest ruby tints when held to the light. Amazing head made of smallish to medium sized bubbles that are cream colored. Head lasts all the way through the beer, but no lacing belies this.
Aroma is that of a single malt distiller. Rough, musty timber, warm peat, and sour tang of the distiller's feet. Entering the mouth, its almost creamy. Smooth sensation then follows with sweetness and tartness of a fruit, but mouth fills with the body of malt. The expansive feeling in my mouth is quite amazing. The carbonation, alcohol, and body all make for a full experience. The mouth is left dry and sweet, and definitely ready for another sip. My own sense of duty must override my mouth's desire for more. I've managed to make this last for 45 minutes though, and its just getting better. 881 charactersfreed, Nov 06, 2003

4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Sampled March 2004
A bready, yeasty aroma emanates from my glass as I pour this murky dark brown beer. It is topped by a thin light brown head. The aroma has a typically Belgian spicy (pepper), aroma with a hint of alcohol, and dark fruit (raisin being dominant). There is a hint of rum in the nose as well. The taste is dry, dusty and spicy. The fruit character is almost non-existant. As the beer warms up, a bit of sweetness becomes apparent. This beer seems very musty and dusty, for some reason. Quite complex, with some interesting spiciness that is all over the place; notes of pepper, clove, cummin, cardamom, and all spice. I actually like this quite a bit, though it really needs to be served on the warm side of cool to really shined.
Sampled Spring 2001
The offering smelled of dark candied malt accompanied by an appropriately dark brown color. It tasted quite good, sweetish with complex notes of malt and caramel. There was an intricate aftertaste that was complemented by a bitterness that was not from hops, but coated all 360° of the back of my mouth. The bottle, in a tasteful way that ran counter to modern commercial methods, was completely bare except for the bottle cap, which designated the brewery and the title 8°. 1,247 charactersGueuzedude, Nov 05, 2003

Appearance: A dark brown pour with a very rich looking tan head.

Taste: Now this is what i was waiting for! A lovely creamy, rich body with wonderful sweetness and complexity. Hints of cocolate, black licorice and caramel reign supreme. Underlying spice gives the beer an extra kick. 
Mouthfeel: Creamy and rich. A full and satisfying beer.

This has everything in the right place for the style-how would/could it be better-only if it were more readily available. The beer pours a massive head in which underneath lies a very dark brownish red life substaining beverage. Aromas are at once complex, inviting and very unique. The beer is richly malty, yet softly fruity at the same time. The balace here is perfect! In the mouth a triumph of complexity! Rich and malty with deep roasted flavors followed by mildly assertive bitterness. Extremely subtle fruitiness comes enveloped in flavors the finest bitter chocolate. The alcohol, while strong is so well integrated you hardly know it's there...until all the sudden you do! This may be better consumed in a soup bowl..it'll last longer! This is like drinking a beer version of Chateau Margaux ! A real treat! 871 charactersmoulefrite, Nov 03, 2003
4.95/5  rDev +10.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Presentation: An unlabelled brown 33cl bottle, that wangled its way Westward directly from the St.Sixtus Abdij. Without a label, all of the important information is contained on a black crown cap with a silver center that has a computer inked 15-04-06, seems like Im early for the party again. Dark blue lettering states Trappist Westvleteren 8, Bier Cat.S, Alc. 8% Vol.. Classically understated. 
Appearance: Dark brown, lots of streamers fill the glass at first, they continue throughout the drink. Beige head looks fucking impressive, rocky at first, it settles slowly to an even smooth silky mass that leaves an intricate looking lace. An impeccable appearance that is very hard to fault. Superb conditioning.
Nose: Incredible that such a fantastic rainbow of odors can come from just one glass. Molasses and brown sugars are immediately detected. Malts are there on closer inspection. Dark fruits, raisins, dates, rum and figs are all there when you concentrate harder. Chocolate, toffee and other dark fruits may well be in my imagination  or is it just the fact that I am awe struck.
Taste: I am never ever failed to be anything but totally impressed by this beer. I always take the 12 when offered the choice. Sadly this means I constantly forget just how damn good this bloody beer is. The beer delivers all of the flavors the nose offers up for purchase, but the way they are skillfully blended must be every brewers dream to achieve or replicate.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, silky, rich and sinful. Other beers are mere 2-stroke engines when compared to this beautifully engineered, smooth powerful V12 engine. Put the foot down on this one and you will not be disappointed by its road handling.
Drinkability: Quite simply, Exceptional.
Overall: On its day, or maybe with some aging, this is equally as impressive as the Westie 12. I just wish the experience would last forever. This beer certainly lives up to the hype. DO NOT let this one pass if you see it, and whatever you pay for it  it is well worth the money. 
Without a shadow of a doubt, one of the Very Best Beers available in the World today. 2,137 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Oct 28, 2003

Even held up to a bright light, you cannot see through this beer. Ive held off, at least initially, in pouring the yeast on the bottom. 
As noted, the head is thick and rocky, with tremendous staying power. Leaves a thick lacing down the side of the glass. 
Remarkably understated aroma, light malts and dried fruits and raisons, again very muted.
The taste is remarkable. Nice almost smoky taste starts us off, flowing directly into an extremely complex burst of fruit flavors, red wine, prunes and plums. The aftertaste is subtle and clean, with a bit of nuttiness. Nice alcohol warmth.
Very smooth and exceptionally easy to drink. Well worth what I paid. 783 charactersjackndan, Oct 20, 2003
4.89/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer poured a big white/tan head with a dark brown body.
The nose was simply amazing. Phenols, grapes, dark malts, dark plums, raisins, mild chocolate, caramel. Very port like.
The taste was also just as impressive. Medium bodied with a very fine carbonation. Sweet with lots of dark roasted malt flavors. Dates, raisins, chocolate, caramel, toffee, and dark bitter cherries as it warms. Definitely a slight citrus flavor like lime peel or grapefruit juice. A smooth woody flavor as well. Oak, faint tobacco or smoke, almost like the inside of a charred barrel. It had a very faint earth hop flavor, but mostly a soft bitterness and light alcohol warmth.
This beer took its time to fade and ended with a long bitter and raison finish.
Basically this is an amazing beer. Beautiful combination of all the dark malts and bitter fruit flavors. All in perfect balance and harmony. I actually like this better than the abt 12. Almost worth the $8 a bottle. 967 characterstaez555, Aug 22, 2003
4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance  Gorgeous, deep brown color with a gigantic whitish tan head that laced every square exposed inch of the inside glass.
Smell  Strong aroma of molasses and fine brown sugar. Some malt as well, and a few other things that I couldn't pinpoint. The smell says its serious.
Taste  This is a hearty brew. The initial taste is almost like a good single malt scotch. It is so sweet, but a sophisticated sweet. I dont know what it is, almost like a good rye or barley flavor. The malt is there, too, along with a presence of alcohol and even a bitter, slightly burnt, dark flavor. This beer has it all, and it's all well executed.
The finish just keeps going. Its almost like syrup  it lingers in your mouth forever. I cant say enough about the flavor of this beer. Im a big fan of the (properly done) darker European ales (weitzens, abbeys, etc) and this one just blows me away.
Mouthfeel  I thought the beer was undercarbonated ever so slightly (for my taste), but typical of the style. The smoothness though was beyond reproach.
Drinkability  This is its strong suit. The 5.0 that Im giving it here under represents my enjoyment in drinking this bottle.
Comments  I had never heard of this beer until I went into a store and, for no real reason, tossed it in my cart. When I logged on I realized that I may have grabbed a diamond in the sand, and I was right. 1,408 charactersRoyalT, Aug 08, 2003

This apparently belongs to the style "Belgian Abbey Dubbel", but on consuming 1/2 of one small bottle, I know now that this beer puts all the others to shame! There is fruit, and dazzling hops, and malt, and tantalizing texture, but the thing that sets this apart, if there is such a thing, is unknowable.
 I had a Belgian Abbey Dubbel tonight from a very reputable source, and it was nice, but not magical.

Smell is diverse with notes of heavy malt, yeast, apricots, and mild alcohol. This is a very tasty beer -- notes of raisins, sweet malt, very subdued hops, yeast, and alcohol are all there. Mouthfeel is superbly smooth and while easy to drink, it's a bit too rich to deserve a perfect score.

There is a wave of flavors consisting of lightly sweetened fruit, faint yeast and an array of spices and a calmly warming alcohol. This is a light to medium bodied brew and drinks down way too easy!

This one has quite a bit more head than the Rocheforts and the Westy 12. The aroma is great - smells of fruits with an undertone of alcohol. The taste is wonderfully smooth - must like the Westy12, but the taste reminds me a lot of the Rochefort 8. This is one of the best beers I've had along with the others mentioned above. If you've not had this, it's worth the high price. It leaves a great fruity taste on the palate after drinking. I could drink this beer all night if it weren't so expensive. 594 charactersclvand0, May 10, 2003
4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This was my first Westy. It was absolutely superb! I love the caramel and fruit tastes and aroma. This may be the priciest beer that I have bought, but it is an exceptional treat. It even caused me to fork over $180.00 for a mixed full case to be shipped from Belgium of the 12, 8 and blonde. Truly nirvana! 307 charactersBoto, Apr 26, 2003
4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My first Westvleteren brew...I've been looking forward to this!
Appearance: Into my Westy chalice, it pours a beautiful reddish-brown, mahogany color with a touch of haze. The head starts around an inch thick and sticks like a champ. Fantastic lacing on the glass.
Smell: Damn...what an aroma! As complex and fruity as anything I've ever encountered, this brew has toffee, grape, fig, raison, and plum simply jumping out of the glass. There's also a light spicy note in there, as well as a bit of a phenolic character. Adding the portion at the bottom of the bottle imparts a bready character from the yeast.
Taste: Amazing rich and smooth with tons of fruitiness. All of the characteristics of the aroma are here: toffee, fig, raison, plum, and grape. Very sweet, with a nice kick of spiciness towards the end. I taste a phenolic flavor, but it's in the background. There's a touch of bready and yeasty flavors towards the end of the bottle, from the slight sediment. Finishes creamy and warming with an alcohol note. Great integration of flavors, as the balance between them is incredible.
Mouthfeel: Medium in thickness, with a smooth mouthfeel. Very creamy and round on the palate. There's a touch of alcohol dryness on the swallow.
Drinkability: Damn good, if you can find it! This brew isn't available in my area, so this is quite the treat. I could drink a few of these over the course of a night, sipping slowly and enjoying every drop. I actually prefer this over the more well-known and stunning Abt 12.
A huge 'thank you' goes out to StevieW for including this heavenly brew in our trade. 1,617 charactersMJR, Apr 16, 2003
3.42/5  rDev -23.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours with a light cream-colored head over dark hazy brown liquid with some particulate matter floating about. Nose is of raisins, a little port wine, dark fruit. Taste is quickly sweet with some phenolic character present. Then a bit of fruitiness followed by hop bitterness and an alcoholic note. Finishes more sweet than bitter. Nice, but not worth the $6 I paid for it. 373 charactersbeerluvr, Mar 29, 2003
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Beautiful brownish-bronze color. Moderate head with vigorous carbonation bubbles streaming up. Aroma hits you from a foot away - dark and sweet. Without a doubt the cleanest and most crisp Belgian I've come across. The malty goodness races across your tongue so fast that you want to grab it and hold on to savor. Slightly tart at the front and amazingly dry. Glides away at the finish with just enough bitterness. Drinkability factor is off the scale. 452 charactersBrent, Mar 19, 2003
4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The difference between this and the 12 is quite easy to see after just the first sip. This is a great brew, but the 12 is head and shoulders above it. 
The brew looks absolutely beautiful in my goblet. A deep, dark amber color with a tight head that retains very well. Yeasty, spicy nose with some dark fruits and light chocolate. Smells very similar to the 12, but with less alcohol in the nose. 
I know I keep comparing this to the 12...but I have to. This seems to have more of a warming alcohol presence, despite the significantly lower ABV. The alcohol is prevalent at the end of each sip, however, I was a bit disappointed in the complexity. I want more. Compared to other brews though, this is a hell of a brew. A mild hoppiness blends well with the fruity and spicy flavors. When cold though, there is little flavor to this brew. Definitely must let it warm to truly appreciate it. 8 is great...but its no 12! 923 charactersIrishRedRock, Feb 25, 2003
4.78/5  rDev +6.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I had this beer a week ago and knew this had to be my 100th. This is without a doubt the best Dubbel I have had. A dark brown, almost reddish color with an unbelievable head that needs to settle before tasting; not an easy feat. Sticky lace on the glass just adds to the experience. Dark fruits, plums, raisins, black cherries, dominate the aromas. The same smells are dominate in the taste, as well as some bready yeast, which adds to the mystique. Unbelievably smooth carbonation, high yet drinkable. Creamy, silky mouthfeel, easy going down, very, very drinkable. I mentioned this as a quest, now the 12 is on my short list. Excellent beer. 643 charactersHopheadEd, Feb 17, 2003
4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer pours to a very dark brown like charred wood. It is topped by a massive off-white foam that wants to stay for a long time without paying rent, and leave a lot behind after it dies to a lace. When you pour the whole bottom of the bottle, there is a dark blob of sediment in the middle of the head that is kind of scary looking, but the flavor was not affected in a negative way by the addition of the full contents of the bottle. 
The sweet cherries and raspberries get to you first. Other aromas that come are wheat bread, coffee, and a little bit of chocolate. Yeast is also present, especially after you pour the entire bottle into the glass. I chose a goblet for this one, and I found it to be to be a good choice because I was able to pick up a lot of the aroma with a bit of swirling. 
The sweetness in the aroma is not nearly as strong as it is in the aroma. Most of the flavor is dominated by roasty flavors of toast and coffee. The alcohol is present, but it is not overpowering at all. 
The body is very rich. It is very crisp, and it has a bite that stays with you right till the end. 
This is another great Westy. A complex brew that would appeal to anyone. 1,190 charactersElGuapo, Feb 16, 2003
4.55/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.533cl brown bottle with no freshness date to be found, thin layer of sediment on the bottom of the bottle gets stirred up a bit from the initial push of carbonation.
Appearance: Tons of tiny bubbles burning a path through the dark and tawny brew, some of the sediment made its way into the glass as it was lifted by the carbonation in the bottle. Those bubbles hold a very solid cream coloured lace together.
Smell: Sweet tart granny smith apple, soft herbal phenols and bready malt with a yeast backing make up the aroma.
Taste & Mouthfeel: Stiff crispness holds its own up against the creamy and thickly layered medium body. Big expressive bitterness from some hops but more of a tangled yeast, herbal phenol and spiced bitter flavour. Fruitiness gets juicy in the middle with some tag along alcoholic esters. Good foundation of malt that leaves nothing untouched as it unravels flavours of whole grain bread, faint molasses, toasted grains and a light dry husk in the end. 
Drinkability & Notes: A big thumbs up from me, more than just a noteworthy brew. Beer like this makes the big picture of good beer that much more clear. An addictive sipping style brew. 1,173 charactersJason, Feb 06, 2003
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5IMHO this beer is a little bit better than its big brother, Westie 12! Although it seems that many people disagree with me, well maybe Todd agrees with me on this one. This beer poured a dark red, amber-ish brown colour with a nice fluffy head which stayed around for quite awhile. This smelled wonderful...Bready, Biscuity, Malty, and Chewy...a near-perfect combination of complex flavours and flavor notes! This tasted just as good as it's nose indicated it would taste. This beer had many wonderful complex flavors which were all combined and tightly and neatly wrapped up into one great package! This beer had a very velvetty mouthfeel but it was not as nice as the mouthfeel on the Westie 12. The drinkability for this beer is quite good, but it is a trappist ale, so if you drink more than a few of these you will be thrown for quite a loop. A great beer which you should purchase if and when you see it. One of the best trappist beers made, if not the best IMO.
cheers!,

4.15/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This brew pours a rich amber color with a creamy fluffy head that last for a while leaving a sexy lace behind. The smell of hops and malt are very strong to the nose. Earthy fruity esters are also present to the nose. The first sip bring great joy to the palate, and malty yet strong hop flavor is nice along with a citrus tart. This is a great brew and I will soon have the #12 to see what all the hype is about.
Cheers. 424 characterskunzbrew, Jan 22, 2003
4.8/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Hard to describe the taste. Very unlike any other Belgian beers I have tried. Somewhat malty, dark and fruity, but without the liveliness and spice of some other Belgian beers. Some lace, head disappeared rather quickly. I found this to be very interesting initially, but it just seemed somewhat "off" to me. I would love to try the 12, and will when I find it. Re-review - (Forgive me, I knew not what I was saying. I finally had this again, and it was sublime. Deep, dark, fruity, I wish I had two! Right up there with the Westmalle as the best dubbel I've had. I can't wait to compare them head to head). P.S.S.! I did a head to head with Westmalle and Loterbol. This blew them away. Fantastic! As good as any beer in the world. 731 charactersJohnnyDuvel, Jan 02, 2003
4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Very dark brown bier, with no transluscence at all. There were a few bits of particulate hovering around in the dark as well. The head was initially a big, tan, frothy sucker! After a short span of time it shrank down to a fine, thin layer, with acceptable sheets of lacing. Nose was quite rich and enticing, with plenty of dark fruit aromas emanating from the glass! West-V 8 has a medium body, and a slight effervescence on the tongue. Flavor is comprised of dark fruit flavors, some mild yeastiness and a slight hint of chocolate lying underneath the aforementioned flavors. Finish is slightly dry, with a fairly long-lasting, and pleasant, aftertaste. Nice bier. I can feel the warmth in my belly, as well! Prosit!!

4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Hazy dark ruby in hue, topped by an off white, creamy, stiff head with typically excellent retention. A fragrant waft of floral, perfume like, rosy sweetness upfront in aroma, followed by a richer melange of dry, powered cocoa, and, raisin like dark caramel Special B. Yeast derived fruitiness aromawise is mild, but is perceptibly acidic, tropical, and slightly citric in nature. Flavorwise, the initial honey like sweetness fades slightly, then allows a complex melange of biscuity malt, oak and rich carob to envelope the palate. Pleasantly minerally, slightly salty notes and dry, spicy black pepper lend a pseudo savory mid palate impression. Mellow phenol complements malt sweetness well, lending a clove laced molasses undertone. Moderate in body, with an agreeably smooth and deceivingly light mouthfeel. Finishes w/ notes of black licorice and brown sugar lingering. 8 is a delicious beer, with tremendous depth in character all around. It's not as assertive in outright yeast derived flavor contributions compared to other Dubbels, yet the malt profile is tremendously complex and refined. It's worth the price... a true treat. 1,137 charactersmarc77, Nov 23, 2002
4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Wow. God is in the details (and I am not a religious man), but something divine is going on in this beer. Deep brown with hints of copper coming through, and a huge, rocky tan head. The first smell is unmistakably Belgian yeast, with dark fruits, some chocolate, fresh baked cinnamon-raisin bread. Flavors of dates, grapes, pepper, again fresh baked cinnamon-raisin bread. Sweet and spicy. Spice lingers on the tongue for quite some time, reminding you of the divine craftsmanship of these monks. Heavenly. 506 charactersmophie, Nov 20, 2002
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The beer pours a nebulous deep black cherry color, ponderous somewhat frothy beige head, and thick lace to cling mightily to the glass, also a "Bazillion tiny bubbles, sliding their little butts up the glass". Not many beers have a better nose, malt, banana, slight yeasty or bread dough if you prefer, over ripe fruit, just makes your mouth water smelling this wonderful beer. Sweet start, light to the top, finish is merciful in its acidity, potently hopped, droughty long lasting aftertaste. A fine cousin to the "12, 10" and well worth the try! 548 charactersGusler, Nov 20, 2002

Nutty (hazel?) rich malty flavor. Medium body.  Slight fruity (yeast) grapefruit finish.  This beer just screams quality and craftmanship.

4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4When you pour it, it sounds like a cola with its fizzy, lively head. Bubbles steam up the sides, again much like a coke, but with this beer, the head stays, but forms an odd concave surface as the middle starts to fade, but the outside stay much the same, reinforced by the constant bubbling. Head lacks the creaminess of the 12. Initial flavor is surprisingly realistic cocoa. There was some complexity, but that was the big flavor. Not as complex or as balanced as it's big brother. 484 charactersaracauna, Aug 10, 2002

One of the best aromas in any beer, fruit, plums chocolate, evem coriander or nutmeg or somethin'.  Tasty stuff, sweetish, chalky, bit of pudding, bit of chocolate, bit of candy sugar, just a lighter version of the 12, dangerously easy to drink, full flavour profile aswell, quite unique, but doesn't compare to the 12. 399 charactersrastaman, Jul 05, 2002

4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Presentation: .33l brown bottle. Direct from the source, so no label. Just a blue cap and the number 8. Served in a traditional Westvleteren silver rimmed chalice glass.
Appearance: Pours a mean chunky off-white head of stiff foam. Settles to a patchy lace with sticking and staying power. Colour is a very deep, dark ruby. Poured leaving most of the yeast in the bottle.
Smell: Incredibly rich aromas of Belgian candy sugar, toffee, yeast and gentle spices -- like anise.
Taste: Extremely smooth on the palate with a wonderful creamy mouthfeel with a fine and gentle carbonation. Luscious malt flavours of chocolate, coffee, licorice/anise, toffee, prune and honey unfold onto the palate with a slightly slick buttery-like (diacetyl). Notes of brandy pull-thru for even more depth of character. A racy sharpness hits with a unique yeast flavour, very mild tea-like bitterness and a spicy alcohol presence. Perfect balance. Dry finish, a little slick on the palate, a bit oily, with coffee and earth flavour residuals and alcohol vapors.
Notes: I'd go as far as saying that this is without a doubt one of the best beers on the planet. Truly a masterpiece. 1,159 charactersTodd, Jun 03, 2001
