4.19/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4.252014 vintage. Its well known that this vintage is practically flat and that was a problem for me. This is still an excellent beer. It has a dry raspberry flavor, mostly skin and seed, red wine, hay, bandaid, lemon, funk, and vinegar with a light mouth feel and dry finish. The aroma and flavors are strong and well balanced, but this leans toward the dry, musty, complex flavors rather than blasting you with raspberries. That's a good thing by the way. The raspberries don't get lost at all. Glad I was able to try this, but for the price I don't see myself reaching for this again. 583 charactersdanh53, Feb 04, 2017

Aroma of funky barnyard notes with some tart raspberry notes. Taste is a mix of funky barnyard notes with some tart raspberry notes, light vinegary notes are also perceptible with some acidity. Body si full with limited filtration and good carbonation. Really enjoyable but maybe not as much balance as I was expecting from this brewery. 434 charactersPhyl21ca, Dec 31, 2016

4.56/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.752014 Vintage. Poured from a 750mL bottle into a 3F "3" script tumbler glass. Acquired in a trade. 
Not much of a pop on the uncork - pours a cloudy brownish maroon body with little head that speak of - little carbonation on the appearance. No lacing or retention. 
On the nose is sour raspberry candy, lots and lots of raspberries with a definite lactic tartness, a light mustyness and acetic vinegar as well. Raspberries take center stage. Smells extremely inviting. 
On the tongue is an initial burst of sour raspberry, followed by a decent oak presence, fruit skins, citrus, light acetic. Drying tartness sticks on the tongue for half a minute. Carbonation is lacking but that doesn't take much away from this beer. Medium body. 
Much more sour than I was expecting (think raspberry warheads), but PACKED with flavor, which I really like. 845 charactersgcamparone, Dec 27, 2016

Dark crimson, light haze. Decanted from a pitcher. 
Minimal lace and foam in the glass, some bubbles in the pitcher.
Raspberry aroma, seedy wild ones. Fruit forward.
Tart and tannic, puckering and bone dry in the finish. Plentiful raspberry, minimal wood or funk. Low carbonation, very juicy. Overall very delicious and full of raspberry juice. Very nice, though at the premium price it's a one and done. 431 charactersemerge077, Jul 11, 2016

Pours a rubin red, satured color, with no head to speak of - apparantly this flat as an island.
Explosive nose of an intriguing interplay between crisp strawberries and funky glue, together with blue cheese. Has an astringent vinegar acetic quality to it, which lends a fermented ripeness to the berries. Has a wet leaves characteristic to it, with moldy, funky wood bark and strawberry bush.
Drinks fairly flat, with just the tiniest amount of carbonation, which leads to an uncompromising, tongue sticking acetic tartness, without 3 Fonteinens typical stony mineral effervescence. The crispness of the fruits make up for it though by providing a nice raspberry richness.
Tastes of cucumber water, turnip cabbage, vinegar and very unripe raspberries. The berries then produce a stone pit accompanied, earthen sweetness, while the beers profound tartness becomes even more prominent. Has an aqueous softness in the finish, while its strawberry richness is almost gone, putting the flavor focus entirely on the teeth numbing, long lastic sourness.
Drinks more than an AWA than a fruit Lambic to me - incredibly sour, vinous, with not much else being able to cut though. The beer produces a powerful acetic sourness which is able to overcome the raspberry presence in this. Compared to Cantillons Rose, this is inferior in each and every way, less pronounced fruit characteristics and quite unbalanced. 1,418 charactersaleigator, Jun 05, 2016

Smells of jammy raspberry skins and seeds. Just a fruit bomb in the nose, this is very pleasant. Nice mild sourness that is a 3.5 out of 10 on the sour level. Tastes like massive raspberries both skin, flesh, and seeds. Almost moderate level of dusty and musty funk. This is very tasty raspberry sour! Medium bodied beer with low carbonation levels. Light dryness that lightens out the body. The carbonation is fine this is not as flat as everyone complains that is a flaw to this vintage. It could use a little bit more bubbles, but Framboos does not suffer from the lack of high effervescence. 673 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, May 11, 2016

Very delicate and balanced beer, way better than the 2014 vintage. Maybe the 2014 needs a little bit more age? 216 charactersKaeF, Apr 05, 2016

A: Pours garnet with a half finger of off white, somewhat average head with largish bubbles. Pretty good retention and no lacing.    Its surface becomes completely still within a short while.
S: Raspberries and bright red cherry up front, which are beautifully integrated and balanced with the musty horse blanket and earthiness of the brett. Hint of oak and vanilla add some complexity. 
T: Juicy, mouthful-of raspberry turns to a hit of acid and undertone of earthy brett and pepper.  Moderate, leaning towards moderate-high sourness which accentuates the fruit. Medium length finish which leaves the impression of some residual sugar, or maybe ust fruitiness. 
M: Medium body and carbonation, slightly prickly.  No alcohol. 
O: A really well balanced and enjoyable raspberry lambic. Surprised how much fruit comes through on a bottle of this age.  Not quite god tier among sours, but still worth the effort of finding, and on par with something like LP Framboise. 1,058 characterspmarlowe, Feb 24, 2016

Pours a garnet hue with a slight haze to the clarity.  Head quickly disperses into a tight band around the edges.  Nose is acetic and expresses a trace of solvent, tart raspberries and jam.  Taste expresses tart raspberries and a light briney quality.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) with a virtually still carbonation and an acetic astringency.  Overall, a very good fruited sour but not as mind-blowing as I anticipated.  I don't see this beer improving much with age. 580 charactersJwale73, Feb 21, 2016

Taste starts very tart, fair acidity, big sour with bit of funk, into big juicy tart raspberry again, more generic berry in vegetal but some raspberry, little sticky candy raspberry syrup, mild berry seed. Sticky little flemmy finish, more tart raspberry and seed lingering, little acidity.
Mouth is med to lighter bod, tart flemmy acidity, very little carb.

Pours a nice deep ruby red colour, absolutely no head or lace. Smell is loaded with raspberry, barnyard and acidic notes, juicy and tart berries are front and centre here. Taste starts off with juicy raspberry before tart puckering fruit roll in, mix of lemon juice and raspberry, funky and oaky long dry fruity finish. Nearly no carbonation, medium body. Exceptional, a very expressive fruited lambic. 436 characterspeensteen, Jan 19, 2016

Smell: Sour fruit - in a pleasing way; not old/moldy. Strong raspberry.

Feel: For a sour, surprisingly smooth across the tongue. Only a slight dry finish.

L-
Very thin head with very small infrequent bubbles.  More visible carbonation than expected based off reviews and the sound of the cork (lack there of).  Murkey dark red color.
S-
Initally very funky but than changes to a strong raspberry aroma
T-
very tart but very fresh raspberry flavor  Finish is a touch acetic but great fruit flavor and a little funk, this one is going to evolve nicely.  
F-
This is the well documented flaw here but it does have a little bit of carbonation.  
O-
This beer would be close to a perfect 5 if the carbonation was higher but that knocks in down a fair amount IMO.  I'm hoping my other bottles gain carbonation with time. 698 charactersPerHops, Nov 04, 2015
3.89/5  rDev -13.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 2.75 |  overall: 3.752014 bottle. Purchased at Finger Lakes Beverage Center in Ithaca, NY.
This one pours a clear, deep almost blood red, with no head, and no lacing. The cork came out with absolutely no pop. I was hoping that an extra year aging in the bottle would carb this up, but it doesn't seem to be the case, unfortunately.
This smells like tart, tart raspberry, just stings the nostrils, with lemon, oak, and a little bit of vinegar.
I can tell that this is not quite what it's supposed to be. It's so flat that I'm not even sure it'll ever carb up to a satisfactory point, though. I wish I had the 2011 vintage. Beyond this issue, there's a great super sour raspberry flavor, almost Warheads level, with some mild, damp basement funk, tart lemon, and some slightly white wine vinegar. It's definitely good, but it could be so much more.
This is light bodied, with no carbonation, and a still, dead, and lifeless mouthfeel. It's really too bad.
I'm disappointed in the amount of money I spent on this versus how much I enjoyed it. 1,023 charactersGreesyFizeek, Nov 01, 2015

Beautiful ruby red hue with very little carbonation. Funk is absolutely classic drie, with jammy raspberry nose.  A bit more acidic than I would normally care for, but the aroma of funk and taste of fresh raspberries balances it nicely.  As many people have stated, this beer could use a bit more carbonation to bump up the experience, but i was in no way disappointed with this beer.

Otherwise, this is a world class lambic and I could just sit and smell the fresh raspberries for days.  Taste follows the nose with big time jammy raspberry and a bit of funk. 320 charactersAndyEdgar, Oct 19, 2015

4.61/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle. One of the first beers I heavily desired. Pours out of the bottle a bright, true pink. It was nearly flat. Almost no head save for an outer ring of individual bubbles. Aroma is of pungent, tart, underripe raspberries. Rustic funk and acidity with a bit of oak. The sip delivers a formidable sourness consisting of puckering, tart raspberries. There is a brief period of sweet jam then it dries back out again and leaves my tongue tasting like raspberry seeds and oak. The concentration and intensity of the raspberry sourness is like none other. One of the more extreme Lambics I have had; perhaps the most. I found it to be less complex as some other Lambics  of high notoriety but this one tastes much more potently sour. Light bodied and the acidity and sourness never leaves the lips. I wish it wasn't nearly flat, though. Surely a treat I probably won't come across again. 885 charactersVelvetExtract, Oct 12, 2015

Huge jammy raspberry aroma leads into a big raspberry jam flavor, with the beautiful labmic funk of Drie in the backdrop. There is no carbonation here, and that's it's only flaw, really. Carbonation would have put this one much higher, but tough to ignore it being flat. Everything else here about this beer is nearly perfect and as expected. 414 charactersBMMillsy, Oct 04, 2015

From 09/19/15 notes. Bought a bottle of this at Zwanze Day at Fool's Gold in NYC. Bottle dated 2014/06/18, poured into a tulip.
Pours a murky dark reddish-pink color with one inch of dark pink head and almost no carbonation evident.
Lots of sour and tart raspberries, fruity malts, oak, funk, spice, vanilla, dark fruits, and tart jam. Medium body and low carbonation, some light acedic notes.
Overall very good; this one is actually worth the hype. I would put it on par with Hommage; both are great funky/sour raspberry beers with that funk you can only get from Belgian beers. Tons of funk and tart raspberries, hoping they continue to make this. Beers like Oude Gueuze Vintage, Hommage, and this really show what DF is capable of and why they are one of the best. 783 charactersmdfb79, Sep 21, 2015

L: strawberry ruby with Apricot edges
S: very funky, fresh Raspberries
T: funkiness is off the chain, barnyard and hay dominate, fresh and underripe Raspberries. Sourness throughout the palate. 
F: medium light. 
O: very good, but too much funk for me. Again, the flatness may be affecting the flavor here. 366 charactersMissSmisje, Sep 20, 2015

A - Poured into a tulip a hazy reddish berry hue with no real head. Looks like fresh squeezed raspberries.
S - Aromas of bright berries, sour acidity, light raspberry funk. Faint green fruit and seeds. Really bright. 
T - Taste is similar to the nose, loads of almost cheese funk. Nice seedy berry, tart berry juice. Really bright acidity, nice berry sharpness. The acidity is to the point that it makes you need the next sip without being oppressive or enamel scraping. 
M - Mouthfeel is brightly acidic with light carbonation. Not flemmy on the finish. 
O - Overall this beer was pretty delicious. Great raspberry notes with solid acid notes. Very pleasant.

T - Sourness is massive with tons of raspberries, some oak and funk.
M - A bit thin with little to no carbonation, sour, puckering and dry. 
O - Excellent raspberry flavor makes up for low carbonation. 374 charactersc-rum, Sep 18, 2015

The 2014 on the other hand wasn't nearly as good. 3.6-3.75 at best for me. Approaching flat, it had a strong vinegar character that drew unflattering comparisons to upland. 2011 is the way to go. 295 charactersWTKeene, Aug 26, 2015

Little bit of vanilla. Just tons of jammy raspberries. Medium sour, at least compared to the LP Framboise that we tried never to it. Big jammy flavor. So much wonderful fruit. Deep funk. Very complex. Super tasty. Medium light feel. 344 characterspopery, Aug 02, 2015

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is where I wish BA had vintages.
2011 is a perfect beer. Raspberry jam with so much perfect complexity between the fruit and funk. So very dry, effervescent and creamy. It's the second best sour beer I've had, right behind VSB. The rating here reflects that.
2014 is a bit less so, at least right now. Incredibly jammy, but it lacks the complexity of the '11. It also lacks the carbonation. I've had it twice now and the second bottle actually did have the slightest bit of carb, but it needs what the '11 had. Overall I'd give '14 somewhere between a 4.5 and 4.75 depending on the bottle. 596 characterscultclassic89, Jul 25, 2015

3.5/4.5/3.75/4/3.75
Murky, peachy, red-brown. 
Funky acetic nose. Deeper notes of bright berry fruit. 
This is good, but...The funky vinegar is kind of overwhelming, and, at times, kind of gross. 
Tart and puckery. 
In the end, this is a pretty guezy-gueze enhanced by raspberries. 380 charactersAgentMunky, Jul 10, 2015

A - Barely a sound when uncorked. Pours to two 3F glasses deep maroon with some quickly fading bubbles for a head. Looks like flat murky juice. Very nice color though.
S - Very intense and dense raspberry sourness. Raspberries get absurdly deep with warmth with being thrust into raspberry bushes coming to mind, while still remaining bracingly sour.
T - Lots of acidic sour, basement funk, potent raspberry, lemon. Sourness is massive but raspberries still manage to pull through very well. Some oak and tannins.
M - A bit thin with low carbonation and a bit of a spritzy feel. Very sour, puckering and dry. Pretty enamel-ripping. 
O - Ridiculously sour but quite drinkable, pretty amazing raspberry flavor pretty much makes the low-carb a non-issue, good creepy dusty cobweb funk as well. My favorite 3F so far, a good step above Hommage which is saying alot. Will be great to see how this ages. 1,031 charactersChico1985, Jul 06, 2015

A- Opens up with a uninspiring cork removal, no pop. Beautiful pink and red body. Pours like wine or juice with a basal amount of foam but no head. No ring and no lace.
S- Cheeks hurt already before taking a sip. Insane amounts of aroma hinting towards very sour territory. The raspberries are the true focal point, absurd fresh berry aroma. Besides that are tones of lemon, lactic acid, musty funk, oak, cheese and slight vinegar.
T- For me gains some more complexities and some semblance of balance but it sure is a sour monster, sore cheeks 3oz in. Foreground of fresh raspberry seeds and all, lactic acid and white vinous grape with a backing of wet oak, acetic acid, Brett sour cherry, musty wine and moderate funk.
MF- Dry and light end body with a sour slickness. Basically flat as it gets but somehow it doesn't bother me much at all here. Finish without taste buds left.
This has been up there on my list of beers to try and it did not disappoint. The borderline flatness was not ideal but honestly the insane amount of raspberry and sourness carry the experience along just fine. 1,142 characterscbutova, Jun 29, 2015

Appearance: Bright red with no head
Smell: Raspberries, funk, grass
Taste: Sharp and aggressive use of fruit similar to their kriek but without any medicinal undertones, raspberries are bright but not too dominant as you still get the barnyard funk, little to no lingering tastes
Mouthfeel: Pretty much no carb, which I had absolutely no issue with. Felt great. Very tart.
Overall: Phenomenal framboise. The end of the bottle was particularly delicious. Not as much fruit but SO much funk. Definitely the highlight. Feel like this beer is just going to get better and better with age. 602 charactersLeftofthedial, Jun 15, 2015

A: Poured a murky dark ruby with purplish hues in the middle. Very little to no head with very little to no effervescence. 
S: Tart off the bat. Strong raspberries notes. A nice blend of tart berry notes in the middle: straw, black, and more rasp. Moderate oak barrel and sour bugs and yeast.
T: The taste really follows the nose nicely with very similar notes. This is a very tart ale.  Fairly straightforward, nice oak followed by delicious raspberry. Not at all sweet.
M: Fairly thin, low carb, light body. Not syrupy.
O: Very very good. I must compare it to Lou Pepe Frambios and it is neck and neck, but I may give the win to Lou. I will admit this was very expensive and I split it with a fellow BAer to negate the financial hardship. Was it worth the price tag, no. Was it a chance to try a rare sour, yes. Would I do it again, probably. 905 charactersmacher0, Jun 10, 2015
4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The epitome of maturity, class and elegance is all sewn up in this intensely sour ale that's in full celebration of the raspberry fruit. But we've come to expect nothing less from the Drie Fonteinen brewery.
Deep and ominously of mauve and rose, the densely laced austere seems cram-packed with fruit. with its delicate swirl of foam collapsing into the ale, its acidity arises to captivate the nose with intense raspberry puree and the mustiness of well-aged burgundy wine, oak, tangy acidity and the tightly woven aromas of earth and must.
As its pungent perfume of saddle leather and horse hair escape, the light malty syrups of raspberry give the beer a slightly fuller body than most sour ale. However, the middle palate turns decidedly sour with hints of balsamic, tart cider, lemon, crabapple and sour berries. A moderate briny balance accompanies a tannin-rich taste of weathered oak and peppercorn with nuances of vanilla and almond.
The beer's bright and sour finish is fully decorated with the tart berries, but have a mild candied finish with an afterglow of sea air and sandalwood. Medium-light for sour ale, the beer still closes with a quick, refreshing and palate cleansing final impression. 1,210 charactersBEERchitect, Jun 07, 2015

Wow this is a huge huge want. When I originally got into beer batch 1 was the biggest whale out there. Batch 2 came out and it gave me some hope. Finally a new batch that made it to the US.
Poured into 2 tulips, and split with my wife on our anniversary. We had hommage on our wedding night and both beers are extremely similar, infact I would put that guy a squeak ahead of this one.
Huge fruit in the nose, fantastic mix of sweet and sour and it looks amazing in the glass. Mouthfeel is spot on, overall this is a stellar beer. Again my only ding is the price point. Aside from that, highly recommended! 619 charactersKevSal, May 25, 2015

Gorgeous looking beer--nice deep pink/purple
Really nice smell, light funk and berries
Very tart, not as much fruit as expected for a fresh bottle
Absolutely no carb
A really nice beer, but not worth the whale status IMHO.  Would have liked more fruit to come through and even just a tiny bit of carb 328 charactersTbub18, May 17, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.52014 vintage. Served at DLD15. Served in a snifter.
Darker pink-hued, mostly reddish body, thin pink head that drops quickly; no lacing. Smells full of tart raspberries, a fair bit of must and oak, leathery funk that I would expect from Drie Fonteinen beers, but the raspberry jam quotient is in overdrive. Flavourwise, this is a nice blend of tart raspberry jam and funk, lemon citrus, wheat base that informs the usual traditional lambic; moderately sour, not incredibly mouthpuckering but I can see this becoming more sour with time. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, nice shake-like consistency, jammy. Sufficiently carbonated, though certainly not optimal. Hell of a framboise with a strong raspberry jam quotient; it's nice that they've chosen to release a new batch of this beer.
Re-review: 2011 vintage, stored on its side for several years, served out of a lambic cradle into 3F stemmed glassware on 6/17/2016. Pours a dark, slightly murky, reddish body, one finger white head with plenty of effervescence, good retention, not so much lacing. Smells of rich raspberries; authentic and jammy, a bit of leather and funk, moderate acetic acidity. No other framboise I've had even comes close to matching the jamminess of the raspberries here, perhaps other than SP Framboise du Fermier, I suppose. Flavour brings more acetic acidity, leather, a bit more lemon, a massive amount of raspberries, but the lambic base shines more here. It's quite impressive how well this comes together. Moderate funk, a bit of sweet yet dry grain. Mouthfeel is medium-fuller bodied, almost creamy like a milkshake. Massive raspberry and acetic vinegar on the finish. This beer is not subtle by any means, and it's beautiful. Overall, this 2011 vintage makes you realize how far off the 2014 vintage is from what made this one great. I would highly recommend going for the 2011 vintage; it may be a bit more costly in terms of what you have to give up for it, but it's well worth it. 1,965 charactersStevedore, Apr 26, 2015
4.54/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review is from presumably the 1990 vintage (it came unlabeled) shared two sides on a sunny Friday of April 2015. 750ml
A: Dark orange pour with an impressive foamy white head. Nothing in the look let guess what this beer is. The color from the raspberries has completely fallen off and the massive velvety head would suggest something extremely fresh.
S: No doubt possible from the nose, there are raspberries inside! The smell is so strong, of fresh, sweet raspberries. There is some tartness in the aroma also but hidden behind tons of pure raspberry. Very impressive for a 25 years old lambic!
T: The taste is also focused on raspberries, but with a strong sourness also, mainly acidic acid, but still very enjoyable. Some mustiness, some wood, and a strong raspberry finish. The aftertaste is long, I had it the whole day in the mouth. Really enjoyable if you love sourness.
M: Sharp on the palate but the carbonation is awesome. The sourness may refrain from drinking it bottoms up but it is actually easily drinkable.
O: A really nice experience. This beer felt like traveling backwards in time. For sure it really add to the tasting experience but this was overall a very good beer. It is very different from the batch from 2011 I have had the occasion to try several times before (and which is more focused on raspberry jam or raspberry purée, but also pretty straightforward on the fruit). 1,399 charactersFux, Apr 25, 2015

A:  Pours a murky muddy brown with slight reddish hues.  Small head that recedes to a thin film encircled by larger bubbles that cling to the rim for the duration.
S:  Straight raspberry jam, plums, currants, overripe banana, fresh flowers, grass, and funk.
T:  Raspberry sweetness up front, quickly turns tart tangerine and grapefruit, dry, long Pinot noir-esque finish
F:  Fairly low carb, becomes almost carbless as it warms.  Lingers around the cheeks.

A: pours a deep red  with orange at the edges with a fleeting whitish head that has poor retention and leaves only a trace of lacing 4.25/5
S: huge sweet rasberry jam dominates the nose, there's also some lemon zest and a hint of stale grain 4.75/5
T: leads off with tart rasberry, not near as sweet or jammy as in the nose, that transitions into tart, acidic lemon that tiptoes on the line of overpowering without crossing it, a hint of grain, tartness lingers, almost puckering 4.25/5
M: medium body, good level of carbonation, very dry finish 4.5/5

Jeff hooked me up with this most recent batch and I just can't help myself. Have to try it (relatively) fresh no matter that I can't get enough of the old 3F funk. Into the tumbler with a big "3" on it. Thanks so much, Jeff!!!
Sticking with the original score for the last batch (2011). Following is for the 18/06/2014 bottle reviewed on 08/31/2015:
A 4.25 Pours a rich orangey-red and looked very still initially. After a minute, a thin pinkish head developed, and then another minute later, faded to a thin collar.
S 4.75 The fresh raspberries hit me as I was pouring. There's a nice bit of woody funk, maybe more than I was expecting with a fresher bottle but c'mon, this is 3F. What's with low expectations, bro?? Anyways, there's some nice light notes of bitter raspberry seeds and a touch of sweet light malt.
T 5 Oh man, that is the stuff. Big sour raspberry, and I do mean big. Some very light funky old wood, a bit of those raspberry seeds but not really bitter. Just delicious.
M 3.75 My only real complaint about the beer is the very low carbonation. Probably serves me right for being all anxious, but then again who knows, it may not carb up completely ...maybe it'll get worse and I'll be a genius? Ha, like it ever works that way. Medium-light body, more on the medium side.
O. So delicious, I would drink this all the time if I could but I'll be happy being spoiled with this bottle all to myself. Well, maybe my wife will get a sip ...maybe. Thanks again to the most generous guy around!! 1,734 charactersRutager, Jul 12, 2014

The pours a super dark, raspberry color, not quite red, not quite purple, hazy, cloudy, opaque, any of those words will adequately describe it. A minimal pink head appears that fizzles out quickly, no lace or any real head retention available. Huge aroma of raspberry jam, fruity funk, lemon zest and some pie crust malt. It's very raspberry forward, simple yet delicate. The flavors are right in line, delicious raspberry jam flavor, funkiness, lemon acidity is there with just a touch of malt. It's not quite as bright as the nose, a bit more earthy, the terroir is showcased well, nice jammy flavors and the funkiness is just right, not overpowering, but helps to express the fruit flavors. The mouthfeel is nice, very lively carbonation that doesn't prickle at all, it coats the mouth and tongue well and the texture feels juicy and jammy with a very soft, creamy finish. 
Verdict: A delicious framboise from Drie Fonteinen, one I wish they would make more often. It's not as delicate and bright as the Lou Pepe Framboise for me, but still a wonderful showing of raspberries with nice layers of funk and acidity that don't overpower the beer or let it get too sweet. 1,380 characterskevanb, Jun 25, 2014

Bottled 05/31/11. Served in a snifter. Review is a hybrid of tasting notes from bottles sampled on 04/25/14 and 04/26/14.
Appearance: Pours a murky, brownish red color with a yellowish halo outline and nice fade. Poor lacing and retention. 3.5/5
Smell: Big notes of tart raspberry, followed by light notes of vinegar and bright lemon zest. One of the bottles has a little cheesy funk to the nose, while the other was much cleaner. The nose on this was pretty awesome, albeit simplistic. 4.75/5
Taste: Tart, jammy raspberries and a touch of vinegar. Mineral water and light must. One of the bottles finished with a cheesy funk, while other finished with raspberry candy. The raspberry candy bottle was incredible, while the other had a layering funkiness that turned me off. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Super, super dry, with a nice tart bite and good carbonation. Medium bodied. 4.5/5
Overall: The bottle sampled the night before Dark Lord Day was pretty subpar and unpleasantly funky in a cheesy/lacto way, while the bottle sampled at Dark Lord Day delightfully bright and tart raspberry jam candy in a glass. Given this beer's reputation, I am inclined to chalk the first bottle up to bottle variation/storage issues. However, the possible bottle inconsistency should be a yellow flag for those seeking out whales to tick.
Cost: $40 for a 750 ml bottle. 1,440 charactersjegross2, May 22, 2014

Appearance - Hazy, kinda dull red. White head. A little leggy.
Smell - Funky. Strong raspberry, but it doesn't smell jammy or sweet like Hommage. Low acidity.
Taste - And here it is legitimately jammy. Still not a sweet raspberry. Lemony sourness, more than the nose implies. Funk lingers in the back end. Tart raspberry also lingers.
Mouthfeel - Medium light body. Well carbonated.
Overall - Significantly more sour than Hommage. Totally different representation og raspberries. 534 charactersAlieniloquium, May 18, 2014

Yesterday we had the Zeebra extreme beerfestival in Holland where this was on of the beers on the list. I was in Kopenhagen when they were released but did not buy them cause this is not my style. 
Poured in a Zeebra tatsting glass the beer looks ok. Smell is ok i guess for a beer like this but i was not very impressed by it.
The taste was extreme on the raspberry, too much for me. I let the beer go to my other tasting companion who loved this beer very much.
I am not born to like this beer, not any other sour or fruit beers... 667 charactersBrabander, May 04, 2014

Pours a murky red brown with a small pinkish head. Massive raspberries coming straight out in the aroma along with barnyard. I don’t just mean barnyard like a lot of sours have barnyard, I mean absolutely full on, I really am down the farm (with raspberries) barnyard. Manure, hay, jam, earth, horse blanket. Flavor is light to moderate sweet and moderate acidic. Some lemon citrus aspects lingering in the palate in the long dry finish. Full bodied with soft carbonation. Yes this is excellent.

Pour is a deep magenta with a wispy pink head, which recedes to a rim. Some effervescence. Smell is bright, juicy raspberries, cobwebs and funky blue cheese. Quite jammy. Huge raspberry profile carries over to the taste, with an additional increase in the level of cheesy funk. Quite sour. A bit of lactic creaminess, and a touch of oak on the finish. Very drinkable, despite being more sour than I expected. A top notch lambic for sure, but I think some additional time will do this well. 542 characterscfrances33, Dec 28, 2013
4.9/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle courtesy of the ever gracious HenrikO. A million thanks for the trade over the past summer.
Shared with family and friends to celebrate my MBA graduation. 
When opened, the bottle could be smelled from 3 feet away. Just super fresh and funky raspberries. Pours a mostly clear purple/dark red. Great looking beer. The head is minimal, but there is some carbonation in there.
Smell is the best aroma on Any beer I've ever experienced. Jammy is the right descriptor, with a bit of butteriness that fits just right with the berries. This is seriously like smelling a handful of macerated berries, just glorious. Funk level is very high, with some oakiness and cheese lingering. Acidity is there, but not overbearing. Just wonderful. I wish I could rate this as a 6 in the smell department. 
Taste follows the nose, but the cheese and funk is very prominent. The jammy raspberries are akin to eating the freshest and best raspberries you can imagine, only concentrated. The funk level is extreme as it warms, but I like it. Some in the group thought this was a detraction, but I'm not sure I agree. 
Mouthfeel is full, with just the right amount of moderate carbonation. Not too prickly, but just enough to keep the liquid dancing on the tongue. Great
Overall, this is probably the best beer I've ever had. Completely lived up to the hype, and then some. Would love to see how it is doing in another 5 years, as I believe it has legs, but I doubt I will ever cross paths with this one again. Seek this out. 1,514 charactersmikecharley, Dec 25, 2013

A: Pours a deep magenta to almost blood red. Hazy with some bubbles of carbonation.
S: Funky, raspberries, fruity tartness and lactic sour.
T: Follows the nose – quite tart and funky, juicy raspberries, some barnyard and a touch of woody dryness. Lactic sourness puckers the mouth. An impression of sour cherries in the hang, and is quite dry.
M: Medium to light body, decent carbonation sensation, and a touch of alcohol warmth.
O: Very very good, even with only a small sampling. I don't know whether I'll ever have an opportunity to try this another time - but I'll be very excited if I do. 724 charactersmacrosmatic, Jul 01, 2013

A- Really dark framboise color. Minimal-medium lacing for this kind of beer. I really thought this beer was going to be thinner, but it is pretty thick. 
S- Deep rich raspberry, barnyard funk, yeast. Pretty much what you would expect from a 3F beer as far as funk. 
T- Dangerously drinkable. There is a minimal milkshake consistency that helps this one down the throat. It first tastes of sugary raspberries that transform into sour raspberries. Very enjoyable and complex in that aspect. I am getting predictable 3F funk toward transition from sweet to tart. 
M- This is where the beer shines for me. The mouthfeel is a perfect 5. Perfectly carbonated; almost minimal milkshake framboise as previously stated. Glorius. 
O- I gave up a lot to try this brew. It lived up to my standards and more. From what I have heard; Hommage makes Framboos look like child's play. I imagine this statement was exaggerated. I need to try LPF too. 1,011 charactersgueuzedreg, May 24, 2013

A - Deep, deep red with a minimal head that quickly settled. 
S - Whoa. Raspberries for days. This is maybe the best smelling lambic I've ever had the pleasure of having. Behind the huge raspberry nose, there's some serious tartness and funk. I didn't even have to hold the glass up to my nose to smell this; the aroma just pops and you can get the smell from a foot or two away. Really awesome.
T - Tart raspberries, moderate to light funk, then some more tart raspberry before finishing with some lactic acidity and sour bite. I expected a degree of sweetness in the taste and I really didn't find it. All the sugar must've gotten eaten up by the bugs and converted into dry, tannic, fruity sourness. Yummy.
M - Moderate carbonation with a super dry finish. I really like super-dry sours, and this definitely was one.
O - Very, very good, and definitely lived up to the hype, but not so vastly better than a similarly aged Cantillon LP Framboise that it's worth giving up the farm for. I'm quite happy I was able to try this, but it's not something I'll be seeking out a repeat bottle of, given the cost of acquisition. 1,317 charactersGreenplastic615, Mar 26, 2013

Taste is raspberry, oak, lemon, tart apple, wet hay, slight sweetness. Slight puckering tartness, very fruity, but balanced and tart, with moderate funk.

A- Pours a slightly hazy pinkish raspberry color, produces a thin bubbly white head that lingers around the edge of the glass.
S- The aroma is really amazing, as soon as the bottle opened you could smell it from several feet away. The raspberry notes are great, very juicy and fresh but also with some dryer raspberry skin. The fruit is very prominent but beneath it is a nice oak and sweet vanilla character, as well as lactic acidity and a nice damp, earthy funk.
T- Very tart with a nice lactic acidity and mild hints of acetic. The raspberry flavor is huge and has a nice mix of skin and juicy flesh. Beneath this there's a nice earthy funkiness and oak and vanilla flavors.
M- Medium-bodied, moderate to low carbonation, which works very well actually, the feel is bone dry with a nice tannic feel.
O- This is a really wonderful beer, the flavors are delicious and very complex, it's just damn impressive. Easily amongst the best fruit lambics I've tasted. Now if only I had a few cases of this... 1,164 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 12, 2013

4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 750 mL caged and corked bottle into a tulip. 2011 vintage. From notes.
Moderately bright, the raspberry brown color has a wispy, off-white cap. This is not heavily carbonated. 
The nose is full of juicy ripe raspberries, with a very sour aroma overall. The fruit is just explosive; it smells mostly lactic in nature, and there is not much funk in the nose, probably due to the young age of the beer.
With the first sip my tongue is greeted with the soft, sweetness of ripe summer raspberries. With each passing millisecond, though, the flavor becomes more and more sour, peaking right at the end of the sip. The fruit clearly dominates the flavor, ahead of the funky lambic notes. The sour notes are mostly lactic tartness, although there is some acetic vinegar to it as well.
The early sweetness creates a slightly fuller than medium body, but the light bubbly carbonation and the sour acidity as the sip progresses drag the body to the middle of the spectrum in terms of lambics. The lactic acidity and light tannins create a dry sensation as well. 
This is simply an incredible raspberry sour, which I have soft spot for anyway. With more time in the bottle, I am sure some of the fruit will give way to more of the trademark Drie Fonteinen funk. It will be tough for it to improve on how much I like it now, but it should mellow out for sure. 1,365 charactersKickInTheChalice, Jan 30, 2013

It’s definitely one of those beers that I never thought I’d get to try. Deep ruby with a thin head of light pink foam. Robust and soapy look that stays very strong. Smells of straight up strawberry jam or some other juicy berry flavors. Some shaper acidity and funky notes burn the edges of the nose a bit. Jam and funk, what a combo. Taste has like a tart rhubard thing going on with some backing sugars. Funky sourness on the edges with a dry oaky finish. Medium bodied with some initial sharpness and a softer bubbly feel that fills out the rest. Not hugely complex but balanced, crisp and very drinkable.

pour was a light red, hit of pink. little head. 
very raspberry forward on the nose, sour, lemon rind and oak. not overly complex by any means but it is what it is.
raspberry forward flavor, not much jam as others have mentioned. more of a rubber and or plastic blend. oak was very faint, too faint. with fonteinen, i usually expect a nice oak presence and it was missing. nice sourness, light acidic character. 
light, mild to moderate carbonation. not overly puckering. 
for the cost, value, etc... i found this lacking. hoping time takes this to another level like the '99. good but not really worth the whale hunt. 673 charactershooliganlife, Dec 27, 2012

I prefered Hommage as their was less of rotten raspberry and cherries added a nice twist. I really had a hard time drinking my pour, maybe it was a bad bottle but my tasting friends liked their glass so old raspberries might no be my style. 545 charactersLuk13, Oct 28, 2012

New batch.
I was really looking forward to this as the 1999 was/is a monster whale I have always wanted to try. Kinda disappointed with this one.
Great red color. Very spritzy with minimal head.
Not particularly well balanced. Very acidic. It kinda burned the back of my throat a bit. Some rasberry flavors but not a ton. Minimal funk almost all sour. So sour that it was kinda tough to drink a lot. Maybe this needs to develop in the bottle a bit? 
This was good but far from great. I would take an LP Framb or a Rose d G over this one dispite the rarity. Glad I got to try this but not one I would trade my cellar for. 691 characterstendermorsel, Oct 23, 2012

Poured from a 750ml into a matching 3F stemmed glass. The brew appears a murky deep ruby to purple color with a lighter hint of orange around the edges. A white cap sits atop that is lightly stained pink and rapidly fizzels away to a fine film of a few bubbles that remain atop from rising bubbles of carbonation. Some spotty lace sticks to the glass.
The smell of this brew is more fruity and raspberry filled than I ever could have imagined. It reminds me of raspberry jam, very thick and juicy with an exceptional bright and natural scent. It sits in the nose and just makes me salivate. There are underlying notes of earth and a seedy quality you would expect from the raspberry pits. The funk of the base brew is evident with a minir contrasting note of something along the lines of plastic.
The taste of this brew is pretty harsh and I mean that in a good way. Its a real mind bender when you smell how fresh and juicy this is, you almost expext it to taste sticky and sweet like jam but instead its very sour. Sour from the natural tartness of the raspberry coupled with a bacterial sourness that has some earthen elements. More sips reveal a bit of citrus charcter along with the previously described notes of plastic that were noticed in the aroma. Mid palate a bit of yogurt tartness and mild lemony lacto tang are evident. The aftertaste of this brew is earthen with a natural seedy quality from the raspberry.
This is a medium to light bodied brew with a moderate to effervescent level of carbonation. It is super drinkable with zero alcohol impact. A super solid jam-like fresh raspberry inclusion jumps out and is very enjoyable mixed with afterthoughts of funk and earth. This brew flirts with perfection as it captures everything I look for in a fruited lambic. My only gripe being the plastic that emerged from this didnt blend into the entire experience quite like I wish it would have. Regardless this was a wonderful treat and something id love to have again. It hurts knowing how rare this bugger is. 2,164 charactersstakem, Oct 03, 2012

A: Pours a murky deep rusty red with no head and no lace. Awesome color though. 
S: Pure raspberry puree nose with a slight bit of funk. Extremely strong and fruit forward. Hints of barnyard.
T: Raspberry puree again, super fresh and fruity, surprisingly good tartness, no sour, with a good dose of funk. The raspberries are extremely fresh. Tastes like I’m eating whole berries off a dirty barnyard floor. 
M: Tart and super dry, medium body, slick and low carbonation. 
O: The best in its class for a raspberry fruit beer. A great lambic too, but not the best, or my favorite. That’s not to say this isn’t an awesome awesome beer. I would drink this everyday. Thanks for the treat Chad. 769 charactersscottfrie, Sep 12, 2012

A-Framboos pours almost a fluorescent red in color and transparent in clarity. Not much head on the pour, but this might be a result of the glassware I selected. 
S-Nose is packed full of jammy raspberry goodness. It dominates the beer, it’s fantastic. There isn’t really any 3F funk, but it’ll come in time. 
T-Taste is dominated by raspberry as well, but there is a little more underlying funk present here. 
M-The mouthfeel is light, albeit almost a little oily? Light acidity, gentle carbonation, and has a nice, long finish. 
O-Incredible fruit lambic that will age gracefully for many years. Is there anything Armand can’t do? 
Note: A couple months after this review, I tried Framboos side by side with Hommage and was surprised how tart the raspberries were in Framboos. I didnt notice it as much when I had it on it's own, but they were puckeringly tart when I tried it again. I can't wait to see how it balances out with the funkiness in a couple years. 1,125 charactersTnudish, Sep 07, 2012

A full haze deep pink to purple with low bubbles and very little fizz or head. Nose is very similar to young 3F Hommage: big phenols, plastic, instense Sharbeekse kriek cherry pit and dark cherry phenols. Taste is lactic, some mallic/tartartic sweet tart zippiness, long citric acid finish. Big sour warhead taste. Aggressive. Drying finish. Lacks a lot of the 3F complexities like grapefruit and leather. Not really seedy raspberry forward like LP Framboise. More citric and phenol bomb at this point. Definitely needs age like the Hommage. 5/14/2012 7/4/8/4/15=3.8
750mL 1993 ed thanks to forgetfu. Pours a hazy orange amber with small pink foam that subsides. Much less vibrant in color compared to the 2011 batch. Nose instead of seedy raspberry is more jammy raspberry with cherry/rhubarb pie, vanilla, rich dessert profile. Taste is bracingly citric sour with mega lime juice acid. Finishes bone dry. Soft carbonation. Very juicy with a long, leathery palate. No acetic acid. Not really even lactic/yogurty. Just very bright and and fresh. Unbelievable that this is from 1993. Very drinkable. Demands to be drunk in large gulps. Unfortunately, each gulp will cost you $100 so better take out a second mortgage. Very delicious. One of my favorite beer experiences ever. 6/9/2012 9/4/9/5/18=4.5 1,366 characterstarheels86, Sep 06, 2012

Pours a dark reddish amber with a small white head that settles pretty quickly and leaves close to no lacing on the glass. The aroma is tons of raspberry. It's bursting with fruit. There is also a bit of funk and a mushroom note as well as a faint, slightly unpleasant medicinal note, and some strawberry jam. The taste is tart and dry. Lots of raspberry, just like the nose. There is also a light funky earthiness, a bit of strawberry jam, and a little cherry. The finish is dry and tart with a bit of funk and lots of lingering raspberry. Medium body. Low-medium carbonation. This is great right now. I'll be curious to see how it ages if I get the opportunity to try it again. 747 charactersjethrodium, Aug 30, 2012

Thanks to Dak for letting me have a sip off his glass after I got snubbed on a pour of my own (not cool enough I guess). Pours a hazy deep berry purple color. Striking fresh raspberry aroma, lactic yogurty, lemon, currant. Vibrant raspberry flavor, as potent as any raspberry beer I’ve had, while maintaining a great balance between lactic and acetic sourness, also melding the fruity sweetness with the firm sourness brilliantly.

Poured into a snifter. Soft cherry in colour, quite hazy, and with a thin head that recedes into a fine ring. Nice looking brew - colour looks genuine.
Great nose on this, with the tart raspberries stealing the show all the way. A bit of funk and musk kicking around in there as well, but really this is all raspberry and I thank them for it. 
Great tart lambic, with a good balance between tart raspberry and traditional sour notes, funk, musk and citrus. This brew sits at about my upper threshold of sourness (at least for now; I'm certainly improving in this regard), so this would have to be a brew that I would share with friends when the mood hits me just right. Fortunately, this was one of those times, and so the balance of this brew really did it for me. Carbonation is firm, but not overpowering. Lingering astringent finish. 
Were it not for its rareness I would certainly keep one kicking around the cellar as an exemplar fo the style. Great brew. 1,115 charactersJohnnyBarman, Aug 13, 2012

Pours a cloudy reddish color with a light pink head. Smells of raspberry, leather, red wine vinegar, and oak. A touch salty too, which is a bit strange. Lemon and straw, a touch of earthy funk. The flavor is quite sour, though it leans toward the acetic side. Still, some nice lactic notes and lemon zest. Raspberry is there, as is a bit of oak, leather, and must. Not anywhere near as funky as most 3 Fonteinen beers. Enjoyable, but not amazing. 462 characterswomencantsail, Aug 07, 2012

4.69/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 51999 vintage shared by treyrab. I am eternally grateful!
I was promised a big rare surprise at this tasting hosted by nittanybeerfan. Trey took this out and said, "ever have this?" I said, "HOLY SHIT!" and spent the next several minutes scraping my jaw off the floor.
Pours very carbonated, surprisingly so for a 13 year old bottle. Ruddy, hazy, cloudy orange-ish red. Huge aroma of horseblanket, dank basement, sweat, and musky fruit rush toward me. Complete overpowering of my olfactory senses, I feel these aromas in my ears.
Raspberries are still present within the flavor in ways that I wouldn't expect for a beer of this age. Extremely acetic in the back of the throat, the raspberries quickly fade into an overpowering sourness which is rather enjoyable. One of us mentioned a tomato-like acidity. At the same time it is clean and lactic. Undeniably complex with its depth of flavors. As it warms a whole new flavor profile emerges: Briny, salty and earthy. 
Mouthfeel changes throughout the experience and is outstanding throughout. From prickly sour carbonation to an acedic burn, then a salty still feel as it warms.
Tremendous on every level and worthy of it's accolades. I am still amazed that I had the opportunity to try this beer and cannot thank Trey and Dan enough.
Beer on a whole new level of world class. 1,330 charactersvictory4me, Aug 01, 2012

Bright red beer with a light pink head with no retention. Spotty lace with little cling. Solid but not special.
Nose is unbelievable. Incredibly aromatic. Crushed raspberry, light cheesiness, hay, cobweb funk. Very pure. Representative of the nose of almost all Drie Fonteinen fruit lambic.
Sweet raspberry with a mild tartness. Great balance. Cheesiness in the back. More berries towards the middle. Aftertaste of hay, oak, yeast, and cobwebs. Very good.
Light to medium bodied. Low carbonation, yeasty in the mouth, mellow going down. Slightly lingering aftertaste. A perfect complement for the taste. 
Given the hype surrounding this beer, I'm a little disappointed. Very good but this isn't as impressive as Hommage was and its close to on par with the Scharbeekse kriek in my opinion. A great offering from a great brewery but its not worth the trouble in this case. 976 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jul 30, 2012

Dark red, nearly purple body with bubbly white head. Minimal beads cling to the sides of my glass.
Aroma is....wow! Very intense, super concentrated raspberry and funk. Seriously, this is incredible. Arguably the best aroma on any sour I've ever had.
Taste is a different story. Fresh raspberries blend with yeasty funk, finishing slightly bitter. Did I mention it's funky? More complex than LP Framboise, though I actually prefer the taste of that Cantillon right now as the raspberries are more forward in that flavor profile. Framboos also lacks the acidity I love about LP Framboise, but that should change over time. This bottle has serious cellaring potential; would love to check in on its progress in about 18 months.
A great sour nonetheless; very glad I got to tick this. 856 charactersbrystmar, Jul 28, 2012

Look: Pours a dark pink kinda ruby red color with a 1/4 inch white bubbly head and ok retention
Smell: The nose is pretty fruity with copious amounts of sour raspberries. There is a slight funkiness behind the raspberries and some oak but the nose is pretty much just a raspberry lovers dream
Taste: Again the beer is just very fruit forward with lots and lots of raspberries again there is some lip pucker tartness and a touch of funkiness
Mouthfeel: Light crisp and refreshing. It tickles the palate a little bit and goes down leaving the mouth just slightly dry
Overall: I am not usually a fan of fruity beers even some of the best ones in the world. But this beer is a fruit lovers wet dream. So good so much fresh raspberry flavor. Glad I got the chance to try this 825 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jul 28, 2012

Pours a deep pinkish-red with a moderate white head. Smells primarily of raspberries in a fantastic way with some oak and funk hanging out there as well. The raspberries really carry the flavor, but there's a nice tart and funky lambic sourness that complements it. It's only moderately sour though, not puckeringly so, and the flavors come together really nicely. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, this was really quite an excellent beer, one of the better fruit lambics I've had. It was especially impressive for me as raspberry beers tend to disappoint me, but this one really came through. 718 charactersstarrdogg, Jul 26, 2012

Opened my first of six bottles in the middle fo June with close friends in Sweden who went to the S&B festival who were gracious enough to bring their girlfriends along as mules for me. Greatly appreciated gentlemen. 
APPEARANCE: White head forms upon pouring and medium carbonation forms, a little bit less than expected but at least I see it. 
SMELL: Fresh raspberries with the slightest trace of moldy chese chunk. This will be a fruit bomb, but in a good way.
TASTE: Wonderful. Need I say more. 
PALATE: Slightly dry on the mouthfeel with a medium thick body. Feels great but wish there was more carbonation to give it the 'perfect' mouthfeel. 
OVERALL: This is perfect that I obtained enough for cellaring as I will be opening up a bottle once every other year with my Swedish or Chicago friends alongside me. There is so much potential as it's a little bit unruly and so much complexity will occur over the years. 939 charactersChicagoJohn, Jul 26, 2012

Pours a murky red with a foamy beige head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with some pretty complex raspberry and woody aromas. Taste is much the same but not as sour as I was expecting based on the aromas.

 Deep pink with a white head that recedes to a ring, leaving no lace. Nice clarity. The nose is beautiful with a big, deep raspberry aroma. Seedy, fruity, mildly leathery and jammy, this is excellent. The base lambic is moderately lemony, and complements the fruit very well. 
The palate is an excellent blend of lemony sourness, bright and vibrant raspberries and mildly salty/briny lambic. Seedy tannins are present, but to a lesser degree than, say, a Lou Pepe Framboise. Super bright fruit, not very tannic, the base lambic does complement the fruit with its blend of lemony and mildly musty notes. Medium-light in body and with a creamy, moderate level of carbonation, this feels excellent on the palate. Highly recommended.

**Edit 27 July 2012**
Trey shared a bottle of the 1999 vintage last night. Thank you, man!
Mostly clear, this is a pretty red with no head or lacing. The nose is excellent. Raspberry aromas, fresh, vibrant, berries, no tannins, mild strawberry/tomato paste sweet-tartness. Funky, and deeply musty, the nose is deep and complex. With a little floral aroma with no mushroom/earthy aromas, this smells amazing.
The palate opens with a moderate sourness, fruity, ripe and clean with lemon and lactic sourness. Salty and briny, a flavor combination I haven't encountered in a while. Minimal seed tannins, none of the solventy character that a lot of aged framboises have, this is quite fruity without being particularly jammy. The lemon notes brighten up the palate. Drying, lemon rind finish with moderate funk. Despite its age, the carbonation is quite high, and the flavors on the finish are excellent. Mildly tannic with minimal oak, this beer is phenomenal.

75cl bottle enjoyed at the Sour & Bitter dinner in Copenhagen (the "Main Event" as it were...Millennium and Malvasia Rosso were just warm-up beers)
Poured in a wine tumbler 
Enjoyed on 10 May 2012
Bottled: 31 May 2011
Best before: 31 May 2021
A: Dark ruby red - looks like raspberry purée. Small white head disappears almost immediately.
S: Smells like a fresh bucket of raspberries. Heavenly! Slight hint of oak, funk, and more raspberry. Touch of acidity as well, but again mostly just fresh raspberry.
T: Follows smell with initial burst of raspberry explosion up-front. Lambic sourness balances this beer wonderfully and the overall execution is superb! 
M: Medium/full body with almost flat carbonation.
O: Smooth, easy to drink, and just really enjoyable! The balance is just perfect. I was stoked to have had the opportunity to drink this beer at S&B while also purchasing a couple bottles for takeaway. I'm excited to see how this one ages as it is still quite young, but all in all a very enjoyable beer! 1,033 charactersspdyfire83, Jun 22, 2012

Appearance: Hazy, murky pour, the 1999 is noticeably thicker and darker. Both have a small white head and decent carbonation.
Smell: Both are incredibly fruity, although, and oddly, the 1999 smelled fresher to me than the 2011. Perfect balance of oak, funk and fruit in each, although the 2011 is a bit too much like jam. Both have a nice citrus element that somehow emphasizes the raspberries, of which there are plenty.
Taste: Both are delicious, with the 1999 being superior. It seemed to me that the 1999 might have spent more time in contact with the raspberries, hence its darker color and intensity, but that is just a prediction. Both have a nice dose of sour, funk, earth and oak.
Overall: both are good, debatable if they are worth the effort to acquire but that is a different story. We opened a rose de gambrinus next to these two bottles, it couldn't even look on them. I found the 1999 slightly better and it would be a 4.75 overall. 1,107 characterscraytonic, Jun 15, 2012

1999: Brownish and hazy with a thin off white head of small bubbles, low retnetion, no lacing.
2011: Pinking and hazy with a bright white head of small bubbles, some lacing, moderate retention, heavy carbonatoin.
1999: Oaky and funky in the nose, almost no fruit present in the aroma. Very 3F aroma though, no oxidation. Very aggressive and strong, lactic, mild succinic and acetic acidic, citric too.
2011: Very fruit forward, strong raspberries, still citric and funky, with oak and the others, the tartness is lower and the fruit is much much higher.
1999: The fruit is still in the body, a thin beer very tart with a nice finish and funk, strong 3F character but the overall beer is subdued.
2011: Very fruit forward, strong on the palate and stingy with the tartness and oak funk. A very nice beer, not as funky as the 99 but very much more fruity. 
It is hard for me to pick a winner but I guess I liked the newer one better. I think what makes the beer different from any other 3F sour is the fruit which was way way more forward in in the newer one. It would probably be better with a year or two on it but after more than a decade the 1999 is probably over the hill a little. 1,380 charactersdrabmuh, Jun 12, 2012

The 1999 vintage is hazy / murky and appears a darker shade of red, with some brown tones. The 2012 version is a beautiful, radiant ruby hue with a half inch of lilac head.
The aromas of the two beers are quite different. While both offer prominent raspberries, the older vintage is funkier, with basement and oak tones. The newer batch is fruity and fresh, with a light sweetness from the fruit.
The flavor of the '99 vintage is smooth, silky, funky. Lingering notes of oak. Slightly musty. A superb brew. The 2012 is a simpler fruit lambic, with raspberries shining through nicely atop classic Drie Fonteinen scents and flavors.
The '99 is quite a bit more tart than the fresh batch. The 2012 is fruity, lightly sweet, with a gentle acetic finish, whereas the older Framboos has more tartness and kick in the finish.
Overall, both vintages were delightful. What a treat. I'm so grateful for the experience. 957 charactersHuhzubendah, Jun 10, 2012

Pour is much darker when compared with the 2011. Slightly-murky copper-red with a short head. Nose is musty raspberry and earth. Light-moderate acidity. So smooth and earthy. Really fantastic. 
Previous 2011 vintage notes:
2011 vintage courtesy of GT2. Pours a moderately-cloudy light brown color with a pretty hefty pinkish-red hue. Short, tight head that recedes fairly quickly, leaving behind a thin collar. The nose has semi-ripe raspberries with mild acidity. Underneath that is a nice bit of earth and a touch of basement character. Lightly funky, though not nearly to the level of 3F geuze. Flavor has a light acidity carrying the raspberries past some underlying earth and a faint touch of bread. Body is medium with average carbonation and a dry, lightly-acidic finish. I prefer this to Gambrinus, but I’d still take a straight 3F Oude Geuze if given the choice between the two.

4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Vintage 1999- Drank this bottle side by side with the 2011 vintage; May 2012 
Pours a hazy pink/red color with a ring of white lace on top. Smell is fantastic raspberry vinegrette aroma that leaps instantly from the glass, along with a great woody seed character and a touch of acetone-like sharpness. Palate brought about an assertive acidity, but mellowed just enough to allow a much of the flavors to present themselves; very funky, a little acidic, & jammy. Mouthfeel was light with carbo being medium finishing dry. Overall leaves the mouth puckering with tart/sour goodness and wanting more. 
Vintage 2011 - Pours a murky red/burgundy with a little lace that fades quickly. Nose is similar to the Hommage with phenols, plastic, some funk, and mild woody notes; nothing over the top though. Flavor of raspberry, lemon, earthy and floral notes, funk, and oak. Light-bodied, with moderate carbonation and a tart, dry mouthfeel. Overall next to the vintage 1999; it's a step down! Hopefully with some age this will improve like the older Framboos vintages.

4.84/5  rDev +8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had this beer for the first time at the SB event and for the second time last Sunday during a nice BBQ in the sun.
Look: the beer pours a dark red color with a small head that disappears fast.
Smell: wow, just after opening the bottle, the raspberry smell is all over the place. This indeed is a true raspberry explosion. The nose is nicely sour and funk, full of raspberries, but also other red fruits like cherries are present.
Taste: Funk raspberry juice. Absolutely stunning. Never had so much fruit is a lambic as in this one. The fruit in the beer is perfectly balanced with the sourness of the lambic, and a hint of cherry bitterness. The lambic is still quite young though. Dry but very smooth in the aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Both bottles had different levels of carbonation; Medium and Medium low.
Overal: A perfectly balanced beer. I noticed some differences in the level of carbonation between the two bottles. But besides that, this beer is stunning. Again, if you want a more complex taste, take a geuze or let the Framboos age for several years, because the lambic is still a bit too young. But.... if you want to experience the best fresh fruit lambic ever made, drink it now! 1,190 charactersrvdoorn, May 30, 2012
4.46/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.55/26/2012
Thanks to rich for opening this long desired rarity. 2011 bottle date.
A: Very dark in color, a deep nebulous burgundy with a fast fading white head.
S: Fruit explosion, an amazing raspberry pie aroma with notes of seed and flesh and pie crust. Pleasant blend of vanilla and oak. Sweet and juicy fruit with leather, musty barnyard, and a touch of mushroom. Exceptional.
T: Moderately tart with big lactic notes. Nice acetic presence with monstrous raspberry character. Authentic flesh and seed notes. Leathery and earthy with light tannic notes and restrained barnyard character.
M: Medium body with upper low to lower medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is dry, sticky, and lightly tannic.
Overall: A very good Framboise with an exceptional aroma. I would have liked more carbonation but the low level of it was not detrimental. 843 charactersHopHead84, May 27, 2012
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The highly anticipated Framboos. We shared a few of these at the Sour & Bitter festival in Copenhagen last weekend. This was the main event, and it was nice to be able to have several glasses throught the evening.
From a 75cl bottle into a tumbler. 
Vintage: 2011
APPEARANCE: Pours a small, off-white head that quickly recedes to a swirling wisp and bubbly ring. Cloudy, hazy, carmine or dark red with no visible carbonation. Very opaque. A light wisp and ring remain until the end and leave some falling dots of lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: Very fresh still. Very fruity, with piles of fresh raspberries all over the place. A light touch of funky notes and some hints of cherries pull through, but this is all about the fresh red fruit. Semlls wonderful. 
TASTE: A light touch of funk up front, but the avalance of fresh raspberries soon steals the show. Very fruity and bold with lots of tart red fruit and a touch of cherry through the middle, into a lightly sour-bitter finish. Bold and lingering aftertaste with lots of tart raspberries, some light funky notes and a tick of floral bitterness. The fruit flavor on this is decadent.
PALATE: Medium body with medium carbonation. Surprisingly full and heavy on the palate, which I appreciate, goes down very smooth and finishes slightly dry. 
OVERALL: This was the star of the show tonight and it certainly put on a stunning performance. With awesome raspberry flavor all over the room, a light tartness and a touch of bitterness as balance, this beer was a real decadent treat. It is still very fresh at this point, so the nose and taste are almost completely dominated by the fruit. Given some time, however, it will mellow out a bit and allow the lambic to mature and play a larger roll. As a comparison, Hommage, which is also a raspberry lambic and has been maturing since 2007, is mellower and somewhat more complex now that the fruit has faded and the lambic has developed. Regardless, the increadibly bold flavors that Framboos brings to the table right now are a real treat, and I'm very glad my mate twisted my rubber arm and convinced me to attend the festival. It will be fun to see this beer develop over time as well. Thanks for bringing this one back from the grave Armand. This was phenomenal. 2,269 charactersJeffo, May 18, 2012
4.21/5  rDev -6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I was able to try the new version at Sour and Bitter. Poured from the bottle into a stemless wine glass.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy red with an amber hue. There is hardly any head to speak of.
Smell: This beer smells absolutely wonderful. Like fresh berry jam. I'm getting the raspberries, but also some strawberry notes. A nice sweetness compliments the berries.
Taste: Not as sweet as the smell. Mildly tart raspberries with some strawberry like notes as well. There isn't a whole lot of sourness in this beer, yet. There is some tart fruit in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with tingly carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: This is a very good beer, but I think it will get even better with age. It smells absolutely wonderful. 740 charactersoline73, May 17, 2012

4.89/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5'99 vintage. Review #1000. Words cannot express the gratitude due both to the ridiculously generous friend of mine who shared this and to Hopstoopid120 for letting me know that it was about to be opened. Thanks guys.
A: The label is a bit wrinkled but still in great shape, and the cork (which let out a highly satisfying pop upon opening) was remarkably pristine. This bottle has been cellared on its side since being purchased directly from the brewery way back when (for no more than $5!), and the proper care really shows. It pours a beautiful amber-rose colored body topped by a substantial cap of delicately frothy off-white foam that never entirely goes away. The only flaw is the presence of a sizable amount of sediment, but this quickly settles to the bottom of the glass and doesn't bother me too much. 
S: Pure fruit lambic nirvana. Juicy raspberry aroma just leaps out of the wine glass, backed up by bracing acidity (mostly lactic, but there's definitely a bit of acetic action going on, which complements the fruit nicely), sour citrus fruitiness, and a terrific background of grassy, earthy funk. It's way cleaner than I expected for a 3F brew, as the earthiness is closer to flint than dirt and there's no real cheesiness to speak of. Instead, this is a positive celebration of well-integrated fruit and acidity. I can't believe how fresh and vibrant it smells, even after a dozen years.
T: It's sharply acidic up front, with mellow raspberry, lemon, and grassiness following close behind. There's a touch of oak on the finish that lends both structure (via some noticeable tannins) and balance (via a lovely hint of vanilla that helps cut the serious sourness). The finish is medium-long, and delicately fruity. Pure deliciousness.
M: Lively, surprisingly effervescent medium body; I definitely didn't expect such an old beer to retain so much zest, and it might even be a bit too frothy. Still wonderful, though.
O: Needless to say I never though I'd get a chance to try this beer, and I certainly didn't think it could live up to the hype. It did. It easily surpassed 05 St. Lamvinus as my favorite fruit lambic of all time, and absolutely put Dirty Horse to shame (how can I not compare these two uber-whales, both of which I absolutely lucked into trying within the last few months?). The raspberry has really stuck around admirably, and the overall balance, integration, and complexity of this beer is unreal. It's terrifyingly close to perfection, which only makes its scarcity all the more saddening. Armand is brewing again, though...

4.74/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle generously shared by hoppymeal - Derek, you never cease to amaze me with your abilities to dig up such amazing brews. Served in a Michigan Brewer's Guild tulip glass. The mythical 1999 vintage.
A - Pours with a half-finger of quick-dissolving white foam that settles to a thick collar, but leaves behind no lace. Hazed orange-brown body with a hint of ruby to it. There's significantly more sediment than the 3F Hommage we had shortly afterward. Still, the carbonation seems to have held up quite well, even after 12 years in the bottle.
S - The first thing that I noticed is that there is still insane amounts of raspberry goodness - somehow the fruit has persisted, even as it has vanished from numerous younger fruit lambics. The raspberry is of the slightly over-ripe variety, and mingles with red wine vinegar and acetobacter, light signature Drie Fonteinen funk, and hints of oak and vanilla. As it warms there is a faint malted grain backdrop and perhaps *gasp* an oxidized note, so I wouldn't really recommend cellaring this much longer. Still - rumors of its decline have been greatly exaggerated.
T - The taste is actually superior, with significantly more sourness, acetobacter, and light lactic acid in the finish. No noticeable oxidation, and significant pucker from the tart, rich and, slightly funky raspberry flavors. Just superb stuff in any case.
M - Extremely dry, with a tannic finish. It literally rips the moisture from your mouth. Medium bodied, with medium-low carbonation. Tooth-coating residual sugars. My stomach started churning almost immediately from the acidity. Could use more bubbles, but for a 12-year old beer it's doing pretty good.
D - I initially wrote that this wasn't significantly better than Hommage - then I tried Hommage and realized I was totally wrong. It's perhaps too sour to drink in mass quantities, and the the rarity and price tag make it unlikely I'd ever be able to have more than 2oz. Still, it's clearly a superior lambic that has held up quite impressively, even after 12 years. As much as I nursed my glass, it emptied depressingly quickly. 2,110 charactersMasterSki, Apr 18, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Mega Tasting III, 1999 vintage, 750ml bottle. Words cannot express the huge awesomeness that this day has brought. Derek, you are the f'n man. Poured into RBSG 2010 tulip. 
A - Pours a muddled brownish color, white head, no lacing, and some spotty whisps on top here and there. 
S - Raspberry puree sweetness, nice funk, lactic acidic notes, some oak. The raspberry is so pronounced it's unlike anything I've ever had. Not overly sour, just right, and very tart. The cheesey funk is there, but it doesn't overpower or overtake the raspberry at all. 
T - Wow. Funky raspberry bomb! Nice sour/tart notes, moreso then the nose, which is excellent. Vinegar, acidic wine notes, and oak in there as well. The finish is funky with a tart bite on the end that leaves your lips puckered. Just amazing how the raspberry is still there after 12 years. 
M - Light, very soft carbonation, dry finish. 
D - Simply impressive. The raspberry is all over this one, which truthfully, I wasn't expecting after all these years. Destroys all other sour raspberry beers with ease and just excellent. Will I ever have it again? Probably not...how sad. 1,133 charactersSean9689, Apr 16, 2011

750ml corked and caged bottle.
pours slightly hazy red-brown, growing more hazy toward the end of the bottle. a thin ring of fine off-white bubbles forms, dropping slowly and leaving a few spots of lace.
aroma is awesome. tart raspberry. bit of spice. horse blanket funk. light leather. caramel and toffee. bit of lemon and malt vinegar, but the fruit is the star of this show. bit of other dark fruit - sour cherry, date, and fig. the berry comes out even more as it warms, showing even more depth. earthy. hint of raw oak. white bread and cracker.
taste is great. much like the aroma, but more acidity comes through. the depth isn't quite as full as in the aroma, but it's still pretty great. great berry character that gets even better as it warms.
mouthfeel is excellent. just under medium body with a nice dry finish. medium carbonation level.
drinkability is great. great balance. restrained but prominent sourness and acidity. great berry character. wow, this is one damn good beer! if only there were an endless supply available... 1,097 charactersgrub, Feb 04, 2011

Big thanks to henrik for letting me have the pleasure of prying this from his hands.
A: Pours a nice reddish pink with a thin white head. Lite on the retention and a few spots of lace.
S: Subtle yet wonderful aromas. Tart berry and oak. Hints of vinegar as well.
T: Tart raspberry and hints of mulberry. Mild oak with a nice lactic quality. Sour without being too much, a mild vinegar note. No oxidation at all.
M: Nice and crisp, perfect carbonation, with a nice tartness from the middle through the finish.
Those who say this one is past its prime are wrong. 630 characterstpd975, Dec 07, 2010
4/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Vintage 1999 - the last true Drie Fonteinen Framboos. Sampled at a private party at GABF.
Poured an nice cloudy pink with a light pink head.
The aroma was of full brettanomyces barnyard funk, lactic acid, and reasonably bright strawberries.
The flavor was moderately tart for a DF beer. The strawberry flavor was reasonably pronounced. The beer had a clean biscuity and wheaty malt backbone (very subtle, but nice). As amazing and rare as this beer was, I must admit that I felt it was past its prime. It did taste slightly stale. I can only imagine how wonderful it was 5 years ago.
The carbonation was medium and the mouthfeel was light. I suspect the age had something to do with the carbonation being a little low for a lambic. 735 charactersSacoDeToro, Oct 16, 2007
5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is the drie fonteinen Framboos/Framboise enjoyed (thanks to JorisPPattyn and MartinT) with MartinT, kimchee, Oakes and Tiggmtl. As Joris points out, this is refermented in bottle. The vintage is 1986 and I swear this bottle is like 1 inch thick. The cork looks completely ravaged like in an horror movie. Apparent soil lie everywhere under the cage which is barely holding in place. There is no label on this bottle, the vintage is written with chalk, simply Despite its age, it opens up with a serious pop. A nice off-white to pink head forms over the top of the reddish, pinkish orange body. Such a head seems like a mirage from the past and scores an easy 5. The aroma is totally unique and exploding of raspberries. They hit the deep end of your nose and penetrate your brain and you know when it happens that the smell will haunt your memories for a while. It feels very dessert-like, wet, creamy. Some sweetness seems to come from the vanilla notes. Its earthy, leafy with leathery peaks. Very complex lemon and citrus complement the lactic tartness and funky brettanomyces character. In mouth, its definitely the most lactic beer ive ever had. Extremely dry and fruity, dusty out-of-date yoghourt. Potent lemon juice with the wheaty acidity really coming out. With the slightest effort (and its really not that demanding actually), you grasp all the typical barnyardy and horsey characteristics. Aftertaste is long, tart, astringent, salivating, begging for more, but begging to let this moment be enjoyed for a while. Medium bodied, very dry and with medium to high carbonation which seems like a miracle. Once youll have tried it youll know, but its one of those beers that is such a labyrinth of flavors and at the same time keeps such a nice focus that its just adorable and deserves to be seeked out and tried to be believed. It's hard to paint in words all the nuances a brewer can attain when exploiting his full brewing art potential. 1,970 charactersRastacouere, May 24, 2004
4.83/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Available, and sampled from the Bottle in the Drie Fonteinen Café, Beersel.
Traditional Raspberry lambic is very rare, sure weve all heard of Framboos, but this is the real stuff. Originally, the whole purpose of producing fruit lambics was to utilize & not to waste excess from a years fruit crops. Obviously the whole fruit was added. Of course these days  syrups, flavorings & all sorts of things are added. Drie Fonteinen make no such short cuts, they add whole Raspberries from Ternat which are some of the very best available, and it shows.
Drie Fonteinen offers this style in two formats;
Draft in the Café at 5.0% ABV, and Bottled at 6.0% ABV.
The two have some differences.
From the Bottle. A 750ml green glass bottle has a simple looking cream colored label that has Framboos & other information written in dark green lettering. Quite a basic presentation, but this is traditional after all, & it would be beneath Drie Fonteinen to have a gimmicky label  anyways, it does not need one.
Once the cage & cork are removed this beer positively oozes a steamy looking white gunsmoke. There is a lot of energy trapped in this beer.
The head is massive as the Framboos is poured into glass, & even a restrained pour does nothing to stop the frothy monster racing up the glass sides. It takes a while to slowly settles, the head activity is huge & the bubbles burst with a random effervescent pattern. Looks very appetizing. The head is slightly darker than the draft version, a deeper pink.
A turbid salmon-pink colored beer that has much higher inherent carbonation than the draft version & positively dances in the mouth, huge mouthfeel & massive similarities to drinking champagne.
Aromas are intensely fruity & not surprisingly of Raspberries. Quite something, really fruity with some sweetness, but the acidity is much higher than the draft version.
Tastes are quite simply mind-blowing. The quintessential traditional raspberry fruit lambic & the epoch of Framboos. Extremely drinkable beer, I note that the bottled version has a higher strength than the draft version, due mainly to refermentation in the bottle. Acidic, smooth, sharp, some sweetness in the middle, but the astringent cheek pulling puckering finish is to die for. 
The King of Framboos  probably the Best traditional Framboos in the World.
