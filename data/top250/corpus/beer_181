Aroma was chocolate and boozy with some sweetness. Flavor was still a little hot from the abv but still delicious. Lots of bourbon, chocolate and some vanilla. Drank a little lighter Thani expected. Overall really enjoyable. 308 charactersStevem68, Apr 30, 2017

5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance- The beer was a murky jet black color with a deep mocha colored head. 
Smell - There is a ton of chocolate with ready barrel aging influence. 
Taste - It seems like Hershey bar in liquid form. The bourbon lays perfectly balanced undertone. Vanilla and burnt sugar hints lay under the layers of chocolate. The beer is not overly sweet or cloying. It improves as it warms, and leaves traces of chocolate in the aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel- The chocolate is so smooth with little carbonation. 
Overall - Perfect. 519 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jan 23, 2017

I have had Black Tuesday and although I can't say for sure since I didn't have them side by side, I think I like this one better. I think the addition of cacoa nibs and vanilla beans actually adds a nice element to the beer. This probably borders on being more of a liqueur than a beer but all I know is it was a damn fine experience. 406 charactersmjpolzin, Nov 26, 2016

The taste did not disappoint:  rich chocolate with fleeting whiskey, vanilla, cherry, and coffee notes. A full and creamy mouthfeel with a slight stickiness on the finish. Also a comfortable warming on the end. Mostly chocolate here - look forward to comparing newer bottles. 492 charactersBuck89, Sep 02, 2016
4.61/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.752016 Chocolate Rain.  I've had it on tap and bottle and it's fantastic and consistent.  This beer pours dark brown, and not pitch black like many stout chasers enjoy.  I love aesthetics, but with stouts just need to be dark. Darker better? meh.
The nose is quite inviting.  The vanilla and bourbon just screams dessert.  Hints of roasty malt and oats, and some earthiness. 
Take a sip.  Bourbon whiskey, dark chocolate and subtle vanilla flood the palate. Definite barrel, but just perfectly balanced and smooth for the heat level.  Not a nilla bomb, not a chocolate beer... its just so dang balanced.  
Thin feel, but great coat and nothing lacking in experience.  Smooth warmth from the ABV makes it's presence known but blends in quickly.
Overall, this might be my favorite weekday stout from the Bruery.  I prefer some sweetness to my stouts, and if do too, fine one! 875 charactersDjc410, Aug 31, 2016

4.85/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75My 900th review, and I am so stoked to finally try this beer. The beer is dark brown/black with a one finger tan head and good retention considering the high ABV. The head is creamy and foamy and left a little lace on the glass. 
N: Rich chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, wood, espresso, roasted malt notes, biscuit, yeasty, citrus, molasses, brown sugar, floral, resin, and earthy notes. 
T: Huge dark chocolate flavors, vanilla, rich espresso, lots of roasted malts notes, biscuit, yeast, citrus, molasses, resin, earthy, and some floral,
M: Creamy, chewy, sticky, warming, and full body. 
O: Oh my goodness the chocolate flavor is huge and the vanilla just makes a nice accompaniment to this beer.  I definitely got the warming from the alcohol, but could not tell it was this big of a monster. Absolutely a fantastic beer hands down one of my Top Ten. I want to get a couple bottles of this and age it for quite a while, I bet 5 years it would be awesome. 958 characterscolts9016, Aug 13, 2016

5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Well I guess its time for the 3rd perfect score.  We're almost up to 1900 reviews, might as well break this one out.
I've had this at least a dozen times now, for good reason.  I love it.  
Pours substantially brown and black, perhaps less black than black tuesday because of the heavy amount of chocolate addition to it.  The forced carbonation does wonders as it always has at least a full inch of brown head on the top of it.  Poured into tulip glasses while in the oversized jacuzzi tub or hot tub outdoors, this one proudly has a 100% score rating with the ladies afterwards.
Well you can't get a bigger chocolate aroma than this .  Rogue Double Chocolate, Southern Tier Choklat, they come close.  But this gets even better as the bourbon, vanilla, oak and sugar round out the chocolate experience.
Wow, its a warm one, definitely you feel the warmth as it slides down the throat, but there is no burn, so much sweetness and chocolate that it prevents that.  Sticky mouthfeel and cling, the bourbon and chocolate never fade, never relent.  
Even the vanilla won't take a back seat on this.  I guess the oak kind of does, being that everything else is more substantial, but dont downplay the oak, it has a good rounding quality for everything else.  
If your lady loves chocolate, you owe it to her and your dick to pop a bottle of this when its just you two (or three if she's cool and brings a friend).  YMMV. 1,420 charactersrodbeermunch, May 30, 2016

I was expecting something more along the lines of Mocha Wednesday in comparison to Black Tuesday, but the differences are very subtle.  The pour is surprisingly thin, but still maintains some of its carbonation.  The smell is similar to Black Tuesday: molasses, bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate; with an emphasis on the last two.  
With three years on it, I was expecting something less hot, but the booze is still pretty hot up front. The taste is pretty smooth.  It is quite sweet and much like the nose, the vanilla and chocolate are more subtle aftertastes.  The chocolate does linger on the palette after each sip, which is a fantastic touch.
Overall, I do like it better than Black Tuesday, but I would rather have a Mocha Wednesday. 769 charactersnawpnawp, May 18, 2016

Plenty of bourbon and chocolate fountain on the nose. Sweet vanilla bourbon, turbinado sugar, molasses, and dark chocolate (the good kind) in the taste. The mouthfeel is about as viscous as you can imagine and breathes out ethanol. Delicious and in need of many more years in the bottle. 387 charactersRockjocknroll, Mar 28, 2016

A:  Poured into a snifter to a deep black with a small tan head that fades to a collar around the edge of the glass leaving minimal lacing
S:  Smells of chocolate and bourbon barrel influence with notes of caramel and vanilla.  Good bit of alcohol on the nose as well with some slight oak
T:  Taste is lots of chocolate with some alcohol, some slight caramel and vanilla with a hint of oak. After warming up there's some coffee and light roasted malt notes as well.  Swallowing this one brings on even more layers of delicious chocolatey goodness.  Lingering bourbon notes as well. 
M:  fairly big in the mouth with soft carbonation and a drying finish from the alcohol.
O:  Absolutely incredible.  Easily one of the best beers I've ever had.  Drinks deceptively well for the ABV and the flavors are just off the charts awesome. 843 charactersSHODriver, Mar 13, 2016

A: Pours pitch black with no head retention, no lacing, average amount of carbonation streaming up the sides, looks a little more carbonated that other barrel aged stouts, looks pretty oily.
A: Lots of bourbon, toasted coconut, getting a hint of oak, not getting any chocolate, just tons of bourbon, toasted coconuts and some alcohol coming through on the nose, has a lot of aroma. 
T: Big hit of bourbon, toasted coconut, hint of oak, some brown sugar sweetness, some heat from the alcohol and bourbon, touch of chocolate sweetness in the aftertaste, incredibly smooth for the ABV but there is some heat on the aftertaste. Chocolate is  the prevailing note in the aftertaste. Lots of flavors, big flavors.
M: Big oily mouthfeel, heavy bodied, perhaps the heaviest bodied beer I may have ever tasted. 
O: A huge beer, with huge flavors, huge mouthfeel, it's amazingly drinkable for 18 % ABV but it does creep up on you. This bottle is almost three years old and probably could have been cellared longer, it has held up pretty good, but I think the chocolate has faded a bit as it's not as prevalent as I was expecting. Overall a world class. 1,237 charactersBrolo75, Jan 02, 2016

Well its typical dark as midnight RIS Typical blow open your nasal passages Bruery great smelling Stout coffee malt sweetness in the air. This sucker has an alcohol kick at first but once it warms up its as complex a beer the Bruery makes may oh may this lives up to the hype. 2015 vintage received in my first  preservation society allotment and surly hope its this years 1st qt  beer again for 2016! 582 charactersmaxifunk777, Dec 25, 2015

4.24/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.252014 bottle from yesterday's share.
Talk about a beer that looks like a booze! Pouring this beer is like pouring a whiskey, just like Mocha Wednesday, Black Tuesday, and Grey Monday were. There was almost no head to speak of after the beer was poured and the only lacing was just the legs from the alcohol content. In the glass, the beer is almost black. On the nose, there is an assault of big, sweet, and boozy characteristics. There was a ton of brown sugar sweetness and little bit of chocolate, both of which were mostly dominated by a strong alcohol scent of whiskey and barrel. When the first sip hits the tongue, the alcohol is instantly noticeable burn. The rest of the drink is a sweet combination of vanilla, oak, chocolate, and just a touch of marshmallow. At the back end of the drink, the chocolate kicks in again a little stronger and is quickly accompanied by the alcohol flavor and burn that is the lingering characteristic. Mouthfeel on this one is more like a liqueur than a beer, with hardly any carbonation and a sticky, boozy, warming sensation as it goes down.
Overall, this was in line with its brethren in the days of the week series; big, boozy, sweet, and a little overrated. The beer itself it more of a novelty than a normal beer, and it drinks like a sweet, strong liqueur. Take this down with a few friends, otherwise, you'll be lucky to remember anything about this beer. 1,405 charactersboilermakerbrew, Dec 13, 2015

3.52/5  rDev -20.5%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours a dark brown, almost black color, with a fizzy, hazelnut brown lacing, immediately collapsing to a tiny film at the edge of the glass.
Has a profound milk chocolate aroma, blending into coconut shell and flowery, warming vanilla. Its vanilla quality grows more profound, once detected, complimenting earthy oak and fudge, with a fizzy coca-cola sweetness. 
Features almost no carbonation, exhibiting a smooth, big body, due to a hot, profound oakiness, balanced by burned earth and a flowery quality.
Begins with toffee supported vanilla bean among scorched earth and bitter chocolate chips. The Bourbon barrel adds a warming glow to the tongue, which amazingly enough never turns hot or boozy, as well as spiced, dry wood bark. Mocha sweetness, together with rock sugar and a pleasant chocolate bitterness create a thrilling interplay, wrapped up by the omnipotent barrel, including a huge amount of vanilla. Finishes with a mix of earthen malts and a spicy dryness, creating a palate challenging finish, which lasts on the tongue for minutes. After that dryness, a late caramel coated milk chocolate quality evolves, creating a mellowing, silk last impression. 
While its nose features a focussed, minimalistic approach, the beers full potential unfolds on the palate, in all its heavy-bodied facetts. It is certainly well executed, but for my personal taste, this is just a tad too over the top. Its richness overburdens my palate, it needs to chill down for a couple of minutes after each sip, which is basically not how a beer works for me. This is closer to being a liquour for me, on which I can sip from time to time. We split the bottle through three people and had problems to finish it. 1,707 charactersaleigator, Dec 06, 2015

Very dark brown in color, not black as I would have expected. Head diminished quickly. 
Overall flavor profile was nice, but I could not get beyond the cloying sweetness… I expected this beer to be sweet, but it was above and beyond what I had expected. Flavor notes of chocolate, raisin, vanilla, molasses. 
The alcohol was hidden well. Although you knew it was a big beer, I didn’t think it drank like it was 18%+. 
Overall, I was happy to try this one but I was not a huge fan of it. I would not seek it out. 553 charactersinvertalon, Nov 16, 2015
4.68/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This is hands down my favorite Breuery beer so far (have not had Tuesday yet). It is not nearly as hot as some of the other high abv offerings. In fact, I would say at 18.4 % it drinks more like 11-12. 
Tons of sweet chocolate, vanilla, oak, and brown sugar. Nice, smooth bourbon compliment.  It is sweet without being too rich or cloying. Like a bourbon infused chocolate mouse or cream pie. The body is outstanding.  This is truly a world class beer and a must experience one. 478 charactersWesMantooth, Nov 16, 2015

The look (upon pour) was extremely dark with a small amount of head and lacing. The smell is similar to Black Tuesday; I got heavy vanilla, cocoa and semi-sweet chocolate on the nose. The flavor of chocolate really takes over here! I also noticed caramel and molasses in addition to the smells aforementioned above. The mouthfeel is definitely full bodied with low carbonation. Overall this beer is surprisingly easy to drink given its super high ABV. This one definitely lived up to the hype in my opinion. Worth seeking out, cheers! 593 characterstregan_20, Nov 12, 2015

Sweet aroma with some alcohol esters precedes an even boozier and markedly sweet flavor.
Near cloying sweet level.

T- big blast of sweetness hits the palate with tons of dark chocolate, cocoa, melted marshmallow, vanilla cream, bourbon barrel, toasted oak, caramel, melted toffee, chocolate cake.  Boozy finish with notes of port wine on then linger 
M- medium-heavy body with low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel and a warming boozy finish

L - Pitch black. Slight dark brown on the edges. No head at all.
S - Massive sweet bourbon and chocolate with marshmallow and a touch of alcohol. 
T - Very sweet with that bourbon barrel which is overpowering everything else. I've had Black Tuesday and I will say that this has some more candy-like, sugary flavors. There's definitely a chocolate presence. but I wouldn't say there is a vanilla bean flavor as I interpret it as more of a sugary vanilla extract which just adds to the overkill of sweetness from the bourbon.
F - I mean, it's an 18.00% BBA stout and it feels as such. The sweetness can get cloying, but I don't care that much. It's very sticky with some alcohol presence, but I expect that with such a gargantuan beer.
O - This is, as expected, a giant BA Bruery beer. It has the roasted notes and alcohol of Black Tuesday, but the chocolate and vanilla flavors are most definitely there to add complexity and even a dessert-like component to this. I think the alcohol taste can be a bit much, but it still is subdued for 18.00%. This is a sipper for sure with enough confectionery notes to add complexity to the base Black Tuesday and make Chocolate Rain its own being. 1,203 charactersThrewRedButter, Oct 10, 2015

A total package stout.
Huge vanilla notes and chocolate whifs with dangerously smooth bourbon notes. This beer is complete, it needs nothing more, it was a little thin but it needed to be. Huge oak and vanilla, again and again. Good lacing from cold to warm. Pitch black monster from the chocolate depths!
I was so pleasantly surprised by this beer. Very thankful to finally conquer this brew! Fantastic.

A hot mess with no huge whifs of any fudge or chocolate or vanilla.

Opened this bottle with 3 other people. Probably a good thing since it is so big. Pour a thick black body with pretty much no head. Huge sweet cocoa aroma. Almost overwhelming taste. Just a ton of cocoa and vanilla with lots of bourbon. It has a pretty strong bite on the tongue. You can tell there is a lot of alcohol. Still, I very much so enjoyed this beer. 384 characterskkleu357, Aug 18, 2015

No head on the pour but it pours viscous like a dessert liqueur. The color is dark brown with amber hues. Laciness over the body. 3.75
Barleywine meets imperial stout. Very thick with malt of the chocolate and caramel variety but also raisin-y. Oatmeal cookie and tobacco and barrel aromas. 4.25
Maple syrup like flavor with a bold oak taste and rich chocolate. Vanilla and cocoa join the mix. Lots of sweet flavors swirl into a syrupy flavor. 4.25
Yeah, it's syrupy and sweet, viscous and almost entirely lacking in carbonation. Approaches a digestif in feel. 4
Tasty but man, this is sweet and syrupy. 659 charactersONovoMexicano, Aug 16, 2015

Like bourbon soaked brownie batter with some vanilla. Taste follows suit with dark fruits popping. I'm not sure where that 19.5 percent alcohol is, but it's dangerous. Medium full mouthfeel with a nice warming on the backend. Slightly better than black Tuesday. Amazing stuff if you have a sweet tooth 388 characterswinningwes91, Aug 13, 2015

L - Medium dark brown with minimal tan head that dissipates quickly.
S - Very heavy bourbon with a bit of chocolate/vanilla sweetness.
T - Bourbon up front followed by delicious sweet chocolate, a bit of vanilla, and some faint coffee. 
F - Thinner than I would have liked, but typical of a lot of barrel aged stouts, and light carbonation.
O - This was my first big Bruery stout and it did not disappoint. For such a high ABV, I was surprised at the minimal amount of alcohol "burn." Definitely a decadent, slow sipper and a must try. 579 charactersSoCal_Matt, Aug 06, 2015

4.24/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a dark brown with little lacing. Surprisingly htwo finger.head which disappeared quickly. I had this one night after drinking regular bourbon county and there are similarities here like the way the big bourbon flavor shines through. This one has more chocolate. Milk chocolate candy bar doesn't dominate the flavor but clings to my throat after each sip. There is a fair amount of fruit as well in the flavor an especially in the nose. You get bourbon soaked figs and raisins, but I'm also getting juicier fruits as well, possibly cherries and plums. Coconut is present, but you have to look for it. Sweet molasses too. The mouth feel is really good. It's thin but that's to be expected with this ABV. It still clings to palate which enhances each sip. The carbonation seems just right and the feel is smooth and silky. The vanilla is not prominent. Maybe it has faded since this is the 2013 vintage. The high ABV is a great feature and really sets this beer apart. You don't taste the alcohol burn, but the warming sensation is very nice. I would love to try this again but with so many barrel aged stouts out there, I don't think I'll be looking to trade for it in the near future. 1,189 charactersdanh53, Jul 26, 2015

Smell-TONS of sweet chocolate, booze, and vanilla.
Taste-Loads of milky chocolate upfront, faint notes of caramel, vanilla, some coconut in there as well, and a slight touch of alcohol but nowhere near the level you might except from a beer this big.
Feel-Very thick and creamy, very faint carbonation.
Overall-This beer is a wonderful treat, hopefully i'll be lucky enough to try it again sometime. 523 charactersSteveB24, Jun 23, 2015

Nose is big burbon, chocolate, black malt, sweet base malt. Taste is huge and complex, big burbon, alcohol warmth, dark chocolate, sweet grain. So deep and so complex it's amazing. Mouthfeel was considerably lighter than expected, sitting on a bottle for a year or 2 is recommended to thicken, sweeten, and blend the body and tastes.

Obviously this is a very dark beer with very little head, low carb, and fairly thin. These characteristics are typical for the big Bruery stouts. 
Unlike the other big Bruery stouts, this has an incredibly complex chocolaty nose and taste. The bourbon is there but takes a back stage. The chocolate comes through big time and the taste is like chocolate milk that is infused with majestic bourbon barrel. Kind of sweet but delicious, not syrupy and a little silky. The booze is non-existence but I only had a portion of the bottle. I would certainly drink more, but a 1/4 of the bottle is perfect, leaves you wanting more and totally content at the same time.
I was very impressed, I will obtain another and enjoy the hell out of it. 786 charactersmacher0, Jun 15, 2015

4.82/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Many thanks to RipRap for this bottle; yet another beer I felt compelled to track down after mouthing it at a tasting. Big 750ML bottle, vintage 2014, with the trademark Bruery label & gold wax, split with my wife. 
The pour is as expected: minimally carbed, and black as the soul of Adrian Peterson with a maple branch in his hand (or a Twitter account). Smells like chocolate milk that’s been doctored with 268 proof something or other: boozy. Not complex or great, but lovely.
Chocolate Rain is something I’d never carry an umbrella for. The first thing I notice is how toasty I am after taking my first sip, as the alcohol burns a warm track all the way down. I hope it doesn’t feel like that coming out. Massive chocolate notes & enough bourbon to sanitize a moderately dangerous wound leap out of the morass. Big-ass vanilla that would have dominated any other beer doesn’t show up until the mid-palate: damn, I’m drunk already. Fudge, oak, gold star maple syrup. The end is all booze & chocolate. Thicker than my…well, thick. Ridiculously drinkable. I’m not sure I would survive taking an entire bottle myself, but damn, I’d like to try. Then try again. 
If ever a beer deserved to have the word ‘decadent’ tattooed into its foamy head, it would be C Rain. This is a boozy, chocolate, bourbony, TNT of a beer. It’s also fantastic & fully deserving of… what was I saying? My wife is now speaking tongues. That’s a good sign. Without question a top-shelf beer. 1,494 charactersmaximum12, May 31, 2015

750 mL bottle to snifter
A:  Cola-brown in color, not as oily-viscous as Black Tuesday - not sure if its the added ingredients or something with the process, but the viscosity is clearly reduced.  A wispy, soda-like head dissipates and leaves almost no trace of lacing.
S:  The added cocoa is prominent - smells like opening a box of chocolate truffles laced in booze.  The molasses undertone that anchored Black Tuesday is replaced by sugary vanilla.    Chocolate pie meets beer.
T:  The flavors are less a confectionery treat and more beer-like, although it's a still a decadent sip.   Easily parsed notes of vanilla and chocolate are balanced by oak, lots of booze and a touch of a leafy hops.  Finishes long and sweet.
M:  Rich and creamy, but not as oily and sticky as its Black Tuesday progenitor.
Just as decadent and delicious as Black Tuesday, but with the added ingredients slightly more drinkable. 925 charactersrand, Apr 08, 2015

L: Pours with a light swirly mocha head. Oily blackness.
S: Intense aroma of milk and dark chocolate, dark fruit, figs, vanilla, oak, freshly baked cookies and smores. An exciting beer to whiff over and over. 
T: Wow. Vanilla, brownies, chocolate and cookie dough hit at the front of the tongue, with oak and an almost white chocolate character at the back. There's some slight bitter stout roastiness and bourbon flavor in the mix, but it's barely detectable and it works well to balance out and dial down the sweetness. 
F: 18.4% ABV...  I don't understand how Bruery does it. Vanilla, brownie fudge and oak coat the tongue, and while you can feel a good amount of heat as it goes down... it's by no means harsh and finishes really clean for how big of a beer it is. 
Overall: A well-rounded, stunningly delicious and decadent world-class barrel aged imperial stout. 932 charactersmig100, Apr 05, 2015

The smell is amazing, the chocolate is the first thing that hits your nose, followed by the bourbon.  The taste follows the smell, with the chocolate up front along with bourbon and finishes with a subtle vanilla finish.  I'm not sure how they hid the 19 percent, you will need help, because it is sweet. 395 charactersskiking70, Apr 05, 2015

Poured black with a light brown head which quickly diminished.
Nose had bourbon, oak, and chocolate.
Flavor started with caramel, chocolate and bourbon initialy. Chocolate increased as it warmed and oxidized. Vanilla, dark fruit and brown sugar also increased as it warmed.
Chocolate is the dominant flavor, but its balanced enough to allow other aspects of the beer to be appreciated. 436 charactersjohn0721, Mar 29, 2015

4.11/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25I tried this 2013 vintage chilled in a nonic from the 750ml. Enjoyed at the looking forward to spring stout tasting.
The color is dark brown with ruby hues when held to the light with light beige head with fine bead. The smell has a dark sugar and cocoa/fig-like earthy and raisiny aroma with slight alcohol odor. The feel is intense, big bold with rich viscous texture and more alcohol than average yet not over the top for the abv.
The taste is like a raisinette -mostly raisin with some chocolate in the taste  which is more on the dark cocoa side with a slight yeast flavor  and sweet dark sugar and vinous elements with a slight alcohol flavor that lasts after the swallow with so much residual sugar it leaves my lips sweet and I can taste the intensity as I lick them. This is one of the most intensely rich beers I have ever had -so much sweet qualities with strong alcohol in the taste which is the only drawback for me. 931 charactersSlatetank, Mar 16, 2015

It poured surprisingly thin compared to what I've been accustomed to with Briery releases.  It's still thick, but not motor oil thick.  There's also a little light that passes through it, giving it a dark brown appearance.  
Aroma is dessert in a glass.  Fudge brownies and vanilla bean. 
This one met my high expectations.   It's sweet and chocolatey.  Boozey, but at 18% not as bad as I'd expect.  I'm thrilled that it's not cloyingly sweet like a lot of these Bruery releases are.  It seriously tastes like a fudge brownie a la mode.  So good. 
It's thicker than it appears.  Soft, good carbonation.  Boozey and a sipper. Sweet through and through. 
I'm glad this also lived up to the hype.  I've been dying to try this one for years and was not disappointed. 780 charactersVonerichs, Feb 22, 2015

Looks still and black as oil.
Smell is out of this world. Sweet chocolate, potent bourbon and a tannic barrel presence. Truly amazing.
Flavor was great, as well. I think being open all night helped burn off some of the alcohol and open it up into something truly decadent. 
Mouthfeel was nice. There was just enough carbonation left to scrub the palate and keep the sweetness from being cloying. 
Overall, I liked this beer a lot. Mocha Wednesday still edged it slightly, but it just goes to show how proper aging can vault a beer up in quality. 673 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Jan 07, 2015
4.09/5  rDev -7.7%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle: Poured a dark brown/black color ale with a small foamy head with minimal retention and some light lacing. Aroma of black chocolates with quite a bit of residual sugar notes. Taste is also dominated by black chocolate notes with loads of residual sugar and a spicy finish. Vanilla notes are more subtle but kind of help smooth some of the rough edges of this beer. Body is about average for style with medium carbonation and warming alcohol can be detected. Big beer or sure that need to be split up between a couple of people, but very enjoyable beer nonetheless. 571 charactersPhyl21ca, Jan 06, 2015

A- pours a not quite, black with a mahogany shimmer in the light. Not much head and it fades off pretty quickly
S- booze, caramel, chocolate, toffee, some dark fruit. Really nice
T- Wow! Incredibly complex. You get some sweet acidity from fruits on the first part of the sip before the booze and toffee comes in followed by caramel and chocolate and more booze. Really sweet. 
M- A bit pricklier than I would of thought. Rounds out into a medium, creamy feel. Not quite cloyingly sweet, but very close. 
O- this beer was well worth the wait. Definite sipper and oh so tasty. 619 charactersJamesStreet, Jan 01, 2015

Pitch black pour with a quickly fading one finger caramel-colored head with minimal lacing.  The nose is huge chocolate fudge and booze, along with hints of vanilla, dark fruit, dark chocolate, and did I mention booze.  The taste is bold and super rich with once again, lots of booze.  Hints of vanilla, oak, dark fruit, maple, molasses, espresso, caramel, leather, tobacco, and milk chocolate.  The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy with low carbonation and a great warming finish.  It approaches cloying, and it's definitely a sipper, but still incredibly drinkable for such a big beer.  Overall, yes, it's hot and boozey, but it's so good!  Much more upside than down.  Highly recommended! 747 charactersbeerdrifter, Dec 05, 2014

The pour is a transluscent medium brown, becoming opaque once in the glass, nearly black. The head is unique for a stout of this magnitude.. light mocha brown and 3 fingers in height, but fizzy and effervescent, dissapating quickly to nothing, leaving no retention or lacing. 
Aromas a big and upfront, slightly boozy with rich deep vanilla, bourbon, sweet caramel being predominant, milk chocolate syrup is in the background. Very inviting. 
First sip and... woah! That's sweet. Liquid diabetes sweet. Sugar coated dark fruits, sweet chocolate syrup, maple candy upfront. The follow through has some roastyness and coffee, but the sweet syrupy nature dominates from start to finish. Aftertaste is slight vanilla and milk chocolate. Slight burn on the way down. 
Mouthfeel is rich, but not super thick like you'd expect. It's actually quite drinkable for 18% and has medium carbonation, more than you'd expect. 
This is one of those beers that I've been waiting years to try, and I'm glad I got to try it. Not an everyday beer, definitely a dessert beer and definitely a beer to split. Not for those who don't like sweet beers. 1,259 charactersgcamparone, Nov 30, 2014

Chocolate and vanilla blend together well in this beer. Definitely improves as beer warms. Smooth taste with some mild sweetness. Delicious! Have had fresher and aged in bottle for 10 months. Aged at 10 months was perfect! 267 charactersKevinpitts, Nov 29, 2014

But as this warms it gets so much more complex.  The wood and the whiskey really come out as it warms.  A very sweet stout indeed but I don't mind it one bit.  Only thing that doesn't scream out to me is the vanilla bean.  Would more vanilla make this beer better?  Probably.  Is this still one of the best BBA stouts I've ever had?  Yes.  I'll drink this any chance I can get. 455 charactersWayne17, Nov 23, 2014

Pours a dark amber-brown, a lot lighter than I'd expected. There's no head or lacing at all.
Smells like chocolate milk on steroids. Smells creamy, vanilla and chocolate all over the place, plus bracing alcohol.
And, unsurprisingly, this also tastes like chocolate milk on steroids. It tastes like chocolate liqueur more than beer. Amplified chocolate flavor all over. It tastes like chocolate milk, with about 50 additional Hershey's bars melted into it. There's some sweet marshmallow vanilla flavors. This is so sweet and cloying, the smaller pours definitely helped this stay relevant for me. Much more than 4 oz or so and this would be tiring. The alcohol burn is noticeable, but not quite as prominent as I would've expected.
This is surprisingly and weirdly thin bodied, I thought it would've been fudgy. The mouthfeel is incredibly syrupy and sweet, though, with basically no carbonation.
Quite an extreme beer. Tastes great, but not without its problems. 1,045 charactersGreesyFizeek, Nov 09, 2014

1.5 years later, I'm having a bottle of 2013 Chocolate Rain and I am loving the heck out of it. Upon cracking it, it looks menacing and awesome. It smells so complex and intense, I thought I would pass out. Smoke, cigar ash, country ham from the boonies of Appalachia, bacon, chocolate, vanilla, alcohol, burnt sugar and dirty porn. Truly heavenly, and then some. Nice carbonated mocha-colored head that vanishes in about as long as it takes to say "The Bruery Chocolate Rain 2013 Vintage"
The taste follows the nose, with a big hit of sweetness that never gets out of control. This is similar to Bourbon County, but way better at the same time; the big sweet boozy beer for those not afraid of big boozy sweet beers. Chocolate all around, nice smoky finish. 
Mouthfeel is perfect for the style, big and thick and creamy and bold. Heavy and outrageous. 
Overall, this is my one of my favorite beers ever and I am so tempted to flat-out rate it a perfect "5" overall. I paid $65 for this bottle and I would do it again. And again. And again... Oh You Chocolate Rain!!!! 1,258 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Oct 16, 2014

S - Thick, dark chocolate liquor, pumpernickel, dark chocolate truffle, caramelized barley, and warm bourbon.
T - Wow.  Creamy thick dark chocolate.  Kahlua liquor, dark chocolate covered salted pretzel, warm oaky bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and raisins.
M - Medium-light body, but outstandingly creamy and silky smooth. 
O - The chocolate character is incredible.  A perfect beer for a fat snifter on a cold winter day.

Thanks to F2brewers for this rarity.
Pours thick and viscous, decent head actually which dissipates rapidly. Aroma of fudge predominantly; flavor is bourbon soaked chocolate cake and alcoholic chocolate syrup.
The issue i have is this brew is quite hot and boozy and it's felt in the flavor which overshadows the complexities that are surely there but are lost due to the booziness.
Definitely let this one sit a few years to mellow out. Would be curious to taste an older vintage to see the difference, not likely to happen though :) 558 characterspapat444, Sep 17, 2014
4.58/5  rDev +3.4%Thanks a bunch to Jeffo for the longtime want! 2014 bottle.
Jet black with just a ring of tan head and no lace. Smell is full of chocolate and bourbon, rich roast, vanilla and a bit of liquorice, this beer smells absolutely incredible. Taste follows the nose and is even more of a treat than suggested, chocolate and roast, bourbon and vanilla, sweet but not near cloying, just a bit of alcohol heat but the 18% goes largely unnoticed. Lightly carbonated, full substantial body. Outstanding, I enjoyed this more than Black Tuesday by quite a bit and I really enjoyed BT, would welcome this again anytime. 605 characterspeensteen, Sep 17, 2014

4.16/5  rDev -6.1%Poured from the bottle into a taster.  2012 vintage.
Appeared a dark brown color - very thin in  appearance which was quite shocking.  Could have to do with the high ABV.  Minimal light brown head disappeared quickly.
Smell was amazingly complex.  Vanilla, chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, dark fruits, marshmallow, cream.....ALCOHOL.   Just a ton going on.
Taste followed the smell.  Alcohol is definitely present...quite hot still even after a few years in the cellar.  Very complex, very sweet.  Can only drink a few ounces of this one.
Mouth-feel is where this one lacks.  I am assuming it is cause of the high abv, but for a beer that is this complex I'd prefer a better feel to it.  This is far too light in the mouth.
Overall not going to lie, a bit disappointed by this one.  Mouth-feel is just not correct for a beer packing so much complexity. 859 charactersTWStandley, Sep 14, 2014

This was truly a treat last night love this stuff would drink it all the time if I could. 416 characterslovethebelgians, Jul 17, 2014

Pours nearly opaque dark brown color with a small foamy tan head with poor retention, that reduces to a thin ring of lace. Some slight spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a moderate amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of big milk chocolate, fudge, vanilla, caramel, toffee, toast, coconut, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic balance and complexity of dark/roasted malt, vanilla/cocoa spice, and bourbon barrel notes; with great strength. Taste of huge milk chocolate, fudge, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, coconut, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness. Slight roasted bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of milk chocolate, fudge, cocoa, vanilla, caramel, toast, toffee, coconut, bourbon, oak, and oak/toasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Absolutely insane complexity and robustness of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa flavors; with perfect balance of malt/barrel/spice flavors with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and fairly full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and slightly syrupy mouthfeel that is incredible. Alcohol is insanely well hidden with only a light-moderate warming present after the finish. Overall this is a world class imperial stout. Perfect balance and incredible complexity of dark/roasted malt, bourbon barrel, and vanilla/cocoa spice flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the huge ABV. An absolutely stunning beer all around. 1,528 characterssuperspak, Jul 13, 2014

APPEARANCE
Pours opaque black with tones of deep red. Initially there is almost no head, and the little there is disappears quickly. No lacing.
AROMA
It is baffling how complex the aroma is. At first I'm sucked into a whirlpool of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and vanilla. Holy cow.
Once I recover, sweet ripe dates as well as red raisin greet my nose. I can also definitely smell the alcohol. There is a hint of wood somewhere in the back, and I perceive sweet bourbon somewhere in the distance. I'm overwhelmed with sweetness, sweetness, and more sweetness. Brown sugar, and sugar pie (a French Canadian specialty: brown sugar, cream, butter).
It doesn't take too long for fortified wine, port wine, madera and sherry to make their presence known, in no uncertain way. They are supported by a malty back bone.
As if it was not sweet enough, other desserts come to me after it warms up: chocolate cake, some sweet carrot cake, notes of cola, truffle, and caramel.
TASTE
It tastes almost as complex as the aroma. My first impression is all dark chocolate and vanilla, with a touch of espresso, truffle, and caramel. It is almost unbearable how good this is.
Sugar pie returns (caramelized cream and brown sugar) - you really have to try this one day to know what I'm talking about. I feel like I'm drinking fancy Swiss chocolate candies. A little note of cinnamon remains after the sip is gone.
I can actually taste the alcohol. However, it doesn't overpowers anything, it balances well with the other components. Eventually I spot a few extras that do their thing quietly in the background: amaretto, a touch of hazelnut, and almond.
Finally, I taste what's going on in the background: tobacco, leather, and a hint of fig.
I was a little surprised to find very little bourbon, wood, molasses and licorice, which are typically found abundantly in this type of beer. I suspect those qualities couldn't find a spotlight on this crowded stage. Btw this is not a flaw, just something unusual. The beer is already outstanding.
MOUTHFEEL
The carbonation is pretty low, and I stand in a world of warmth from the alcohol (not burning though). Curiously, it leaves in my mouth a prickly sensation, that faintly numbs my tongue and even the inside of my cheeks. I suspect the vanilla to be responsible.
I was expecting a very thick and oily beer, but no, surprisingly, its body leans on the light to medium side. Viscosity is average, and it is not very chewy. It is extremely pleasant, to be honest, it elevates the drinkability. Even more surprising, the finish is rather crisp for that style of beer. Perhaps aging it for a year and half has thinned it just right?
OVERALL
Lots of surprises with this beer, especially with the mouth feel. The only flaw I found was the lack of head, which is a fairly minor one. For me this beer is nearly perfect, mature, and -excuse the language- fucking EPIC. 2,962 charactersBrew_Bear, Jul 06, 2014

Pours opaque black. The 1/4 inch khaki head quickly disappears completely and leaves no lace. 
The smell is of bourbon, dark chocolate, vanilla, pipe tobacco and maple syrup. 
The taste is of dark chocolate, milk chocolate, dark malt, vanilla, molasses and bourbon. 
The texture is heavy bodied, thick and slightly oily with low carbonation. 
An 18.5% ABV sweet bourbon bomb. The chocolate, vanilla and molasses accents are pushing this one toward the 'too sweet' realm. 489 charactersFurlinator, Jul 06, 2014

2.96/5  rDev -33.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 2.5A: Pours not completely opaque, but dark black with some ruby brown around the edges. A tiny bubbly head forms and recedes to nothing in a second. Looks really still.
S: Very boozy up front. Some bakers chocolate, vanilla and roast comes through. Huge barrel aromas that overpower everything.
T: Like the nose, all barrel and not much else comes through. Some bakers chocolate and vanilla. Light roast. Mostly boozy ethanol and barrel flavors.
M/D: Still carbonation with a thick, gloppy, resinous body. Oh, the alcohol here is rough. Crass and over barring in almost every way. Really hard for me to enjoy this.
Oh man, I just don't get this. Beers like Bourbon County are so much more well rounded and incorporated to me. This is the newest release, so hopefully this mellows with time. Though as is, just over barring and not something I really enjoyed. 857 characterschamp103, Jul 05, 2014

Huge bourbon barrel characteristics with some some slight chocolate on the nose. Medium mouthfeel with more bourbon and some sweetness in the taste and aftertaste which helps cut the alcohol content. Not an overwhelming 18.5% abv at all and believe the cacao nibs and subtle sweetness help. Very little vanilla present if at all. Outstanding brew. Hoping I can move from PS to RS to stock up even more. Curious to see how this would taste with a bit of age on it. 566 charactersJayPeso, Jun 22, 2014

Pours a dark brown beer. Some bubbles form at the top. Smells like ale, chocolate, porter, coffee, cognac. Tastes like an old ale too, mixed with imp. stout. It is somewhat heady, and it will go to your head quickly. Body is a bit thick. 334 charactersJulioH, Jun 10, 2014

Misc.: 2014 edition (18.5% ABV); wax bottleneck
Poured a black color with 1-to-2 fingers of frothy tan head, which quickly gave way to a serene setting on the top. Below average-to-minimal lacing on the sides of the glass. Average retention.
Smelled a potent mix of boozy bourbon and chocolate right away. Also got cocoa, fudge, toffee, caramel, Hershey syrup and Rolos candy. Definitely no hiding the 18.5 percent alcohol as it keeps coming in strong. 
Initial taste was flat out fantastic. Got cocoa, chocolate, chocolate syrup, cocoa nibs, fudge, toffee, caramel and the Rolos candy. That gave way to a long, warming finish. After the first sip, I could feel it warming down my throat for almost a minute. Not as boozy as the smell for sure. Just so good.
Medium-to-full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish.
This beer was so good. I would love to have this again. 1,098 charactersBucannonXC5, Jun 01, 2014

A - Pitch black, little to no head. To be expected with the alcohol content.
S - Huge bouquet of bourbony-booze, vanila, semi-sweet chocolate and caramel.
T - Giant bakers and semi-sweet chocolate notes. Insanely chocolatey and not that artificial tootsie-roll chocolate. Super boozy. Bourbon, vanilla, and more chocolate in the background. 
M - Surprisingly well carbed, full bodied, rich and velvety.
O - In a class all its own. Hard to even compare to other imperial stouts. 560 charactersZach136, May 11, 2014

A - Black with a limited head of large bubbles that struggle to group together. It seems a little thin as it pours.
S - Big bourbon and vanilla!
T - Intense! It took a while for my palate to calibrate. Big bourbon with dark chocolate, molasses and roasted marshmallow. The alcohol is intense and there's a moderate sweetness.
M - Thin with a low carbonation.
O - Too intense for me. I may as well have had a bourbon. But I can see what others love about it. 505 charactersGJ40, May 06, 2014

Aromas are very rich including hints of vanilla and chocolate. This beer is highly carbonated with a thick texture.

S- so much chocolate. Delicious. Some heat from the alcohol. Lots of vanilla as well. 
T- just like the nose. Chocolate with a lot of vanilla. The heat is actually not as bad as i thought it would be. But there is still a lot there. 
M- pretty smooth for it. The sweetness is very strong though. Little heat from alcohol. Silky sticky deliciousness.

S-Very fudgy. Like a chocolate liqueur. You can tell it's going to be very sweet. The smell of bourbon slowly rises out of the glass as well. Some dark fruits.
T-Chocolate liqueur. Bourbon infused fudge. Dark fruits. Brownie batter. Vanilla. Whiskey and wood. Very sweet but complex in its sweetness.
M-Oily with a unique feel. Slick. Hot. Sticky and boozy. Lower carbonation.
O/D-As I felt with Black Tuesday, I wasn't totally in love with it but I know it is well worth a try. Not many beers are quite like Chocolate Rain. Some stay dry while others feel the pain... 696 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 23, 2014

A- Pours mostly black with dark brown hues around the edges. A small off-white head dissipates quickly, leaving no lacing.
S- The aroma is very in your face. Tons of whiskey, thick chewy fudge, vanilla, and oak. Alcohol soaked dark fruits, namely prunes, dates, and figs are also prevalent.
T- The flavor is sweet as expected. The most prominent flavors are actually the dark fruits previously mentioned. Roasted malts and a bit of bitter baker's chocolate make an appearance. The fudge and vanilla play supporting roles. There's big bourbon alcohol in the finish.
M- The mouth feel is super thick, smooth, and velvety. Just the right amount of carbonation. A significant, but not overwhelming amount of warming booze.
O- This is basically like drinking bourbon-soaked dark fruits with vanilla and fudge. A very tasty imperial stout! 858 charactersSadMachine, Mar 22, 2014

Thought 2014 was fantastic, but this was on another level - one of the greatest stouts I've had.
Tons of fresh vanilla bean, marshmallow, and chocolate - but it is not too sweet, a lot of booze and whiskey.  Has an old ale quality I think is in all the huge bruery stouts - toffee, caramel, oak barrel.  Follows suit on the palate - explosive strong flavor, rich boozy sweetness, tons of vanilla bean, chocolate and whiskey.
Phenomenal beer, though not in appearance,, the adjuncts add flavor and some sweetness but do not cover up the base whiskey stout.  The vanilla and marshmallow integrate naturally with the existing bourbon sweetness.  Best BT variation. 697 characterstimc100, Mar 08, 2014

18.5% ABV, 2014, Best stored and cellared around 55°F 
A - Pouring thick and rich, this (surprisingly) dark brown beer's high alcohol content drives the tan foam to a thin halo almost immediately but, give this boozy beer a swirl and legs will drip down the glass for what seems like forever.
S - Thick soy sauce cakes grain alcohol-soaked raisins while molasses seeps through faint charred oak barrels that once held bourbon. Until the beer sits and really warms up, chocolate isn't even part of the picture but, it's milky nose peeks through with whole vanilla beans for a more pleasant olfactory experience.
T - A trail mix of dark chocolate morsels, booze-soaked raisins, creamy vanilla yogurt bites, and caramel-draped charred oak cubes fill the mouth with potency, almost completely overlapping the bourbon barrel character, save for the whole booze-soaked raisin part. It's damn tasty - much tastier than the outrageous nose lets on, but it's comes across more like straight grain alcohol was added to the beer once inside a charred oak barrel.
M - If it weren't for the onslaught of alcohol, Chocolate Rain might otherwise come across as a thick, throat-coating imperial stout. The truth of the matter is, there's so much freakin' alcohol in this beer that it cuts the full-bodied feel with thinning solvent heat that carries from mid gulp down the throat where it perpetually warms the stomach. It's creamy smoothness makes for a nice sipping beer when the potent alcohol is cast aside, though!
O - Here I sit, reviewing The Bruery's Chocolate Rain in my Bruery hat, feeling kind of silly about that. ...And the fact that I just absently dropped a rhyme. Moving right along... Chocolate Rain shows some serious promise but like Bourbon County Stout, I couldn't possibly see myself truly enjoying this beer fresh ever again. If I crave hard alcohol (which I almost never do) I'll pour myself hard alcohol. Chocolate Rain's Tripel Bock-like soy sauce nose is immediately off-putting but slowly opens up to richer nuances, transitioning into a fuller, more rich flavor of chocolate, vanilla tannins, and some trace of actual beer instead of solvent alcohol. I never age a beer I haven't had fresh but I'll count this as a learning experience; The Bruery's Chocolate Rain will probably be exceptional with 2-3 years of sitting in a cool, dark room on it which is the only way I'll have a bottle of my own next time. 2,479 charactersBeerFMAndy, Mar 08, 2014

The flavors were poorly blended, with the general consensus among my group that the flavors were akin to cheap malt liquor with chocolate syrup added in. This also describes the mouthfeel, which was quite thick, almost silty, like chocolate milk made with Hershey's syrup. 
I normally love a stout with deep chocolate flavors, but this just did not do it for me, and seemed more like a gimmick than a true attempt at crafting a quality product. 
If nothing else, the name is cute. 646 characterspaper_tiger, Mar 06, 2014

A - Deep space black with brown highlights and a thin brown head, no lacing.
S - Boozy with massive dark chocolate notes. Molasses, vanilla, and dark fruit also contribute to the aroma. 
T - Rather copious amount of sweet milk chocolate and vanilla with toffee and dark fruit. The alcohol is there, but it doesn't seem like the 18.5% ABV. It is just so chocolatey, but not overly sweet. 
M - Medium with lighter carbonation and an alcohol burn at the end. 
O - This was excellent to try and I highly recommend it. I'm not sure I would buy it, but it was awesome! 600 charactersRi0, Feb 16, 2014

The aroma has sweet vanilla, some alcohol, bourbon, sweet toffee and molasses, a familiar Black Tuesday aroma, but with punches of dark chocolate come through.
The flavor follows upfront of sweet chocolate and vanilla. Onto hints of bourbon. Toffee sweetness, dark fruits, and then a hit of alcohol on the finish.
Having had multiple vintages, '10 dulls the alcohol very well. '11 is still a bit hot. '13 was obviously the most hot, but the chocolate and vanilla shined through so well. Drink this fresh.
Definitely better than Black Tuesday and its variants. Lovely beer. 608 charactersdar482, Feb 12, 2014

S: big alcohol soaked dark fruits right up front, with an awesome sweet dark chocolate toffee/molasses and vanilla bean blats. this beer doesn't smell like its 18.5%.. 
T: i pick up on an immense sweetness but its not overly sweet. big chocolate, toffee, alcohol soaked figs/raisins, and a bit of heat to it that's actually quite inviting. for 18.5% this is extremely smooth and the finish is an awesome creamy vanilla that helps cut out the alcohol.
M: on the lighter side of full bodied. chocolate, vanilla and touch of alcohol is left on the palate. this is really enjoyable.
O: An outstanding brew. extremely well balanced, and has just the right amount of sweetness to cut out the big ABV. 818 charactersBeerXKing, Jan 25, 2014

A- Rather transparent for a BA stout, especially with this amount of ABV. Little to no head. Thin lacing around the bottle. 
S- Big bourbon upfront. Chocolate malty in back. Dates perhaps raisin thin in back.
T- Rich chocolate bourbon. Very smooth. This is for the sweet beer lovers. Probably wouldn't work if you are a die hard strict RIS fan. 
M- Pretty smooth, with some carbonation going down the throat. Kinda thin. Surprised by that. I have had this many times, and I don't remember it being this thin. 
O- I think?? a well crafted beer by The Bruery. It seems their most popular beers have to have a sweet factor. 673 charactersgueuzedreg, Jan 03, 2014

12/12/13 – Served in a Duvel tulip glass
A: Viscous looking body collects a dark black pearl in the glass with a light edging of more translucent brown. Thin wisp of quick going khaki cream settles out to a partial ring. Minor alcohol runners and a couple dots of stick are left behind. 
S: Cocoa nib and booze at the forefront. Loads of dark roast character with more fudgy chocolate, molasses, and dark fruits. The barrel aging is there with a touch of woodsy earth, crème brulee, and vanilla bourbon spice. Light undertones of toasted coconut and coffee. I get a touch of soy sauce/umami thing going on in the background as well. Overall nice with good chocolate aromas but a touch boozy and rather restrained bourbon notes. 
T: Chocolate mousse cake with toasted caramels, cherry cordial, and plum. Not the most chocolaty beer I have had but with good complementing layers of dark roasted grain, vanilla bean, molasses, and toasted coconut. Boozy alcohol but it is tolerable here. The beers dessert like sweetness is cut by the intense alcohol sting and a higher amount of hop bitterness. Earthy with some mild spice. The vanilla, charred oak, and bourbon really start to perk as the beer warms up which takes some effort. A great beer but not quite up to my expectations. Hits you like a chocolate liqueur majority of the time.
M: Heavy and slick from the seemingly lower amount of carbonation. Has a fairly viscous quality that is relatively balanced by a nice bitter bite and light drying finish. Warming alcohol coats the palate. 
D: A nice sipper and definitely a great feat in craft beer but didn’t quite meet expectations. It is chocolate and booze with some timid barrel character. I feel there are just other beers with more developed chocolate and better bourbon character. Would really like to spend some more time with this one though. 1,939 charactersNugganooch, Jan 03, 2014

4.07/5  rDev -8.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Managed to try this the other night thanks to a surprise bottle opening at a bar I go to. Thanks to everyone who was generous enough to share! One of my top wants for a while. 2013 vintage. Poured into a wine taster glass from a 750ml bottle. Keep in mind that I *haven't* had Black Tuesday yet as of this review, so I have nothing to compare it to.
This actually was a gusher. Are you joking?! Nevertheless, pours pitch black (as expected), with some brownish, tanned streaks, which mostly manifests itself in the head. The alcohol legs are monstrous, but lacing is actually far better than I thought it would be, leaving behind granite looking droplets against the wall of the glass after every swirl and sip. Looks like a chocolate liqueur melded with port wine, plain and simple.
An immediate blast of malty, chocolate and oak laden sweetness reaches the nose, but it's a little more complex than other imperial stouts within the category. The first flavors that hit the nostrils (albeit a brief sting from the alcohol) consist of fudge, caramel, and vanilla, and soon meld into a far more unique profile at the finish - with roasted cashews (seriously, not joking, this is very nutty), tobacco, prunes, dark cherries, and molasses. Quite a complex offering, and while it fails to hide the alcohol as well as I'd want, it's still extremely diverse for a mere chocolate-forward bourbon barrel aged offering.
The flavor is exactly what you'd expect it to be based off of the aroma - an enormous cascade of chocolate and fudge, combined with a brief sweetness of burnt toffee, vanilla, and caramel. Very, very sweet, but luckily other flavors make themselves noticeable at the finish, ranging from dark fruit (blackcurrant, prunes), spices (cinnamon, tobacco), and a brief tannic consistency from the oak barrels. While there's some carbonation, this is extremely syrupy, but luckily it's not overbearingly sweet so it doesn't bother me as much in the long run. As a port wine lover, it's pretty impressive how this tastes very similar to drinking a high quality Tawny with some dark chocolate alongside. Very enjoyable, but 4oz was more than enough.
Very good, but most certainly not worth the $40 price tag they're asking for on this. TCHO is one of my favorites and their chocolate really accentuates the base beer overall. Perhaps improves it, but I will only find that out as soon as I get to crack open my first BT. I'll be honest, though - it's going to be hard to find a beer of this type again that is as decadent and as complex as this one is! 2,558 charactersmagictacosinus, Dec 29, 2013

Nose- straight vanilla, then some sweet milk chocolate then bourbon. Vanilla is really crazy strong, even for a 2012. Slight booze. 
Taste: this is a dessert. Vanilla, chocolate and bourbon. Vanilla is still extremely prominent, then sweet chocolate whole bourbon and sweet oak is present throughout. Very rich and decadent, drink this by itself. 
Overall: this is a liquid dessert, much like a port or brandy. Would be fantastic with a flour-less chocolate cake with rich vanilla icing. This is a fantastic beer, for sure, but it's so rich is a "this is my only beer tonight" kind of beer 722 charactersVernonBaxter, Dec 27, 2013

BCBS best appearance of the group, not too impressive on appearance with no real lace but jet black but better on second pour nice lace. Smell bourbon chocolate. Taste really good a bit better than pirate.. upfront, chocolate bars dance on the tongue.. could really use some vanilla ice cream and chocolate cake to make a shake with.

Even with its ridiculous alcohol, one decadent taste and she'll have you under her spell for hours.
As the beer crawls around in the glass, its would-be onyx-black appearance is shed upon by shades dark brown mocha. A gentle swirl leaves a sprinkle of cocoa on the glass along with an inky and rusty haze. Light on any head character, the ominous ale prefers brandy-type legging over any Belgian lace.
Savory richness exudes from the snifter as the olfactories become awash with fudge-type chocolate, brownie batter and sweet liquor. With a stern scent of port and sherry, its roasted "stout" character, in all its espresso and toasted glory is somehow dwarfed by the immense dark chocolate overtones.
Its taste is nothing short of decadent as its rich chocolate and mocha flavor simply melt the palate, the heart and the soul. It's an absolute culinary delight as the roasted espresso flavors are trumped with all that fuggy, brownie, ooey-gooey richness. As soon as the ale becomes too much, the rise of bourbon-like sweetness, sherry-like tartness and port-like savory notes become almost "meaty-rich" like teriyaki. Finishing long and strong, its flavor hangs onto the palate like tiramisu. 
Its absurdly full body is chewy, mouth-coating as the ale coats the palate with a dense film. The Bruery might as well serve it up with a fork and knife. But all that clinging cloying texture ensures a long and savory reward as the beer's thickness is only tempered by buttery and acidic alcohol heat.
The front of its label reads, "contains alcohol" - ya think!? Chocolate Rain is a most decadent ale-sipping experience- especially for chocoholics like me. I'm sold! 1,859 charactersBEERchitect, Dec 18, 2013

Appearance: Black as sin, no light whatsoever comes through. There is a thin tan head that I cant believe is there. 
Nose: Big notes of chocolate, and bitter dark chocolate. Smells amazing. Light astrigency from the alchohol but that is to be expected with this abv.
Taste: This thing is just dripping with a sweet milk chocolate flavor, if I could make hot cocoa from this I would. This is a big beer but you cant taste any alchohol at all. There is a slight warming in the chest, but it never comes through in the taste. 
Mouthfeel: This has one of the thickest mouthfeels I have ever had, there is a slight sweet film left on my teeth.

The aroma hits sharply with a snap of alcohol but then settles in with coconut and vanilla. Deeper in the aroma starts to really penetrate deep in the nose with fudgy chocolate and molasses.
The fudge, chocolate and brownie like flavors burst on the palate as the finish ends with cream and whiskey notes.
The feel is smooth and quite thick. The alcohol is imperceptible but for a warmth that enters the body and gives you a happy feeling all over. 560 charactersKYGunner, Dec 16, 2013

Obviously dark and milk chocolate dominate with large amounts if vanilla, coconut and brown sugar. The sweetness is really too much. Even as you drink this one it doesn't get any easier to bare the sweetness with the alcohol and bourbon taking a back seat even to how sweet it is. Full body and light carbonation, very smooth.

A dark cola, no head or lace as expected, long legs, like Tuesday its not as dark as expected, no too worried though, looks aren't everything 
S holy fudge batman, milk chocolate, vanilla, bourbons there, chocolate liqueur, there's booze but not the massive amount there should be, I don't get much of the barrel that should come with the bourbon but this smells awesome either way 
T a little more wood then the nose but still not all that much, not the extreme chocolate fudge on the nose but still strong, vanilla and booze still play a big part, tastes great but the nose was a hard act to follow 
M thick and syrupy, a little heat but there should be much more, my lips are stuck together, bourbon and I get a hint of smoke on the finish 
O half chocolate liqueur, half bourbon, half big fuck off stout, yes I realize that's three 1/2s but I'd say this is easily a beer and a half 
I could have sat there smelling this all night but I kept drinking it and before I knew it my glass was empty. I was expecting much more heat from this 2013 bottle, I'd love another crack at this one with a few years on it. 1,214 characterswordemupg, Oct 13, 2013

The aroma starts with heavy bourbon and oak paired with candy sweetness. Loads of cacao comes in towards towards the end which tempers the intense sweetness. Some light vanilla highlights noticeable at the very end. The flavor follows suit with the nose. It starts
very sweet with the heavy cacao quickly following. Notes of cream, coconut, and vanilla come through as the sweetness subsides with one last wave of dark chocolate at the end. The mouthfeel is thick with mild carbonation. Overall, a nice feature of cocoa, very sweet, strong, but well balanced considering its monstrous 18% abv. 667 charactershomebrew311, Oct 10, 2013

Review #225.
Looks like Black Tuesday. Pours motor oil and looks like liquid chocolate, like fondue. Opaque, black and chewy. Even came out with a 1cm mocha head that had fairly good retention. Not much lacing. Looks like freakin' dessert.
Heavenly is what I'd call the smell. We had just drank 2011 Black Tuesday before opening up this one, and it smells even better than BT. The massive sweetness of the base BT is tempered a bit by cocoa bitterness and raw vanilla, which is perfect. It's intense and over the top, which is the Bruery for you.
I love how this beer tastes. The sweetness is pretty much a straight up caramel-molasses-sugar bomb. So intensely sweet, but not overly so because of the bigness of the vanilla essence and the bitterness of the cocoa nibs. A good bit of barrel contribution, giving us some sweet bourbon and some oak.
Mouthfeel is BT plus. Medium bodied, basically liquid dessert, much like Bourbon County Stout. Carbonation is low which is expected here. Best thing about it is that there is no booziness whatsoever in this 19.5% beer. Dang! Finish is complex as hell with a nice resinous quality to it. Not too sticky, not too dry. Its great.
This is an awesome imperial stout. Much better than Black Tuesday for sure.. the adjuncts do a great job of taming down BT's ridiculous sugar bomb aspect, and there is no heat in this. None at all. This is a treat, but I would agree that you have to open this bottle with 4-5 other people to be able to fully enjoy this. 1,638 charactersStevedore, Oct 07, 2013

Conspicuously light chocolate brown with an anaemic tan head that quickly dissipates to a collar.
Ripping vanilla, 70% dark chocolate, frangelico, liquorice, cocoa and steadily growing hazelnut presence. Big and brash.
Similar but booze and sweetness causes a loss of structure and focus. Mainly big, sugary barrel contributions of vanilla essence, coconut and Frangelico.
Not hugely thick or heavy, but marred by the distracting, hot booze presence.
Some delectable flavours but lack of drinkability is a big problem. Going to sit on my other bottle for a good few years. 637 charactersspicelab, Sep 30, 2013

Obsidian with ruby tint, no lasting head or lacing, strong alcohol legs.
Strongest vanilla I have gotten off a beer on the nose, boozy, chocolate. The vanilla hit quickly and bites hard but lets go long enough to enjoy the roasted coco, oak, sweet molasses notes. Very sweet, pretty boozy, but very pleasant bourbon heat.
Full body, low carbonation, chewy, warm etoh.
Amazing beer but still needs a year or two longer on that vintage for the vanilla to mellow, I was bummed the coco nibs didnt shine through as much, but still, this is liquid gold, eould love to try older years! 653 characterswilliamjbauer, Sep 29, 2013

I want with all my heart to praise this beer and to say that what I gave for it was remotely worth it. I wouldn't trade a six pack of your favorite AB-INBEV product for another bottle. Overly sweet, overly misplaced boozy in a very non clever way. This smelled like something my brother would have cooked up in his "cooking class" when he was postulating drug addled kittens. The mouth feel was nice and thick, like poisonous pancake syrup. 
I'm sorry.

For whatever reason, I still feel a decent amount of pride in the fact that I still have not seen the "Chocolate Rain" video in its entirety. Regardless, this stuff pours a very dark black-brown topped by a half-finger of wan sandstone foam. The nose comprises cheap boozy whiskey, wood, and a twinge of chocolate syrup. The taste holds notes of overly-sweet chocolate syrup, vanilla bean, toasted caramel, and bourbon. I don't ever say this, considering my sweet tooth is as long as an average femur, but this stuff was just way the hell too sweet for its own good. It's cloying, o'erwhelming, and wrong. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a semi-chewy feel. Overall, I don't get the praise this beer receives. I like incredibly sweet things, and it was too sweet for me. The bourbon is only there to color things in a drunken manner and provide an extra jolt of booziness, which itself is completely unnecessary, given the general booziness already pervading the proceedings. It was hard to finish my glass of this, and that worries me a bit. Not a fan. 1,116 charactersTMoney2591, Sep 02, 2013

A- Pours a deep brown/black. Minimal head that disappears quickly. No light is passing through. Viscous liquid, and due to the high alcohol, it leaves legs on the glass. Not what I usually look for in a barrel aged stout. 
S- BOOZE and CHOCOLATE. This thing is a mess. Upfront, I get a lot of sweet sweet sweet bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate. Aromas of toasted coconut and burnt sugar follow right behind. The aroma gave me diabeetus. So far, I don't understand why people are crazy about this. It smells like a Hershey's chocolate bar (cheap chocolate) mixed with Wild Turkey 101 bourbon.
T- Guh.... Cloyingly sweet. More of a mess than I was even expecting. It was boozy, hot, chocolaty, and very sweet. I may have grabbed a bottle of Hershey's syrup instead of chocolate rain. The alcohol is not masked at all. It seemed quite amateur. It doesn't taste like it was expertly crafted.
M- The lack of any real carbonation just made this sit in my mouth. It coated me teeth and gave me cavities.
O- Ok, The Bruery. I understand you guys like your big bottles and fancy wax, but please make the beer taste better. This whole badass, high alcohol, wax dipping thing appeals to high school lacrosse players, but the beer inside doesn't deliver a level of sophistication that I expect from a $40 bottle of beer. This was a total mess and a huge disappointment. I really don't understand the hype. 1,580 charactersMichigan, Aug 04, 2013

A - Pours a deep rich black with very little head that recedes quickly. This beer leaves serious lacing. It warns that doming it may not be the greatest idea, but it's a challenge to accept.
S - Sweet vanilla mixed with bourbon. Strong burnt sugar alcohol smell. Like a decadent dessert. Smells like I may not be able to walk when this is over.
T - This my friends, is a freaking Beer. Up front you walk right into bourbon soaked coconut which fades out into some bittering chocolate and leaves with sweet vanilla and molasses. This is a beer to be sipped and savored. Delicious. There's something wrong with you if you didn't lick your lips after a sip. 
M - Big syrupy beer with definite warming alcohol presence. I'm glad I have another saved for winter. Low carbonation, which is preferred in this style. 
O - This is a wonderful beer. It may be too sweet for some, but I freakin' love it. It's just a notch behind Black Tuesday overall, but a wonderful change of pace.

Review #800
Opened in celebration of my friends Matt and Kelly's firstborn child's birth and drank while listening to Tay Zonday's hit single "Chocolate Rain."
The beer poured a surprisingly thin, mahogany brown. No real head and no lacing. Frothy tan colored bubbles dotted the liquid and quickly morphed into a thin ring of froth. With each swirl of the liquid, substantial legs trickled down the glass.
Bourbon came through super strong in the nose. This was perhaps the most bourbon forward beer I have ever sampled. Lots of toffee and brown sugar sweetness. Strong notes of vanilla bean and maple syrup. Hints of coconut. Dark fruits were also noticeable. Plums and raisins were most apparent.
The flavor profile almost followed the nose to a T. Tons of sweetness up front, with a big caramel malt/toffee presence. Very boozy from the start, but the booze was definitely welcomed. At 19.5% ABV, this drank surprisingly well. Super strong bourbon notes. Loads of vanilla bean. Lots of dark chocolate and dark fruits sweetness. Figs, plums and raisins came through strongest. Touch of burnt sugar and oak. Some roasted malt flavors were present, but the roast was surprisingly subtle.
The mouthfeel was rich and syrupy with an appropriately low carbonation. This beer could have been a bit thicker and chewier for something of this magnitude.
All in all, this was an amazingly interesting and complex beer. Although I wanted to compare it to Black Tuesday (which is my favorite beer of all time), this was a completely different beast. With its lighter appearance and mouthfeel and its sweeter, boozier and more fruit-forward aroma and flavor profile, I found more similarities between this and Melange No. 3 than with Black Tuesday. 1,863 charactersDamian, Jul 18, 2013

A: Dark, and thin appearance/runny, but not translucent thin. Doesn't hold on the glass at all, very fluid. 
Smell: Brown sugar, raisins and booze. Definitely some vanilla smell coming through too.
Taste: Sweet, sweet, sweet. Very sweet (did I mention that?). Starts with a lot of sugary vanilla and chocolate, chocolate and caramel even, and leaves me thinking of sugared raisins. Brown sugared raisins. Slightly boozy, but surprisingly low for how strong this is. More sugary raisin aftertaste as I think on it. A bit sweeter than I would prefer (I guess just give me Black Tuesday).
Mouthfeel: Could be thicker, but fairly syrupy too. Obviously similar to Black Tuesday.
Overall: initially thought it was too sweet. After nearly a 750ml bottle down, I still think its a bit too sweet. All that aside, it's still really good. I prefer BT, but am very happy to have had a chance to try this. Wouldn't pass on a glass if it were poured for me, especially after warming a bit. Curious to see how this would age, possibly some sweetness from the vanilla would fade. But might lose a little of the booze too (which surprisingly isn't too much).
Serving type: 750ml bottle, served in a snifter. 1,376 characterschrisp450, Jul 07, 2013

A; pours a dark brown colored body with some amber tints to it. created an off-white thin head that quickly dissipated. 
S: big alcohol soaked dark fruits right up front, with an awesome sweet dark chocolate toffee/molasses and vanilla bean blats. this beast doesn't smell like its 19.5%.. and this could get dangerous quickly
T: following in stride with the nose. again, i pick up on an immense sweetness but its not overly sweet. big chocolate, toffee, alcohol soaked figs/raisins, and a bit of heat to it thats actually quite inviting. for 19.5% this is extremely smooth and the finish is an awesome creamy vanilla that helps cut out the alcohol.
M: on the ligher side of full bodied. chocolate, vanilla and touch of alcohol is left on the palate. this is really enjoyable.
O: simply an outstanding brew. extremely well balanced, and has just the right amount of sweetness to cut out the big ABV. so damn excited that I was able to try this one out! will definitely try to get one in the future. must share this! 1,071 characterstut2528, Jul 02, 2013

Appearance: Pours a dark, deep oak brown with a hint of cherry coloring. Leaves behind a solid finger of off-white head.
Smell: Sweet bourbon, strong vanilla, dark chocolate, toffee, caramel. Really delicious combination of aromas. The vanilla really stands out, maybe more than in any other beer I've had.
Taste: Bourbon and vanilla come out right away, front and center, along with milk and dark chocolate, toffee, more vanilla. The layers of strong, sweet flavors mask the alcohol expertly. Some heat is definitely there but it only adds to this beer. Very sweet, but not overly so - really well done.
Mouth-feel: Silky texture with low to medium carbonation. Medium to heavy body. Very smooth and creamy.
Overall: This is a terrific monster of a stout for chocolate lovers. Definitely sweet, and the alcohol is masked brilliantly. This one packs a whole lot of flavor and the smell and taste match each other very well, in a good way. Definitely worth seeking out. 1,012 charactersResuin, Jun 25, 2013

Pours dark brown (thin looking) with no head whatsoever. Big vanilla chocolate nose with huge sweet bourbon and a bit of licorice and woody oak. Big thick mouthfeel, velvety, with low carbonation but not flat. Big burnt sugar and molasses up front, with sweet chocolate syrup on the back end. Bourbon booze burns on the time. Packs quite a flavor punch. Serious sipper with a lingering sweetness that is rather pleasant. Starts great, harsh going down and waaaay sweet, then the linger is fantastic after dinner treat. Age might do this well for that middle portion which makes it tough to deal with more than a small pour (5 oz here). Only two of us, so recapping the rest for tomorrow. 759 charactersBMMillsy, Jun 21, 2013
2.84/5  rDev -35.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2.5Served on-draught at Beer Belly in Koreatown last night. 19.5% confirmed. Cost was $7.00 USD for an 8 oz pour. Served into a tulip. Expectations were extremely high; I love Black Tuesday. Reviewed from notes. 
A: Pours a half finger head of milky light khaki colour. Retains for 1.5 minutes, reducing to a floater ring which itself remains for about 3-4 more minutes. Body colour is an opaque solid black; not quite a jet black but dark. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. I remember Black Tuesday looking far better and richer. Given the gargantuan ABV, I think the head retention is pretty impressive. Pretty good for the style overall. 
Sm: The first thing I noticed about the beer when the bartender handed it to me was the aromatic pungent vanilla bean notes. Chocolate, cacao nibs. Dark malts. Molasses. Raisin. Boozy, but nowhere near as much as you'd expect for 19.50%. Caramel. No yeast character is detectable. Syrup. Light vinous notes. Powerful and strong, but not as rich or evocative as I recall Black Tuesday being. A bit disappointin,g but inviting overall. Certainly not alive. 
T: Molasses, chocolate malt, dark malts, caramel, raisin. Light vinous character. No roast, to my chagrin. Sweet vanilla bean on the climax; a bit overbearing and creme-brulee esque - definitely too sweet, but not quite cloying. Hot and boozy; it's unpleasant but tolerable. I expected far more from the chocolate/cacao based on the aroma, but it's not rich or high quality at all. Surprisingly shallow depth of flavour. Syrupy and imbalanced. Aside from the alcohol, flavour intensity is actually fairly restrained for the style. No subtlety here at all. Not getting any barrel or wood notes. Average flavour duration. 
Mf: Syrupy and thick. Undercarbonated. Smooth and wet. Not at all ideal for the style or flavour profile. Really underwhelming. Average presence on the palate. 
Dr: THIS is based on Black Tuesday? THIS is highly sought after and heavily traded? Boy am I disappointed. A boozy mess with lackluster balance and few remarkable characteristics. Honestly, I wouldn't order this again. I'm shocked at its high ratings. Is Grey Monday as mediocre as this? I expected way better having loved Black Tuesday. This emperor has no clothes; I'm sorry for those of you who pay The Bruery exorbitant membership costs just to have the purported privilege of buying bottles of stuff like this. I pray the bottled version is better. I'm almost tempted to figure that the bar didn't serve or store this right, but Beer Belly has quite a good reputation. Wow, I did not see this mediocrity coming. What a waste. Very mundane.

A) - Jet black with a head that quickly dissipates. Small amount of foam rings the glass.
S) - Chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and Oak.
T) Really digging this the chocolate is semi sweet and it is complimented by the vanilla. The bourbon is very pronounced. This does not drink like an 18% beer. The alcohol heat is well muted and only shows up a bit at the end. Still though this is a sipper as you want to keep the experience going.
M) Velvety smooth.

Pours jet black with about one finger of brown head. Head receds to a tiny halo which doesn't lace. Swirling my glass shows nice thick legs that fade slowly. 
Smells incredible! Bourbon chocolate cake and vanilla dominate with oak, roast and booze thrown in. 
The nose, while excellent, couldn't prepare me for how awesome this tastes. Rich chocolate cake, strong yet smooth bourbon, vanilla bean ice cream, sweet creamed coffee, booze soaked dark fruit, heavy roasted malts, that kind of funky sweet almost signature Bruery yeast character and a little alcohol burn. So freakin delicious with the rich flavors coating my tongue. The alcohol is present but this drinks so smooth like only half of it's 18% abv bill. 
Thick, heavy, chewy, viscous feel with light carbonation. Coats the mouth for a long, sweet bourbon chocolate cake aftertaste. 
Truly outstanding! This was one of the main reasons I joined the Reserve Society and I couldn't be happier. So rich and full. Even better than the already stellar Black Tuesday. Very highly recommended. 1,236 charactersThickNStout, Jun 10, 2013

 Appearance - Poured a deep almost black with dark red edges with very little head but left a thin ring in the center and around the edge of the glass.
Smell - Wow are you kidding me!! The smell of Chocolate Rain is the best smelling beer i have ever had the chance to smell period!!, sweet baker's chocolate, cocoa, vanilla and bourbon barrel notes all mixed together in an all out attack on the nose, i could of sat and smelled it all night.
Taste - Taste mirrors the smell!, big sweet chocolate (go figure), bourbon, vanilla, oak from the barrel that all blends together perfectly. 19.5% not here! There is a little alcohol heat in the back end but it never got overpowering even as it warmed up and the after taste hangs around for days! 
Mouth feel - Velvety, creamy and silky all at the same time great mouth feel.
Overall - This is an absolute must try and is totally worth it, how ever you can get your hands on a bottle do it!! This beer may have ruined this style of big high ABV barrel aged beers for me as nothing will live up to what this one did. IMO this is perfection in a bottle hype well deserved. 1,237 charactersM1A2, Jun 01, 2013

2011 vintage
A: Opaque, dark brown color showing some light transmission at the edges. No foam head develops and no lacing remains on the glass. Fine brown sediment settles out.
S: Concentrated chocolate syrup that gives an impression of overt sweetness to come. Boozy vapors are profuse, heady, not leaving much room for some of the finer details of oak and spirit-aging.
T: Begins sweet, with a medley of overpowering dark flavors that begin predictably chocolatey before revealing considerable plum fruit. Cloying alcohol reigns throughout the profile. The finish is nutty, tasting distinctly of walnuts. Wood influence is not well-represented, athough vanilla extract seems to go hand-in-hand with the booziness.
M: Thick viscosity, very hot and syrupy on the palate, with moderate carbonation.
D/O: Impossibly extreme, though focused, stout that effortlessly overwhelms the palate with booze. While remarkable in some respects, it proves extremely fatiguing upon the palate. To paraphrase another drinker present at this tasting, it is easier to drink straight bourbon than this beer. Let's not be hasty--although the sentiment is not completely unfounded. This legendary project beer is best taken in small doses, or with a decadent dessert to help cut the alcohol. 1,320 charactersbeagle75, May 27, 2013

Burnt umber, milky and opaque in the middle and clearer at the edges. A hard pour results in nearly no head, which is expected -- this thing is like liqueur. 
Huge bourbon nose, packed with alcohol. Vanilla bean, buttered toffee, acrid charred oak, and dark chocolate sauce. Lots and lots of chocolate sauce.
Wow, is this rich. Vodka-soaked heath bars, bourbon, vanilla, brown sugar, oak. It's a delicious blend, but so sugary I'm worried I'll get a headache.
The word of the day is: rich. Thick, syrupy medium-full body. Alcohol heat is high, like pepper spice on the tongue. It numbs the tongue a little as well. Carbonation is light and prickly. Heavy stuff. 
Like drinking chocolate frosting. Thick, rich, highly inebriating. It is, however, a one-trick pony. There's not a ton of complexity, but you don't really need it. Chocolate? Good. Stout? Good. Bourbon? Gooood. 905 charactersPhelps, May 25, 2013

A: Very dark, black pour, with creamy mocha head, which falls into a thin collar around the glass.
S: Nose is on chocolate, vanilla, molasses, also toffee and wood. Not too much alcohol given the ABV.
T: Palate is rich and very expressive, on chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. There are also underlying notes of toffee, some sweetness, and some fruitiness with figs and plums in the background. The finish is quite alcoholic, really warming in the back of the throat, a bit disturbing actually.
M: Velvety, oily, a little bit sticky, and also warming mouthfeel.
O: The flavor profile of this beer is great, rich and dense. There is however a bit too much alcohol in this to be truly perfect. Thanks for sharing Brandon! 817 charactersFux, May 20, 2013

pours dark and very little head if any very little lacing
smell is overwhelming chocolate and vanilla 
which is reflected in the taste first upfront is heavy chocolate 
and the backend is vanilla heavy
very strong not hott but definite can tell it has a high abv
i split half the bottle and was slowing down by the last of it 
may need to split three or four ways next time 
overall i really enjoyed this bottle it was sweet but not as sweet as some people tend to describe it as a sugar bomb 
definite something to try if you have not had 585 charactersmhksuccess, May 20, 2013
4.46/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle stored in my cellar for over a year. Poured into 18oz Funky Buddha snifter, bottle split three ways. Reviewed live.
A- Pours a dark black that has some translucency, actually slightly lighter then I was expecting. Pretty much no head, very still top, minimal carbonation, just some alcohol legs along the sides of the glass.
S- Rich chocolate, vanilla beans, lightly bourbon, extremely well balanced booze. Can tell it's got a high abv, but fits very nicely for how high it is and integrates well with the other aromas. Fairly aromatic.
T- This is where the beer gets really interesting: flavors of dark chocolate, cocoa nibs, bourbon, vanilla, hints of booze on this finish but nowhere near what you would expect at almost 20%, extremely well balanced. Aftertaste that lingers with chocolate and balanced vanilla.
M- Very smooth especially for 19.5%, a beer definitely should not be this smooth with an abv this high- feels more like 9%, fairly minimal carbonation but nice for the style. Can't believe how easy this is to drink.
O- This was a fantastic high abv stout that was incredibly easy to drink and extremely flavorful. I was expecting this to be overly boozey but the abv was well hidden and was surprisingly easy to drink with all the flavors coming out very nicely. I highly recommend seeking this out, just be careful with how dangerously smooth it is. 1,383 charactersjaasen64, May 19, 2013

A: Pours pitch black with a cream colored head that fights to just cover the top of the beer before quickly dissipating into a nearly non-existent ring around the edge of the glass. Minimal head is to be expected from a beer of this size. Obvious alcohol legs with each swirl and sip.
S: Booze soaked dark fruits. A definite port-like character. Dark chocolate and brown sugar. Some vanilla-bourbon presence, but well integrated with the other aromatic complexities.
T: First impression, "this is better than Black Tuesday." The cocoa nib additions cut some of the intense sweetness; not to say this isn't a sweet beer (obviously given the ABV), but less so than the base beer. Picking up more roast in the back end than with normal BT. The cocoa addition is apparent with a nice bittersweet baker's chocolate presence. Over the course of this tasting, I've picked up flavors of plums, chocolate, caramel, burnt chocolate, coffee, and vanilla throughout. Ends milk chocolate and espresso, followed by alcohol warmth. 
M: This beer is about as thick as it gets; borderline syrupy. Minimal carbonation and slick on the tongue. An appropriate mouthfeel for supporting the massive flavors and complexity of this one. 
O: Excellent beer, one I prefer over the 10 and 11 vintages of Black Tuesday (the only vintages I've had). 1,406 charactersdbc5, May 11, 2013

A: Can't figure out how this is possible but it isn't even close to opaque...dark brown pour with ruby highlights...nearly no head but epic alcohol legs. Still looks good.
S: Huge boozy dark fruits here, lots of rum-soaked raisin character...smoothed-out caramel and lots of vanilla...big bourbon tones...lots of chocolate character too after you get used to the vanilla and boozy dark fruits.
T: Milk chocolate like a boss...chocolate and vanilla liqueur...dark caramel and burnt residual sugars...bourbon sweetness...booziness is apparent but totally manageable, the warmth is actually pretty nice and cuts some of the sweetness...
MF: Very low carbonation, moderate warmth from the booze, viscous and full-bodied...this is the epitome of a sipping beer.
O: Pretty awesome, as you get used to all of the boozy characters (dark fruits, vanilla, caramel, and bourbon) the chocolate is pretty epic in this thing. Totally recommended if you can snag one. 1,059 charactersScotchboy, Apr 29, 2013

A-	Pours like a porter/stout with lots of alcohol/sugar legs. Small to almost no head retention. 
S- WoW smell is of big chocolate, vanilla/bourbon, sugar, and oakiness. 
T- Taste is of chocolate and vanilla with slight dark fruit smells. Leaves a fantastic after taste of bourbon/vanilla and chocolate. Alcohol shows up big so be ready to be warmed up. 
M- Very viscous with good carbonation full bodied beer that is sweet yet balanced considering the abv. Liquid dessert if you ask me.
Overall, this beer is a masterpiece unto itself. The base beer BT I say is slightly better but I’ll never say no to CR. Always ready and willing to have. If you can find, and if you have collateral, make the trade. Beer lives up to the hype and more. 889 charactersUncleserg, Apr 29, 2013

beer pours a heavy 30 weight consistancy, lacing decipates immediately, smells of straight bourbon with a hint of vanilla, taste like a dark expresso bean chocolate stout with hints of marshmellow and vanilla, the bourbon profile is extreme but pretty much what i expected from a 19.5% beverage. This beer is awesome, much better than black tuesday in my opinion and definately worth its hype. Might even be my new favorite, the only negative for me is that can be a little hot and its limited availability. 602 characters1424IpA, Apr 28, 2013

I keep forgetting who brought what, dammit. Anyway, this was a big want of mine, and I'm grateful for not having to search the country for it. Pours a very deep brown color, not quite deep enough to be called black. Even an aggressive, straight down pour produced almost no head - a slight ring that fades to naught rather quickly. Possibly an effect of such a high alcohol content?
The aroma is one of the strongest and most poignant I've ever come across. It fills your nasal cavities long before you finish bringing the beer to your nose. Deep, deep vanilla aromas; dense and syrupy. A bourbon-like alcohol character is strong and robust up front, almost burning the insides of my nose. The bourbon is settled down a bit and held in check by a delicate chocolate that emerges; sweet, milky, and creamy through and through. All of these aromas only intensify as the beer warms up. The bourbon burns more, the malts get sweeter, the vanilla gets more dense. The harshness, the sweetness, the sheer dominance of the nose is quite intimidating - but hey, I would expect nothing less from a 19.5% ABV stout that was this highly acclaimed, right?
The first thing that my taste receptors send to my brain from the moment this beer touches my tongue is, "holy fucking sweet!" The sweetness is very high on this one, right out of the gate - honestly, just a tad overboard. The flavors, however, are very, very nice; baked brown sugar, bourbon soaked licorice and mild dark fruit, heavy vanilla beans, and lots of light, cocoa undertones. There is a solid oak and wood characteristic, front to back as well. As anyone would expect, this one gets much boozier as it warms up - starting off as a bourbon heat, it turns into a hotter bourbon heat accompanied by a slightly phenol or rubbing alcohol kind of heat. 
The more and more I drink this, the more and more the vanilla-bourbon flavors stand out to me as the most dominant. The aftertaste is controlled by some light cocoa flavors that are sadly overshadowed by heavy booze. The sweetness also lasts long into the aftertaste, like a boulder rolling down a hill that is very hard to stop. Near the tail end of this beer, the alcohol is much more dominant and it actually helps keep the sweetness more in check. Slick, sticky, slightly thick mouth feel with super low carbonation.
Super glad I got to try this one - my 6 oz. pour was perfect - I would imagine that any more than this would be too much. The flavors were awesome, but there were two main things holding this one back from being a top 10 beer for me: it was a bit too sweet, and it was a touch too boozy and hot, especially as the beer warmed up. I guess that's to be expected from a 19.5% ABV beer, right? So maybe I'm being too harsh. But the beer was still damn good and the flavors were on point. Overall, if this were taken down on the ABV level and the sweetness was controlled a little better, it would easily be a top 10 contender. 3,038 characterstectactoe, Feb 25, 2013

A - Chocolate brown with a thin looking body. There was a very small chocolate head that faded quickly
S - Milk and dark chocolate, light vanilla, caramel and bourbon. Not as boozy in the nose as Grey Monday
T - This is a delicious beer. There is sweet vanilla, light oak, caramel, sweet bourbon. This sweetness is balanced perfectly with the bitterness of the dark chocolate cacao nibs. Finish has slight cinnamon spice, heat from the bourbon and light oak
MF - This is a super thick and velvety smooth beer. It is really thick and coats the tongue. The finish is slightly astringent 
O - This is really a good beer that I liked more than BT and Grey Monday. It has such a great flavor profile that is balanced between the dark chocolate and the sweetness of BT.

5oz mini tasting snifter
A: Pours out a deep reddish brown. I see others describe this as pitch black, and doing a side by side with BT '11 that is not what we got. Definitely some reddish hints in there and not a thick black at all. I got a layer of off white, light tan head. I was actually surprised to get any head on this high ABV. Tons of alcohol feet. 
S: Well, it smells like chocolate that is for sure. Lots of dark and milk chocolate character on the nose. It's masking the vanilla and oak character a little bit that I was pulling more from the BT, but you can still get some coming through. There is a little alcohol booziness coming through, but it's to be expected.
T: Up front, dark super high cocao chocolate. As it progresses, you get more vanilla meshing in to give it sort of a milk chocolate like feeling. I wish there was more roast and/or coffee, but what is there is still delicious. We had this bottle open for a while between us, as it's certainly a sipper. I think I prefer the BT to this, that year did BT well. This is still fabulous beer though. Warming brings out more flavor but also some more booze.
M: Full as full could be. 1,181 charactersinlimbo77, Feb 04, 2013

This is a great beer. This beer is huge with a big bite from the high ABV throughout. There is intense chocolate that tastes like a bourbon dipped chocolate bar. There is some smoke from the grain but I feel like most (85%) of the flavor of this beer comes from the adjuncts (chocolate, vanilla, candi sugar) and a vast minority comes from the actual brewing process (grains, barrels, hops, yeast). While this beer is amazing, I don't taste beer. 459 charactersjvillefan, Jan 20, 2013

5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The Chocolate Rain is a variation of Black Tuesday. Even though higher in ABV the flavor is a tad lighter.
A. Thick black with a dark brown head.
S. Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, & coffee.
T. All described in the smell are noticeable but the two flavors that stand out the most while drinking are chocolate and vanilla. Real powerful in taste but stands out more on the sweet side. Not bitter in anyway.
M. Thick syrup and extremely smooth. Consume in a small round glass taking a sip at a time or this beer will be gone before you know it. 
Overall I would have to say Black Tuesday is the king of stouts and the variation Chocolate Rain is the cherry on the icing. For 19.5 the alcohol is well hidden and the flavor is extremely enjoyable for any drinkers choice. 769 charactersSpectre, Jan 15, 2013

As you'd expect, it pours pretty much identically to the base beer... edges if copper clarity, a thin khaki head and loads of oily alcohol aftermath that coats the cup.
Surprisingly mellow bourbon quality - takes a back seat to a variety of figs and dates, milk chocolate, vanilla oak, fresh coffee beans, some sweet dessert notes... caramel or toffee. More chocolate goodness.
Wonderful. Sweet assertive bourbon layered with caramel, fudge cake, brown sugar, molasses, chocolate liqueur, just as big and bad as BT with chocolate addition that somehow draws everything together instead of pushing the diabetic envelope. 
Incredible stuff. I remain in search of... 794 charactersyamar68, Jan 03, 2013

Pours a jet black beer with a few bubbles breaking the surface. Syrupy and heavy in the glass, looks like I expected. Menacing....
The aroma is downright bad. Booze. The strongest alcohol aroma I've ever encountered in a beer. I thought I may just have the beer too cold (around 42 degrees) so I let it sit for 15 minutes and revisted, re-sniffing throughout the 90 minute session. Harsh alcohol, solvents, chemical aromas. As it warms, more of the beer and bourbon show up but it's REALLY boozy. Nothing like any of the BT vintages I've had. 
The flavor is rich, sweet, and hot. Bourbon is light but there. Vanilla and Chocolate are more forward. The alcohol is very present but works into the whole package. Sweet, decadent, boozy, syrupy, bourbon, vanilla, char, roast, sweet dark fruits. Tasty but way over the top. 
The mouthfeel is perfect for the style, perfect. Heavy, thick, syrupy. No way to complain about it!
Overall, meh? Good. I'd happily drink it but I prefer regular Black Tuesday. And while it's a cool beer and it has a ton going on it's just not worth the price and effort for a non RS member to obtain. Glad I got to try it and it was a perfect beer for Christmas. 1,212 charactersBrew33, Dec 26, 2012

Served lightly chilled in an over sized wine glass. 
Bottled on: 02/09/2012 Lot 30
Thanks a million to futura123 for hooking me up with this bottle. 
Appearance: Hmmm, Chocolate Rain is far lighter than I expected. The body is dark brown and a back light shows a lot of deep red along the edges of the glass. A rough pour generates a small tan coloured head that dissipates almost instantly and leaves no lacing. As one would expect from a beer that is 19,5%, a swirl coats the glass in thick, yellow tinted alcohol legs. 
Smell: Mmmmm this smells absolutely amazing! There is not as much chocolate as I was expecting (it is no Southern Tier Choklat), but who cares when it smells this good! Notes include: Dark and milk chocolate, cocoa, bourbon, dark caramel, brown sugar, butterscotch, sweet vanilla, cocoa laced butter icing, chocolate liqueur, a ton of sweet dark fruits (cherries, raisins, dates and plums), a little oak and some molasses. For nearly 20%, there is shockingly little booze in the nose. 
Taste: The flavour follows on from the nose and is absolutely delicious. Notes include: A ton of chocolate, sweet dark caramel, toffee, bourbon, brown sugar, vanilla, oak, dark fruits and some molasses. As the beer warms the alcohol becomes a little bothersome, but that has to be expected from a beer of this Abv. 
Mouthfeel: The body is just shy of full, but incredibly sticky and the carbonation is of a medium-low level and nicely smooth. I could sip on a beer like this all day! 
Overall: Don't get me wrong, Chocolate Rain is a phenomenal beer, but I think I preferred Black Tuesday. 1,630 charactersThehuntmaster, Dec 06, 2012

Poured into a goblet. Black as pitch, slightly chestnut when held to the light, with a thin off white head that recedes into a thick, but substantial ring. 
Nose is very sweet: coffee, cream, booze, vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, light burnt sugar. You can smell the weight on this. 
Very tasty indeed, "rich" is an understatement. Boozy? At a hair under 20% of course it will be. However, I did find the sweetness and the booze more pronounced than the Tuesday. Vanilla and sugar quite prominent, though the other flavors are certainly there. Don't get me wrong, this is a damned tasty beer, but I give the edge to the Tuesday. Syrupy, velvety feel, with enough carbonation to keep the sweetness at bay. 
Very enjoyable beer, definitely worth a second look if I ever come across it again. 922 charactersJohnnyBarman, Nov 17, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 2
Appearance: Very dark brown with a fairly small beige head which dissipated fairly quickly. Considerable legs on this one.
Smell: Upfront Bourbon, raisins, brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate/cocoa, and a bit of coffee/roasted malt aroma. Also a bit of ethanol in the nose. 
Taste: Bourbon, raisins, vanilla, brown sugar, chocolate, and some coffee/roast malts appearing in the finish. There is an alcohol presence but no way is a beer that's 40 proof not going to have an alcohol presence. Nice barrel presence and flavor complexity. 
Mouth-feel: Medium to full bodied. Some heat but good for it's alcohol level.
Overall: Good beer, which is quite a bit better closer to room temperature. My memory may not be accurate but I feel the cask version I had in 2010 and Batch 1 were a bit better than the batch 2 bottle being reviewed. Nonetheless, it's a big beer that's a stellar sipper. 894 charactersIKR, Nov 10, 2012

Pours an inky black without much of a head that musters but dissipates quickly. The aroma from this glass is heavenly. Deep rich caramel and chocolate with hints of brownie batter, roast, vanilla and a fair amount of alcohol. You can tell this is high in abv from the aroma, but it never seems harsh. The flavor follows the aroma but the alcohol is a bit more evident but it really never harsh. Rich chocolate, vanilla, roast, caramel, and molasses flavors melded into a high abv sipper. This would be an excellent brew to sip with a few friends on a cold night with some cigars or brownies. Thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet almost syrupy mouthfeel. I/we enjoyed the hell out of this beer tonight, too bad I may never see another bottle of this! 806 charactersjohnnnniee, Nov 10, 2012

A - Holy shit!!! Thin mocha head atop a blackish brown hued pour. Outstanding with so much lovely legs!
S - TONS of chocolate and bourbon! Big, big vanilla comes through as it warms with nice light malt too. So much chocolate and bourbon. Like a Kentucky candy bar.
T - ¡¡¡¡¡¡ZZZOOOMMMGGG!!!!111 Liquid chocolate bars tempered with vanilla and bourbon. Rich, quality ingredients as well. Sweet zombie Jesus! So, so phenomenal with outstanding barrel notes, absurd amounts of silky chocolate. I really don't know how to put this into words. Its a silken chocolate gusher candy filled with bourbon and vanilla explosions. Unreal.
M - Mouthfeel is silk in my mouth. 19.5%...go F yourself! This can't be higher than 9%! I simply dont believe it, shanangins! Its thick and silky and almost coats the mouth. Its like a Geology field trip to Berkshire county all over again testing particle (grain) size on my tongue. Is this silt? Clay? No...its a colloid!!
O - This is a velour fog in my mouth covered in a velour bedspread, all of which is tucked into a too small velour uniform. Kif, inform the men! 1,206 charactersrudzud, Oct 31, 2012

Another huge thanks to Redbeeron for sending over this big time want in a trade! 
A: Pours a quite thin appearing dark brown with lightening on the edges. An aggressive pour yields approximately 1/2 fingers width of light tan head which dissipates down almost immediately to a think outer ring. Leaves no appreciable lacing. Actually appears very similar to a cola. 
S: Tons of bourbon and dark fruits. Cinnamon, caramel, vanilla bean ice cream, rich dark and milk chocolate, balancing booze, maybe even a hint of coconut. Jesus. Its so sweet and delicious smelling. Intoxicating. Incredible. 
T: Huge sweetness up front, with a big caramel/toffee presence. Dark fruits, fig and cherry. Pretty boozy from the get go, but it has to be to balance out the huge sweetness. Cocoa is significant and hangs around for ages in the aftertaste. Taste is similar to dark chocolate covered cherries, soaked in booze. I also get burnt sugar, bourbon, raw oak, some roasted malt flavors and vanilla which makes itself known but is mild. Awesome palate profile here. 
M/D: Smooth, slightly syrupy with an appropriately low carbonation. By no means thin, but could be thicker and chewier. Drinkability is actually very good, but this one is a slow sipper, thats for sure. And although this has a boozy component throughout, it does an incredible job of keeping the 19.5% ABV in check. Its the highest ABV beer I have had to date, and even with that ABV it is not necessarily even hot going down. 
O: Overall, another big hit from the Bruery in my book. Its literally one of the best smelling beers I have ever had, and the taste is excellent (but not quite to the degree of the nose). Im very glad I was able to try this one, and will definitely seek it out again. As far as in comparison to Black Tuesday, I like CR more. Better aroma and greater balance in the flavor profile (less of the straight up diabetes-inducing sweetness bomb that BT is). I'd drink both any chance I got, but BT is great, and CR is excellent. 2,058 characterszac16125, Oct 29, 2012

A: Pours a pitch black with no edge translucence. Very viscous, leggy (nice!). It has a small mocha-colored head. 
S: Rich, burnt caramel, chocolate, vanilla, molasses, raisins, bourbon. Some coffee, and of course, booze. As with many other Bruery beers, this is dessert in a bottle. Extremely rich. 
T: The taste is rich, as well, but it's not cloying. It comes off as a liqueur; the heavy body delivers burnt caramel, bourbon-soaked raisins, molasses, vanilla, coffee. It's tannic in the finish, which probably helps it feel a little drier than it actually is. 
M: I'm not sure who these people are that claim the beer isn't boozy. Of course it's boozy. But it's not quite as hot as I would expect (see some 120 Minute IPA for how to do it wrong). Even the sugar burn I typically get off Bruery beers is muted here. I don't know if that's from the oak suppressing it, but I'm impressed. 
O: I like this beer more than Black Tuesday; but I liked the small handbottle of Cherry Chocolate Rain (from cask) even more. I hope that comes around again. I don't think this is really worth $35 or whatever the cost was, but it's a tasty beer. 1,201 charactersArbitrator, Oct 19, 2012

(A)- Pours pitch black with some surprising tan and brown bubbles/froth considering the massive ABV on this thing.
(S)- A very dense but rich burnt caramel and cocoa with vanilla oak. In the far background is a more pronounced rich dark chocolate component. Very nice.
(T)- Similar to the smell, only a far far greater rich and silky chocolate flavor amidst dense caramel and vanilla oakiness. Some heat as well at the end, but definitely not nearly as much as I was expecting on a near 20%ABV beer.
(M)- A mellow carbonation level, but it fits this well. Very strong and rich overall. I like the deep chocolate middle of this beer's flavor profile; that richness definitely helps mask the huge ABV.
(O)- Definitely a fun and successful spin on the regular Black Tuesday. To me it is a bit hotter, but still not as massively crazy going into it. Extremely rich though. I daresay I almost like the regular BT version over this actually. 1,008 characterssweemzander, Sep 27, 2012
3.7/5  rDev -16.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Reviewed from memory, had this 3 nights ago. Dark brown, not much foam. Subtle carbonation. The nose struck me initally as very estery, almost banana, with vanilla bourbon notes galore. The booziness seems limited at first, but keep on smelling and it starts to get heavy with alcohols. I was expecting lots of chocolate and more roasted malt character but those were not very evident at all. 
The taste is much of the same, lots of vanilla character with more estery fruit. It's rich with bourbon, yet not overdone. The alcohol does not burn, and is well integrated in the flavor, but the warming is certainly felt throughout the body. It's a slow sipper but never gets to be too much, and a 4 to 5 ounce sample is a very nice amount to quaff. 
Overall a nice beer, and drinkable enough for 19% ABV. It's certainly not worth the hype though, and considering many in the group I shared this with said it was better than Black Tuesday (which I've not tried), that doesn't bode well for Black Tuesday. Worth a try if you get the chance, but don't trade away your gold for it. 1,075 charactersbennetj17, Sep 23, 2012

Poured dark brown with a mild mannered khaki head; the retention was light, with a non-existant lacing. The nose picked up some cocoa, vanilla, molasses, caramel, and paramount bourbon. The flavor profile was really impressive out of the gate. It wasn’t initially boozy, but it was very heavy on the cocoa nibs and vanilla. However, the booze hit quite hard in the back finish which pretty much dominated the rest of my drinking session. The malt profile was dominant throughout – more caramel, molasses, cocoa nibs, vanilla, dark fruits, biscuits, and some more booziness. Sticky mouthfeel with a thin to medium presence. Unfortunately, the booze took over the pleasant aromas and flavors which were much appreciated initially. 776 charactersCuriousMonk, Sep 20, 2012

A: Sludge and tar. Heavy pour yields a very thin mocha lacing which will quickly dissipate. Not as viscous in the glass as it first appears.
N: Tons of prune and bourbon. Fudge and soy sauce. The promised vanilla is plenty obvious, and there's a very good similarity to blackberry brandy.
T: Very much like a port heavily laden with chocolate and cherries. Snapping vanilla and rough dark chocolate similar to mocha powder. Prune and some more of the blackberry brandy. Huge alcohol presence. And oh yes, chocolate deserves another mention.
M: Drying and thick. The drying aspect is somewhat unique as its similar to the way baker's chocolate scrapes your mouth clean. Don't find this terribly successful.
O: Very glad to try this. Was very intense, but I feel like it could benefit from some more body and less chocolate. And this is coming from someone who's a bit of a choco-nut. 976 charactersSarlacc83, Sep 16, 2012

4.25/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42012 bottle courtesy of Vincent at our crazy Antwerp tasting. Thanks everyone for an amazing night that will long have a special place in my heart and liver. Sampled next to a 2011 Black Tuesday, in a 50-50 blend of the two and even mixed with a lambic (which was dead gorgeous). Yeah, that's how crazy things got.
A: Pours a chestnut brown going into black. Very little head with awesome oily lacing that gets swept away by the alcohol. You can tell just by looking at it this is going to be one boozy beast.
S: Bourbon, vanilla and milk chocolate. No real bitter notes from dark chocolate, which I was expecting since this was matured on whole cocoa nibs. The differences with Black Tuesday are there, but they are very subtle at best. It seems the cocoa has mostly subdued the oaky notes from the barrel.
T: First things to hit the tongue are bourbon, vanilla, sweet Japanese soy sauce and creamy milk chocolate. Some woody notes, but very subtle if so. This is distinctly less sweet than the Black Tuesday, whereas I was expecting the complete opposite due to added vanilla during maturation. The cocoa nibs are sadly all but lost to me and that's a bit of a shame: the bitterness and slight acidity of a roasted cocoa bean would have cut through all that sweetness beautifully. Again, the booze is very present and borderline hot. It could do with some aging.
M: Soft carbonation that's only just enough to remind you that you're drinking a beer and not syrup. Very fitting for the style.
O: Though the maturation on cocoa nibs is sadly a bit lost to me, I preferred this over its base beer. Where the alcohol in Black Tuesday came out just a touch more aggressively because of the sweetness in it, the added maturation on this seems to have mellowed out some of that hotness. Since there are currently no Choccy Rains older than a year and a half and the first batch is very hard to get, this beer will take some time before it reaches its peak. When the time comes, I'll be sure to give it another shot. 2,015 charactersDennoman, Aug 26, 2012
4.81/5  rDev +8.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Notes from a tasting on 8/15. not sure who brought this one, but i can tell you that it was far and away the highlight of the tasting. i had a batch 2 recently (review still needs to be added), and i can tell you it is a different beer entirely from batch 1. batch 2 is not bad by any stretch of the imagination, but batch 1 is simply magic in a bottle.
Batch #1!!!
a - poured a watery black with no head at all, looks kind of sludgy, but has that darkness of the devil's soul.
s - a hint of rubbing alcohol with a salm in the face of amazing gourmet chocolate and the perfect dosage of vanilla glazed on top. some toasted coconut in the background to round out the nose. really just marvellous, my mouth is watering.
t - HOLY MOLY!!! Huge vanilla with rich decadent chocolate. Still pretty hot, but beautiful. everything is in it's right place. the vanilla is divine. not a vanilla bomb, but a dessert.
m - a bit hot, but silky smooth. for a beer this huge, it blows you away how great it drinks.
o - FAR superior to batch 2. FAR FAR FAR superior. this beer is unreal. the entire group was floored by it and i don't think one of us didn't peg this as the top beer of the evening (and it was in good company with rare, black note, pappy eclipse, and other big guns). we even gave some sips to a table of ladies next to us and they too were blown away that "a dark beer" could taste so good. when we told them the ABV, they thought we were lying. 1,451 characterscosmicevan, Aug 21, 2012

4.12/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Decided to open this one with a few friends during our annual trip to Maine. Batch #2.
A- No carbonation at all really. Pour was slightly thin, similar to BT. Dark brown in color, not as dark as most stouts.
S- Right up front the chocolate hit me, followed by oak, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, toffee, and some burnt notes as well. There is a lot of alcohol on the nose as well. The aroma is extremely sweet, but I expected this.
T- A lot of the same notes in the aroma come through in the taste as well. Dark chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla are the main flavors that come out. The aftertaste is all dark chocolate. Chocolate Rain is definitely not as smooth as BT. There is a huge alcohol presence and although it doesn't taste like it's 19.5%, it's still very obvious that it's high. The taste is extremely sweet, maybe even more than BT.
M- Thinner, definitely not creamy at all. No carbonation.
O- This is good, but not great. It's on par with Black Tuesday if you enjoyed that, but it's different. I feel like both of them are constantly rated high because they're great for having such a high ABV, but that doesn't impress me. I'd rather drink a stout that's 12% and tastes better, but that's just me. There are some exceptionally complex flavors in this that made me happy that I tried it, but I wouldn't seek it out again. It's not very smooth at all and just too sweet for my taste. 1,397 charactersmgp2675, Aug 19, 2012

4.82/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5In the Beer 2000 (the rest of this voice should sound like Conan O'brien)... Oh man, never thought I would reach 1000 let alone 2000, holy crap! To do it, one of my long (about 1 year) sought after beers, Chocolate Rain, "Some stay dry and others feel the pain" (Tay Zonday eat your heart out). Shared with rudzud as our shared RS membership dictates.
As it pours, it looks a bit lighter than I expected as it's flowing slowly out of the bottle. A light fizzy head forms, darker colored I think although hard to tell, fades almost instantly, although typical for ridiculous abv beer, over a very dark beer, not quite pitch black, with hints of light sneaking through the edges, and I mean HINTS. It also wants to have legs, but is more like a layered sleen of beer slowly sliding down the sides of the glass instead of legs.
Nose is just pure chocolate! Awesomeness! Tons of chocolate right out, oh and vanilla!. A big cocoa nib profile wafts out of the glass, not too aggressive at first, but then shows me up quickly, with some cocoa nibs, melted milk chocolate, a bit of baker's and some heavy dark chocolate. The fresh soaked vanilla beans, tons of caramel and molasses to add to the richness. A bit of booze, but doesn't seem like 19% yet. It brings that aroma of a brick of almost pure dark chocolate, there's so much chocolate! so many exclamation points!. A hint of cinnamon leads to some brandy and bourbon soaked raisin, vanilla, some oak and bourbon. The vanilla really builds as it warms.
Taste, ooohhh man, knee buckling, luckily I peed before I sipped this. it just erupts with pure chocolate! It reminds me a lot of the huge brick of the super dark chocolate I used to get at Trader Joe's which I would shave slices off, and let them just melt over my tongue, and the result is almost exactly like this experience. Various layers of chocolate melting all over my mouth, bakers', dark, milk, cocoa nibs, etc, etc, and also etc. Then comes vanilla, with all the descriptors I did for chocolate, vanilla is just behind it (well mostly after it warms). Some toasty oak barrel, vanilla, pure vanilla bean and richness. Some bourbon comes through as well, not strong, but enough to let you know, with a light bourbon soaked raisin like flavor. It drinks like 9% not 19%, smooth and rich, and just a light bitterness. A touch of biscuit adds some malted milk ball flavor. Finish is super long, mouth coating, tons of vanilla, chocolate, dark choc, light bourbon, oak, booze, and just a touch of bitterness, linger for what seems like forever, and even burps up flavor of awesomeness hours later.
Mouth... holy shit, this has to be the best mouth feel I've ever had in a beer!!! it doesn't even seem like a beer, more like velvet, velour, essence of pour silk, and everything in between, all having sex with the hottest chic in the world in heaven, wrapped in melted dark chocolate, and served on a naked hot Japanese woman, ala sushi, etc. There really isn't a word to describe the mouth feel. If I could vote for higher than 5, this mouth would go to 11. It even tickles my gums on each subsequent sip, literally tickles!
Overall... gggmmmsssshhhgggguguuuaaahhhgggrrrlllggguuh. 3,191 charactersjlindros, Aug 15, 2012
4.13/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Batch 2 poured into a Cigar City snifter
Appearance ~ Deep Black/Brown with a small amount of Tan head. 
Smell ~ BOURBON, Chocolate, BOURBON, vanilla, BOURBON and some nice almond notes. In case you didn't catch the bourbon, I thought my nose was going to catch on fire it smelled so strong.
Taste ~ This baby is hot, really hot. Chocolate and sugar are really nice, its a good sweet, and not too sweet. Only problem I have with the taste is the overwhelming booze. Great taste after you get past the alcohol.
Mouthfeel ~ Nice, still a little hot, but the aroma hangs around nicely.
Overall ~ This is a quality brew. I think if I have another, i'll hang on to it for a minimum of 3 years before I drink the next one so the hardcore booze calms down. CR is Black Tuesday with cocoa nibs. It's good, but I would have just saved the cocoa and put out more Black Tuesday, BT is much better at hiding the heat. BT is just much better period. 941 charactersUNCCTDawg, Aug 10, 2012

The beer pours a deep black with no visible head. The nose is cloyingly sweet with a touch of chocolate and way too much booziness. The taste is just as sweet and the immensely overpowering alcohol makes this beer less than enjoyable. I literally feel my palate burning with each sip...and none of the beers rich, chocolaty body comes to my rescue. I assumed the beer would have a velvety smoothness that masked the alcohol, but this is not the case. (Batch #1 is significantly better with far less high octane ethanol and much more chocolaty smoothness). I just don't understand the hype...but I'd recommend getting a Batch#1 over a #2 in any case.
2013 batch shared side-by-side with mocha wednesday and BT
Pours a bit darker than Black Tuesday, very dark brown, some sediment, razor thin head around the perimeter. The nose had a potently aromatic vanilla, some deeper chocolate notes, prune as it warms, caramel sweetness, hints of alcohol. The taste has a big chocolatey sweetness and burning ethanol in the finish. The mouthfeel is sweet, but has a vanilla and chocolate presence that cuts through the ethanol (especially compared to Black Tuesday). It's not as thick and full bodied as expected, but the alcohol is well masked, even when it warms. This beer is noticeably better than the base, really drinkable considering the abv and heavy flavors 1,417 charactersThePorterSorter, Aug 04, 2012

Big whiff of alcohol, even from across the room. Dark chocolate, bourbon and wood. 
A bit of sweeter chocolate up front. Heavy notes of bourbon and wood. Perhaps a bit of vanilla comes through to round things out. Chocolate and booze linger on the palate for quite a long time.
A bit light in the body, with an almost oily feel. Alcohol is quite warming, but not overwhelming. Quite the experience. 534 charactersBierguy5, Jul 29, 2012

Big fusle alcohol aromas almost burns my nose hairs. Thick chocolate, vanilla and toasty oak with a nice layer of bourbon. Some dark fruit lies underneath.
Just a killer tasting beer. Layers of sweet melted chocolate, fudge, vanilla bean, bourbon, dried fruits, burnt caramel, toasted oak, very light coffee. Date, black fig, quince and black licorice. Some cherry and currant as well. 
Mouth isn't big and thick but oily and slick with alcohol. But fits the beer well and doesn't interfere.

Pours dark black, with zero head, zero bubbles at all. The smell is way too hot. Loads of alcohol, as well as chocolate, roasts, vanilla, and a bit of bourbon. Taste is sweet from the vanilla. Not as much chocolate flavor as Black Tuesday, and also extremely hot. Just too much booze. However, once you get pass the booziness, it is blended nicely. Mellow chocolate, sweet vanilla, and balanced bourbon make the flavor have a lot to look forward to. Mouthfeel, once again, just overrun with booziness. Full, and creamy, but the booze is just too much. Overall, I gave this a 4.5 based on how I think this will develop. I'm going to wait at least 2 years to open my 2nd bottle, and I think this will be amazing once the booziness fades. At the moment, I prefer Black Tuesday over Chocolate Rain, but that could change with some age. 908 characters1Adam12, Jul 20, 2012
4/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Shared this bottle with the girlfriend and some friends at Eureka! Burger last night. Pours a thick black color with little to no head. Some tiny brown bubbles. Scent is very sweet and boozy. The booze is very up front in the nose, which quickly switches to sweet chocolate and vanilla. Subtle sweet bourbon aroma with more intensified vanilla. Taste is not nearly as boozy as the nose made it seem. Very sweet though. Intense sweet chocolate and vanilla flavors...like literally eating some rich chocolate cake. I feel like there could have been more barrel flavor to this beer...and possibly a little overly sweet. Mouthfeel is full bodied and syrupy. Drinkability is fair, as long as you are sharing it with a good amount of people. Overall, I enjoyed Black Tuesday a bit more. This is a well-crafted beer that most breweries could not pull off (a 19.5 ABV stout that is drinkable!)...just good in small doses. Glad I tried it. I have one more bottle and need to decide whether to age it longer or trade it. 1,010 charactersDovaliHops, Jul 19, 2012

3.0 A: Deep brown/black color. Head fell just about as soon as it was made.
4.0 S: Surprisingly, the booze is fairly well hidden, in the the nose at least. Big roastiness, lots of sweetness, but reasonable. Chocolate, vanilla, molasses, and leathery bourbon. Coffee underneath. It's intense, but it doesn't have much of the subtlety or complexity that I like to discover in the style.
2.5 T: Big roast, lots of chocolate, caramel, and molasses. Vanilla with oak underneath. Big leathery bourbon. Uncontrolled sweetness and booze, but not quite as bad as BT '11 was.
3.0 M: Heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Too thick and chewy though otherwise okay.
2.5 D: This is undoubtably tough to drink and no one in my 'burgh tasting group cared for it. 814 charactersDavoleBomb, Jul 18, 2012

Appearance - Dark brown, not quite black. Ruby flecks in the light. Mocha head that's gone pretty quickly.
Smell - Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Nice, until the booze. Wow is it boozy.
Taste - Sugar. Sugar again. Bourbon. Chocolate, then sugar and sugar again. Alcohol rounds it out, I guess. I get the chocolate, but there's no other evidence of a stout in there. Still, it tastes pretty damn good.
Mouthfeel - Sugary sweet. Diabetes in a bottle. 3 or 4 oz. is the most I could drink of this. Excruciatingly boozy.
Overall - It's so over the top. Better than BT, but only because of the chocolate flavor. There's barely a stout back there behind the barrel and chocolate. 751 charactersAlieniloquium, Jul 17, 2012

This thing reeks of booze and vanilla bean, with chocolate back behind it -- I love it! Taste is the same. Actually reminds me a good bit of World Wide Stout. Big chocolate, licorice, vanilla, "bourbon" (and all that entails) and booze. I keep saying "booze" -- but don't let that fool you. Also, there's some roast on the palate, which I'm extremely sensitive too -- but it's minimal and quickly overwhelmed by the rest of the beer. This is imminently drinkable and smooth, with a nice warming burn as it goes down. Mouthfeel is syrupy, but not overly thick.
I love it, but I think I loved Black Tuesday even more. And quite frankly, I feel like World Wide Stout scratches the same itch pretty well...and WWS is way more readily available. 838 charactersMavajo, Jul 10, 2012

A: Very light for an imperial stout with minimal head. Not very good, but I guess it could be worse.

M: Fairly thick mouthfeel with low carbonation. A bit too low on the carb.
O: This is a sweet boozy unrefined milk chocolate bomb. It's certainly not bad, but it's certainly not world class. 633 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Jul 09, 2012

A - Poured very dark brown and looked unexpectedly thin during the pour. Settled black with next to no head. 
S - Big bourbon and vanilla notes up front with oak, cocoa nibs and a big sweetness. Very robust and inviting nose. 
T - A big hit of bourbon up front with loads of sweet vanilla and oak. There is also intense cocoa and lighter licorice and roast flavours present. The vanilla really takes centre stage here with the added vanilla beans accentuating the natural vanilla from the barrels. There is a fairly big alcohol presence, but considering the 19.5% ABV, it isn't harsh at all. In fact, the ABV is just enough to balance out the sweet vanilla and cocoa. Very decadent. 
M - Medium body with some viscosity at times. Light carbonation. 
O - A truly decadent beer. I haven't had an imperial stout over 14% ABV that was as drinkable as this one. Remarkable. 1,017 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Jul 01, 2012

T: The taste is simply amazing! Unlike the nose this is leaps and bounds above BT. There were massive flavors of chocolate, vanilla cream, fudge brownies, molasses, and bourbon.
M: The feel is medium bodied and thick like syrup on the finish. The beer does get kind of cloying the longer you drink it.
O: I was not as impressed with BT when I had it as I thought I would but this definitely lived up to the hype. I could drink this all the time in small quantities. It does get cloyingly sweet as you get to the end of your glass but it's so tasty. 942 charactersGregSVT, Jun 27, 2012

From a 750ml bottle into a snifter
Second bottling
Note: We drank this right after the 2011 batch of Black Tuesday, so much of this review applies there as well. 
APPEARANCE: Luckily this one didn't gush like BT'11 did. Both beers pour very similar though. A very transparent, thin, and relatively light brown pour yields a thin, loose, bubbly, off-white head with lousy retention. Clear bistre brown body with no real carbonation. Head quickly fades to a thin ring, which eventually vanishes as well. Looks flat by the end and absolutely no lacing at all. Much too thin and transparent for the style as well. Very disappointing; clearly worse than older vintages of the Black Tuesday. 
SMELL: Quite a bold nose on this one. Chocolate notes for sure with a good dose of bourbon barrel. Oak and a touch of vanilla in there as well. Still boozy with lots of bourbon barrel, though the cocoa mellows it out a bit and it's not as harsh as Black Tuesday. Lots of chocolate and barrel, though not much stout per se. 
TASTE: Lots of cocoa up front, accompanied by plenty of bourbon, oak and vanilla from the barrel. Booze and a touch of roasted malt through the middle, then a big, boozy burst at the swallow with some vanilla and chocolate following through. Big, bold and boozy aftertaste of bourbon, oak, vanilla and enough cocoa linger and linger on the palate. This is very much Black Tuesday plus cocoa and vanilla. A boozy, flavorful desert beer. Boozier than the '10 and '09 vintages of Black Tuesday for sure. 
PALATE: Medium-light body with medium levels of carbonation. A little lighter than the base beer, and definitely lighter than older vintages of Black Tuesday. Goes down with a decent burn after the swallow and finishes rather sticky on the palate. Lots of heat lingers. Too light and harsh really. A little challenging here. 
OVERALL: This is a huge beer for sure. The nose and flavor are quite decadent, thought it suffers from being wholly too hot right now. This and the '11 Black Tuesday were way hotter than I remember the 2010 and 2009 vintages of the base beer. Moreover, the look was sad and the feel simply too light and harsh to really be an enjoyable drink. While the appearance is a lost cause I'm afraid, some time will hopefully let the booze mellow and the feel smoothen out a bit, which will move this in the right direction. There is a lot of potential here, but there's too much "big" in the way. Thanks again for the bottles boys. I look forward to seeing how this one develops with a couple years on it. 2,671 charactersJeffo, Jun 23, 2012
4.17/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750ml poured into a matching Bruery snifter. The brew streams a dark brown that settles in the glass more toward black. An initial 3/4 finger of tan froth dissolves to a fine ring around the edge of the glass. Some spotting of lace sticks to the glass that is minimal. There is a greater amount of alcohol legs that sticks to the glass than lace. A swirl agitates bubbles from solution that again creates a quick dissolving film. When held to the light, the brew looks more of a clouded brown with some yellowish/orange highlights around the edges.
The aroma is fairly strong with notes of cocoa and vanilla. These 2 characteristics are also present in the base beer but it is really exaggerated here in Chocolate Rain. The overall nose is quite sweet smelling and inviting with character that is reminiscent of brownie batter. As the brew warms up, the alcohol starts to come through with some solvent burning to the nostrils and a faint amount of dark fruity character.
The taste is sticky and sweet with an immediate rush of chocolate and strong vanilla flavoring. There is no hiding that 19.5% abv though. It comes surging out with bold fusels and a solvent kick that strips the sweetness from the inside of the mouth and burns all the way down the gullet. There is a bit of bitterness here towards the back that seems like unsweetened chocolate and a bit of fruity hop accent. Black licorice is evident in the aftertaste.
This is a full bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. It is thick and chewy yet a smooth sipper. This is an impressively bold brew with a shocking amount of cocoa and vanilla inclusion (moreso than I expected.) As far as drinkability goes, this one is a brute and is not something to be drank glass after glass of. It is rich and inviting and something I would like to be able to take in small samples on multiple occasions, not try and tackle an entire 750ml of. Fans of Black Tuesday will love this but in my opinion this is really hot right now. I wish I would have waited a year or more to open this. 2,044 charactersstakem, Jun 22, 2012

4.59/5  rDev +3.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle. Bottled 02/09/12. ABV 19.5%. Served in a snifter.
Pours dark root beer brown, slightly translucent. No head, just a tiny ring of bubbles. No lacing.
Aroma of dry chocolate, coffee, vanilla, bourbon, wood, dark fruits and a significant amount of alcohol. Chocolate is the strongest note.
Flavor starts with rich sweet chocolate. Some roast, but sweetness takes the forefront. Vanilla and dark fruit flavors are there, but sit behind the chocolate. Bourbon barrel notes emerge through the finish. Not tasting much of the copious alcohol, but heat comes on quickly. Chocolate lingers on in the aftertaste. Stunning and powerful flavor.
On the fuller side of medium bodied with low carbonation. Fairly silky and smooth.
A fantastic beer, especially for chocolate lovers. 785 charactersbrotherloco, Jun 03, 2012
4.59/5  rDev +3.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle dated 020912, Lot 30.
A: Pours jet black with only a tiny light brown head that fades almost immediately. Just little specks of lacing.
S: Huge boozy bourbon aroma. Loads of toffee, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, raisins and vanilla. Very similar to BT but with more vanilla and chocolate (but not much). 
T: Up front, big toffee, caramel, brown sugar and molasses hit with a punch of alcohol burn to boot. Turns into a bunch of vanilla and bitter cocoa. Smooths out a bit into the finish with a sweeter milk chocolate. Stinging booze. Very sweet, especially in the chocolate and vanilla that stick around for a long time in the aftertaste.
M: Big, thick, heavy, syrupy mouth-coating stout. 
O: Well, I had a BT last week and I wanted to compare to CR within a reasonable time frame. They are 90% alike. The biggest difference I noted was the lesser molasses and fruit element in this compared to BT, and the much larger chocolate and vanilla factor in this as well. This tastes more like a stout whereas BT tastes like a barleywine/stout blend aged in bourbon barrels. Regardless of the differences, this is one big, complex and sweet beast of a beer. It's extremely rare to get a beer that is almost 20% that comes out this well. This might be the only one, in fact. Hence the 5. 1,294 charactersDope, Jun 02, 2012
4.03/5  rDev -9%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Siege06nd for breaking out a bottle of this the other night. 2012 vintage poured from a 750ml bottle. It poured dark brown in color with a spotty tan lacing scattered across the top. It appeared a little lighter in color and more still then I would have liked. 
In the aroma the vanilla immediately stands out to me, but the chocolate isn't far behind. I get a little roasted malts to it, but the sweeter chocolate and vanilla steal the show. It's got a bit of a nice dark fruit presence as well. The bourbon was a little more reserved, but did come out more as it warmed. It's definitely sweet and boozy, but the aroma was good enough to overcome that for the most part. 
Lots of chocolate and cocoa come out in the taste. The vanilla really starts to shine more towards the finish. I get a little bit of a roasted malt presence, helping it from becoming too over the top sweet. The bourbon is in the finish as well, but adds more of a boozy, alcohol heat and doesn't really compliment or integrate into the beer flavors all that well. 
The mouthfeel is a little oily with low carbonation. The mouthfeel is a little thin for the style, but I like the low carbonation. Overall, very good but short of great. It's very rich, with some great flavors but the boozy alcohol heat hurts it for me. The bourbon barrel flavors just doesn't seem as complimenting, integrated and smooth as they could have been. 1,414 charactersbillab914, May 31, 2012

A. Disappointing, big time. Faint, loose head that quickly disappears. Looks like flat coke.
S. Really nice. Vanilla, chocolate, brownie batter, caramel, and ripe dark fruit. The fruit qualities here are amazing. But it also comes with an undercurrent of booze, which I fear will bleed into the taste...
T. And there it is. Boozy as all get out. Tastes pretty damn nice besides that, with chocolate, vanilla, caramel, fruit, and barrel. But man is it sweet. Uber-sweet. Disgustingly sweet. Fat kid finishing his whole bag of Halloween candy in one night sweet. Gahhh.
M. Flat-ish. Low on carb, high on booze, and mega-high on sugar. There is some very enjoyable complexity here, including chocolate, fruit, vanilla but it gets totally bombed out by the sweetness and the lack of carb.
O. Well, what a disappointment. Goodness gracious the hype train has gone off the rails on this one. If you gave me 4 more of these, I would trade very single one for some freakin' KBS. Just massively overrated, and quite literally diabetes in a bottle. One (maybe two) note and lacking in imagination, Chocolate Rain is admirably mediocre, but mediocre all the same. 1,180 characterssiege06nd, May 26, 2012

*From notes
-- Big, big thanks go out to siege06nd for opening his CHOCOLATE RRAAAIIINNNN!!! Thanks buddy. --
A: Not the best of introductions. This looks kinda like a cherry cola, as it's a pretty clean, fair brown. A forceful pour yields no head, no collar, no lacing. Really not off to a good start here.
S: I don't even have to put this to my nose to smell it, as this is as aromatic as any beer I've come across. Costco sized quantities of ruby port wine overwhelm my nostrils. Lots and lots and lots of red vine fruit. Letting this open a bit, the vanilla really begins to show itself. It's quite candied and really damn expressive.
T: Creamy, luscious vanilla, mounds of warm dark chocolate, intense red vine fruit and a boatload of booze. The bourbon and 19% ABV attack the finish. Jesus is this hot. It really sticks to the jowls and burns long after the beer's gone down my gullet. This is most certainly a dessert beer to be sure, as it's extremely cloying and pretty damn sweet. It's also divisive: most of the group felt this to be too much, where I really enjoyed it for what it is.
M: Lackluster is a good way of putting it. The feel for such a big beer like this should be dense and thick. I should need a knife and fork to get through this one. Instead, it's lacking any semblance of complexity and proper weight. I really think that a bigger body would make for a more balanced and enjoyable beer.
O: Certainly a good beer, but it's an aquired taste, I suspect. I found more pleasure in this then the rest of my tasting group, yet I do firmly believe that this never reaches the upper echelon of the ADIS style. I'm not quite sure how this got to the lofty status it currently holds, as I assume the hype train just got a rollin' and never let go. Do yourself a favor and hold onto your cellar's best bottles, as 'll bet they're better then this. 1,935 charactersRhettroactive, May 25, 2012

Score: 98
2012 vintage bottle (batch 2) served in my brand new Kate The Great balloon glass and enjoyed on 05/12/12.
Appearance: Pours a jet black color. This looks like motor oil. Completely opaque. A thin layer of brown/milk chocolate head quickly and completely settles. Minimal, oily lacing and minimal retention. This nearly 20% ABV beer is intimidatingly heavy on appearance. 4.5/5
Smell: Rich milk chocolate, vanilla beans and lots of modestly sweet raisin/dark fruit. Smooth molasses. Sweet on the nose, but not Dark Lord sweet. There is a little alcohol heat, but not nearly as much as you'd expect from a 19.5% ABV beer. 5/5
Taste: Sweeter taste than the aroma, but this beer is still far from cloying, "diabetes-inducing" sweetness (or even Dark Lord-like sweetness). Sweet and creamy vanilla and milk chocolate throughout. Ample warming alcohol heat on the midpalate, but no "booziness" flavor in conjunction with this palate sensation. Plenty of bitter cocoa, bourbon and molasses flavors to boot. As the beer layers, I detect a little sweet dark cherry flavor akin to the Black Albert. Just a little bit of oaky/wood flavor.
Mouthfeel: A little short of full bodied. Minimal carbonation. Has a slick mouthfeel that falls between syrupy and oily. Sweet and warming finish. 4.25/5
Overall: Sweet, rich and decadent. This beer is incredibly/surprisingly smooth and drinkable for the ABV. In my opinion, Chocolate Rain absolutely lives up to its hype. I can see why some think it's too sweet of a stout, but I did not think it was. I personally prefer this brew to Bell's Black Note. I doubt I could drink a whole bottle of Chocolate Rain -- be it because of the ABV or the layering sweetness -- but I probably could and would regularly knock this one back during the winter months if it was readily available in 12 oz bottles.
Recommendation: Everyone should seek a bottle of this stuff out to share with a small group of friends.
Pairings: A cocoa-nib rubbed filet.
Cost: $40 for a 750 ml bottle. 2,063 charactersjegross2, May 24, 2012

Chocolate Rain Batch 2 in a waxed 750 format bottle split 3 ways. An 8-9oz pour served in a snifter at cellar temp.
reviewed from notes taken on 5/18/12.
Appearance: black bodied beer with a thin brown head that drops quickly to no head or ring. 
Smell: Perhaps my favorite part of this beer is the nose. Massive gourmet dark chocolates, bitter cocoa, and vanilla notes. Smells like a rich dessert. Hints of oak and bourbon are a bit more subtle. When this beer is at cellar temperature is has no booze in the nose, but as it warms the begins to become noticable. It just smells amazing, I could smell this beer all night.
Taste: Its taste is a little contridictory, but not in a bad way...it both a massive beer yet its mellow too. It pretty sweet, but not quite cloying to my palate because I enjoy sweeter stout over a hoppy stout. The beer opens up with notes of dark bitter chocolates, bourbon, cocoa and they mix with big vanilla notes. You can get a hint of the booze when this beer hits room temperature, but you gotta expect that when a beer is 19.50%. 
Mouthfeel: This aspect of the beer also impressed me. Its full bodied beer with low carbonation. Its big, its favorful, mellow, and smooth. The alcohol is warming and has a mild boozey burn to it when at room temp. I think it drinks at an ABV of 12-13% which is impressive when it 19.50%. A sipper for sure. It also surprised me that the beer was not as thick as i expected it to be, but it does have an oily and slick quality to it.
Overall: Really crazy what brewers can do these days to push the envolope of truly big beer while still making it pleasant and palatable. I was impressed by this offering by the Bruery! Honestly, I dont think I would age this beer, I would drink it fresh.
Had this side by side with 2011 Black Tuesday! Gotta say that Chocolate Rain is much smoother and more mellow than Black Tuesday. 1,960 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, May 22, 2012
3.57/5  rDev -19.4%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3First had: bottle as a "gift"
2012 bottle labeled as 19.5%ABV
Refrigerated for about a half hour, and allowed to slowly warm while drinking. Decanted into a Bruery snifter, dark cola brown color, translucent around the edges, with a thin, wispy tan head. No real lacing, but a streaky, oily film is left on the glass. Nose is pretty much straight up bourbon and dark chocolate. Taste is pretty hot with booze (my throat is burning as we speak), bourbon is the first thing to hit the palate, followed by dark chocolate, sweet vanilla extract, with notes of oak and cocoa powder. Chocolate definitely comes out more as the beer warms. It's sweet and boozy, basically, with some chocolate in it. A bit chalky in the finish. Body is on the heavier side of medium, but not at all full. The booze cuts back on the drinkability a bit, and I'd like to taste it after a year or two of aging, but that probably won't happen. Pretty good overall, but there are plenty of other chocolate beers out there that are better, made better, and of course much easier to obtain.
Tasty enough. Worth a try? Sure. Worth the hype? No. And I'm not going to give a super-high rating just because it's rarity. Easily the best Bruery beer I've had so far, but just further convinced me that all Bruery beers are overrated. I have other Bruery beers in the cellar, but I'm pretty much done going out of my way for them. 1,393 charactersRifugium, May 16, 2012

A: Like many of the release-day RIS beers of current day, it is a deep dark brown with a thin coffee head. It still manages to retain a small head, unlike Dark Lord.
S: Dark chocolate. A quick bit of sweetness at first, but its just like a raw chocolate candle in front of your face. I really go for sweet beers, like Curmudgeon's Better Half, so I immediately got excited.
T: You remember the first time you went and bought a young's double chocolate stout, rogue chocolate stout, or anything else that said "chocolate"? A little part of you was really hoping it would be like the real thing. All the beers until now fell short. It is literally like eating a vanilla dipped chocolate bar. Sweetness is just perfect. The vanilla was present but did not take away too much from the chocolate in my opinion. It's just amazing all around. 
M: So creamy. The conditioning all around leaves a mouthfeel i'll never forget. The chocolate lingers, as it should - it's the star of this beer.
O: This is one of the beers that have made it into my personally acclaimed "best things i have ever put into my mouth" list. I took one sip of this beer, looked at BackFat and said, "I feel like I just cheated on my girlfriend" Others have reviewed this beer and said it has too much chocolate, but thats why this is a forum - lots of this goes on personal taste and preference. Chocolate Rain hits just about every thing I want in a beer. Cheers! 1,518 charactersTroopScoop, May 15, 2012

A: Dark brown on the pour and even so sitting in the glass. There's a blackness to the beer though it's not jet black like other Imperial Stouts. No head at all, only a thin tiny bubble ring around the edges.
S: Chocolate liqueur, milk chocolate chips, fresh split vanilla beans, roasted malts and a touch of coffee. Throughout there's a noticeable generic alcohol smell but it actually works nicely with the aromas instead of sidetracking them.
T: Huge milk chocolate, it tastes like I'm chewing on gooey chocolate chips. Touches of bourbon play throughout the palate, with hints of vanilla beans and dark roasted malts in the background. This is such a big, rich and sweet beer but it's not disconnected or overdone at all. Really amazing stuff right here, beautiful beer.
M: Not too thick but full-bodied. Almost chewy in a sense from the chocolate but not from the actual mouth feel itself. A bit hot from the alcohol and a little sticky.
Simply put, this beer was incredible. It delivered on so many different levels and took Black Tuesday which is an amazing beer on its own to the next level. The fresh chocolate and vanilla flavors were incredible additions. Absolutely one beer everyone must try. Amazing stuff right here! 1,399 charactersShanePB, May 06, 2012

For a beer called 'Chocolate Rain' there's a crap-ton of vanilla in it. The nose is sweet and vanilla. Other things exist, but they are pounded mercilessly by Mr. V. 
And the taste is vanilla. Sweet and dull. That flavor just pops out and kills enjoyment of other flavors, like cocoa (little) and caramel (very little). Drain pour here.
Could pair well with ice cream, or something else too sweet...like cotton candy. 547 charactersMebuzzard, May 05, 2012

A: Pours a jet black with a thin tan head forming on the pour. It recedes quickly to a thin ring and leaves some massive legs on the glass after each sip.
S: Big boozy bourbon with some brownie and chocolate covered raisins. The oak is present as well, but is really dominated by the booze.
T: Dark chocolate, boozy bourbon and some woody oak. Dark fruits, mainly raisins and figs are mid palate. The finish is mainly a vanilla sweetness and some warming booze.
M: Slick and viscous. Low carbonation and some warmth in the throat.
O: This beer definitely needs some time. I enjoyed the sweetness from the vanilla but it couldn't quite cut the big boozy bourbon. I'm glad I still have one in the cellar that I can revisit in a year or two. 846 charactersTreebs, Apr 29, 2012

Pitch black. Viscous and pretty oily looking. Short dark khaki head. Pretty low retention and spotty lacing. 
Nose is nice but obviously young. A bit boozy but I like a bit of booziness. Rich chocolate and vanilla with a touch of bourbon. 
Flavor IMO is fantastic. Huge and rich. Vanilla and chocolate are nice although it needs to age to perfection. Very deep dark sweet but not overly sweet. 
Mouth is very full bodied. Low carbonation. 
Overall this beer is fantastic and will be amazing with about two years age IMO. Can't wait to revisit. 592 charactersMrVonzipper, Apr 25, 2012

Thanks Andrew!!
Dark brown, clear, not much head yada yada. I thought Black Tuesday was liqueur like, Chocolate Rain is liquor like. Thin, boozy and hot, in the best way. Chocolate, vanilla, toffee... it tastes like one of those fancier candies.
It is so damn good, I would consider killing an entire bottle myself. Definitely. Now I said that it was thin... it's not thin in the sense of final gravity I guess, but because alcohol is such an excellent solvent, this beer “flows”. Just a great beer with marvelous complexity and deliciousness. Believe.

Pours jet black with a miniscule brown head leaving a good chocolate sludge of lacing.
Aroma consists of cocoa, booze, vanilla, roasted malts and toasted wood more or less in that order. The nose leads to me believe it's going to be coming in pretty hot.
Wow I am floored by the taste. Same flavors come through as in the aroma, but it is wonderfully balanced. The booze grabs you at first, but despite the nearly 19% ABV it is not overpowering. It's somehow less hot than Black Tuesday. Some good roasted malts along with vanilla and oak come through and it finishes semi-sweet with a delightful cocoa presence. The loads of cocoa in the finish help to balance out the boozy bourbon. 
Rich and luscious mouthfeel with lowish carbonation. Amazingly despite all the components it isn't overly sweet or cloying at all. 
This beer is amazingly smooth and terrifically well balanced. All the flavors work well in harmony with one another and despite the high ABV and bourbon it manages to not be too sweet which is amazing. I struggle immensely with overdone sweetness and everyone at the table including a few who don't like big boozy stouts thought it was delicious.
Bottom line: one of the best imperial stouts I've ever had. 1,316 charactersjmarsh123, Apr 05, 2012

A - More of a dark-brown than black pour with a tan head that doesn't wait long to turn into lacing....thin lacing. Seems thick, sticks well. It looks great with the exception of the color....which I suppose is more like chocolate than a deep black. Maybe that was the intention?
S - Fudge, booze and hints of vanilla. Booze is not scared at all here to show itself. Actually, it turns more into a delightful chocolate/cocoa aroma after it sits for a moment and the booze subsides. 
T - Lots of chocolate upfront that has a booziness trying to fight through. First sip is a little confusing until the vanilla and chocolate linger in the finish. On second sip, the chocolate comes out first again and then there is a nose-clearing sensation. Some vanilla and charred oak from the barrel emerge, then booze, then a heated but tasty finish of cocoa. The cocoa notes really stick around in the finish. I think the vanilla gives it more of a milk chocolate flavor. There is, however, the heat. 
M - Thick, yet on the lighter side of thick....or thicker side of medium? I like it a lot but it leaves me wondering what could be.
O - I love the aroma, I love the flavor, but it is still too hot. I'm not sure how long this needs to mellow out, but I'd say at least another 6 months. The only reason my score is so high on the flavor is because there is a lot of great stuff going on. However, the underlying heat brings the beer down overall. 1,552 charactersclaaark13, Apr 04, 2012
4.36/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52012 bomber. Highly anticipated, no doubt. 9-10 oz. poured over the course of two hours into my CBS snifter on March 31st, 2012. 
A - I felt that Black Tuesday poured just a touch too thin, and this pours even thinner. Dark-brown center coloring softly fades to lighter toffee-colored hues at the edges. This also has less carbonation than bottled BT. No lacing or retention, but I must note a shitload of alcohol legs on this one, more so than I've seen on most red wine. 
S - The Bruery's lovely oak barrel aroma blended with the freshest rich chocolate. Periphery is vanilla, baker's chocolate, bourbon, roast, raisins, and toffee. Faint alcohol traces. Really need a 4.75 here. 
T - Front-palate roasted malts, bourbon, and deep oak and wood. Mid-palate dark cocoa quickly pours into the best backened vanilla bean and chocolate blend. This isn't just an average chocolate. It's bitter, it's sweet, it's decadent in every sense of the word. As the bitterness and milk-like sweetness meld together I sense this rich note of buttery toffee that fills out the finish. Very tolerable backend heat with less warming than I would have guessed.
M - The feel is a bit heftier than the look suggested. Medium-heavy body, very velvety. Appropriate level of moderate carbonation and moderately-dry finish despite the backend sweetness in the taste.
D - Pure indulgence in liquid form. CR better serves as a dessert beer. BT seems more fitting for individual beer exploration - I think it has a bit more complexity. CR blows your mind off in flavor robustness and depth. 1,567 charactersAuracom, Apr 02, 2012

2012 vintage.
Pours a murky dark brown with a khaki head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form on the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, wood, and bourbon. Taste is of dark roasted malt, cocoa nibs, vanilla, bourbon, and wood flavors on the aftertaste. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good stout with some excellent barrel aging going on.

4.79/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 5HUGE thanks to blatantdream for gifting me one of my whales! Shared this 2010 bottle at a tasting last month, reviewed from notes. Opened alongside Black Tuesday '10 for comparison.
Looks about the same as BT, not quite as much head, but who cares? Time to subtract arbitrary beer geek points for something that in no way detracted from my enjoyment.
Massive aroma emanates from my glass upon first pouring and remained potent for hours afterwards as I savored my pour. So incredibly much going on here, but the overwhelming scent is heavily vanilla and reminds me of vanilla cake frosting. Specifically, red frosting. Caramel, booze, cocoa, some roasted malts too. But yeah, cake batter & frosting out the wazoo!
Loved this aroma so much -- I kept about 1oz in my glass for the rest of the night and took a whiff every few minutes. On par with the best aromas I've ever experienced (Morning Wood & Passionfruit Berliner from FB, Cable Car Kriek). Where are the Chocolate Rain scented candles?
Taste is decadent; layers of flavor with strong vanilla leading the charge again. Deeply roasted malts, caramel, chocolate, toffee, dark fruits, and plenty of booze. The alcohol doesn't bite at all; rather, it blends in with the other flavors exceptionally well and warms nicely as it descends too. Again: vanilla cake frosting. *Red* cake frosting.
Flavor profile was shockingly different from its base beer (Black Tuesday) -- to the extent that I never would have known they shared the same base just from tasting them both. Also, the huge, creamy body from BT'10 was somehow absent in Chocolate Rain. Needs a LOT more body to carry this much flavor. No idea how it disappeared either, but its return is needed! :)
Overall, this is one of the best beers I've ever consumed. Glad I got to share it with a great group of BAs too! Met or exceeded all of my expectations, minus the body. Cannot wait to sample it on draft this weekend at the Bruery Reserve Society event, and I'm excited about the bottles I'm getting from this year's batch! 2,039 charactersbrystmar, Mar 13, 2012

Pours with a dark foam that settles quickly with no lacing. Body is black, touch of brown at the fringes.
Smell is incredible, once I opened the bottle it filled the room. Chocolate fudge cake, vanilla, caramel, booze, banana. 
Tastes of fudge, chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and oak. Less sweet than I remember Black Tuesday 11 being, so maybe the cocoa, vanilla and some roast character helps balance this one out. A little alcohol heat present, but well masked for 18.5%. Very drinkable.
Mouthfeel is super smooth, full-bodied, with mild alcohol warmth. Sticky, viscous, and carbonation is bit too low. Not as thick as I was hoping for.
Overall, a delicious improvement from BT 11, I guess it has to do with the cocoa, vanilla, and aging. A decadent dessert beer that isn't overly sweet. Looking forward to trying my 2012 vintages. 871 charactersislandboi8204, Mar 12, 2012

The Bruery
Orange, CA
(Aged for 2+ years)
The body of the beer is near black throughout, with very dark brown edges, and a very thin dark brown head. The beer leaves thin, wispy, specks of stick to the glass.
The aroma of the rich, dark chocolates is simply divine. Roasted malt, bourbon, and a hint of coffee complement the chocolate as well, but this is a chocolate lover's dream in a glass. There's also perhaps a bit of earthy vanilla and sweet cream. The aroma is rich, decadent, and incredible. It doesn't get much better, if at all.
The flavor is rich and transformed--a much different beer than Black Tuesday. The rich, earthy, bittersweet flavors of chocolate come through first and foremost, alongside barrel/bourbon character, vanilla, and whipped cream. There's a presence of alcohol warmth but it's not at all distracting and small in accordance with the beer's ABV.
Full bodied with low to moderate carbonation. A wonderful dessert sipper. Decadent.
Incredible, though I prefer Black Tuesday. 1,027 charactersehammond1, Feb 28, 2012

4.44/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 2 - Sampled 1/6/13. Too sweet and boozy compared to Batch 1, so I have to ding this a little on taste. Both were aged about the same amount of time, hopefully batch 3 turns out a little more drier and less hot.
Batch 1 - Pours a silky, menacing, near black color with a small dark tan head. Some solid lacing on the sides of the snifter, especially after a few swirls. 
The aromas are out of this world. My first impression is liquid brownie batter; a huge mix of dark and milk chocolate/cocoa powder, equally large vanilla and caramelized sugars. As it warms you get the base beer's presence coming through with a light dosing of bourbon plus some mild roasted maltiness. Booze is extremely subtle at this point and I can only detect because this is at cellar temp (if not warmer). There's a mild coffee presence, but that is more of an undertone to sweeter chocolaty smells. 
The tastes begin almost equally as intense as the nose. The chocolate is the dominant character. Melted milk chocolate malt balls, melted dark chocolate baker's cocoa bars and vanilla extract all come to mind initially. This is diabetes in a glass. Next you get lesser amounts of light bourbon and hints of oak plus lesser notes of roast coffee. 
The mouthfeel is really thick and full bodied with, thankfully, some medium to low carbonation. Finish is velvety smooth and sweet, and yet thanks to the base beer being barrel aged, it avoids being cloying.
Overall this was stupendous and a great treat to sample. There is no feasible way I could finish this by myself or probably even with another person just because of its luscious flavor profile. Highly recommended for all beer geeks and absolutely a must try; definitely one to trade for and share with a couple beer geek buddies. 1,773 charactersclaspada, Feb 24, 2012

The smell is heavy on the bourbon, with some sweet notes of cocoa and vanilla. The taste is big sweet chocolate upfront, some notes of oak and vanilla in the middle, with big bourbon burn at the end. The vanilla became more prominent as it warmed. It's fairly thin, moderately carbonated, easy on the tongue. A nice beer. 432 charactersgory4d, Jan 31, 2012

a - Pours a very dark brown, almost black color, with one inch of very dark tan head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks pretty good.
s - Smells of chocolate, roasted malts, bourbon, vanilla, dark fruits, cocoa, cream, and toffee. Very nice nose, a wonderful mix of the bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla. Loving it.
t - Tastes of of sweet milk chocolate, roasted malts, bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet dark fruits, raisins, cocoa, cream, caramel malts, and tofee. Again, a really great mix; tons of sweet chocolate again. The chocolate and vanilla really comes through; a step up from the nose.
m - Medium body and low carbonation, very smooth and creamy. Near perfect mouthfeel; a tiny bit more carbonation and it would be perfect. Hard to believe this one is in the 18.5%-20% ABV range.
o - Overall I thought this is a fantastic beer; I think I actually like it a bit better than the normal BT as it had more sweet chocolate, especially in the taste. I love chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon in beers, and this blends all three in a great way. A top notch RIS; very glad I'll get another bottle in the Reserve Society next year. 1,262 charactersmdfb79, Jan 03, 2012

This beer is a chocolate lover's wet dream.
The beer pours a blackish brown color with good head retention and lacing. On the nose, there is just a huge aroma of chocolate that overwhelms pretty much everything else. I get some light vanilla and coffee as well, but the chocolate aroma (dark chocolate and milk chocolate) is intense, drowning out pretty much anything else. Much to my surprise, if anything the flavor profile is even more stunning, providing an absolute chocolate tour de force. This beer blows Southern Tier's Chokolat completely out of the water. This beer is rich and very sweet, though there's a hint of bitterness in the finish that buoys the sweetness just a bit. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to full, with a long, sweet, milk and dark chocolate finish. There's a bit of heat in the finish from the high level of alcohol in this beer, but I really didn't think it detracted much from the flavor profile. 
Very, very impressive.... 994 charactersJohn_M, Dec 21, 2011

Appearance: Pours a very dark brown with a mild amount of tan head that leaves a ring around the edge of the glass.
Smell: Chocolate and roasted malt with some cocoa and dark chocolate. There is a lot of really hot liquor in the finish.
Taste: Cocoa and roast hit the tongue right away. The chocolate flavors are mildly sweet, but the roast seems to dominate. There is a heat from the alcohol that shows up immediately and builds throughout the sip.
Mouthfeel: The body is on the thick side of medium with smooth carbonation and a finish that is a bit dry.
Overall: This is a good beer, but didn't quite live up to the hype for me. I would love to try it again with some age on it, but we'll have to see if that happens. 826 charactersoline73, Dec 19, 2011

After sampling BT first, I wasn't sure how much more chocolate flavor could be worked into a beer.
I couldn't have been more wrong. A beautiful black viscous pour.aroma of Chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. A bit strong on the mouth, but amazingly balanced and very smooth all things considered.
Chocolate flavor present throughout. Might have been the best beer I've tasted. 418 characterspeacehammer, Nov 22, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +8.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle poured into a Bruery tulip. Split with russwbeck and tasted side-by-side with Chocolate Rain. Epic.
A - Depending on the light, the body looks anywhere from a glossy black, similar to Black Tuesday, to a ruddy, rustic brown. It builds a bigger head than Black Tuesday initially, eclipsing a 1.5-fingers of tawny head, but settles into a similar, foamy cap as Black Tuesday. Looking at the cap, a steady stream of carbonation cuts through the foam. 
S - The initial aroma is hugely robust and bold, bursting with a sweet booziness that is almost unprecedented compared to anything I've had previously. Anise and roast are abundant as well, but it's easy to discern the vanilla beans and chocolate. The whiskey is strong as well, but even combined with the inherent alcohol aroma, it doesn't exactly come across as hot.
T - The first few seconds of the taste are offensive, abrasive, brash. But good things come to those who wait, and the roughness gives way to an amazingly smooth flavor that encompasses all that it was described as. Even with the addition of vanilla and chocolate, it somehow comes across as less diabetic sweet than Black Tuesday, and the transformation from harsh to silk is awe-inspiring. It forsakes the anise and char of Black Tuesday for a more friendly cocoa and french vanilla finish, and even though it is more sweet than your average double stout, it is many rungs lower than Black Tuesday and similar company. The back-end delivers a decent amount of whiskey, probably more-so than Black Tuesday, and make no mistake that it finishes hot, but every other flavor tries its hardest to mask it, and it doesn't even appear to approach the over 18.50% it actually is.
M - The mouthfeel is moderately heavy with nice carbonation. Definitely thick and bold, but not as syrupy or heavy as I was expecting. Really full-bodied though, and the flavors and sweetness last for a very long time afterward.
D/O - Drinkability is moderately high. As much as I was surprised at the flavors in this, the fact of the matter is that this is to epitome of a sipper. The alcohol isn't offensively hot, but it really creeps up on you (especially when you are drinking it side-by-side with Black Tuesday and drinking it during a large tasting) and the flavors are special, robust, and long-lasting enough that several sips are enough to last you a good amount of time before reaching that glass again. It certainly lives up to the hype and is one of the most unique and flavorful stout's I've ever had, but you need to split this since it is too much for one mere mortal to drink alone. 2,609 charactersnhindian, Nov 22, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Shared side by side with 2011 Black Tuesday with nhindian
A: Brown pour, amazing how less dark this is than fresh Black Tuesday. Extremely noticeable change in color. Neither have a very distinct head. What head there is is light brown and leaves no lacing or retention. BT gets the nod in terms of appearance.
S: The smell is very boozy and sweet, but also extremely complex. Booze and bourbon mix with chocolate, vanilla, and molasses to create one of the biggest smells I've ever encountered in beer. I must say I am worried about the booziness and sweetness here. Hoping the taste is balanced and not too over the top. Going to call this one a push between BT and CR.
T: All I can say is wow. I graded BT before taking a sip of CR and fully developed an opinion on it first. I must say, this is better. All around the taste simply blows me away. This has to be the best thought out beer I've ever had the privilege of tasting. The way the tastes develop on my palate simply cannot be put into words. The initial taste is boozy, offensively so, but once you become accustomed to it, the booze becomes an afterthought. As soon as the booze subsides, a TON of vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate, and dark fruits simply attack the palate. Roasted malts, warming alcohol, and dark fruits finish the beer off perfectly. The complexity and balance is unmatched in craft beer and honestly until you taste it, you could not possibly understand how a beer could encompass so much with each and every sip. A 5 if I've ever had one.
MF: Extremely similar to BT. Not quite as thick as I was expecting, but by no means is it light. It is not syrupy or creamy like other big stouts. The ABV will catch up with you before too long.
O: Overall this was the best beer I've ever had. I'm aware it might not be the highest rated beer on this site, but this was simply the cream of the crop. Blew me away. The drinkability is not terribly high, as the sweetness and extreme ABV are not easy to deal with, but this category is now considered 'Overall,' and overall it is a 5. 2,060 charactersrusswbeck, Nov 22, 2011

The elusive Chocolate Rain pours with a fairly standard appearance: near-black, with a very slight collar of deep umber froth; the only surpise is that it has relatively thinner viscosity. The nose is pure chocolate deliciousness with a surprisingly lowbrow reference: it is highly evocative of Nestle Quik powder. There is almost no booze to be found in either aroma or flavor, which is truly a feat, given the ABV. And it is quite delicious, flavor-wise, with chocolate-coffee-candy-liqueur notes akin to Black Russians or Espresso Martinis. The body is fairly light for a Stout, and in this case, it serves the brew very well. I am not sure if I prefer this to Black Tuesday, but I am sure that they are both phenomenal. 794 charactersktrillionaire, Nov 21, 2011

Pours no head. Same color as regular CR. Dark caramel brown, nearing black.
Aroma: Similar to the tap version. Very nice and warming. Tons of vanilla, oak, and bourbon. A lot of sweetness.
Taste: Way too hot and boozey. This takes a lot away from the beer. Too compared to the tap version. Not nearly as enjoyable. The other flavors are still there, but they are masked by the alcohol.
Mouthfeel: hot and then some. Light to medium bodied for the style and the abv. Lower amount of carbonation. Ends kind of clean.
Overall, not nearly the same as the tap version. I didn't like it as much. Too hot for me. Not overly complex for what it is. 782 charactersmothman, Nov 16, 2011

A- Thin bubbly brown head, dissipates to nothing, no apparent carbonation, dark black opaque color.
S- Big alcohol aroma, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, toffee, sweet, really hot in the aroma, definitely some chocolate, cocoa.
T- Wow this is a big beer, a lot of heat as it goes down, big vanilla taste, huge bourbon flavor, toffee, slight chocolate, the vanilla really takes over.
M- Big mouth feel, coasts the palate, smooth drinking, big alcohol feel, dry finish.
O- Wow huge beer, not the greatest BA stout, but very satisfying, not really balanced, really hot as it goes down, still a great experience and very grateful to Lenny for bringing this beer. 787 charactersChriscrundwell12, Oct 29, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap from a beautiful barrel @ the 2011 Black Tuesday release. This my 4th or 5th time trying Chocolate Rain and I wanted to put down a review. It never disappoints. 
Appearance: Black, brown chocolatey colored on the edges. Slight head for this beast.
Smell: Chocolate, bourbon, boozy aroma - you know your gonna get hit with the alcohol when it hits your lips.
Taste: Chocolate, some oak coming though, vanilla bean for sure... so good, so strong, so balanced... Like a roller coaster of flavors and tastes.
Mouthfeel: Big beer, full bodied, light carb, very smooth, silky, tad boozy but not over the top. 
Overall: A great beer. I probably prefer more Black Tuesday for longer drinks or bigger pours, but it's a stellar beer that must be tried! 754 charactersCenCalMario, Oct 27, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the Bruery for 2011 Black Tuesday release.
A: Pours an opaque very dark brown, no head. 
S: Like smelling a bar of dark chocolate. That's the gist of it. Also, some malt and cocoa, and a hint of vanilla and bourbon, but mostly chocolate. 
T: Like biting into a bar of chocolate. A little bourbon/heat come through at the end, but the alcohol is mostly hidden. Leaves behind a cocoa residue on the tongue, like when you make hot cocoa from scratch.
M: Full body and a little creamy, coating the mouth, but almost no carbonation.
O: The chocolate amazingly hides all the alcohol and makes this very drinkable. Really delicious, but loses points for being a little one dimensional; I wouldn't mind seeing the malt, vanilla, and bourbon in a little more balance.
I liked this better than Black Tuesday but less than S'More Tuesday. 843 characterspmarlowe, Oct 27, 2011

4.08/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served at ridglens' pre-wedding tasting, graciously shared by the main himself. Poured into hayesez's Portsmouth snifter.
A - Pours very dark, opaque brown, with half a finger of pale tan head. Retention is nice, lingers for the length of the experience. Looks a little bit lighter and thinner than I expected.
S - Chocolate bourbon. And HOT chocolate bourbon at that. Super alcohol burn in the nose, which is a little unpleasant.
T - Starts off very chocolate, with the bourbon burn more in the background. Reminds me almost of Hershey's chocolqte syrup mixed with bourbon. Finish starts super hot, then smoothes out to a fudge-like chocolate. Very unique.
M - Burning. That's the only thing I can focus on. Does have a creamy feeling to it, but too much burn. The lasting feeling does even out though. Saves it a bit.
O - Overall, a crazy experience. I like it more than I probably should, but I don't totally mind burning. Absolutely ecstatic to get to try it! 968 charactersMarkIntihar, Oct 22, 2011

Thanks again Matt (exitmusic00) for hosting.
This beer was poured into a taster glass.
A: Deep dark brown/black. The beer had minimal light transmission, lacing, and head. The pour and swirl demonstrated a thin, low viscosity beer. 
S: Chocolate brownie/hot cocoa on the nose. Subtle hints of vanilla
T: Lots of booze up front which quickly fades. Vanilla and brownie batter flavors linger after the booze is gone.
M: Mouth feel is thin with little carbonation.
O: I was excited by the hype of this beer. Unfortunately, the hype left me disappointed. The beer lacked the complexity that I would expect from this particular style. With a name like “Chocolate Rain”, I expected rich complex chocolate flavors that were simply not present in this beer. I am thankful for the opportunity to sample this beer. I would give this beer another try, but would not participate in a trade for this beer again.

Bottle to snifter.
2009 Vintage
A huge thanks to Mike (mtep13) for sharing this at our DL Variant & Other Ticks Tasting in Chicago. Stoked to finally try this whale.
L: Deep mahogany – almost burnt brown, but not quite black. Thin auburn head that disappears quickly. Does not look as thick as I expected. 
S: This smells like a fresh plate of dark chocolate/fudge brownies with a touch of vanilla. Very, very sweet smell with a hint of alcohol coming off the nose.
This is where the beer falls apart. Sad, but true (at least in this review).
T: Hot and un-balanced. From the first sip, this beer was not enjoyable. Hints of chocolate, vanilla, and a little molasses, but all of these flavors are over-powered by the booze. Totally unenjoyable.
M: Thin mouth-feel; not what I was expecting. I had hoped and thought it would be more sludgy and thick, but it’s not. More disappointment.
O: Just awful. I hate to say this, but I was really excited for this beer and it is simply overrated. Too boozy, not thick enough for the style, and a complete disaster start-to-finish. I can’t help but think this beer is overhyped after trying it. I would never trade for it going forward, but it is possible this bottle could have been off. I’m thinking not, but maybe so. I will not go out of my way to try this again in the future, but if it happens to land in front of me, I’d be willing to give it another shot. 1,431 charactersspdyfire83, Oct 11, 2011
3.02/5  rDev -31.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 32009 Vintage
A: Very dark brown, almost black, in color. Forms a thin dark tan head that quickly reduces to absolute nothingness. No lacing. 
S: Loads of chocolate and cocoa with hints of vanilla and molasses. 
T&M: The first thing you notice is how thin this beer feels in the mouth. Almost watery, but then the alcohol kicks it and it becomes thin, watery, and hot. The only flavor is chocolate. Cheap, shitty, chocolate mixed with alcohol. Lower carbonation. 
O: This beer tastes as if someone took Nesquick, mixed it with water instead of milk, then dropped in a couple of shots of vodka. There is absolutely no depth or complexity to this beer and it is oddly thin for a Imp Stout as well. Drinkable, but certainly doesn't live up to hype. 748 charactersFlorida9, Oct 11, 2011

A- Pours a dark brown with some red highlights near the thin mocha head. No lacing is left behind.
S- Uncooked dark chocolate fudge brownie batter, roasted malt, hint of dark fruits, vanilla wafers, and some sweet booze. Very nice.
T- Holy hell, this is hot. The ABV was fairly hidden in the aroma, but it attacks the taste buds with relentless force. The brownie batter is there with some black cherry roasted malt, and a bit of vanilla.
M- Medium carbonation and body. Thinner for what I was expecting from such a big beer. Finishes very boozy.
O- This was a pretty disappointing beer. Really boozy and not too complex. The aroma was the best attribute. Am I glad I got to try it? Absolutely. Would I trade my cellar for it? No. 877 charactersiadler, Oct 11, 2011
4.41/5  rDev -0.5%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Swimsum brought this over to our place as part of an epic tasting on Saturday. Thanks Brent! Following review based on notes taken at that time.
4oz. sample poured into a snifter.
Appearance: Very little head off the pour. The murky body sits calmly in my snifter, showing off brown edges and brash viscosity when held to light. White bubbles meander around the surface, but that's it in terms of head; looks flat. Surprisingly weak glass-coating as well.
Smell: Booze, chocolate creme, and vanilla are easily discernible from the get-go. As it warms, the booze component actually fades, giving way to more vanilla, and dark berries (cherry schnapps-like). Very enjoyable.
Taste: Chocolate and vanilla dominate, while cream, macadamia nut, and booze play lesser roles. Not as complex as Black Tuesday in my opinion, but likely smoother.
Mouthfeel: Warm and dry, but also heavy, creamy, and surprisingly smooth given the ABV. Very lightly carbonated. A great sipper.
Overall: Of the stouts we had on this night, this ranked third in my book behind BA Speedway and Hunaphu's. However, all three of those beers were close, and the fact that this one outweighs each of those by ~7% really says something: given the ABV, this is unbelievably tasty and drinkable. As good as Black Tuesday? I don't think so. But it's certainly close. 1,333 charactersThreeWiseMen, Sep 30, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a tulip glass from a 750ml bottle.
A - Pours a dark dark brown with some nice darkness that does note let any light through. It is less viscous and oily than expected. There is a thin 0.25 inch head that is dense but is removed quickly. The high ABV probably has something to do with that.
S - Sweet milk chocolate is intermingled with some intense molasses and caramel notes. Dark fruits are extremely present some raisins as well as strong sweet caramel. Very very sweet aroma. The Bourbon notes are very apparent. The vanilla is very noticeable as well and is complimented with some slight woody spice that vaguely offsets the sweetness. The molasses is definitely prevailing here with some nice chocolate sweetness. The roast notes are not present.
T & M - Taste starts off very sweet. Tons of vanilla up front that quickly turns into a more caramel and brown sugar sweetness. Then there is some slight alcoholic burn. This is quite a hot beer. There is some chocolate notes on the palette as well that mix in with the sweetness. Tons of Bourbon flavor can be appreciated as well all throughout the brew. There are some dark fruit notes such as raisins and there is even some slight licorice on the middle-back portion of the sip. As the beer starts to warm there is more bourbon notes to the beer. THe vanilla is also more present as well as some nice slight chocolate sweetness and some mild coffee roast. The beer is quite hot with some boozy notes from beginning to end and lingering for a while. Mouthfeel is a bit lighter than I thought it would be but still it has a heavy body.
O - I think I like BT better than CR. This is a lot more boozy than I thought it would be and the chocolate seems to have died down a bit on my bottle. This would probably be better fresh. Still a good beer. 1,813 charactersJoEBoBpr, Sep 14, 2011
3.94/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Massive thanks to Richard (Khazadum) for sharing this with all of us. There aren't enough high-fives in the world to cover that check...
Appearance -- Pours a dark chocolate hue with absolutely no head. Looks thick and menacing...I like it.
Smell -- In a word: indulgence. The glass exudes with decadent milk chocolate and vanilla bean, sweet Kentucky bourbon, roast malt, and a hint of dark fruits. it's incredibly aromatic, and considering the name, this is spot-on to what their intentions were. Good luck to any brewer thinking of trumping the nose on this.
Taste -- Again, lots of chocolate and vanilla sweetness, sweet bourbon, some roast and coffee-like character, and a modicum of dark fruit. It really doesn't live up to the aroma, but the flavors are still quite nice. The 19.?? abv is definitely apparent - as the beer is still cold the alcohol burn is not horribly perceptible, but that's all out the window after about 10 minutes of the glass held in hand.
Mouthfeel -- Medium-bodied with milder carbonation and a heaping helping of booze bite. Meh.
Overall -- Incredible aroma, but everything else about this beer falls short of Black Tuesday. The extra percent or so of ABV is so incredibly apparent. In the case of BT, letting the bottle sit a year or so will significantly diminish the booziness, as can be seen in the first batch. With the introduction of the cocoa and vanilla, these two will fade over time and I can't imagine there being a sweet spot in this beer's lifespan where there will be that incredible chocolate/vanilla flavor but with less booziness.
As it stands, I would definitely take a year-old bottle of Black Tuesday over Chocolate Rain. However, I'm curious to see what future batches of Rain will be like. 1,751 charactersyeahnatenelson, Aug 01, 2011

Appearance - So black light doesn't get through this beer, zero head.
Smell - Huge chocolate nose with bourbon and hints if vanilla 
Taste - Damn this tastes like Hershey's chocolate syrup with bourbon and a hint of vanillia, and I loved it. I like big sweet stouts and this one hits the spot. This was very hot I like beers with a alcohol bite, but this one had a big alcohol taste. 
Mouthfeel - It was very oily/slick and very little carbonation. This was the worse part of this beer for me, it seems like with some age it might lose some of the oiliness. 
Overall - I think with a year or more on it might calm down the alcohol bite, but with that said I would love to get my hands on a bottle. 804 charactersphisigben, Jul 28, 2011

A- Deep mahogany brown color with a quarter inch of light tan foam. Great lacing. 
S- Big chocolate notes backed up by roasted malt and booze. 
T- Chocolate brownie up front transitions into caramel and roasty malt flavors. There is a hefty alcohol presence, but it's not off putting. It integrates like a very well done chocolate bourbon cake. Very tasty. Finishes with lingering chocolate and bourbon notes. 
M- Feel is sticky and viscous. Lower carbonation level accentuates the interplay of decadent flavors present in the beer.
O- Incredible. Given the hefty ABV this is a masterpiece of a beer. Extremely well integrated flavors make for an exceptional chocolate/ bourbon experience. A sipper for sure, but as big, chocolate Impy stouts go, this has no equal. Highly recommended! 821 charactersSideswipe, Jul 24, 2011

It pours a dark molasses esque brown in color and poured very thick and syrupy. It smells like sweet chocolate syrup with a touch of roasted malts. It's awesome and very well integrated. It tastes of sweet yet not cloyingly sweet milky chocolate with a touch of coffee. The bitterness at the end is light and compliments the sweetness quite well. It drinkable thick and syrupy but drinks well for the size of this monster. Great beer. I almost hate when beers live up to the hype like this one does.

This looked initially opaque, but it's a little transparent at the edges. Dark copper brown color (not as dark as expected).
This smells boozy, the alcohol is definitely apparent behind the cocoa. Maybe hints of bourbon too, mostly chocolate, ethanol, and some vanilla. 
It tastes very hot, sweet and chocolaty, with massive malt character. Overwhelming might be too much of an adjective, but this is definitely a big beer and it feels like it. Sweet aftertaste of brown sugar. 
Carbonation is on the low side, still adequate though. This was a treat, and was the beer I was looking forward to most at the tasting. I'd definitely try it again any time it might be offered. 833 charactersTurdFurgison, Jun 19, 2011

Poured a hugely thick and evil looking jet black molasses looking sludge into my pint glass, hitting the bottom of the glass like a thud. Such a rich dark color, there was no chance at all of any light coming through this one at any point what so ever. A huge dark tan colored head rose up from the depths of this one reaching a height of easily three inches which never really did settle down to much, leaving a constant pillow of brown of top that at the most settled down to around an inch and a half. 
the first thing I noticed was how sweet it was, tons of sugar here in the aroma, thick chocolate like smells that really sweetened it up. Mixed in were the slightest hints of French roasted coffee and molasses, really giving this that big dark aroma that you look for in the style. as it warmed it started to let off some more bourbon notes along with a noticeable hint of vanilla that again confirmed how sweet it was.
 The first flavors I was picking up were rich chocolate and vanilla that were layered upon a coffee like base. This gave it such a rich, complex and sugary profile that I was not even sure what was going on. As it warmed subtle notes of bourbon and licorice started to come though and blended in very well, keeping it sweet, but at the same time confirming its dark nature. The finish had a surprising amount of dry bitterness to it, that really caught me off guard being how sweet this was for the entire session, 
overall this had to be the thickest, smoothest and creamiest beer I have ever had. I crave a good stout that has the consistency and feel of a chocolate shake, this almost one upped that, 1,832 charactersmikesgroove, Jun 12, 2011

A: Dark brown/black with a hint of deep red, and a small tan head that receeded quickly.
S: Bourbon scent up front, with roasty, caramel, vanilla, chocolate notes intertwined throughout. Very complex smell, indeed.
T: Strong bourbon and chocolate taste up front, but with a swirl of vanilla, caramel, and rich malty flavoring. I had this right before Black Tuesday, so this is MUCH sweeter in taste, and also you feel the boozy heat quite a bit more. The sweet, however balances the boozy heat perfectly.
M: Medium carbonation, not as thick as I had anticipated, however nothing less than what I hoped for.
O: Overall, this beer was simply incredible and lived up to it's name. Definitely felt the abv, but enjoyed every drop of it! Hope to come across another bottle of this in the future. 908 charactersLuvzsurfrz, May 31, 2011

Thin tan head dissipated fast. Left a ring of head. Super dark brown in color. 
Aroma is amazing. Sweet malty caramel, dark fruits, figs, raisins, tons of chocolate and a bit of roastyness.
Tastes just as it smells. It's a little boost but expected at 18%. Bourbon, chocolate, dark fruits and caramel. Warming down the throat.
Mouthfeel is not as malty as the above taste discripters would suggest. Smooth but a little high on the carb.
Overall a fantastic beer glad I had it and with their up in production of these beers hopefully I can get some of this next year. 664 charactersPeprSprYoFace, May 31, 2011

S: Smell is exceptional. Tons of chocolate and brown sugar. A strong vanilla extract scent as well. Booze is very detectable. 
T: Tastes like chocolate liquor. So much alcohol taste it ruined the rest of the flavors for me. I was able to gather some brown sugar, lots of bitter chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. But it mostly tastes like a vodka soaked chocolate bar.
M: Mouth feel is mostly burning and harsh. Oily consistency with almost zero carbonation.

Wim has three bottles of this very rare and overwhealming brew. After the tasting he had only two because he was sooo generous to give us all this treat.
Poured in my Westvleteren tasting glass this beer looks good but not spectacular (like most stouts).
The smell and taste of grapes and (hazel)nuts and above all milkchocolate, tons of it!
Thanks again Wim, a real treat... 565 charactersBrabander, May 20, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle into a La Chouffe tulip. Huge thanks to the generous soul who deigned to give me a taste of this at the Batch 3 Rosso release - I never thought I'd get to try this beer.
A: Not as dark as I expected, but still nice: dark brown with reddish-brown highlights and a thin ring of tan bubbles. Almost still.
S: Rich, intense chocolate and alcohol. Sweet, simple, and amazing.
T: Chocolate, coffee, caramel, toffee, sugar, and general sweetness. Less booze than promised by the aroma, surprisingly.
M: Thick and sticky. Just what I expected.
O: This beer delivered precisely what I expected it too: a massive explosion of chocolate sweetness and warming alcohol. It wasn't anything life-changing, but I thought the purpose of the chocolate made its intense sweetness more enjoyable than that of the base Black Tuesday. I would never trade my cellar for a bottle, but I'd love to try another sample of this some day. Tasty beer.
Cheers! 948 characterswoosterbill, May 19, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.575 cl bottel poured into my tasting glass @ a tasting with some awesome BA's -:)
The beer pours a dark brown to black color with no real head. There are a few dark brown bubbles. A very nice looking stout. The aroma is awesome. I get a lot of chocolate, bourbon and oak notes, as well as vanilla and maple from the barrel aging. The mix of bourbon and chocolate in the aroma works perfectly. The beer smells about like I expected it to and it is very nice.
 The flavor is more of the same and is also great. I get a lot of boozy chocolate as well as a lot of bourbon, oak, vanilla and maple. Even though the beer is pretty boozy, it is still very easy to drink. The barrel aging has done great things to the base stout, imparting several different flavors that all meld very well together. Low carbonation and thick, creamy mouthfeel. 834 charactersbeerpirates, May 16, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Tried this last Monday, thank you Eric! 
Appearance: Black, smallest wisp of tan head
Smell: Bourbon! That was the first impression, then the roast, sweetness, toffee/caramel/vanilla/chocolate, and alcohol. 
Taste: The first sip was amazing, or rather the finish, just went on forever. You definitely get the bourbon up front (boozy?), then vanilla/chocolate notes, fairly sweet, no hop flavor, very nice!
Mouthfeel: Very lightly carbonated, not overly sweet/malty, the bourbon seems to make for a thinner beer than I was expecting. Excellent mouthfeel though, very nice drinking it. 
Overall: Special beer, huge complexity and long finish even after our normal Monday 10+ beer tasting, great bourbon/vanilla/chocolate stout, and not cloying/sweet/too malty. ABV is high, and it's there in the glass, but not a hot mess for sure, I really enjoyed it. 855 characterslandhoney, May 12, 2011
3.04/5  rDev -31.4%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 2 |  overall: 2.5Bottle from our RS membership. Dark black pour, almost no carbonation and an aroma of vanilla and ethanol. Flavor is a combination of vodka, vanilla beans(picture a vanilla vodka black russian) a little bit of chocolate and finishes thin and very hot. I loved Black Tuesday(and really expected to love this one even more), but this was a bit of a let down. Out of all the beers we’ve received from our membership so far, this was the worst. 442 charactersTorgo, May 07, 2011

Pours a sugar-shimmering black with a small ring of whitish-tan head. This is obviously a big one and it looks great. The nose is big vanilla, fudgy brownie chocolate, a touch of oak and booze, maybe a hint of coffee. Really, what stands out is the vanilla and the fudge. Could probably sit and sniff this for days. The taste is outstanding - big dessert fudge, chocolate, vanilla, some present booziness, a bit of bitterness like baker's chocolate. Really decadent and quite good. Rich, but in a totally different way than Bourbon County Rare. That flavor was deeper and smoother. This is a bit rough around the edges. The mouthfeel is fantastic, big, sticky with low carbonation. Overall, this is quite the fantastic beer. There is a touch too much heat and cocoa bitterness in the taste to give that a 5, but regardless, this is a fantastic beer and totally worth the hype. 923 charactersseeswo, May 05, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A big thanks goes out to Dyan for bringing this bottle out to our recent tasting. Beer number 21 of the tasting overall, tasted side by side with Black Tuesday. The bottle opens with a hiss and some nonsensical lyrics courtesy of Tay Zonday. Dyan poured the beer as he wondered what the F they mean...
The pour is the same as Black Tuesday...thick and viscous looking. Definite pitch black and tar colored, with nearly no light getting through at all. Extremely nice boozy legs, even more so than I found with Black Tuesday. This is one sexy looking beer. Obviously, at nearly 20%, there was no lacing.
The aroma is nuts. Sniffing the mouth of the bottle, it smells like straight vanilla extract. Once poured, it opens up a little more giving a medley of sweet and dessert-like aromas. Vanilla, more natural and subdued than the extract, chocolate, light booze, oaky vanilla, and maybe a hint of coffee. The palate is similar...vanilla bean, more subdued bourbon than the base beer, again, and plenty of warm alcohol. This almost flies away as it is intensely sweet, but a light roasty flavor moves in with chocolate to bring this back to imperial stout from the edges of boozy dessert.
Silky and creamy, the high abv comes along with a surprisingly low final gravity, as this variant of Black Tuesday feels a bit thinner on the palate. Very complex, though less so than its non-chocolate laced brother, this is a phenomenal beer. 1,433 charactersNittanyBeerFan, May 03, 2011

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLWGA4FeTsI&feature=related
A: Chocolate rain opens up with a nice melody of tunes. Further, the hiss evidences nice carbonation, which is not expected for a beer of this size. Pours into the glasses a pitch black, oil, with surprisingly lively carbonation. A tad thinner than I was expecting for such a large beer.
S: When smelling the rim of the bottle, it smells identical to a sweet vanilla bean. Literally on other flavours at all besides vanilla. It was pretty awesome. However, that scent did not carry through to the actual beer. The beer itself was also very nice, with sweet vanilla, chocolate, and bourbon. The vanilla really kicks the shit out of all other scents, and it smells extremely sweet. Smells like a very, very solid dessert beer.
T: Having this side by side with Black Tuesday, this one was a tad thinner and not as complex. Definitely more of a dessert beer than an Imperial Stout. Sweet, complex vanilla blends with nice bourbon and chocolate. Super sweet all around.
M: For a beer this big, it was a tad thin. Expected a tad more viscosity, but it is still very nice.
Overall, I am glad I tried this one. A little too sweet for me (and I am a big fan of sweeter beers), and not as complex as Black Tuesday. Still, very, very solid! 1,507 characterstreyrab, Apr 24, 2011

Bomber shared with the MN crew! Thanks! Cloudy pitch black pour into a small snifter, no head, only a spare light brown ring. Smells like a bottle of vanilla extract, slight bit of chocolate coco powder coming through after the taste is in the mouth. Huge, messy and sweet smelling, cut by a nose burning alcohol. Wow, huge boozy flavor. Almost thin tasting. Flavor is booze, vanilla, and slight chocolate, messy ash. Odd carbonation level, feels like almost harsh bubbles and thin. I really like BT, but this beer does not live up to the hype at all. Just a thin, boozy mess, that burns the throat and nose. Don't buy into the hype. 751 charactersCLevar, Apr 23, 2011

Aroma is sickening vanilla extract, massively sweet, quite boozy, some chocolate. Holy shit this is hot. Lots of booze - man, this has got some massive burn, vanilla, can’t really drink much of this. Not awfully sweet on the flavor - the vanilla really thins out the mouthfeel. Retronasal is straight burn. WTF, this isn’t even enjoyable. Anyone who claims to perceive any complexity in this beer is either drinking hard alcohol daily or kidding themselves. 556 charactersMatSciGuy, Apr 23, 2011

A - Pours a syrupy black, ever-so-slight tan-colored head on the initial pour which vanishes quickly and leaves only the base beer behind.
S - Huge sweetness, tons of chocolate, vanilla, oak, alcohol. Decadent. It's pretty messy right now...lots of booze, cloying sweetness, vanilla. It needs some more time, IMO.
T - Again, pretty much a mess. Chocolate, booze, vanilla, oak. The booze is very evident, and at 18.5%, I can understand why. It's like sipping chocolate syrup spiked with booze. 
M - Full, rich and smooth, creamy finish.
O - The alcohol is a bit too much right now. I found 2009 Black Tuesday to be much the same upon release, but after a year, it really mellowed out and came into it's own. For what it is, it's not bad, just not outstanding and a little too much hype. My 3oz pour was more then enough. 999 charactersSean9689, Apr 18, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -4.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to hoppymeal (again!) for sharing this one. Served in a tasting snifter.
A - Pours with a quick-dissolving wisp of foam that settles to a partial ring, and no lace, etc. Body is black, with a glint of transparent brown at the fringes.
S - Cocoa nibs, chocolate cake, vanilla, caramel, booze, fudge, lightly roasted grains. Alcohol is present, but seems a bit lower than 18.5% - still, it's quite obviously "high-test". Sweetness is borderline cloying.
T - Alcohol is better hidden to taste. Lots of melted chocolate, fudge, cake, vanilla, and perhaps some light bourbon character as well. Less oaky than I remember Black Tuesday to be, and not much in the way of roast character either.. Some heat still creeps in, but the sweetness would become off-putting long before the alcohol.
M - Smoth, full-bodied, with mild alcohol warmth. Very sticky and viscous. Carbonation is low but sufficient. Pretty much exactly what I'd want from a beer of this style and heft.
D - I prefer the base beer to be completely honest. This is a bit too sweet and hot at this stage for me to want more than a couple ounces. I suspect it will improve over then next 12-18 months, but I long for a bit more roast to my stouts and that is definitely not happening here. Still, as a decadent dessert of a beer, this is quite good - perhaps it should be renamed Chocolate Panty Dropper, as chocolate-crazed wives and significant others will go wild for this one. 1,448 charactersMasterSki, Apr 18, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Portion of a bottle consumed at the Rosso release. Bottle wrapped hobo style. Served in a SAVOR snifter. 
Pours near black with the thinnest of tan heads. Some light legs on the sides of the snifter, especially after a few swirls. Completely opaque. The nose is quite pungent, but nothing that jumps out too much. My first impression is that I like Black Tuesday more. There's a pretty strong chocolate presence intermingled with a light dosing of bourbon plus some mild roast. Booze is fairly prevalent, but doesn't stand out too much. There's a mild coffee presence, but that is more of an undertone to sweet creamer. 
The flavor mixes the flavors pretty well, though nothing really pops all that much. From the start, I'm thinking that some age will definitely do this well. Some flavors could probably be blended a bit better. The chocolate is the dominant character. Beyond that, there's light bourbon and hints of oak plus a bit of roast and creamy, milked-up coffee. Mouthfeel is really thick and there's some residual sweetness. Along with that, there is a bit of booze in the finish. Nicely done. I look forward to revisiting this one in the future, hopefully after the flavors integrate together just a bit more. 1,224 charactersThorpe429, Apr 17, 2011

Short review because I am more concerned with drinking than reviewing.
Black pour with little head but fine for the ABV. Aroma is a tad boozy with lots of chocolate and vanilla. Taste is amazing. Waayyy more vanilla than expected. Smooth as hell considering the ABV. I wish I could be more descriptive but honestly it is hard to put into words. The body is medium/full and carbonation is a bit too high. Some alcohol burn in the finish. Overall this is definitely a top shelf imperial stout. 539 charactersalcstradamus, Apr 11, 2011

4.52/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I shared a bottle with the guys the other day, side by side with the 2010 Black Tuesday.
Like BT, this is dark brown with a dense, brown head that recedes to a ring leaving nothing but gorgeous legs. The nose has chocolate, chocolate, vanilla and more chocolate. Intensely decadent, this has brown sugar, vanilla and bourbon. Like BT, it displays an abject lack of roast or coffee aromas, this has plenty of caramel to go with the chocolate. The palate is what you'd expect - chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, brown sugar, no tannins and intensely dessert-like. It's good for what it is, sweet and boozy on the finish, a decadent treat. Full in body with medium-light carbonation, the mouthfeel is rather tremendous. Not as good as the cask version I had, but still, very, very good. 779 charactersDefenCorps, Mar 29, 2011
4.14/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Appearance: Pour is a near jet black, smallish head that quickly disappears. No real lacing but it does have some legs
Smell: Smell is decadent; probably one of the best smelling non-sour beers I have encountered. Pure fudge brownies with molasses, caramel, toffee, vanilla and oak. It is like being in a bakery or chocolate ship. 5.0
Taste: Very hot, which I suppose it to be expected at 18%. As opposed to the smell, the taste is a bit more rough and edgy. The fudge brownies, caramel, toffee, vanilla and oak are all there but the alcohol burn/edge makes it harder to enjoy and detracts.
Mouthfeel: Extremely rich and tick; you need to take half-sips, especially given the heat. Almost syrupy and a bit too sweet.
Overall/Drinkability: One of the best-smelling non-sour beers I have encountered, but the high ABV and hugeness of it really detracts. We split this five ways next to a Black Tuesday (which tasted not so good next to the chocolate rain) and we ended up having to take "break" beers (two times actually) before we could finish this one. 1,056 characterscraytonic, Mar 27, 2011

Dear lord this tastes amazing. Perfect score easily. Marshmallows, vanilla beans, rich chocolate, booze, happiness.

A - Pours black as the devils soul with a small tan film of head, dissipating down to almost nothing, leaving light wisps of lacing down the glass.
S - Holy sweet heat batman. Tons of rich chocolate sweetness, vanilla, sweet malt, and bourbon heat. The alcohol is strong but it blends in quite well with all the other strong flavors. Very nice overall balance, all things considered.
T - Lots of chocolaty sweetness up front never really fading throughout consumption. Hints of vanilla, sweet malt, and strong bourbon help round things out. Finish is a mix of sweetness and bourbon, lingering for some time. This stuff is awesome. I can't wait to see what a little bit of time in the bottle will do to it.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Thick, sticky sweet, feel with plenty of lingering sweet heat in the finish.
D - Finally a beer that lives up to its own hype. I made sure I got a pour as soon as I walked into the party and I was glad I did. I enjoyed the overall mix of sweet chocolate and warm bourbon. One of the best stouts I have ever had. Glad I have a bottle of this in my cellar. 1,210 charactersorangesol, Mar 10, 2011

A: Standard pour yields a thin mocha colored ring that fades out quickly. Beer is a viscous, oily black. Great legs but little to no lacing and no cling. The lack of a head hurts this one a bit but considering the glassware, the score is adjusted a bit. 
S: Nose is bold chocolate and vanilla with a slight hint of roasted malt in the background. Very aromatic and in-your-face booziness that covers the subtleties in this one. Still, molasses, honey, and sweet over-ripe plums are detectable. Much more enjoyable than its little brother Black Tuesday. 
T: Chocolate, honey, molasses, vanilla, and everything else dark and sweet in the world. Sweet booze hides and plays around in the background. Fudge, chocolate, and vanilla in the end with some sprinkles of roasted malt bitterness thrown in for balance. Finish is prunes and plum with a dark fruit and chocolate aftertaste. I feel like I'm eating a piece of liquified chocolate and vanilla cake and washing it down with bourbon barrels. Over-the-top decadent and delicious. 
M: Full bodied as you'll ever come across. Slick, oily, and filmy in the mouth. Heat comes forward a good amount in this one. Slight roughness going down. Sticky finish with a lingering aftertaste. Enjoyable overall but I could reall do without the big booziness if the Bruery would just turn this one down a notch or two. 
D: For anyone asking if there's a big difference between Black Tuesday and this beer, the answer is a resounding YES. More complex and even more importantly, much less boozy so I can actually enjoy the subtlety that lies within this dark mystery of a beer. I wanted to hate this one, given my feeling on Black Tuesday but in the end, I just can't. Very well done. 1,872 charactersSpeedwayJim, Feb 20, 2011

Apppearance: Pitch black with walnut edges and the very top of the glass. Extremely viscous. A tiny tan head forms and dies almost immediately, leaving no lacing.
Smell: Simply phenomenal. Smooth, deep, and nicely complex. Dark chocolate, lots and lots of vanilla beans, a little bit of coffee, oak, and a little smoke.
Taste: Lots of chocolate to start out, not surprising. Dark chocolate, lots of vanilla, and quite a bit of booze. The alcohol is noticeable but manageable. A bit of woody oak and some smoke and tobacco come through, and the finish is sweet and boozy. 
Mouthfeel: This is very full bodied and extremely thick, but I was actually picturing it thicker in my mind. A tingling sensation is felt on the tongue as a result of the very intense ABV. The carbonation adds a creamy element but is mostly submissive to the huge body.
Drinkability: This is just a phenomenal beer. The booziness creates a tingling sensation on the tongue and warms the throat and stomach, but is hidden from the taste. Chocolate Rain has a great aroma and great taste; it is up there as an ultimate sipper. 1,166 charactersKickInTheChalice, Feb 17, 2011

The beer pours a dark brown to black color with no real head. There are a few dark brown bubbles. A very nice looking stout.
The aroma is awesome. I get a lot of chocolate, bourbon and oak notes, as well as vanilla and maple from the barrel aging. The mix of bourbon and chocolate in the aroma works perfectly. The beer smells about like I expected it to and it is very nice.
The flavor is more of the same and is also great. I get a lot of boozy chocolate as well as a lot of bourbon, oak, vanilla and maple. Even though the beer is pretty boozy, it is still very easy to drink. The barrel aging has done great things to the base stout, imparting several different flavors that all meld very well together.
Low carbonation and thick, creamy mouthfeel. 
Very glad I got to try this one and hope I get to try it again. 919 charactersMora2000, Feb 13, 2011

A - Poured a deep, oily coffee brown, almost black liquid with purple hues around the bottom edges and a thin ring with a wispy island in the center that disappeared, leaving no lacing at all.
S - Wow! This is the kind of beer that you just want to sit around and bask in its aroma all night. The nose of Chocolate Rain is a gorgeous amalgamation of baker's chocolate, cocoa, vanilla extract and smooth bourbon notes. While there is a decent amount of alcohol presence, it does doesn't even come close to what I'd envision an 18.5% ABV to smell like. 
T - This tastes like licking the wooden spoon after your grandma just baked a cake! This is chocolate cake batter in liquid form with vanilla and mellow bourbon notes blended in with just a hint of wood. Plenty of chocolate and cocoa goodness throughout, followed by a nice bourbon tang in the finish accompanied by a mild earthy hop bite. The alcohol presence definitely gains strength as the liquid warmed up, but it never gets too out of control.
M - While the mouthfeel is lush, smooth and creamy, the texture is quite viscous and oily with plenty of residual stickiness. Carbonation is quite modest, as expected. While there is some alcohol heat in the backend, there isn't that huge burn I was expecting.
D - The drinkability of Chocolate Rain is just silly for a beer weighing in at 18.5% ABV! This is, simply put, amazingly delicious. I am honored to have had the chance to sample this exquisite brew. Thanks Tanger! 1,543 charactersffejherb, Feb 09, 2011
5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had some time to think this guy over for a bit(but not to long to forget our encounter), had it at the Reserve Society Initiation party pourd into a taster.
Had low expectations going into this guy because of all the hype. 
A- This is the tough part given the circumstances, very rushed pour(within the madness) into a taster, it becomes a bit tricky to rate appearance. After the pour I get away from the chaos and this guy looks great. didn't get a huge head, but it dissipates quickly to a nice brown ring around the glass. 
s- if i could give this a 6 it would be well deserved, this guy smells amazing. i must have sat there smelling this guy for several minutes, could have sat there all day. strong smell of chocolate (ofcourse), a lot of bourbon goodness, and vanilla 
t- cant describe this, its absolutle amazing. are you kidding me, the hype is real? tons of chocolate, vanilla and very low alcohol burn considering the abv.
m- perfect, exactly how i like my stouts, thick, full mouth feel. the flavor is everywhere!
d- done already! extremely drinkable, could have easily drank this all day. careful with this guy its so drinkable it will creep on you quick.
some say the alcohol taste is high in this guy, i didn't get it at all. in fact i cant believe just how drinkable this beast is.

Thought long and hard since October, the first time I had this, as to whether I could really give this kind of review after only having 4oz of it. So I drank it again at the RS party, bumping my total up to about a grand total of 10oz through roughly five different tastings.
Anyways, jeez, not pitch black, the brown chocolate current running through it, not a big head to it, its not supposed to. Why everyone thinks a beer can't have a perfect appearance unless it has massive carbonation leading to a 2" head and tons of lace clinging to the glass. . . (well actually this did cling decently). If it makes you feel better to get some visual stimulation, swirl it a little, it'll do what you want. Massive chocolate aroma, bourbon, vanilla.
Taste, I picture a crack fiend with a lighter and spoon, melting dark chocolate in the spoon and dropping it into the beer. Lots of vanilla come out with this one, everything is huge, except ironically, the alcohol. Bourbon, vanilla and chocolate pretty much bigger than an any other example I can think of. Wood tannin meld, very under the radar. Viscosity is not through the roof, just right. Such a warming feel to the alcohol, soaked up with the chocolate. Had many beers 1/3 the abv that come across with more heat and less enjoyable because of it.
I would guess there might be multiple sources of high end chocolate going into a high end beer here (cocoa, dark chocolate, white chocolate etc. . . ). Can't think of any beer that is bottled that rivals it. Really, I've come to the conclusion that the greatest beers in the world are just all the different varieties of Pliny and Black Tuesday. 1,660 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jan 16, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review #500!!! Had at the Bruery Reserve Society Party. Served from tap into a Bruery sampler imperial pint. Poured pitch black with a slight brown hue with a half finger tan head that subside to a minimal amount quickly (I blame the ABV). Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass (which was surprising). The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, chocolate, and vanilla. The flavor was of sweet malt, dark chocolate, milk chocolate, vanilla, and alcohol. It had a heavy feel on the palate with mild carbonation. Overall impression: Good God this thing is good! It was truly excellent in all aspects. I can honestly see why so many people have been looking for the bottles that were released now. Glad I have one for myself. It hides the massive alcohol present in this one really really well. Kind of scary if I'm honest. This is an absolute must try, whether it be going to the RS Event or pulling out all of your trading ammo to land a bottle. It is TOTALLY worth it. But it is a sipper, so be warned. 1,003 charactersthagr81us, Jan 12, 2011
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the Bruery Reserve Initiation party 2011. Pours a dark black/brown non see through color with a slight dark tan head that collars around the glass. HUGE aromas wafting out of this one with notes of dark chocolate, vanilla, cream, barrel, and a slight warming booze aroma. The first sip yields a nice medium/heavy mouthfeel. The flavors are well blended but the chocolate is very noticeable and pleasant. Other flavors include vanilla, roast, and booze. For being 18.5% this beer drinks very well albeit still a sipper. Probably would be best as a dessert beer. This one was great! 590 characterskbutler1, Jan 11, 2011

A - Pours a deep espresso, almost black, but with a slight brown hue. Very small lacing, virtually no head.
S - Vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate. But ot only just chocolate, you gets hints of milk chocolate, semi-sweet chocolate, dark chocolate. One of the most complex beers I have ever smelled.
T - Sticky sweetness, with vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, maple syrup, toffee, and some caramel. 
M - I don't like to give 5s normally, but man, the mouthfeel is creamy, complex, and very very smooth. This is what sets apart both Black Tuesday and Chocolate Rain from all the other big RIS.
D - Slight burn, but for the amount of octane this beer has, the burn is every so slight. Dangerously drinkable. 761 charactersteamizm, Jan 11, 2011

So sweet, mostly chocolate followed by hot, abrasive, candy-coated alcohol reminiscent of bourbon. Some maple in there too. Lots of dessert.
Wow. This is quite an extraordinary beer, hugely decadent and dense with chocolate, cherries, caramelized sugar and straight up bourbon. Unique and well balanced for the 20%. This beer is dangerous.
Can you taste carbonation at this level of ABV? I want to say lightly carbonated, full bodied, and surprisingly non-cloyingly sweet.
Chocolate Rain is not just a novelty, it really is an exceptional example of an upcoming style. 630 charactersptykozoon, Jan 10, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured a very dark brown with maroon brown highlights when held up to the light that had a half finger of brown head and left some good frothy lacing sticking to the glass. Very nice bourbon vanilla and chocolate aromas pop out on the nose with cocoa, caramel, and toffee notes but with some booziness as well. The taste was also very chocolatey like the name says with bourbon, vanilla, and cocoa accents roasty character but did have a touch of caramel toffee plus there was definitely lots of booze but it didn't overpower the overall flavor. The brew was medium in body with a nice amount of carbonation which had a roasty, chocolatey, bourbon, sweet, creamy, and chewy finish. Definitely an amazing tasting black Tuesday hybrid that will knock everyone socks off. I'm glad I got to try it and was a sipper faux show. 821 charactersGobzilla, Jan 10, 2011

on tap at RS party
App- Its a very dark brown and very dense, it might have been a small pour was a thing of beauty.
Smell- A nice smell here. I haven't had the BT as it's in my cellar and at 18% its too much for me alone. This was perfect. Nice chocolate and other smells of vanilla, and a small bit of alcohol and some roated scents.
Taste- This was amazing. I can see what all the hype was about. I wanted to take all 10 tickets and drink this all day. Pass out wake up and do it all over again. It's a big beer even in a small glass but very glad I had the chance to try it. Had a multitude of flavors that played very well together.
Mouth- A very heavy pour even in a small glass. Very low carbed but very smooth. Its high ABV is present but doesnt overpower you like you think it would.
Drink- I wanted it all day long. It's potent, viscous and big. Very tasty and very pleasant. Patrick and the team knocked it out of the park with this one. 972 charactersFosterJM, Jan 09, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +9.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Chocolate Rain... A beer whose unavailability will be the bane of my existence until they choose to bottle that lovely dark liquid.
It is sexy.
Dark and mysterious. It pours thick and almost syrupy looking. Imagine the way a Dark Lord or similar big stout looks, the way it coats the glass, except that it is flat (cask).
Cacao nibs, fudge, roast, oak, alcohol sharpness, bourbon, sweet brown sugar, chocolate, dark chocolate, chocolate... mmm this beer smells good.
Obviously, you can taste the base beer of black tuesday a bit. you get the roast, the bourbon, etc... but the chocolate is really special in this beer, and it takes the front seat.
Magical, amazing. Like the best 60-75% gourmet dark chocolate that you have ever had. the flavor evolves from roasty bitter chocolate to sweet fudgy chocolate and leaves a lingering ruby port type warming finish. It is amazing how many different types of chocolate flavors are going on here.
There is a bit of an alcoholic burn on the back end, but it is not unwelcome enough to hurt the score too terribly. The lingering finish is really quite spectacular. It actually feels like I just swallowed a teaspoon of fudge.
If 'Drinkability' refers to the way Anheuser Bush markets Bud Light, then this is not drinkable. But, by my definition, since I would gladly sip on this for hours, I consider it mighty drinkable (moreso in fact, than several beers that are half the ABV).
I have gone back for repeated tasters of this every time it has been available for me to taste. They shouldn't mess with this recipe (i.e. Cherry Chocolate Rain). Patrick, please just make more of this and sell me cases of it. 1,656 charactersthe1DarkLord, Nov 22, 2010

T: Dark roasty chocolate malty sweetness. Divinely amazing. 
M: Thick but not uncomfortable. Light carbonation leads to smooth viscosity. Aftertaste is fantastic.
D: Heaviness and high ABV make this one to be shared. This would be an excellent nightcap. I enjoyed this more than Black Tuesday and wish it were bottled. 502 charactersMooch273, Nov 09, 2010
5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours a dark, dark brown, almost black. Virtually no head, just a giant slick of oil. The smell is chocolaty sweetness. The taste is the familiar Black Tuesday, intensely flavorful and sweet but the chocolate adds another level of complexity without really adding to the sweetness of an already very sweet beer. The chocolate is very evident but not overwhelmingly so and is a wonderful compliment to this beer. 411 charactersaknight, Nov 06, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I have been meaning to review this but have been busy.
Appearance - Poured into a Bruery tulip at the Black Tuesday release party from a cask. Not completely black in color, though extremely dark brown. Just a hint of head and every so slight lacing.
Smell - I remember smelling someone who had this while I was enjoying Black Tuesday. The nose on this was incredible and I felt smelled much better than Black Tuesday. Obviously they smell similar, however this had heavy vanilla, cocoa, semi-sweet chocolate, and maple syrup (along with the bourbon notes more noticeable in Black Tuesday). It smelled so damn good.
Taste - Flavor is less boozy up front than Black Tuesday (which I already considered not to be overly boozy for how high an abv). The chocolate flavors really do take over, though. Incredibly sweet, yet bitter due to the cocoa and bitter chocolate. Vanilla is present the time and helps meld the bourbon and cocoa/chocolate flavors together. Sweet caramel and molasses are interspersed with the chocolate. Overall just a damn enjoyable beer.
Mouthfeel - Full bodied, low carbonation, massive viscosity, finishes a hint dry.
Drinkability - For such a high abv beer (the highest I've ever had) it is "easy" to drink. I had no problems putting my pour down in a relatively short time (okay, perhaps there was a bit of a fire lit under me to try the other beers in the remaining hour I had). Nonetheless, worth the hype. Damn good. 1,448 charactersSpdKilz, Nov 03, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I still can't believe that this was just there, at the Bruery, waiting for me to try it. This beer was as good, perhaps slightly better on every other Thursday than Black Tuesday. Think Black Tuesday plus chocolate.
Beer is served on cask into a Bruery tulip. Beer is brown / black with a diffuse head of small and big bubbles that doesn't leave lacing on the glass. Carbonation is low. Looks OK.
Beer smells like bourbon and chocolate, it smells amazing. Its sweet, molasses, chocolate, liquor, some alcohol, its so amazingly complex, I could have smelled it all night.
Beer has this creamy mouthfeel from the cask, its sweet and has some minimal bitterness on the back from the chocolate. The forward flavors are like a hershey bar dipped in bourbon, its great, its not cloying or overpowering its just really solid. The finish is nice and not too dry, a little dryer than the regular Black Tuesday but overall its a great beer. I would definitely have it again, only if they would bottle this. 999 charactersdrabmuh, Oct 31, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On cask at The Bruery's Black Tuesday Release Party, Session 1.
A: Dark dark brown, no light exits, little to no head.
S: Dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses, booze, bourbon.
T: Far more complex than the Cherry version. Dark chocolate, roast, cocoa, molasses, bourbon burn. The alcohol comes through a lot more than the Cherry, but it's very welcomed. The sweetness is very nicely balanced with the booze
M: Nice light carbonation and viscous, but the carbonation makes it very pleasing. Silky, smooth and coats the palate very well.
D: Enjoyable drink in small amounts, especially on a cold night. I wish I could have a few bottles of this and let it sit for a bit, opening it every winter and seeing how it changes. 720 charactersantioch, Oct 29, 2010

A - Murky dark brown with a small thinly formed head, basically a ring around the glass. Little lacing.
S- Huge cocoa, bitter chocolate, vanilla, maple syrup-like notes. Bourbon and pleasant boozy alcohol. 
F/M - Again, bitter chocolate, cocoa, roast, vanilla, bourbon. Very nice alcohol warmth and sligh alcoholic bitterness helps this beer finish very smoothly. Sweet, rich, full bodied, oily and slick. Moderately low carbonation. Lingering chocolate flavor.
D- This is such a delicious beer but its so rich and at 18+% it is one heady beer. I could drink a lot of this though. Oh so good. 629 charactersdomtronzero, Oct 29, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Cask.
Pours...well...not totally black even. Dark brown and slightly translucent when it's in small amounts.
The aroma is really heavenly. There's a lot of Black Tuesday in there, which is my favorite smell. Bourbon is big, and chocolate rains down - or up - at your nose like Tay Zonday's legendary lyrics attacking your eardrums. A little anise and molasses rounds it out.
The flavor is excellent. A bit of a boozy, bourbony sledgehammer crammed up your cramhole, but there's a lot of awesomeness going on. First of all, delicious Black Tuesday is big. I feel like there's maybe even more bourbon here. Plus -bal and rich milk and dark chocolate, molasses, roast, and sweet caramel.
Thick and intense on the palate, with low carbonation and a fair amount of booziness.
Overall, this is awesome, and I'm not just saying that because I enjoy sucking down rare DONGs so much. Drinkable for the amount you should be drinking. 928 charactersnickd717, Oct 28, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4On cask at Black Tuesday. Chocolate Rain rests a near lifeless opaque brown in my glass, only a few wispy bubbles floating on top show signs of carbonation. It smells like chocolate cake and booze-soaked vanilla beans - the complexity of Black Tuesday's aroma has largely been stripped away and replaced by layers of chocolate, bourbon and vanilla. The palate is equally decadent, and offers a touch more complexity in the form of subtle oak and roast buried beneath the rich dark chocolate and vanilla. This ended up being every bit as enjoyable as I was expecting, hopefully more of it is made next year. 606 characterslargadeer, Oct 28, 2010

A: Pours a dark brown with a mild cask head. Some lace, very nice colour.
S: Lots of chocolate, bourbon, the cacao really comes out and differentiates it from BT. A soothing but complex smell.
T: Direct bitter cacao nib flavours. Sweet residual sugar throughout with a hint of acidity in the finish.
M: Full-bodied, but thins out a bit with the acidity towards the end. A big beer though for sure.
D: A very nice stout. I was a bit underwhelmed as I missed it last year and have been waiting for this moment. Not as good as regular Black Tuesday for me, but in the whole scheme of things it is well made in its style. 672 charactersHalcyondays, Oct 27, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a thick, viscous deep deep mahogany towards black into a Bruery tulip. A quick swirl reveals outstanding legs... and since this is closer to a liqueur than it is a beer, that's alright.
The aroma is where this truly shines... huge chocolate notes with a bit of plum, fruity with bursting esters and hint of background alcohol (distinctly bourbon) and a hint of roast coffee. Deep and complex.
This drinks like a chocolate liqueur with a bit more complexity (and dryness, although as beer goes this is very sweet). Full flavored is an understatement, although the roastiness takes a back seat, playing more as a milk chocolate and sherry combination. The vanilla really is barely present, really working well instead to compliment the barrel aged flavors and chocolate. That said, this sits sweet and heavy on the tongue, and despite its viscosity is a bit thin on the back palate. Even a volume and a half or so of carbonation would do wonders... or, conversely, a bit more alcohol. Utopias manages to pull off the flatness by having a bit more heat which this masks beautifully, but leaves this a bit cloying.
Delicious to sip, but I wouldn't want more than the 4oz I consumed on any given evening. A bit blended with Black Tuesday produced a spectacular brew... returning some carbonation and just a touch more roast balanced the sweetness and deepened the mouthfeel to produce something truly sublime. 1,413 characterserrantnight, Nov 02, 2009

4.88/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5It looked marvelous sitting there in it's glass being all pitch black. I tried to look through it to the ceiling but failed. I was like, "Aw, hellz yeah." Some people trip on beers having a head, but I've never been caught up upon that.
It smelled alright I guess.... It smelled a lot like bourbon, which is something I do not like. HOWEVER, compared to normal Black Tuesday I was impressed, and could smell it without thinking, "Science damn this smells like bourbon." I could actually smell other delicious scents instead of being overwhelmed with bourbany odors. I imagine it was as delicious as other people thought Black Tuesday smelled - very.
Once it hit my tongue I nearly creamed myself. I was like, "Hey, I thought y'alls said this had 19.5 ABV?!?" I immediately thought my chain had been thoroughly jerked.... or had it?
So much flavor it's pretty hard to explain. It was a taste explosion of awesomeness. It was a very wee bit chocolatey, but enough to make me notice it. I'm pretty sure the oakey vanilla had some say in there as to why it was so good. I'm at a loss of words to accurately describe what I want to. That's how I feel about Choco-Rain - words cannot precisely explain the flavor so I will not even try very hard. Instead I suggest you try this on your own. I highly recommend it.
The mouthfeel was great. I now know what Zapp Brannigan of Futurama was talking about with his love of velour.
I was also quite impressed by the drinkablity. I sincerely expected it to be something I could only sip on every minute or two. I thought the overwhelming flavors would blow my mind so hard that I couldn't come back to reality for minutes at a time. Quite the contrary, as I wanted to gulp it down and claim the "chugability" of Bud Light. 
All in all, this was grand. I would have given it all fives, but I just do not like bourbon. If you love bourbon I expect you'd rate this flawless. I would have given the taste portion six if I could have. 1,970 charactersButtWizzard, Oct 31, 2009
4.84/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5On cask at The Bruery on Black Tuesday. Four ounces gravity poured into my tulip glass... multiple times.
Black beer with no head. Viscous in appearance, coating the sides of the glass as I swirl it. Not exactly Triple Bock or milkshake level thickness, but nice looking. Cannot fault the lack of head, as Chocolate Rain is pushing boundaries here--it is not intended nor expected to be carbonated.
The nose contains copious fumes of oaky bourbon, sherry, maraschino cherries, vanilla, and loads of sweet malts, chocolate included. Personally the chocolate was not something I could put my finger on, but I am sure it added to the overall sweet, decadently rich character of this creation. The vanilla addition was quite evident. The taste of Chocolate Rain echoes the bouquet, but the variety of sweet malts and vanilla overpower the bourbon and barrel qualities of the base beer. The end result is a syrupy dessert beer with a lot more vanilla and dark fruit. 
The deliciousness of the beer is unquestionable to me, but the balance of the original BT gets lost a bit. A beer of this magnitude is usually either incredibly boozy or balanced with things such as malt sweetness, bourbon, or espresso. What Black Tuesday did so well was deliver the oak, bourbon, and malt qualities all at the same time to create a beer where everything is married together in near perfection. The addition of vanilla bean and cocoa nibs (not to mention the factor of lack of carbonation) amps up the sweetness to overpower the oak/bourbon. If you dig syrup, this might be your preferred brew. The feel is thick and despite being still was quite refreshing and very easy to drink. I finished my first pour of this before I even knew what had happened. The alcohol is just about nonexistent in this, which is absolutely preposterous. I had to go straight back for another pour. Then another... then... let's not get too much into details. 1,921 charactersvacax, Oct 31, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +9.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Apperearance: black w/ no head
Smell: bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, brown sugar, more vanilla and even more choclate.
Taste: chocolate, port, bourbon, vanilla, oakiness, brown sugar, caramel, and a malty finish. Complex, balanced, drinkable.
Mouth: Very thick and flavorful all the way down. Not much alcohol taste or burn at all amazingly. Can't believe that this beer is this strong and you can't tell. Would have like a little carbonation as it is almost like a port then a beer.
Overall: It's the 2nd best IS I've ever had, with Black Tuesday being the best. I'm shocked by the abv and it is way more drinkable than any other beer or wine of this strength I've had.

4.89/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I stumbled toward the entrance of The Bruery with bleary eyes and a grim countenance from the wanton ash billowing off the post apocalyptic 57 freeway. It had been a good hour since Overlord's pre preline Black Tuesday SUV tasting and the craft beer tremors were beginning to set in. "I'm thirsty, is all," I told myself, "I just need a few ounces of craft beer to tide me over. A few ounces will do the job." I knew that was only a half lie as I thought it. The only thing that could quench my perishing thirst was one specific beer, a pull from the cask of eternal life. 
When I transcended the vestibule I walked briskly to the bar and forced a pained smile. I managed to choke out, "One refreshing glass of craft brew, please" before the woman noticed my involuntary convulsions. I knew what she'd say. She'd say exactly what they all say. 
"Alcoholism is an inaccurate term," I responded preemptively. "It's just that I've got a tremendous thirst on all of a sudden, and I could use a draught of your delicious Chocolate Rain." At that moment I realized my face and freshly tailored shirt were covered in Barrel Aged Partridge in a Pear Tree from the tasting. I was just a bit too eager to drink that craft beer, it's not indicative of any sort of problem. She had noticed it too. "Look, I've had a bit of a rough journey here. As you can see, I slipped and fell in what is obviously mud just outside the façade and I could really use a glass of craft beer right now." 
She hesitated briefly and then poured the elixir into a snifter and set it on the counter before me. I placed a solitary red ticket next to the glass to complete the exchange, and she picked it up with a look of indignation. I gave her another pained smile-half leer as I picked up my glass and said," Well, thank you for your hospitality, I'll be withdrawing to..." I was plagued by another involuntary convulsion and before I could finish my sentence, the glass had managed to find its way out of my hand and onto the floor. "You haven't properly dried your glassware," I cried, red-faced, "How is a craft beer connoisseur to enjoy a refreshing beverage if it slips out of his hand at the slightest turn?"
At that point a full on craft brew frenzy had taken hold of me. Nothing could stand between me and my craft brew as I grabbed one of the nearest champagne bottles that happened to be filled with Barrel Aged Autumn Maple and ripped the cap off with my teeth. I signaled, wild eyed, for a fresh glass, but was only met with a look of horror from the woman. "It doesn't matter," I cried "I've already reviewed this particular beer! I needn't adhere to my normal stringent reviewing standards in this instance!" I fell to my knees upon shards of broken glass and a pool of Chocolate Rain and proceeded to dump craft beer into my mouth faster than I could imbibe it. The mud (Barrel Aged Partridge) on my French cuffs was now joined by Barrel Aged Autumn Maple and my tears of joy. I greedily drained the entire bottle in a matter of minutes and the tremors finally subsided. "You see what I've been driven to? I only wanted a crisp glass of refreshing beer! What could possibly be the harm in that?!" At this point a small crowd had begun to gather around the ghastly scene. "Stop looking at me like I'm some sort of alcoholic! We're all of a like mind here. I'm just so terribly thirsty" I wailed, rising from my blood soaked knees. "Please, someone administer a dram of Chocolate Rain and hand me my notepad." 
12 ounces consumed on 10/27/2009 in a snifter juxtaposed alongside Black Tuesday. The beer pours dead black and deader still, lost to some indifferent sun. A miniscule dark brown head pleads for clemency as it retreats into nothingness and night, into a blackness without depth or dimension. A swirl of the glass reveals the same legs I witness on Black Tuesday. It's a nice looking beer, grim and terrible in its ebony viscosity. Though, without carbonation it cannot fully reach the beauty of Black Tuesday.
The nose is brown sugar, dark cherries, grapes, plums, black licorice, anise, cocoa and bourbon. Strong vanilla notes radiate from the beer like light from a sun. The beer is sweet, with prominent dark chocolate and brown sugar. 
The beer has lost balance and become more of a desert beer, but I can't argue with the final product. Alcohol is well hidden. I notice oak, barrel tannins, toffee, plums, dark cherries, and grapes. The sweetness reminds me of brown sugar. Blackstrap molasses is well integrated, and I again detect subtle black licorice notes. The finish is a satisfying recapitulation of all the aforementioned flavors with lingering notes of bourbon, vanilla, and dark chocolate. Full bodied with a silky, sticky, and viscous mouthfeel. The carbonation is low but fitting. This beer is decadent and delicious. 4,833 charactersHopHead84, Oct 29, 2009
5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I shared this divine 4 oz cask pour inside a Bruery tulip glass with fellow advocate and Bruery loyalist tedbyrnes at the Black Tuesday release.
Appearance - Rather nubilous and subtle in appearance without even a modicum of a head being represented. Truly, this was a display of velvet in a glass.
Smell - An insistent companionship of milk chocolate and syrupy vanilla accompanied by the tenacity of bourbon. A second whiff might suggest you order a luscious cut of your favorite chocolate cake to chaperon such a gratifying experience.
Taste - Nothing like I have ever experienced and incomparable to any beer out there. There are distinctive types of identities in the taste that I can't put into words, rendering me ineffectual to pinpoint specifics. I could assert, however, that this is what a Vanilla Bean Chocolate wine would taste like (if such a thing exists, or were to). This is just so unique and something one must personally experience to comprehend what I am getting at here.
Mouthfeel - Like wine, compensated with drops of syrup to refine the finish. The absence of carbonation was clearly not a factor in the mouthfeel.
Drinkability - I could moderately sip on 8-12 ounces of Chocolate Rain all night, as this beer should elevate it's qualities at higher temperatures. The 19.5% ABV is nearly indiscernible, respectively, thus permitting the drinkability at a whole new level. 1,401 charactersazagthoth, Oct 29, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 54oz pour into a Bruery tulip on tap at the Bruery for the Black Tuesday release.
A - Pours an opaque black with dark brown highlights around the edges when held to a light. No head at all. Pours very thick and syrupy, totally coats the glass wherever it touches.
S - Lots of milk chocolate, sweet vanilla, coconut and bourbon. Very sweet aromas, smells very smooth. Not much of an alcohol smell to this one...hard to tell its almost 20%
T - Taste largely mirrors the aromas. Creamy, milky chocolate dominates. Vanilla presence is quite prominant too and blends well with the chocolate creating a very smooth and creamy flavor. Hints of bourbon too. Again, not much alcohol presence detected, surprisingly.
M - Thick and syrupy. Absolutely still, no carbonation. This beer completely coats the mouth in flavor. Amazingly low perception of alcohol in this - this really goes down easily. Couldn't believe how smooth this is.
D - For a 19.5% beer, this is incredibly drinkable, dangerously so...very low presence of alcohol in the flavor (the other beers on tap had way more alcohol presence - Autumn Maple, for one). Should be a slow sipper, but tastes so good, it is hard to drink this slow. This makes a perfect desert beer all by itself. 1,243 charactersportia99, Oct 29, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this at the Black Tuesday release at the Bruery.
A - Pours with zero head. Looks like melted fudge, with the viscosity of a thick, jet black motor oil. There is no carbonation or bubbles.
S - A little bit like heaven. Milk chocolaty goodness dominates with very subtle hints of vanilla. Bourbon and caramelized and/or brown sugar is mixed in for a very balanced aroma.
T - What you smell is what you get. Chocolate hit my palate immediately, with the bourbon coming on next, followed by the hints of vanilla, roasted malts, more bourbon. There was a lasting finish on the chocolate that just lingered and stayed there for a while. For being an 18-19% beer, there is no "bite" from the alcohol. So f'n smooth... And at one point, it did weaken my knees as I was standing there sipping it.
M - Thick, and a little chewy with absolutely no carbonation and a very creamy texture. I know it's barrel aged, and it's out of a cask, but something is lost, to me, with no bubbles.
D - One sip can last a few minutes with all of the lingering notes in there. I don't think it's as drinkable as it's counterpart, Black Tuesday. I wouldn't want to have more than 8-10 oz of this at a time. It's a perfect dessert beer that'll cap your night off with a big smile. But I think it also loses something with 0 carbonation. 1,315 charactersKaiser81, Oct 29, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4It might have been the almost 4 hours in line that made this beer so good, but it deserves my (and others') praise anyway. Oh, and this beer deserves bonus points for the name.
A: Chocolate Rain is a devilish jet black elixir which comes from a cask perched atop the Bruery bar. It has no carbonation or head, nor does it need one.
S: Hotdamn! Now, this baby has a nose on it. I nearly experienced a failure of the nasal cavity from all the bourbon, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, brown sugar, roasted malt, and alcohol in this beer.
T: This picks up right where the nose leaves off. Absolutely facemelting flavors of vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, and roasted malt. A bit of booze comes though, but what else would you really expect?
M: As previously mentioned, the beer was served still--cask style. I think a bit of carbonation could have helped here, but I still found it to be very, very enjoyable. It did allow for a certain sensual experience that we don't often get the pleasure of enjoying.
D: As I mentioned in the taste portion of the review, the alcohol component is quite prevalent on the palate, and nobody should be surprised by this at nearly 20% ABV. But, it does detract from the drinkability, despite the awesome flavors and aromas. An amazing concoction. 1,274 characterswomencantsail, Oct 28, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Wow. Wow wow wow.
All I can say after every sip was simply "wow."
This beer was incredible. Changed my whole perspective on what is possible with a beer. Overlord said it well when paired with ice cream, you'd make millions. Seriously, this is a beer of epic proportions, and one I'd trade two Black Tuesdays to have one bottle of this.
Appearance: Brown-black and flat as can be. I know it's cask and that's how it's supposed to be, but still thick and creamy as can be. No head whatsoever, but of little concern here.
Smell: Sweet Jesus. Bourbon, vanilla, milk chocolate, almost cookie-like sweetness on the back end, and just the slightest soy sauce, but not in a bad way. Probably from the bourbon. The senses have you brace for some huge bourbon notes, that's for sure.
Taste: Like a slap to the face and the only thing I can think of to compare it to is what it was like the first time I had a sour. My senses were so fooled. Bourbon is so, so mellow and accents the flavor perfectly, not too dominant in the least. Heavy vanilla and chocolate hit 1-2 punches like a dream. Finishes sweet and creamy, and all I can muster is a "wow."
Mouthfeel: The best beer I've ever had as far as creamy texture goes. Almost syrupy it's so silky. Oh my God I get shivers just thinking about how much I loved this beer. Carbonation might change this beer just a tad in both the good and bad direction, but it's of little matter here. Like drinking a liquid dream.
Drinkability: I have never had a beer like this. Never. A thing of beauty, a work of art, and a beast through and through. Would I want 22oz of it? Yes, yes I would. Just maybe not all at once. But at almost 20%, 22oz is like 11oz of Vodka. 
Bravo. What a beer. My heart breaks a little every time I've thought of the fact that I may never have this beer again. Makes me want to buy cocoa nibs and vanilla beans and try and make my own out of my Black Tuesday. It's THAT good. 1,939 charactersnomomentwasted, Oct 28, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4First beer enjoyed at the Black Tuesday release. A welcome treat after that long wait.
Enjoyed in a Bruery snifter provided as part of the tasting. Poured from the cask on the bar. Opaque black without any sort of head or lacing. The smell is flat out incredible: vanilla, bourbon, and chocolate. Taste is mainly sweet vanilla up front, with a bourbon chocolate finish. Mouthfeel is full bodied, but super sweet and heavy due to the fact that this beer is totally flat from the cask. Too much to drink in any volume and despite the fact that it was the first beer of the night it was very hard to finish.
Amazing, but a brutal monster of a beer that really needs some carbonation. Fortunately, regular Black Tuesday is carbonated and much better because of it. 762 characterssrroos, Oct 28, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +12.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5so I like the dumb ass that I am show up at 4:25 to get in line for black tuesday... 3 hours and 200 places in line later I get into the bruery make a sprint to the bar and enjoy an 8 oz pour of this magic. 
pours darker than anything I have ever had. pitch black wouldn't do this justice. zero carbonation. sticks to the sides of the glass like a needy girlfriend leaving thick sheets of residue that are darker than most imperial stouts
smell makes me want to cry. the smell alone was worth at least half the time spent in that god awful cluster fuck of a line. I am hit instantly with rich milk chocolate, notes of toffee and vanilla dance around with the rich smell of bourbon. I am left in awe. 
taste is literally to die for. everything that is present in the smell comes out in spades in the taste. a lot more toffee evident in the taste than from the smell. huge amounts of chocolate. this beer tastes like if bourbon county stout and southern tier choklat had a baby. and then that beer went to an ivy league beer school and graduated valedictorian of its class...
mouth is smooth and creamy. rich and viscous. thick and satisfying. this beer is 19.5? It drinks like its an 8. truly an abv ninja hiding out in the bottle waiting to attack your blood stream. 
hands down one of the BEST beers I have ever had the chance to drink. I read a while back that someone compared vanilla bean dark lord to "gods cum" well if thats the case then this is what god was drinking for a few weeks before releasing the vbdl. well worth the hype. in fact I dont believe this beer is getting enough hype. GREAT JOB BRUERY CREW! 1,623 charactersMauerhan, Oct 28, 2009
4.82/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5After waiting in line for about 4 hours with my good buddy Kris...I was able to enjoy an 8 oz. pour of this much anticipated beer. 
A: Black and thick...really couldn't get any bolder in both categories. The only disappointment was the lack of head and lacing, which was probably due to the cask serving, but I'll give this beer the benefit of the doubt.
S: Incredibly robust dark and milk chocolate upfront followed by assortment flavors including vanilla bean (similar to that you find in Dreyer's Vanilla Bean ice cream), some dark fruits, and tons of brown sugar. Extremely complex and robust...and would say improves the aroma of the original BT.
T: Immediate brown and white sugar sweetness upfront that I'm not sure is incredible or too much followed by hints of chocolate, molasses, wood, and dark fruit. I would put this in my top 5 in terms of flavor and a definite enhancement on the original BT. Would probably give this a 5.5 if I could! The only knock is the strong alcohol finish and aspartame (not sure if that is spelled right...Victor please correct me) flavor afterwards. 
M: Full body with basically no carbonation. Again, I attribute this to the cask...and in my opinion, was served too cold for this style.
D: Overall, I like the aroma and flavor immensely...but I found myself having trouble finishing my glass. Mixed emotions about this brew, but still epic in my opinion.
Overall: I think I prefer regular BT over this, but this is a close second. A must try. Cheers! 1,498 charactersOlieIPA, Oct 28, 2009
4.87/5  rDev +9.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Enjoyed at the Black Tuesday release day. Glad I got there early, as the line looked ridiculous. Had 8 oz. of this.
Pours a black sludge. Looks like some form of motor oil. No head, insanely viscous. Sits there lurking with no motion, like a turbid bog.
Smells. In. sane. Huge bourbon-y vanilla (like, three different types of vanilla), sweet milk chocolate, and supple brown sugared malt assault your nose. Wow. Epic.
Taste is a liquid dessert. Blend this with ice cream, you'd make millions. Dappled vanilla, brown sugar, tons tons tons of sweet milk chocolate, a hint of roasted malt, and a layered bourbon overtone with a hint of roasted chocolate malt melts on your tongue. Amazing flavor.
Just like Black Tuesday, insanely drinkable for the ABV. Now, it's not getting as high of a score from me, as I like to be consistent in my preference for beers with some level of carbonation. While the thick mouthfeel is pleasant enough, I must admit that the pancake flat cask effect could have been enlivened by some bubbles. 1,027 charactersOverlord, Oct 28, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Ha! FIRST! Beat you Overlord and HopHead84 to the review. What happened to no lineups before 4:30pm? I got there just before 4:25, and I was already in spot 130+. I waited in line for 3 hours outside to the Bruery, but it was worth it for this.
Had about 6oz of this at the first annual Black Tuesday release in Placentia, CA into my Bruery Snifter on 10/27/09. Black Tuesday on cask with Vanilla Beans & Cocoa Nibs.
A- Pitch black used motor oil with little to no head.
S - The Bourbon vanilla and chocolate hit you right away. It's got an amazing nose. Very apparent. Hints of molasses.
T - Similar to nose. Vanilla, and super rich chocolate, bourbon, molasses, raisins, sherry. Every flavor REALLY comes out though. It really hits you. You don't have to search for the chocolate or the vanilla. It's there up front and in your face. But so is the bourbon. But nothing is overpowering, not even the bourbon. Very balanced.
M - Clean and smooth. But really viscous, velvety, silky and creamy all at the same time. This is probably the BEST mouthfeel on any beer I've ever had, and it had little to no carbonation. The creamy/velvetyness was insane. I drank a Black Tuesday after this one, and I could still taste the chocolate on my tongue.
D - Scary scary drinkable. The ABV of this one really isn't apparent. It's for sure a sipper, not something you'd want to quaff. The lack of head or carbonation really didn't detract too much from the beer. Which is weird. It's more like a fine smooth liqueur. You'd really want to sit down and enjoy this one slowly, because it is SO good. Not because it's hot, but the flavors are so powerful and beautiful. I've had a lot of chocolate/coffee/vanilla/bourbon/etc/stouts, but this one takes the cake and makes the rest of them seam like PBR.
I preferred this over Black Tuesday. I heard some people say the opposite though. Black Tuesday was really really good, but this was even better for me. The chocolate and vanilla and on cask really took BT to a new heights. Wish they would bottle CR! I found myself struggling to actually order black tuesday over chocolate rain. But I did it anyway, and then got some more chocolate rain taste from a friend. 2,201 charactersmikedashg, Oct 28, 2009
