Smell:  Funk, oak and raspberry jam combine to deliver a perfume-like aroma
Taste:  The sweetness of the raspberry fruit hits the tip of the tongue, with the tart aspect following quickly; the lacto aspect builds through the middle and then the funk takes over the finish; very dry and oaky in the aftertaste
Mouthfeel:  Light to medium body with moderate carbonation; somewhat puckery
Overall:  An incredible experience and one of the best sours I have encountered

Pours translucent dark magenta. An effervescent pink head blooms and quickly disappears completely and leaves no lace. The smell is of sweet vinegar and ripe red raspberry. The taste follows, starting off tart and sour and finishing with raspberry jam. Crisp texture with bubbly carbonation. A world class sour. 332 charactersFurlinator, Nov 24, 2016

4.52/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5An intense presence of tart jammy raspberry and bright cherries immediately captivate the nose. Some lambic-like lemon zest follow, with faint barnyard hints of hay, horseblanket, and sweaty leather. The lingering scent is actually more reminiscent of cherries (kriek) than a raspberry (framboise) at first, but once you give it some time and heat, some raspberry seed and the lacto notes take center stage.
If you had blindfolded me and told me this was an aged kriek or a fresh framboise I probably would have believed it -- the taste is deceptively Belgian for an "American Wild" ale. Decadent bright jammy fruit from the nose is matched beautifully on the palate, this time with the whole fruit, seeds and everything; the Texas Hill funk is expressed in the form of earth, pepper, oak, and some light hay. The sourness isn't off the charts but enough to make the lips pucker; I'd heard of stories that this was a "sour" or "lacto" bomb, but I can confirm that those stories are false.
Nice juicy and bubbly mouthfeel with a medium-light body; the carbonation is slightly more vibrant than the Belgian counterparts that I've been comparing to, but not at all unpleasant or unenjoyable in anyway. 1,200 charactersamano_h, Oct 17, 2016

A: Dark garnet hue with quick dissipating head; a millimeter-thin ring of head clings to the edge of my Teku glass.
S: Lacto, raspberry Jolly Ranchers, little bit of barnyard wheat; sugary jam; some merlot notes plucking through. 
T: Major tang from the brettas and lactos; rich jammy and tart finish with the raspberries. The jam notes come out more with warmth. 
M: Fairly medium in body, which is a bit of a surprise. The acidity finishes quickly, but the kick is there at the beginning. You can almost taste the raspberry seeds after you've swallowed. 
O: This is easily the best sour I've enjoyed yet. This is masterful in its balance with one of my favorite fruits. 701 charactersRanz, Aug 26, 2016

Nice color, hues of pink and purple in there.  Very thin ring of head on it, less than 1/5".  Aroma was wheat, sour bacteria.  
Taste and mouthfeel were gritty, raspberries didn't jump out at me.   Very acidic.  I immediately once tasting was wondering what the big deal is, I can think of all kinds of raspberry beers that were easily superior to this.  Top it off with a sulphuric existence, I really wasn't getting it.   I guess they don't make too many of these, maybe that has something to do with the ratings as a whole. 584 charactersrodbeermunch, Aug 22, 2016
4.62/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bright to dark ruby reds, with a creamy, bright pink clingy finger head that manages to retain a thin ring throughout.
Huge, bright raspberry, seeds and all, burst on the nose, with a little red wine, and an herbal tartness. Faint oak and vanilla are accompanied by a light, milky cheese element as it warms. When given more time with this beer, I began to notice a nutty, toasted sesame seed aroma.
Taste is tart, lightly acetic, bright raspberry. It seems really acidic, but is just overflowing with so much unbelievably fresh raspberry. With a hint of gin on the tongue, this is electric.
Finish is semi-dry, accompanied by a tingly twang at the back of the cheeks. This is a tart sour that does not burn at all (except for maybe afterwards in regards to acid-reflux). With all that raspberry, that's pretty impressive.

4.71/5  rDev +3.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Drank a Batch 1 and a Batch 5, side-by-side. Pretty clear the age had a distinct effect of the beer, although the preference for the Batch among our group varied on personal preference. 
Both were just absolutely bursting in raspberry, with a medium tartness and that classic JK aftertaste. I feel you can always taste a little of the "terroir" in their beers. 
The primary difference between the two, was the Batch 1 had become much more jammy. More viscous with that slightly thicker mouthfeel and a toned down acidity. The acidity in Batch 5 was much more pronounced, where you really feel that tang on your tongue as it washes over your pallet. The beer also felt a little "brighter" in terms of the raspberry flavor. 
Both were among the best raspberry wild ales I have had the pleasure of drinking, although my preference would be for the batch 1. 856 charactersBferber, Aug 15, 2016

S: berries are very present here, with a lactic twang and a small musky funk. Deep and rich smell.
T: berries are at the forefront, but there is plum and pear here as well. There is a sharp sour, as well as a bit of funk on the finish. This thing is extremely complex, but coherently so.
F: almost a little too puckeringly sour. Could have used some creaminess as a counterbalance.
O: this is one of the best sours I've ever had. I'll probably never get to try Atrial again, and there's a fair chance you'll never get to try it again either. 583 charactersNizzleEGizzle, Aug 08, 2016

The brew looks absolutely fantastic, a cool, vibrant read, with very little head.  The nose is delightfully delicate berries followed by the very faint skunkiness of the base beer.   Taste is very balanced, lots of raspberry upfront followed by a tart finish, however not overly sour.   This was incredibly delicious and can't wait to taste more ! 518 charactersAlby, Jul 28, 2016

L:  crimson with pink collar, murky; no head but it had been poured and given time to settle ... I saw an actual pour and it pushes up a thick head of light pink foam, about 2 fingers on just the 8 oz.; it's not clear and the way the colors work, it's a work of art
S:  so Jester King funky with loads of musty barn aroma yet also incredibly sweet ... candied cherries at first, then settles into a sweet/sour mix of raspberry and lemon
T:  super lemon sour punch to the face but not a lot of JK's signature musty barn/old dead hop flavor, and with each sip, the fruit takes another step in ... first super tart cherries, the strawberry sour candy then fresh raspberries but always mixing with the more sour lemon base flavor; the fruit dances well with the sour flavor, and the fruit also seems to be masking some of JK's funkier flavors; occasional grain aftertaste and always a sour aftertaste
F:  light and crisp but somehow with some ale softness and weight ... what a mix!  it's perfect, a true summer sour ale feel.
O:  Atrial Rubicite lives up to its reputation and you can understand the craze over it, yet the simplicity almost leaves you wondering "why the craze over it?"  When your palate adjusts and your halfway into the glass, it's sour and sweet, some lemon and some raspberry.  But the journey there is complex.  Jester King's dusty, musty barn aroma on the first whiff signs off that it's a JK brew while the level of fruit flavor masks a lot of that in the taste.  The the nose gets real sweet, mixes nicely with the tarter flavor, and you wish you could drink it all summer.
It was worth the trouble, which included sitting in line for 2 1/2 hours in the Texas heat.  I'll do it again in 2017 if I get the chance. 1,782 charactersPremo88, Jul 25, 2016

Taste is much the same, just awesome raspberry flavor. I do kind of wish there was a little more going on, but hard to complain too much with such incredible raspberry character.
Dry and easy drinking

Smell – The nose was most reflective of fresh strawberries. 
Taste – The raspberry is fresher than any fruit that I have tasted in a beer. The raspberry is both seedy and tart. It has a very pleasant level of tart that continues into the after. 
Mouthfeel –Despite the sugar, the beer is not sticky or syrupy. It runs surprisingly smooth. 
Overall – This is a new level of fruit beer as the fruit is fresh with few attributes of actual beer. 554 charactersJohnnyHopps, Sep 22, 2015

It's a plum, magenta, deep maroon color. Pink head dissipates quickly. The carb is a soothing effervescence. The raspberry jam aroma is intoxicating. The taste, however, is not overwhelmingly jammy. There is a light jammy-ness but the beer is mostly dry and tart with the jammy-ness playing a subtle role. I love that. It is definitely a tongue puckerer. If I were to be picky, the mouth might be a little thin, but overall, this is one of the best raspberry sours I've ever had. 523 charactersSheppard, Aug 30, 2015

4.44/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I finally got the opportunity to enjoy this revered beer thanks to the extreme generosity of fellow BA F2brewers. I thought the box I sent over was pretty good, then Kevin destroyed my porch--this was an extra! Anyway, this bottle was from Batch 2 and was poured into a classic Duvel chalice.
Appearance (4.5) - Pours a ridiculous saturated dark magenta hue. Dark enough that it's almost purple and obscures my ability to see through the glass even though the liquid seems to have reasonably good clarity--not much in the way of haze aside from the chill. Brighter, almost fuchsia highlights around the edge of the glass where the light penetrates a bit more. Atop the body is a finger of light pink foam that retains for a little while before fading away to nothing but a thin ringlet of bubbles around the edge of the glass. Lacing is all but nonexistent--just a smattering of dots here and there.
Smell (4.25) - The aroma is fruity and full of raspberry character, but I must admit there isn't much else going on. I expected more character from the oak, but there isn't really any of the mustiness or funk that I love in this style of beer. On the plus side, that makes for a very clean, if one-note aroma. I'll say this--it smells like I've stuck my nose into a box of fresh raspberries, so take my criticism with a grain of salt.
Taste (4.5) - Similar to the aroma, there is very little presence from the oak, but also like the aroma, that really allows the character of the fruit to stand out and be the centerpiece of this beer. It also manages to capture this character without employing the sweetness that is a natural part of fruit, remaining dry and tart. Speaking of the tartness--that is the one other area in which the taste of this beer stands apart from the aroma. There is a healthy puckering sourness on the tongue where I didn't pick up much in the nose.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - Light bodied and moderate carbonation with a feel that is definitely impacted by the acidity of the souring bacteria, providing a nice jolt of puckering sensation, but not overpowering. Dry finish.
Overall (4.5), a fantastic showcase of the fruit that ends up being a very refreshing and succulent beverage. My personal preference is to want more of that complexity from the oak barrels--tannins, musty, wet hay, etc--but I can hardly fault this beer for being what it is: delicious. 2,380 charactersLambicPentameter, Aug 25, 2015

LOOK: Pours with a finger of pink foam that just unfortunately shrivels down into a thin line. Has a gorgeous dark fuchsia color. There is a very minimal amount of rising bubbles. 4.25
SMELL: Strong aromas of sour yeast meet stronger aromas of raspberries. What others are calling "barnyard funk", I'm saying are mild aromas similar to alfalfa hay. A hint of earthy yeast is also detected. 4.75
TASTE: The initial taste is an exquisite combination of very strong raspberries and sour yeast. Mild alfalfa hay flavors along with hints of earthy yeast enter immediately after as initial flavors persist. Usually, the taste experience would of ended by now, but not today! As all flavors begin to push on well into the aftertaste, the alfalfa flavors grow from mild to strong. 5
FEEL: Medium-bodied with a subtle carbonation. The sourness playfully agitates the tongue. Finishes with an amazing thirst quenching juiciness. 4.5
NOTE: It may not be the highest rated beer that I have consumed (due to the not-so-spectacular appearance), but this is the best tasting.
OVERALL RATING: 4.85
______________________
Blend 5 - June 2015 Aged 6 months. Consumed on 25Jan16.
LOOK: Pours with a fingers worth of light fuchsia colored foam that halves itself into a white foam head after 45 seconds. Dark fuchsia in color with a moderate amount of cloudiness. Rising bubbles are small in size in size and moderate in quantity. Lacing is thin and moderate. 4.5
SMELL: Very strong aromas of equally sweet and tart raspberries and strong sour green apple acidity entangle with mild aromas of hay, tobacco, and earthy yeast. Subtle aromas of oak can also be detected. 4.75
TASTE: Very strong sweet and tart raspberry flavors elegantly combine with mild flavors of sour green apples. Strong hay and tobacco flavors enter immediately after as raspberry flavors grow stronger. Mild oak and earthy yeast flavors finish off this most impressive of taste symphonies as all previous flavors push on. 5
FEEL: Medium-bodied and moderately carbonated. Goes down somewhat smooth while also clinging to the back of the throat like syrup. Finishes extremely crisp. 4.25

4.64/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours a deep, yet brilliant, pink to ruby in color with a small, fizzy head. The head is pink in color and is gone quickly, leaving little to no lacing in the  glass. The body is a touch hazy and the color makes it looks like a light red wine in the glass.
S- Huge, juicy, and slightly tart raspberries hit the nose right off the bat when this beer is opened. The raspberries are fairly sweet and jammy at first before turning just a touch to the more tart side. Underneath the fruit there is a touch of detectable sour base beer that is a little oaky and a little dry.
T- Just like the scent, the big raspberries notes smack the taste buds first and dominate the beginning of the drink. Juicy and ripe raspberries wash over the tongue and provide a solid, sweet, and fruity profile before letting both some fruit and base beer tartness kick in. After the fruit, the drier base beer adds a touch of bitterness to the flavor along with a bit of oak flavor. Lingering flavor is a combo platter of raspberries and light, dry base beer.
M- When this beer hits the tongue there is a sting of high carbonation. Other than the effervescent nature of the beer, it is very easy to drink and light on the palate.
Overall, this is a really well done fruited sour. The raspberries are really displayed prominently without taking anything away from the base beer. If you are a big fan of big sours, this might not be for you, but if you are a fan of fruit on display in a delicate and balanced sour, this is for you. 1,510 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jul 31, 2015

It pours a beautiful, pink-red color with a mostly white head of foam.
Aroma is a blast of fresh raspberries that swirl out of the glass and into your nose the entire time the beer is in your hand. Slight detection of acetic acid.
The flavor is a tart, very acidic cascade of raspberries that lingers for some time. Again, a bit of a vinegary acetic acid is hiding in the backseat. 
Mouthfeel is juicy and bubbly with a slight mouthwatering/puckering sensation on the finish. Like other reviewers have pointed out, this beer held up wonderfully as it got warmer (which it did, because Austin was 95 degrees when they were releasing this) 704 charactersThirstyMiner, Jul 29, 2015

Overall a very nice version of this beer but not the full blown sour of previous batches, Maybe this will change in the bottle
Update. 1 year old bottle of batch 5 is all raspberries with very little tartness. We did drink other sours along side, and this is really just a raspberry fruit bomb. Absolutely delicious, but well below expectations
Batch 6 re-update. Incredible. So jammy and perfect sourness. Great funk on the nose. simply stunning 560 charactersTommo, Jul 26, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Blend 5. Slight crack of the bottle cap, not even fully cracked, and strong raspberry jam aroma escapes instantly. Pours mauve/bright blood red, hyper fizzy carbonation sizzles for about 30 seconds. 
Taste is massive ripe and sour raspberries that linger for about a full minute after each sip, with ever so slight oak. Doesn't benefit my health but it definitely benefits my taste buds. 388 charactersmig100, Jul 26, 2015

Nice sweet and funky aroma.  Raspberries are very evident.  Sweet raspberry flavor with a nice funky tart edge at the end.  Medium bodied with very little carbonation.  This is my first taste of this beer, and it came with batch 5.  While I was expecting heaven in a bottle, it was an enjoyable beer.  Bought two bottles and cannot wait to crack one open. 451 charactersjngrizzaffi, Jul 26, 2015
5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my absolute favorite fruited sour beer in the world. I just drank the new batch 5 fresh and it knocked my socks off. I drank 6 of these on tap and it even managed to maintain the flavor after if warmed, which is not typical for this style. There is so much complexity and balance with this beer and the hype is 100% justified. 334 charactersBeerSamurai34, Jul 26, 2015

Sweet raspberry taste lingers with a bit of grass that then turns into a long wave of tartness ending with a pucker. Mouth is a bit juicy up front with a nice carb that ends very dry.  This beer is deserving of its lofty reputation, delicious. 358 charactersOneEye78, Jul 25, 2015

4.38/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Batch 4. Thanks Aaron!
A: clear, brilliant ruby body under a thin head of fine pink foam that settles into a persistent ring. Lovely color. 
S: Intense raspberry is all there is, complete with juice, seed, stem, leaf and all. Sweet, tart, herbaceous, and enticing. Great. 
T: Follows the nose, with deliciously complex fruitiness dominating. The finish is solidly sour, and fades into distant grassy bitterness. Excellent, but a bit astringent and watery on the tail end. 
M: Fairly light bodied with moderate, soft carbonation. Solid. 
O: Excellent sour; if the flavor carried through to the finish, it would be spectacular. 
Cheers! 640 characterswoosterbill, Jun 27, 2015

Pours a beautiful reddish-pink color with one inch of white-pink head and moderate carbonation evident. Tons of sour and funky raspberries, tart dark fruits, jam, oak, tannins, spice, earthy notes, light barnyard funk. Light body and low to moderate carbonation.
Overall I thought this was really, really good. It is lightly tart but not a vinegar bomb, and very fruity. Has some Belgian-style funk to it too which is really cool in an American beer. Very great, would love to have it again. 542 charactersmdfb79, Mar 16, 2015

Nice red color, hazy, with a fizzy white head that held good and dotted the glass with lace. Musty aroma, lots of raspberry, sweet and sour. Great raspberry profile in the taste, tart and crisp, slight jammy sweetness, and a good dose of wet oak. Crisp mouthfeel, medium body, very nice overall. 362 charactersRifugium, Mar 15, 2015

4.48/5  rDev -1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I find it really difficult to rate this, as I have had batch 1, batch 2, and batch 4 (twice), and each time it has been dramatically different. Batch 1 was raspberry perfection; it tasted like the mild bitterness of the seeds was somehow liquified and fermented. Batch 2 was much more like a puckering tartness, while batch 4 was almost too sweet and juicy when fresh the first time, then a bit more funky the second time.
The deep, ruby color looks epic in the glass, and you could sniff this in a glass for 10 minutes before even tasting it, it's that good. When in its prime, this is so awesome it's hard not to guzzle it. Each individual sip has so much flavor that lasts in your mouth, though, that you can really stretch out a glass over a long time. 756 charactersyankeepride, Feb 10, 2015

A: Pours a beautiful violet cranberry juice color with a thin pink head that faded to a thin collar.
S: Extreme juicy raspberry dominates the nose. I'm not getting a lot of funk, or much of anything else really, just but tons of raspberry purée. 
T/M: Tastes very similar to many other American raspberry that sours I've had. Flavors are not as jammy or full as the nose let on. There's a clean raspberry taste with a great puckering tartness. The finish is drying, but overall this beer is super sweet and sugary, but not synthetic. There's a mild earthiness but the beer is not funky. Lighter body, effervescent carbonation. 
O: Good, but not as good as many other similar tasting raspberry sours. To be honest I was a bit disappointed. The taste just wasn't as juicy or full as the nose suggested. I'm splitting hairs though, this was still a very enjoyable beer that I'd gladly drink again. 922 charactersscottfrie, Jan 22, 2015

Looks and smells the part...raspberry puree, lightly tannic and jammy on the nose.
Fruit is very front heavy...seedy raspberry..but quickly moves in a fairly acetic and very tannic middle that serves to abruptly and quickly dry the fruits from the tongue. What starts as fresh fruit centric is quickly erased and the barrel is very drying leaving a sour oaky finish with lingering berry.
Maybe I'm in the minority, but I'd like more sweet fruit and sour yang here and I preferred the nose to the taste. A fun beer, an appreciative opportunity...thanks Bill!..but not a great beer. 592 charactersBarrytheBear, Jan 17, 2015

Review #975
Gorgeous appearance. The nearly clear, deep ruby red body was topped by a one-finger tall, fizzy, light pink head that dissolved almost immediately. After a few sips, a thin ring of froth circled the liquid and lasted until the beer was finished.
The aroma was amazing. Freshly pureed raspberries came through strong right off the bat. Jammy with a subtle sweetness. Tart and funky notes followed. Somewhat musty. A crisp, dry, yeastiness was also noticeable. The musty, funky, barnyard-like qualities intensified as the beer warmed.
Raspberries appeared in the flavor profile but were quickly overtaken by tart, lemony notes. Super crisp and dry. Vinegar-y. A touch wheaty. Almost lambic-like in its intensity. Band-Aid notes appeared in the center. Somewhat musty on the back end. Dry, tannic and oaky on the finish, with lingering notes of bitter lemon rind. Really crisp, tart and refreshing.
The beer was light, fluffy and highly effervescent. Champagne-like. The liquid felt prickly on the palate. 
Atrial Rubicite did a great job at melding a tart, musty and funky wild ale base with bright raspberry notes. I can understand why this beer receives such amazing scores. Personally, however, I found the raspberry to be understated in the flavor profile. Also, I think that this beer could have benefitted from a bit more residual sweetness. 1,473 charactersDamian, Jan 13, 2015

4.39/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to bilco for sharing the bottle.
Appearance: Straight dark pink. Almost clear. Small pink collar is bubbly. No head or lacing. Just super pink with deep reds. 
Smell: Boom raspberries. Macerated raspberry flesh with some seriously juicy aromas. A touch of citric tartness with hints of lemon zest and juice. So much jammy raspberry. Layers of oak with the slightly damp Jester King funk. Earthy and damp. A bit of a floral and citrus edge. Tart raspberry flesh. Jammy and sweet with a very mild malt base. A good bit of oak. Sweet and tart are surprisingly balanced. Just all the raspberry.
Taste: Tart obliterated raspberry. Flesh, skin, and juice. A mildly tannic edge with a solid lactic and citric tartness. Very mild malt body adds some very mild bready element. Oak and bright funk. Some musty, mildly, earthy elements with a tart cherry edge. The jammy nose is present on the sip but gives way to a sharp citric edge. Warming pushes some of the raspberry down and let's the Jester King funk play up a bit more. I imagine when this is fresh it's just a raspberry explosion.
Mouthfeel: Low end of medium body. Moderateish carbonation. A slightly dry finish.
Overall: Key ingredient in Ambrosia.
it's got all the things that are good. Raspberry, Jester King funk, and balance. It's just spot on and hits on "sour" more than pie. 1,350 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Jan 09, 2015

A: After a bit of an intial gush, the beer pours a beautiful dark red/purple/plum color with a foamy dark pink head that sticks around but leaves no lacing. Fairly cloudy; really looks like raspberry pure.
S: My whole kitchen smells like fresh, sweet, raspberry puree. Very juicy aroma, subtle tartness present, no real traces of any funk.
T: Much more dry than the aroma would lead you to believe. Great depth of fruitiness - pressed raspberries, subtle tartness, grape skin, crushed raspberry seeds, hints of earth/spice. Tartness works very well with the complex raspberry flavor and there is SOME sweetness, but overall very dry.
M: Very crisp, highly carbonated (slightly higher than I pefer), bounces off the tongue, fluffy mouth feel.
O: Outstandingly refreshing and great complexity of fruit flavor mingled with subtle tartness. This is an easily crushable raspberry bomb without the cloying sweetness. 972 charactersDan_Inreallife, Jan 03, 2015

4.88/5  rDev +7.5%This will be quick. I'm at Sour Sunday at the Holy Grale in the Ville KY.
Pours dark ruby red. Fine bubble reddish rim. The nose is sour raspberry, sour yeast, funk, and wine soaked oak. The taste starts off tart, lots of cherries raspberry blackberry, sour funk, and a pleasant metallic finish. High carbonation, very smooth, and light body.
This is a very well crafted sour. Big tart and big cherry/raspberry.  I can see the reason for the hype. 449 charactersmacher0, Nov 23, 2014

Big thanks to Daemose for this bottle! Reviewed from notes. Poured from 16.9 oz. bottle into a Peg's snifter.
A: Pours a very deep crimson, quite hazy. Forms a thin off-white head with fairly low visible carbonation.
S: Funk, tart raspberries with jammy character. Sour and barnyard intermingle with dry oak tannins.
T: Juicy, jammy raspberries. Tart and sour and acidic. Oak dryness with the sour causes some tingly sensation, and has an understated barnyard funk. As it warms, flavors of underripe blackberries develop. All of the big bright flavors fade to a tart acidic dryness with residual yeastiness quite quickly - a bit of a strange sensation.
M: Nice full mouthfeel. Average carbonation sensation and alcohol content is well-integrated.
O: The raspberry flavors are so real, I caught myself having the check-for-raspberry-seeds-in-the-teeth sensation. But all of the rich flavors present here just disappear right at or just after the swallow - very odd, and not sure why. But this is good…very good. Perhaps not the complexity to the funk profile that Cantillon, etc. has. But more than enjoyable. Very glad I had the chance to try it. 1,176 charactersmacrosmatic, Nov 14, 2014

Wish I got more reviews in to truly archive all the madness, but whatcha gonna do?
This had a great maroon body with a pink head, retention was great. The scent was awesome, the taste somehow lived up, pretty amazing raspberry flavors here. Tastes like fresh stemmy berries and puckering sour raspberry candy with a good dose of barnyard funk. Not too much for oak. Solid well-carbonated body.
The stickler in me wishes there was a bit more in the way of musty earthy funk complexities as this does come off as little one-dimensional, another part of me doesn't care because it's probably the best raspberry profile I've had in a sour. Really great all around. 817 charactersChico1985, Sep 30, 2014

A- 500ml poured into four glasses for a bottle share. Bright ruby red body with a pink head up to about half a finger eventually receding to a small foamy ring. Head retention is decent.
S- Reminds me a lot of Rose de Gambrinus in the aroma, enough to note that here. Juicy fresh raspberries and barnyard, musty funkiness. A bit of wood to provide a backdrop.
T- The smell has a blast of raspberry but here they shine even more somehow. Fresh, fresh whole ripe raspberry feel, flesh seeds and all. More backing notes like lactic acid, musty funk, slight barnyard, lemon juice sourness and something reminds me of stone fruits and white grapes.
MF- Light end bodied with a texture between fizzy and foamy with a cushion of some frothiness. Carbonation at the high side with a medium sourness finishing it all off.
A raspberry bomb that reminds me of any great Belgian Framboise and specifically of Rose de Gambrinus in the aroma. Biting assault of fresh raspberries on the taste buds with a complex, rounded out lambic bug mix. 1,161 characterscbutova, Sep 28, 2014

Cheers to Bilco for sharing this
A: Deep, rich garnet red - borderline absurd, unbelievable color, pretty much the most red thing I've ever seen - no head, no carbonation, but the color is so rich that I couldn't care less
S: Raspberry madness - more raspberry aroma than actual raspberries, it's like fresh raspberry concentrate - fleshy, with some serious berry - nice tart edge, with some sourness - minimal sweetness
T: Raspberries, raspberries everywhere - lightly fermented raspberry juice, raspberry puree - light level of tart, sour - the emphasis here is really the fruit - the potent raspberry is so intense that it almost overpowers all malt, all yeast - like eating a bag of raspberries, minus the sugar - beautifully dry
M: Medium body, super smooth, virtually no carbonation, a lovely sipper
O: Holy raspballs!
So. Much. Raspberry. This is one of the best uses of raspberry ever, up there with New Glarus Raspberry Tart. 972 charactersangrybabboon, Sep 22, 2014

This beer is gorgeous.  A dark ruby body with a nice pink head.  I certainly don't select beers based on their looks... but you gotta give credit where credit is due... and this beer looks like Christina Ricci in black snake moan.  Raspberries dominate the aroma.  A slight sour kick up front in the taste but then the tartness from the raspberries takes over.  A little bit oakey, acidic, with a touch of fruity sweetness.  It's def a sipper but I think that's the point of most wild ales.  You could tell it was unfiltered and unpasturized as there was lots of remnants left at the bottom of the bottle.  I loved every sip of this beer and am very thankful I got to try it. 710 charactersDNICE555, Sep 19, 2014

4/5  rDev -11.9%A barrel aged beauty of mature sour beer that had several hundred pounds of raspberries added it. It pours a dark ruby color with a little head that disappears quickly. The aroma of raspberry hits you immediately. The taste is initially sour but the tartness of the raspberry quickly overtakes that. It finishes slightly oaky and lightly acidic. It’s almost like a Berliner Weisse w/ raspberry syrup dropped in already. I'm generally not a sour beer fan at all but this brew is good. The vibrant and fruity flavor offsets the sourness very nicely. 550 charactersjoeyfeets, Sep 12, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -0.9%B1 poured into a tulip glass.  Beer pours a dark reddish purple, slight haze with thin white head.  Not much head retention despite some decent carbonation.  
Nose is very raspberry forward, fresh sweet and tart berries similar to sticking your head into a basket of ripe fruit.  A bit of lactic acidity and old oak as well.  
Sharp acidity upfront, heavy lactic acid, lemon juice and sour raspberry.  A touch of sweet fruit, earthy funk and mineral flavors.  Acidity really dominates the palette though, drying out the tongue with lingering lemony lactic flavors.
Light body and effervescent, tons of soft tiny bubbles aiding in drying out the tongue and keeping it clean. 680 charactersnataku00, Aug 29, 2014

Thanks for Mike for this one
App- Well color me pink. I didnt think this would be such a wonderful color. The pinks and reds and purples intermixed into a liquid raspberry (in no other words to say it) jam color. A small pinkish white head with only about 1/2" in of thickness was there and then gone. Didnt leave any stick or cling.
Smell- I liked the nose. A bit sweet and cloying but that was expected. A nice aroma of sour, oak and raspberry filled the nostrils. A bit of sugars permeated as well and wofted up. As it warmed it became a little thicker and more sweet vs. pure oak.
Taste- This was pretty good. I enjoyed the raspberry flavor intermixed with a solid oak and barrel flavor. Almost like a jam flavor but suprisingly light. The flavors melded well and created a lush flavor. A very good after dinner beer.
Mouth- Light bodied with a light and fizzy carbonation level. Delicate and flavorful.
Drink- Glad I traded for it. 1,003 charactersFosterJM, Aug 25, 2014

Unbelievable color of pinkish reddish beauty.  Thin pink head.  The smell is amazing.  Just amazing raspberry, oak, and funk.  Taste is perfect, with acidy raspberry jammy goodness.

Big raspberry aroma - including seeds - along with black tea and touches of vinegar and old wood. Deep, complex, and captivating.
Tastes absolutely delicious. Great balance between fresh juicy fruit, spicy and ever so slightly bitter seed, leaf, and barrel flavors, and a good dose of sourness. Quite complex and full-flavored, and at the same time light, refreshing and highly drinkable. Long finish, spicy berry seeds and old barrel.

A-The color is a perfect brilliant red with a thin layer of foam on top. Just a beautiful color!
S- Smells exactly as you would expect. Sour raspberries.
T- If you like sour beers and you like raspberries you'll love the taste of this beer. Definitely the best fruit sour I've had to date because the raspberries really have a strong fruit flavor that balances the sourness.
M- Slightly acidic and refreshing. The carbonation is just right. Not overly carbonated to detract from the flavor.
O- Liked this beer so much that I picked up a bottle to bring back to Florida and even bought an Atrial Rubicite T-Shirt. 732 charactersELS, Aug 04, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bottle traded from Adam. Huge thanks for a huge want here. Batch 2, Aug 2013 poured on 8/2/14. Pours a beautiful ruby red with a small pink head that recedes not long after pouring. Beautiful aroma of fresh raspberries, tartness and lacto acidity, a bit of dry oakiness. Flavor is tart lacto punch followed by a smooth jammy raspberry. Lightly sweet and big tartness that really bites the tongue. Lingering tart raspberry left on the palate. Dry and light to medium bodied with medium prickly carbonation. Everything I expected gets jammer as it warms up and makes things even better. Yum.
If you're finding this too sour and not jammy enough, makes sure to pour in the dregs and let it warm above fridge temp. Things really improve at that point. 748 charactersBMMillsy, Aug 03, 2014

The Atrial Rubicite is the most flavorful and delightfully sour farmhouse ale I've ever had, with a dominant raspberry profile. A truly unique creation that is a pleasure with every sip, with food or without. 265 characterstmutes11, Jul 24, 2014

I don't know what to say about the smell of this beer, but definitively funky.
Pours a nice reddish beer, very dark. Almost no carbonation form, but this is a carbonated beer. Aroma is of funky yeasts, berries. Taste is really good, very sour but not overly sour. Very drinkable. Tastes like berries. The body is light. 331 charactersJulioH, Jul 20, 2014

500 ml bottle poured into a wine glass
Appearance: Pour a dark ruby red color with less than a finger of a light pink head that settles to a thin ring. Body is relatively clear when held up to light with light amounts of fine suspended sediment.
Smell: Huge fresh raspberry aroma, barnyard funk, oak, acidic sourness. The raspberry aroma is not just raspberry juice or jam, but rather an entire raspberry (leaves, seeds and all). Aroma strength is strong.
Taste: Whole fresh raspberries, oak, lactic character that was lacking in the aroma (almost yogurt like), light medium funkiness and a very faint underlying malt character. There's an acidic sourness to it as well, but I'd characterize it more as just hugely, hugely tart.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied with low medium carbonation. Finishes super tart and dry.
Overall: Extremely impressed with this beer. One of the best American fruited sours out there. Absolutely worth seeking out. 962 charactersJonada, Jul 18, 2014
4.58/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Blend 4
Appeance was deep pink with a small whitish head that didn't quite completely leave.
Taste was semi sweet, fruit forward with more of a slightly funk tart than sour notes at the end. 
Mouthfeel was light and enjoyable. 
Overall this is a little behind my sample of Framboos but truly well done. I can't see myself drinking this very often but it is a very nice occasional treat. 390 charactersJared14, Jul 17, 2014

B1: Red wine characteristics at this point, but very good and very interesting. I really like what the fruit is doing here. Stood out from the rest.
B2: Similar to B4 but not as pungent.
B3: Almost exactly similar to B4 
B4: Fresh Raspberry sour at its perfection. Perfect mouthfeel for a fruited sour, very balanced between sweet fruit and tart funk, a little oak
Overall my favorites were B1 and B4. 430 charactersbcp5296d, Jul 06, 2014

Pours a vibrant red/pink color with a tiny ring of white head.
Smell is incredible, strong raspberry, oak, and lactic tartness.
Taste follows suit, though the soureness overpowers the raspberry a bit too much.
Mouthfeel is a bit thin, and could use a touch more carb.
Overall, a very enjoyable beer. I would like to see a touch of sweetness in this beer to give it a better balance. I considered running out and grabbing a bottle of NG Rasberry Tart to mix a bit, but was too lazy. Would love to try that combo in the future. 605 charactersthebigredone, Jul 05, 2014

Pours an almost ruby red color with a 2 finger reddish head the disappears very quickly. On the nose you get slight oak with really strong acidic raspberries. The taste is awesome. Great pucker from the raspberries. Great oak notes. Just what I expected. It is definitely sour. Mouthfeel is refreshing and then a little dry. Overall a fantastic beer!!

Appearance - Bright red body. Small white head. Settles to nothing pretty quickly.
Smell - Wow. Oaky and acidic raspberry. Really nice. 
Taste - Very sour. Almost too sour. Still has a great raspberry flavor. Extremely oaky, especially in the finish. Lightly yogurty.
Mouthfeel - Almost too sour. Medium carbonation.
Overall - Excellent and better than blend 4, but not by much. Just a more complex sour beer, even though it has less of a raspberry jammy flavor. 562 charactersAlieniloquium, Jul 03, 2014

S- Huge raspberry forward, slight acid in the back. Its raspberry, but comes off aromic as fresh flowers; deep dark and seedy
T- Big raspberry forward, a bit watery after that; then kind of a void. But the vibrant raspberry gets it to 4.25. 
M- A bit watery again here, I like the thicker smoother styles of crooked stave batch 1 or framboos. The carb is about right, if not a bit too much. Nevertheless a great beer here. 
O- Jester King is really doing great things, and I can see why they are highly regarded. Probably put this around #6 or so roughly in the belgian & domestic raspberry sour/lambic categories. 746 charactersgueuzedreg, Jun 19, 2014

A- Pours a dark beet red with a thin layer of cherry white head that recedes to a thin ring and a wispy layer. Decent amount of carbonation with nice consistency.
S- Huge notes of fresh raspberries, raspberry puree, slight raspberry jam, raspberry seeds. One of the better aromas of a fruited sour that I've encountered, I love how fresh smelling the raspberry presence and doesn't have a artificial or syrupy presence.
T- Tart raspberries, a little bit of sour vinegar, oak, finishes with fresh raspberries and raspberry puree. Lingering aftertaste of tart raspberries. Not as fresh smelling as the nose but an awesome raspberry tartness.
M- Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, maybe just a slight hint of a syrup presence, a little bit on the sour side.
O- Jester King really knows what they are doing with fruited sours and Atrial did not disappoint. I love how they capture the fresh fruit presence and a beautiful color without making it taste artificial or too syrupy. Definitely recommend checking this out as it's one of the better American fruited sours out there right now. 1,281 charactersjaasen64, Jun 18, 2014

Aroma is fresh raspberries and raspberry jam. Musty and slightly funky.
Flavor is tart raspberry. Not super sweet. The balance of sour is incredible.
Mouthfeel is medium but leaves your mouth kind of dry. 
Not a complex beer but this is the essence of raspberries.
I hope to enjoy many more of these.

A: Pours a rich, dark, ruby-red color, almost plum-like in hue. Thin head that eventually fades, leaving a light lacing.
S: Tart, ripe raspberry... almost immediately the mouth starts to water, tart, cheese-like funk smell.
T: Raspberry jam, sour lacto (though not very sour), vinegar, some rubbery notes, dry oak is apparent in the finish.
M: Spritzy, yet medium-bodied, med-high carbonation.
O: While this was very, very good, and I'm glad I was able to try, I wouldn't be hot to seek this out, likely because I favor Nocturn Chrysalis. 637 charactersHalfbrother83, May 31, 2014

Appearance - Pours a stunning rosewood colored, hazy body with a light maroon fizzy head that reduces quickly, leaving no lacing. Some settling. Very inviting. 
Smell - I let it warm for ~20 minutes to get maximum aromas. Very interesting and aromatic.. musty, earthy, berries and fruit in the background and with tart lactic aromas. A odd note of green olives comes through, but not overbearing or cloying. 
Taste - Upfront the raspberries are very apparent.. not apparent in an in-your face syrupy kind of way, but a subtle note that sits behind the sour, funky notes that dominate the tongue. Oak and more berries comes through on the follow through. Very complex and balanced. 
M- Medium body, not syrupy, but not watery at all. Medium-high carbonation.
Excellently crafted.. seek this one out. Not a berry-bomb, but a pretty sour masterpiece with raspberries to compliment. 988 charactersgcamparone, May 11, 2014
4.4/5  rDev -3.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours like raspberry juice. It is deep magenta, not light pink like some other fruited sours. The pillowy pink head is really neat when you pour it vigorously. The nose is so deeply jammy. I detect very little tartness on the nose and a hint of oak. It smells like straight jam. The taste didn't quite deliver on the nose. The sour level was perfect for me. It's nicely tart like an unripe raspberry. I just don't get the distinct jamminess that was on the nose. The mouthfeel is a little thin and I could use a tad more carbonation. This beer is so light and flavorful that it is an ease to drink alone with only a slight bit of sour stomach after a whole bottle. The raspberry delivers on the finish as this beer warms. 731 charactersPHBoiler, May 09, 2014

Raspberry, plain and simple. Smell your fingers after crushing fresh raspberries in them, like that.
Finding a hard time describing Atrial because raspberry is the only word that comes to mind. Smell your fingers after crushing fresh raspberries in them. Sourness is about a 6 on the Duff27 sour scale.
Perfect amount of carbonation, medium-low. Mouthfeel is medium.
Intricate and simple raspberry at the same time. About as good as it gets for fruit wilds...we live in good beer times. Thanks for this kojevergas, a beer I never thought I'd get to try! 669 charactersDuff27, Apr 19, 2014

Pours a raspberry hue with a frothy pink head that dissipates into a cluster of bubbles around one side of the glass. Nose reveals tart raspberries and a faint medicinal quality towards the back. Taste consistent with nose, but flavors are a bit more muted and there is also a salty character. Mouthfeel is light and lively with some astringency. A very good beer, but the fruit is too subdued and the salty quality is a bit too assertive. 487 charactersJwale73, Apr 07, 2014

A: Similar on both batches, although Batch 1 is darker in appearance, and murkier; blood red with a fushia hue, and a one finger pink head that faded into spotty lacing. 
S: Batch 2: Light funk, and jammy raspberries - slight medicinal quality, as well. Batch 1: Less fruit in the nose than batch 2; a tiny bit of musk, and raspberries. 
T: Batch 2: Intense tartness upfront (lactic acid & and fruit) that fades into sweet raspberries. Very dry. Batch 1: Not nearly as tart, nor as much fruit, compared to batch 2.
M: Batch 1& 2: light bodied with soft carbonation.
O: Batch 1 is rather unremarkable. Batch 2, on the other hand, is a significant improvement - although it lacks depth. 720 charactersxenjoiii, Apr 05, 2014

A- Gorgeous ruby red, any darker as it would be purple. Quick diminishing fluffy head and lots of chunky raspberry sediment.
S- Best part of this beer for sure. Fresh juicy raspberries, tangy tart smell with a little bit of funk as it warms up. One of the best smelling raspberry beers I've ever had.
T- Not as sour as I may like, but still extremely good. Loads of fresh raspberries, juicy pulpy raspberries. Pretty tart with more funk as It warmed up.
M- Medium bodied, with adequate but not tons of carbonation. Juicy clean feel with a dry finish.
O- The best American raspberry sour I've had for sure. Not overly sour, but it makes up for it in every other way. Gorgeous, I want some more of Atrial. 770 charactersImperial_Sapient_Groat, Mar 16, 2014

poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: dark red with a slight hue of purple. A thick cap of white head that has a dark red tint to it.
Smell: Huge juicy raspberries. Moderately cheesy lacto funk. Hint of rubbery fink.
Taste: Mild sourness overall. Boatloads of freshand juicy raspberries. Mild cheesy / lacto funk and a hint of rubber. Pretty darn close to the aroma of the beer. I would say that the nose is much more intense than the flavor though.
Mouthfeel: light end of a medium bodied beer. Low carbonation levels. Slightly dry, but also watery at the same time; honestly a good balance between both those qualities.
Overall: This is a really awesome JK wild ale. It reminds me a bit of raspberry berlinner weisse beer like August Schells Fram Du Nord. This beer is definately a coolship beer and it was noticed in the feel of this beer. 889 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Mar 14, 2014

App- Absolutely beautiful pink-red body with an equally stunning one-finger purple-pink head that retains quite well. Not much lacing. But the color is just beautiful.
Smell- Chilled, this is a raspberry bomb. Really appealing for sure.. this is probably the best American raspberry beer I've ever smelled. As it warms up, a little bit of rubbery barnyard funk comes out, with a lot of acid. This is very good.
Flavour- A bit disappointing but still extremely good. Lots of fresh raspberry fruitiness mixed in with some vinegar acid, perhaps 5/10 sour, just enough to make it interesting. A small dab of rubbery funk, but there isn't a ton of funk overall, which would have really scored high with me since this is supposed to be a coolshipped sour beer. But hey, I won't complain too much- this is very tasty by any measure.
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied, not syrupy or watery at all, just about right. Good carbonation. Nice acetic, very dry finish that smacks of fresh raspberries.
Overall- Very good American raspberry sour. This is what I wish New Glarus Raspberry Tart was. I'd venture that Cantillon Rosé de Gambrinus is very similar, and Lou Pepe Framboise kills this 10 times out of 10. But still, this is the best American attempt at a raspberry sour, certainly in the neighborhood of Framboise for a Cure. 1,427 charactersStevedore, Mar 12, 2014

S: Jammy like raspberries up front and center. Tannin like, with plenty of acidity. Sugary, fruity sweetness that rounds everything out.
T: Sweet, tangy, and acidic fruits that are jam like. Raspberries, obviously the focal point. Also a grape skin, almost tannin like character. The acidity builds and lingers as this warms.
M/D: A medium body and carbonation. Fairly crisp, and smooth. Again, tannin/fruit skin like (they are everywhere in this beer). Very easy to work through the bottle. The acidity never overpowers, and thankfully the alcohol is not very big here.
Certainly the best that Jester King has released since they switched to the all farmhouse stuff. Is it worth the price, effort to obtain, and hype? Maybe not. Though It is damn good. Well done. 885 characterschamp103, Mar 02, 2014

4.53/5  rDev -0.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5500ml bottle, blend 3 (November, 2013), poured into a Jester King wine glass. 
The beer pours a deep raspberry red color, hues of pink and purple with strong garnet tones. The beer itself is quite hazy, opaque with a few noticeable bits of sediment floating in the glass and a nice pink colored head, loose and fizzy that vanishes quickly and leaves no lace or film behind. The aroma is great, lots of fresh, juicy raspberry, tart and tangy, with some musty yeast, light oak, lemon citrus and a bit of other sweetened and ripe fruit. The flavors are spot on, huge amounts of raspberry, strawberry, light oak quality, the sourness is very acetic while the fruit flavors read more tart. There is a good amount of citrus quality as well as the bretty flavor present, but this beer is all about the raspberry. It's simple, but delicate, beautiful and super fresh, the raspberry is showcased extremely well and the balance between the fresh fruit and acetic sour character is wonderful. The mouthfeel is lively, crisp carbonation, lots of bubbles, that coats the mouth well, and finishes with a gentle touch with only a few prickly bubbles as it goes down.
Verdict: A tremendous effort from Jester King and easily one of the most impressive American Wild Ales I've tried to date. It's fresh, vibrant, delicate and bright and very quaffable. The balance is great, not overly sour, not overly sweet, not overly fruit centric, everything is in it's proper place. This can easily rival any of the Belgian lambics that employ raspberry, a must try. 1,540 characterskevanb, Feb 18, 2014

A - Deep ruby color with pink foam. 
S - Raspberry aroma seems to have been moderated a bit by barnyard funk with about a year in the bottle. More of a deep, overripe raspberry aroma. 
T - Very nice balance between funk, acidity and sweet raspberries. Delicious. 
M - Medium mouthfeel with lightly sharp carbonation. Decent residual sweet stickiness. 
O - One of the better Raspberry sours I've had. Not overly sweet but still with an apparent raspberry presence. 476 charactersEliotRosewater, Feb 15, 2014
4.56/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Poured at the brewery in TX, an awesome place to visit I highly recommend it! Awesome scene with multiple drink stations and beautiful scenery. 
The beer pours a ruby red, a beautiful vibrant color showing the amount of fruit. Not much head and a bit of carbonation present in the body.
The smell is a beautiful raspberry packed masterpiece. Some well bodied oak and cherry notes too reminding me of a great cab franc in its dark and pungent aroma. The taste certainly has some tartness up front and follows with a bunch of fruit of course, and ends with a cereal flavor and bit of a disappointing aftertaste that falls off quickly. Sort of thinner than I expected in feel but has a really nice tartness over the palate. Overall a very solid taste, not amazing mouthfeel. 
Great beer! 787 charactersDreadnaught33, Feb 15, 2014

A: Pours a deep garnet, very good clarity, with a half inch of dark pink head. Good retention, moderate lacing.
S: A dark, austere, wine-like raspberry, dirt and funk, with some supporting oak, light spice (clove). The funk and earth are the prominent aromas, though the raspberries stand up to them.
T: Round, juicy raspberry, moderate mouth-puckering sourness and sweetness, a little salt, some funk and earthiness. 
M: Medium-light carbonation and body. No alcohol is evident.
O: Pretty tasty. Definitely fruit-forward and sweetish, but with enough funk and sour (though not *quite* enough oak) to offset those qualities and provide some balance. 676 characterspmarlowe, Feb 13, 2014

After the fruit, the beer moves onto vinegar, acidic tartness, and then onto a gentle sweetness. A very light drinking and flavorful beer. 
Lives up to the hype as one of the best fruit wild ales I've had. 404 charactersdar482, Feb 12, 2014

A - Straight ruby red, quickly dissipating pink head.
S - Raspberry seeds with a hint of oak.
T - A perfect balance of sour and sweet. It tastes like biting into freshly picked raspberries that aren't quite ripe yet, but it's not to cloying sweet and not too sour. 
M - Medium bodied and slightly sticky.
O - Definitely my new favorite raspberry sour. Bow down Raspberry Tart and Rose de Gambrinus. 437 charactersZach136, Feb 08, 2014

4.2/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25500 ml bottle shared between three drinkers in three low ball glasses. Big thanks to Damian74Shensky for this bottle, among several others he sent me. Bottle says "Blend One -- March 2013," so I assume this bottle is close to a year old. 
A - a very pretty beer indeed. The appearance is very dynamic; one glass is slightly lighter than another, one has more carbonation than another, etc. It's as though none of us are drinking exactly the same beer. AR has a long necked bottle, and when I opened it I was met with a nice pink foam, but, surprisingly, there was very little on the forced pour. What foam there was dissipated rapidly. The color is fairly extraordinary, a nice blood red, similar to strawberry jam, viscous, opaque, even on the periphery. I'm reminded of Raspberry Eisbock, though there's tons of carbonation here. My drinking partners are entertained merely by watching this beer.
S - a huge hit of fruit right at first, giving way to the vinegary sourness, ketchup, and apple cider. There's a carrying raspberry scent throughout, but, unlike other American sours, the dominant trait here is the bitter, wonderful funk of a lambic. The tartness is pervasive, but it's hard to assign specific fruits here. 
T - the first impression is bitterness. It threatens to overwhelm the senses, turning the beer rotten, but then it gives way to massive amount of raspberries, which are specifically discernible in the taste in a way that they weren't in the smell. It's fruity, sweet, sour, a little salty, vinegary, complex, funky, and delicious. As AR makes its way down my throat, it bursts like a liquor, warming. 
M - like any good sour, AR is excessively carbonated, burning, and sour, making the mouth pucker in reaction. But, again like any good sour, it's a good thing, interesting, experiential. There's no alcohol to speak of, but the yeast strain leaves my cheeks a little sore and aflame. Puckering, but not overpowering. 
O - AR is a fun beer, a truly excellent take on a style that's difficult for American breweries to capture. It's sweet, tangy, yeasty, and sour. I cower at how much this beer costs, but I would never turn it down in the future. 2,175 charactersJamesShoemaker, Feb 01, 2014

A - Pours ruby red with a nice one finger tall white head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving small streaks of lace down parts of the glass. Goes pretty dead after about five minutes in the glass.
S - Smells of musty basement, bit of horse blanket funk, tart raspberry - both skin and pulp - oak, dash of sugar and a touch of lactic sourness. Berries are strong but so is the musty funk, really nice nose on this one. 
T - Starts off with the strong raspberry tartness quickly being joined by the basement must and barnyard funk. Hints of oak and some sugary sweetness help to keep it all in check. Finish is tart with some sweetness, drying the palate and lingering for awhile after consumption.
M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Tart, musty feel with some backing sweetness helping to keep it in check.
O - Really impressed by this one. It had everything I enjoy in a raspberry sour and nothing was out of proportion. Really looking forward to visiting the brewery in a few weeks, if their other beers are as good as this it should be an awesome trip. 1,174 charactersorangesol, Jan 19, 2014

Blend 01
A- Pours a deep raspberry red with a large pink head that dissipates to a collar. Lively effervescent carbonation. Simply gorgeous!
S- The first words to escape my mouth were "Oh my God, this smells amazing!" Huge aromas of raspberry, both tart and sweet. Clearly acidic, with sour green apple, and cherries to go along with the cascades of raspberries. Mild funk and sweet fruit. A nearly perfect smelling fruited sour!
T- All sorts of sour/tart flavors. I'm pretty sure both lacto and pedio were used here, but even if not there's a lot of tart/sour complexity here. Obviously there's tons of raspberries in the flavor, mostly tart, but just enough sweetness to balance it out. The hints of sour cherries and granny smith apples from the nose come through, as well as the slight funk. There's also some oaky, tannic flavors. An absolute delight to drink, and I don't want to finish it!
M- The mouthfeel is effervescent, dry, and acidic. A touch thicker than most sours with all the raspberry sediment floating around, but it's welcome. Nearly perfect for the style!
O- This is nearly a perfect beer! I don't think I've had a sour that has impressed me this much before in every aspect!

4.83/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Think this makes a fitting beer to crack on the first hour of Christmas. Received in a trade and poured into my Duvel tulip. This is Batch 2.
A - Pours a glorious, vibrant raspberry red not quite crystal clear with a beautiful one finger pinkish red head that fades rather quickly. No lacing or that stuff, but, kind of to be expected.
S - Ohhh yes. Yes. Yes! I sound like that damn Herbal Essences shampoo commercial as I take a deep breathe. Glorious raspberries, pure and sweet like burying my face in a fresh picked box of berries. Very light jam notes. Not sweet, nor is this overly tart. It smells like a raspberry coulis.
T - Please, please be as good as the nose...Not quite, but damn close. Where to begin. Loads of raspberry here, tart berry slams the pallet first with some green tart seed notes, skin, then the sweet fruit aspects come through with a touch of sweetness. I can't stress enough how much this tastes like raspberry coulis. There is some light funkiness towards the finish that is overpowered by the return of tart red raspberries. This is leaps and bounds better than say, Allagash Coolship Red. The raspberry is so bright...so not typical for American sours. This is Cantillon level quality. I really cannot think of anything more I would like on the taste.
M - Mouthfeel is nice and dry, crisp. Carbonation is just wonderful, spot on for the style. Each sip leaves me craving another. Tart, but not enamel scraping. 
O - Overall this beer is just delicious...and the nose, the nose is incredible. This was worth the wait. Merry Christmas to me. 1,577 charactersrudzud, Dec 25, 2013

Raspberries and not much else. The sour raspberries do have a touch of funk at the end but it's minimal. Perfect amount of carbonation.
A bit one dimensional. It's a raspberry tart beverage; it's hard to tell this is a beer. Glad I had a chance to try it but considering the price for the amount you get I won't be getting this one again. 465 charactersJ_Dub, Dec 21, 2013

Pours slightly hazy deep ruby red color with a 1 finger fairly dense pink head with poor retention, that reduces to a small ring of lacing. Minimal glass lacing and a fair amount streaming carbonation. Great color and clarity. Aromas of huge tart raspberry, raspberry skin, sour cherry, red grape, green apple, oak, clove, pepper, leather, red wine, vinegar, hay, straw, herbal, musty funk, and yeast earthiness. Incredible aromas with big raspberry presence and great yeast/oak balance; with great strength. Taste of big tart raspberry, raspberry skin, green apple, sour cherry, pear, red grape, oak, clove, hay, straw, leather, red wine, musty funk, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Moderate amount of fruity/earthy tartness on the finish; with lingering notes of tart raspberry, green apple, red grape, pear, sour cherry, oak, clove, red wine, hay, straw, light vinegar, herbal, and yeast earthiness. Fantastic complexity and balance of raspberry, oak, and yeast ester flavors; with a great sweetness/tartness balance and zero cloying flavors after the finish. Medium carbonation and body; with a smooth, crisp, and moderately acidic mouthfeel that is fantastic. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an insane raspberry sour ale! All around fantastic complexity, balance, and robustness of raspberry, oak, and yeast flavors; and very smooth to sip on with the moderate acidity. An extremely delicious and well balanced offering. 1,613 characterssuperspak, Dec 15, 2013

A: A beautiful shade of purple with a little bit of effervescence popping on the surface. Maybe slightly too much carbonation? Not disappointed with it, just a observation.
S: As a self admitted raspeberry addict a huge smile came across my face when I took a big whiff of this one. Like fresh picked raspberries. Everything I had hoped for in the nose.
T: Super, super tart. Did not pick up any sugary sweetness like I would have in say a New Glarus Raspberry Tart or Founders Rubaeus. All tart here with just some slight flavor from the oak barrel. You can tell that you are drinking a wild ale though.
M: The effervescence/carbonation is really what my taste buds first focused on. I didn't think it was too thin or anything. 
O: It's so hard being objective on some of these really hyped beers. I'm glad I tried this 9 months after bottling as I am sure some of the flavors simmered down just a bit. Did it live up to the hype? No. But that's not why I tried it. As a huge fan of raspberry beers I was very, very happy to try this one. It met my expectations as far as what I had hoped for: a really enjoyable raspberry wild ale. 1,191 charactersCaptainFleeker, Dec 13, 2013

A - Pours a deep red with a finger of reddish pink head that falls somewhat quickly back into the glass. This is a truly beautiful looking beer.
S - Whoa. Raspberry jam, anyone? One of the best noses of any beer I've had this year. There's just so much fruity aroma coming out of the glass that I can smell it from 2-3 feet away. 
T - Jammy jam jams. I honestly thought it would be more sour, but it's really more of a fruit bomb with some moderate acidity and mild tartness. This isn't a sour in the way that Cascade or The Bruery would make a fruited sour; it reminds me much more of something like Rose de Gambrinus, just without that signature Cantillon funk. 
M - On the dry side, but nicely offset by the fruit flavor and tartness. Carbonation is spot on for a beer of this style - not over the top, but unquestionably present.
O - This is a really well put together beer, and by far the best thing I've had from Jester King to date. If you like raspberries, this is a must get. Looking forward to future batches as well as future JK coolship projects. 1,131 charactersGreenplastic615, Dec 05, 2013

It pours a bright cherry red which just glows in the glass. Nose is an absolute raspberry bomb. The fruit is fresh and there are even earthy notes of soil in the back. Some perceived tartness towards the finish of the smell. Taste is quite acidic up front creating a nice pucker. Some raspberry sweetness follows and balances well with the sourness. This beer is chick full of bold and big flavors. Mouthfeel is moderate with effervescent carbonation. This is a winner from Jester King! 550 charactershomebrew311, Dec 01, 2013

The beer pours a dull, bloody red with ruby tones!! some sediment, and a thin white halo of pink head that fades into nothing. The nose is dank and has a funky astringency, vegetable/beet earthiness, followed by a tart, ripe, off-the-vine raspberry fruitiness similar to homage (slightly sun dried tomato-y?). The taste is the same incredible funkiness swept away by tart raspberries. The mouthfeel is quite carbonated, juicy/fruity, tart, with a wheaty medium body, and a lingering dry finish that's cleaner than expected. I think this beer is a potent blend of raspberries and funk, delicious and different.
update - Blend four a very different beer - much more fruit forward by comparison 716 charactersThePorterSorter, Nov 29, 2013

Poured into a pair of JK snifters, the color is a striking ruby jewel tone, really bright and saturated, just beautiful. Momentary pink foam that lasts all of a minute, then fades away to a still glassy surface. Clarity is bright, there are some tiny particles visible. 
Noticeable raspberry aroma, a little bit leafy and a touch citrusy. Not as pungent as Framboise Du Nord we just had. Not all that funky or tart in the nose.
Bright tartness, clean and puckering lactic acidity, light raspberry taste. Palate scrubbing carbonation. Not a lot of depth or complexity unfortunately, but tart and fruity. Seems like any other raspberry wild ale out there. Not sure where all the hype stems from. Raspberry Ananke is far better. 749 charactersemerge077, Nov 25, 2013

A - Pours a beautiful, crystal clear, bright pink/strawberry/raspberry red color with a finger of fizzy pink head that falls to the surface quickly.
S - Fresh raspberries galore from beginning to end. Nice perfumey and floral like aroma, fruity with a very mild tartness and the slightest hint of funk that intensifies as the glass warms a bit to add a nice barnyardy feel to it.
T - Nicely tart up front. Much drier on the palate than the aroma would indicate. Tartness is crisp and medium intensity and backed up by tons of fresh raspberry flavor. Lactic, dry sourness, very mild funk. Tons of raspberry goodness throughout and plays off of the tart/sour aspects extremely well. One of the nicer raspberry wilds I have had.
M - A lightish medium body and medium high carbonation level consisting of very fine bubbles. Very tingly and lively on the tongue. Slightly puckering and definitely causes the mouth to water with the lactic tartness. Pretty standard for style, but nice nonetheless.
O - Very good raspberry wild ale worthy of the attention and hype it is receiving. I could easily drink a lot more of this. Will have to keep this one on my list in hopes of coming across another bottle or two. 1,281 charactersportia99, Nov 15, 2013

Holy crap the color on this beer is amazing. Beautiful grape juice purple with a little red thrown in topped off with a lavender head. Absolutely gorgeous. 
NOOO! 
*sighs* The raspberries...they...they are dead...
Tis true; they have been slain. Absolutely no sign of them in the aroma. Instead, it is really funky that was more in line with the other Geuzes we drank. Little bit of sweet cherry tomato on the aroma. I have a batch 2 coming soon, and while I was going to trade it after drinking this one, I traded for this one expecting raspberries and dammit, daddy needs his fucking raspberries!
Flavor is nicely carbonated with a mouth-filling quality. It really coats the palate. Unfortunately, I have to take off both on aroma and flavor for not having ANY raspberries. I know it has been 8 months, but I did not expect that to be all the time it took for the raspberries to disappear. 
Still a personal want ticked off, but just not what I expected. I went in with high hopes. Now I am really contemplating keeping my other for drinking. Ugh, decisions! 1,187 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Nov 07, 2013

I never give perfect scores, and I have to here, no place to improve in taste. the berries are forward but not at al sweet, the sour elements are all lined up, pucker and dry, but not burning or angry, just balanced, still supremely drinkable, not too much alcohol, just right. no gimmicks. carbonated like a champagne, it really pops off in my mouth. cant believe how alive and active this is, and how there is not a lick of residual sugar here, its dry and fruity as it finishes. the robustness of the berries and the balanced yet complex sour flavors are the takeaways for me, and that color of course. its like absolutely nothing else out there, and I would kill to have a steady stream of it. never thought I liked fruited beer, so if you are in that boat, this is a life changer. worth every bit of hype, trade value, and praise it has received and then some. it takes a lot to blow me away these days, and jester king has done just that. it is the standard by which all fruit beer, and maybe even all sour beer will no be measured. as close to perfect as they get. wow, just wow. stop at nothing to acquire this, contact me if you've got extras. my appetite is now insatiable 2,203 charactersStonedTrippin, Nov 05, 2013

A- Pours a ruby red with a 1/2 inch pink head that quickly fades to a thin layer over the beer. Great clarity with carbonation bubbles evident throughout.
S- Jammy sweet raspberries with a lactic acid background along with a touch of barnyard, although the fruit is the dominating force in the aroma. 
T- The sweet nose was very deceptive- still tons of raspberry character, but very much on the tart side of things. The lactic acid mixes with the fruit and dominates, with some yeast and barnyard character at the end.
M- Low body, low carbonation, very dry finish leaves you wanting another sip. 
O- This beer is incredible, absolutely mind blowing. Tons of fruit character- I am glad I drank my one bottle fresh as I can imagine it will fade over time. Drink it now. This is delicious. 811 charactersjustforrazors, Oct 23, 2013

Smells great. Very jammy. Lots of fruit. The berries come through strong and tasty. Not a lot of funk. Mild oak but it might just be overshadowed by the fruit. Taste is a step back from the aroma. The fruit is still the dominant note, but it's not as jammy as I expected from the aroma. Funk is mild again. More oak shows up. Quite dry. It's tasty but there's not much depth. Mouthfeel is light and drying. Good sour but the yeast/bacteria blend just isn't quite there yet for me. 601 characterspopery, Oct 13, 2013

Expectations were high given its current #1 rating on the Southwest Top 50 list. Due to the environment I was in, I wasn't able to go into as much detail as I usually would in a review, so the review below is truncated. 
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured. 
Pours a half finger wide head of pink-red colour. Nice creaminess and thickness. Lackluster frothiness. Little lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes. Retention is poor - about 20 seconds. 
Body colour is a light red - almost a pink. Yet it's dark enough to be nontransparent. Translucent. No yeast particles are visible. 
It's looking quite good for a wild ale. 
Sm: Pleasant sourness - lactobacillus yeast, no doubt, as well as a hint of controlled bacteria. Tart raspberry. Not getting any lambicus yeast. Sugary fruit. Belgian pale malts. The raspberry fruit is dominant, though I'm not convinced of its authenticity - it seems vaguely puree-redolent rather than evocative of actual raspberries. I like the tartness. The sourness is quite timid overall. 
No hop character or alcohol is detectable. 
A pleasant aroma of mild strength. Looking forward to trying it. 
T: Good. Tart sugar-glazed raspberry. Has a light sour edge on the climax; it's not puckering but it's nice and approachable. The sourness is entirely lactobacillus; I don't get any lambicus or true wild bacteria. It's clean and clinical; true spontaneous fermentation is not suspected. Well balanced, if a bit simple. Raspberry fruit is largely genuine, though there are hints of puree. In any case, it's not as artificial as it could be, nor does it ever veer into cough syrup territory. Berries. I love the tart raspberry, which is aptly dominant. As with most beers, this could use more complexity and subtlety. 
Average depth, duration, and intensity of flavour for the style. 
Mf: Smooth, wet, clean, lightly crisp, and refreshing. It'll have you smacking your lips. Decent body and thickness. Well carbonated; the natural bottle conditioning did this one well. Good execution; the texture complements the taste well. 
Dr: Extremely drinkable. The best beer brewed in Texas? I doubt it, but it's damn tasty. I'd definitely get it again; it's great stuff. Another solid sour from Jester King, though it isn't one to crack open if you're looking for true spontaneous fermentation or a puckering experience. I'd recommend it to friends and trade partners. Well worth trying. I'm not sure I'd get more than 1 or 2 bottles at $16.00 USD a piece, but I'd definitely like to revisit it in order to go into more detail in my review. 
B+ (3.92)

03.12.15: 2nd impressions from a Batch #4 bottle:
A: Looks gorgeous. Vibrant red. Incredible.
Sm: Lovely tart raspberry, powdered sugar, juicy redcurrant. Lush sourness seems to be ~5-6/10 in terms of intensity. Aromatic intensity is moderate. Highly appealing - even mouthwatering.
T/Mf: Fantastic. The sourness has developed with age; lactic puckery smackiness accentuates the jaw-dropping tart raspberry. Incredible notes of powdered sugar and juicy berries/currants fill out the body nicely. Impeccably balanced and beautifully built, this is a brew which is truly gestalt. Complex enough, with plenty of subtlety of flavour. Amazing execution. Perfect carbonation. Smooth, wet, refreshing.
O: One of the finest American sours ever brewed. Well worth aging. It earns its high reputation. Perhaps Jester King's best beer. It's hard not to inhale this beer given its high quality; it's effortlessly drinkable. I'm shocked how much better this has gotten. Flat-out incredible stuff, and absolutely worth trading for. Cements Jester King as one of the best sour producers on the nearest two continents.

The random shit you learn thanks to beer: apparently rubicite is a material found in many MMOs that is bright red in appearance and is normally associated with HP regeneration. The more you know... Anyway, this stuff pours a somewhat hazy magenta topped by a finger or so of glowing off-white foam. The nose comprises dank raspberries, mild barnyard funk, sour blue raspberry, and a twinge of green apple. The taste brings in more of the same, with the apple now more apple vinegar-like and the overall level of tartness greatly increased. It's bright, it's fruity, it's tart, it's kinda funky, and it works. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a drying finish. Overall, a damn fine sour raz drink, one whose greatness was only impugned by the fact that it followed other stellar sours in the same night. Still, it was thoroughly enjoyable. 892 charactersTMoney2591, Sep 28, 2013

Jester King glass
A: Pours a beautiful deep pinkish red color. Much dark than expected. Initially a nice layer of pink head. Forms a collar around glass. Seems to be nicely carbonated.
S: Nose is so epic. So much raspberry! Complete fresh and delicious raspberry. That funk is there too. Smells tart. Some oak notes. Dry.
T: God this is fabulous. Up front amazing fresh tart raspberry. Really juicy fruit. Middle of that mouth a touch of sour. Dry oak rounds the taste. Finish is dry with lingering fruit character.
M: Medium bodied. Dry. 569 charactersinlimbo77, Sep 24, 2013

Appearance is one of deep dark maroon blood red body with amazing pink lace that leaves it's foamy bubbly fingers along the sides of my glass! Beautiful to say the least.The smell is like a raspberry tart with that funk I recognize from many other JK offerings. The taste is instant with raspberry and quickly tart on the tongue with lactic tinge. This beer is such a fine example of what I like in a fruited sour to this point in my life. I really look forward to more special releases from Jester King! 619 charactersJDJTEXAS, Sep 21, 2013

4.98/5  rDev +9.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5First off, let me say this is the first beer I am submitting a beer for review on BA. I'm a recognized BJCP judge and have a few years of judging experience. I've also been brewing since 1989 and have been suckling on craft beer long before it was trendy to do so. I'm a brewer first and foremost, not a skinny little emo beer geek who fantasizes about getting a bottle of Hill Farmstead Edith in trade for that 3 year old Supplication I've been sitting on. Rarely does a beer speak to me enough to want to review it. That said, let's do this.
Pre-amble: I had a few 8 ounce glasses of this beer at Jester King over the course of the weekend. I have to say they are hitting the nail on the head with this beer. I had a number of their beers but this one was the coolest of the lot. Atrial is a visually striking beer. I've never seen a framboise close to this bright in color. The color is a fresh unoxidized blood red with a hint of bright pink mixed in. The head was even pink and was sticky and long lasting. 
Aroma: Fresh ripe raspberries dominate the nose, with hints of lactic acid and a slight house funk that most of the JK beers seem to exhibit. It is a pleasant funk and it sticks around in your nose long after you leave the brewery. Driving home, I had ghost whiffs of this house funk at times.
Appearance: As already noted, this is a visually striking beer. It is bright blood red with a hint of pinkness. It's not that dirty darkening blood color but more like when you first cut an artery and the blood has yet to oxidize as it is spurting out. Long lasting thick pink head that falls slowly and leaves a nice lacing down the glass.
Flavor: Bright raspberry flavor dominates the front, but finishes into a light tart lactic finish. Not the acidic bite like you might find with a Cantillion, but much softer. This is a very drinkable beer as you won't need the Tums to finish a few of these.
Mouthfeel: Medium low body with a bone dry finish, medium carbonation. A bit lower on the body than you might like but definitely not an detraction. This is difficult to not see in beers that dry out this much.
Overall: This is a great beer, especially for a first foray into the world of fruit. It is clearly dominated by way more raspberries than were needed but nothing exceeds like excess I like to say. Way to go Jeff and Michael. You hit the cover off the ball on your first attempt at a fruited sour. I really like the softer acidity as it wasn't sharp and therefore this is a beer you could drink many of. Unfortunately, there aren't many of these to be had. If you were lucky enough to get a few bottles, then guard these with your life as people who are in the know will steal them without reservation. 2,724 charactersIrrenarzt, Sep 09, 2013

500ml bottle poured into a Peg's Berliner Bash snifter.
As others have mentioned this is a stunning looking beer. Deep pink and touched of purple in a hazed yet bright hue. Moderate head. Really beautiful to look at. 
Smells like ripe raspberry. Slight touches of barnyard funk and lactic acids.
Taste follows the nose. I swear i was going to have raspberry seeds in my teeth. Beautiful and delicate with just subtle tart notes. I was hoping for a bit more funk and sourness, but it is delicious just how it is.
A pretty lively mouthfeel with an excellent and refreshing finish.
I am an admitted Jester King fanboy and had been really looking forward to this beer. While i was hoping/expecting (perhaps misguidedly) for more of a sour beer, this is a beautifully executed beer, drinks like a legit fruited lambic. And it'll probably be good with some age on it. 913 charactersMatthewPlus, Sep 09, 2013

First off it comes out blood red, lighter red to pink head. The nose is fresh tart raspberries, almost like purée. Not much funk like you get in Cantillon of Drie Font, but tart raspberries. Which I really enjoy, pure in flavors.
Taste is very tart and very raspberry. You can tell that' a ton of these little berries went into this beer. The complexity is there, but not like other raspberry beers out there. It tastes like unripened raspberry juice.  Tart.
In all I do really enjoy this beer. I'm glad to see JK finally achieve the level of "farmhouse" that they are going for. It takes a while to hone this technique down. Looking for the other installments from them. Cheers! 763 charactersDajtai007, Sep 09, 2013

Had 4oz of this in a wine glass on Sept 7 on tap at Jester King, when I was picking up my allotted three bottles. Wish they would have let me fill my growler!
Appearance: Beautiful shade of crimson, a small pink head that dissipated pretty quickly.
Smell: Wow. This is where the beer really shines. The raspberry really comes through here, it's as if they were just picked off the bush. Hints of the oak and farmhouse funk come through too, but the fresh raspberry is definitely dominant.
Taste: Very tart, raspberry flavor is predictably strong, and again very clean and fresh. Unlike some fruited sours, it doesn't get syrupy sweet. This is surprisingly dry. A bit of the funk flavor comes through, less so with the oak. I could drink this stuff all day, damn that 3 bottle limit!
Mouthfeel: Not thick and syrupy like some others can be. A nice balance of carbonation.
Overall: This beer will become famous, that I'm sure of. Certainly my favorite of Jester King's very interesting selection. I'm going to be drinking those bottles very slowly, it will be interesting first to see how the bottle differs from the Draught version, and second to see how the beer ages over time. I'm excited, will drink this only on special occasions, for sure. 1,292 charactersWTKeene, Sep 08, 2013

4.88/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Had at the Jester King brewery - draught into a wine glass.
Pours a beautiful deep red - brighter than a red wine but with enough haziness and body that it still looks like a beer instead of a fruit punch. The 'Atrial' name is very appropriate here. Moderate head that leaves some light lacing as it fades.
Nose is very heavy with the scent of fresh raspberries with an underlay of Jester King's signature farmhouse funk. 
You can taste that this would be an excellent farmhouse ale even without the addition of the raspberries, but their addition turns this into something truly one of a kind. Loads of sour notes from both the raspberries and the wild yeast. Unlike a lot of lambics and other fruit beers this one is really able to stand on its own as a drinkable beer. 
Surprisingly substantial mouthfeel. Fairly light on the carbonation, and once again really distinct from most of the beers that I'd compare it with.
Been waiting for this one for a long time and have to say it was worth the wait. As with most Jester King beers at this point, you have to be onboard with their approach to like their beers, but if you've signed on to their old world farmhouse approach to brewing then this is likely to be a new favorite and is a standout in their lineup. 1,266 charactersTXBulldog, Sep 08, 2013

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Atrial Rubicite from Jester King. Bottle label reads "Unfiltered, unpasteurized, and naturally carbonated". The bottle is a 500ml Morningstar-style, and I poured the beer into a Cantillon sherry-glass for this review. $16 per bottle, limit 3 per person, 2000 bottle count.
Appearance: Pours a radiant, clear, ruby red color. An aggressive pour yields a very thin, reddish-pink, one-finger head that dissipates quickly to a thin ring.
Smell: The smell is just absolutely incredible here. Freshly picked raspberries mixed with pure raspberry jam. Slight hint of oak and earthiness. Rising from the depths comes a soft, yet assertive musty funk that is reminiscent of Cantillon beers. On the finish, I pickup hints of lemon and acetic acid.
Taste: The raspberries have subsided since the bottling in March. The wild yeast and bacteria of the Texas Hill Country dominate this beer. The initial taste begins with sweet raspberries that is swiftly cut by the acetic-vinegar. As I said earlier, the balance is tipped towards the sour and yeast flavor rather than the sweet raspberries. Light hint of basement funk in the middle. A touch of sour lemons that gives way to a nice mouth-puckering quality. The raspberries fermented this beer fairly dry, so if you were hoping for a sweeter beer, I suggest looking elsewhere. It's quite tart
Mouthfeel: Atrial Rubicite is a very dry, fluid, and refreshing beer. It has a low-high carbonation with a medium-low body that allows you to appreciate the finer aspects of the beer. Crisp and clean.
Overall: A rare, perfect beer. It's hard to imagine a beer without some sort of flaw. Some sort of aspect that you'd like to change. However, Atrial Rubicite nails every single aspect a fruited sour should be. The only better fruited sour I've had was Cantillon Lou Pepe Framboise.
I drink this beer, and I wonder, "Was this really made in Texas?". Texans are lucky to have Jester King around. Their hard work is reflected 100% by Atrial Rubicite. 1,985 charactersClonies720, Sep 07, 2013

On tap at the brewery.
A- Beautiful bright pinkish red, hazy, slightly thick looking. Like raspberry blood I guess. Hardly any head on it, absolutely no head after walking out if the taproom. 
S- Wow! Dominated by huge fresh ripe raspberries. Definitely tart, some sweetness in there as well. Picking up some dry champagne notes. And that Hill County wild yeast. The best part of Texas sours, is that yeast. I can pick it out in the cool night air, and I can pick it up in Texas Wild Ales. 
T- Follows the nose very well. Huge fresh raspberries (and seeds?), great tartness balanced out by a slight sweetness. There is more funk in the taste than in the aroma. Again a white grape acidity on the finish.
M- most surprising part of the beer. It starts out fairly full bodies and hearty. A bit syrup-y and thick, but finishes crisp, dry and delicate. Aggressive, prickly carbonation, great amount to bring this beer all together. Excellent mouthfeel.
O- We've been waiting so long for JK to do a fruited sour and they delivered in spectacular fashion. Price point was a bit high, but it obviously didn't stop me from buying it. Definitely in my top 3 American Wild Ales. 1,212 charactersstarkmarvelo, Sep 07, 2013
4.59/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Batch 4 poured into Jester King stem.
The pour is purple tinged with Rosé type radiant pink highlights. Small, deep pinkish violet colored head lingers briefly before subsiding to a frothy quarter inch wide ring around the edge of the glass. Gorgeous beer. 
Aroma is jammy raspberries, strawberry cotton candy, berry preserves, faint oak, soft spearmint, and a vague salinity. Reminiscent yet different than traditional lambic framboise'.
Taste is much the mirror translation of the aroma with the raspberry jam coming big, berry skins, woodsy oak touch, and some minerality to it serving as evidence of the house presence of Jester King house culture and hard water. 
Mouthfeel is light, medium carb, dry and tart finish. I feel this lacks the perfect carbonation of Nocturn but besides that everything is the way I like it. 
Overall one of my favorite raspberry sours. Has all the fresh fruit flavor you could want along with a big jam like essence. It's super dry and acidity is right smack where I like it. The house culture helps put this on a level few exist. 1,071 charactersMarcWP, Sep 07, 2013

4.54/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Sampled both from a bottle pre-release and on tap at Jester King during the official bottle release. Truly exciting to experience Jester King's first bottle release!
4 oz pour into a stemmed wine glass. Served around 50 degrees F and allowed to warm in the hot TX shade.
Appearance is the first thing that you notice about most beers. This brew's radiant deep, ruby red hue is no exception. There's no real head by the time I get my glass out the door and sit down to start considering its magnificence, but there are scattered whitish bubbles on the surface. It's worth mentioning again; the color is surreal and beautiful.
Smell is the beer's weak point. Straight on raspberry with a hint of rubber and definite sourness. Thankfully the raspberry smell is pure fruit, no extract or synthetic. Still, not as rich as I'd imagine.
Taste is outstanding. Ripe, tart deep red raspberries with a bracingly sour acidity. Imagine eating perfectly ripe raspberries atop homemade raspberry jam, then chasing with lacto and pedio souring bacteria that haven't overkilled the product you're consuming. That's what this is. Amazing raspberry clarity in the taste. I wish someone had brought a Rose de Gambrinus so I could try them side-by-side.
Mouthfeel is also outstanding. Fuller bodied than most sours, thanks (I'm guessing) to the substantial fruit presence in the beer. This is nearly syrup-y in texture, which makes it more enjoyable in my opinion. There's definite carbonation throughout.
All in all, this is Jester King's maestro performance to date. Call me a homer, but I've traveled and consumed Rose de Gam at its source in Brussels and I think this beer is on par. In terms of TX beer, papa's got a brand new bag. 1,721 charactersjsboots21, Sep 05, 2013

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beautiful raspberry sour was a delight for my wife and I. We visited JK this past Sunday for the AR release and allocation pick up. Glad to try batch 2 on draft. The smell does not even come close to the taste of pure raspberries, fresh. The deep red raspberry color is just one more reason to love this beer. #Loveitman 325 characterstx_beer_man, Sep 05, 2013
5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer is so good it's got me writing full reviews, something I haven't done for some time. It joins an exclusive list of beers that I'd rate "nearly perfect across the board." It's that good.
A: Simply beautiful deep ruby color that says to me, before anything else even comes into the picture, "raspberry." Light behind the glass imparts a deep red, and frankly I haven't seen a beer this beautiful in a long time. 
S: The aroma takes you through the process of being a raspberry, from raspberry patch to ripe fruit bursting with deliciousness. Before even taking a taste, you already know that this will treat the raspberry like a delicate, almost sacred fruit, simply because of the way that it plays on your nose. Tart, fruity, ripe. And under all that, just they tiniest hint of the oak barrel. 
T: Wow. Super dry (which I love) and tart. Raspberry through and through. From start to finish, this is quintessential raspberry, and the flavors imparted by the barrel boost that even further. You know the best raspberry torte you've ever had? The one where by far the worst part of the torte is the floury parts, the crust and other fillers? Where you wish that you had more of the filling, the raspberry greatness? This beer is the liquid form of that greatness. The tartness is incredible, and the flavor is a perfect match.
M: Extremely dry, reasonable acidity. Exactly what the aroma implies, and perfect for the taste. I briefly thought about rating this 4.75, but upon further reflection, I don't honestly know what could possibly make this better. It feels great on the tongue, palate, and throat. Ideal.
Overall I think this is the best beer made in Texas yet. I'd strongly argue for it being included in any discussion about best beers in America. Jester King not only has created a great beer, they've created a masterpiece. I can't wait to drink more of this. 1,882 charactersnathanmiller, Sep 05, 2013

Bright raspberry flavor, but solid balance between malts and funk as well. Slightly tannic with a solid finish, keeps me going back for more. Overl a fantastic fruited wild ale, and the best beer I've ever had from JK. The only thing I would prefer more would be a LP Framboise, but that's a different style of beer and not exactly a fair comparison. People might think this is a homer review, but I've never had a raspberry American wild as good as this one... 577 charactersxpimptastikx, Sep 05, 2013

A. Pours a beautiful ruby red, this is one of the most beautiful beers I have seen. 
S. Wild raspberries, sour and funk. 
T. Wow this is sour. One of the most sour beers I have tasted, but without being overpowering. Very dry with loads of raspberries, without any sweetness. 
M. Light and prickly, everything you would want out of a fruit sour. 
O. Without being blasphemous I would say very close with a lot of Belgian frambroises, the best American raspberry beer I have tried. 598 charactersr0nburgundy69, Sep 05, 2013

The color is near amazing, up there with a number of high caliber fruited sours that I have had along the way. Smell promises the fruitiness and tartness to come. Light, pink head, dissipates quickly. Jammy raspberry taste with tart dryness in the finish. It will be interesting to see how the flavor has developed in the bottles, which are 6 months older than this tap batch. 434 charactersUtisTheLaw, Sep 03, 2013
4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75On tap at Jester King's Atrial Rubicite release (Batch 2). Had a taste from a 'super-secret' bottle before the release (Batch 1), too. As I understand it, all bottles from the first release are Batch 1 as well.
Atrial Rubicite, for lack of a better word, is stunning. The brilliant, bright ruby red body is hazy in the light with a fleeting pink head. Aroma is bursting with fresh raspberry juice & jam, funky yeast, and acidity. Quite complex, akin to some of the more prominent Belgian sours (very reminiscent of Drie Fonteinen's Hommage...just less 'jammy').
The flavor is tart and dry, with vinous raspberry juices puckering the sides of the tongue. A hint of leather and wood from the barrels blends perfectly with the delicate raspberry note. Acidity is light, but enough to balance the funky yeast. Good carbonation, refreshingly tart and slick on the tongue with a medium body. Atrial Rubicite is very complex, and very well crafted. Probably Jester King's, nay, the entire state of Texas's finest beer to date. 1,021 characterswagenvolks, Sep 03, 2013

S: Sour raspberry, faint sweetness. Vinous, fruity notes. Very nice...
T: Raspberry with a dry, tart finish. Any sweetness is wiped clean by the incredible dryness of this sour. Balance, tartness, dryness...no cloying sweetness from the ton of raspberries they used that might be expected. Masterfully done...
M: Dry and clean on the palate. Just enough body to hold everything together.

4.98/5  rDev +9.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Draft: Batch 2 served 8/31/2013 from 4oz stemmed white wine like glassware or 8oz teku like stemware.
Appearance: Liquid rubies, medium to darker hue crimson red with a light pinkish head that recedes at just the right amount of speed to release the nose in a very seductive manner. Welcoming without being overpowering till she's ready to have you consume her. Lacing is fueled by nice carbonation leaving champagne like light bubbles kissing the glass and dancing in a “last bubble stands” fight for survival like the sugars trying to out last their consumption. The overall color ranges from light melted rubies, to that of alchemist's highly heated precious stones, resulting in the over abundance of the element chromium adding to the intense shade of this color that has been unseen in a brew of this caliber till now. The reason for the wide range of colorings has been from exposure of this beer for a few weeks and watching it mature is akin to witnessing something organic blossom.
Smell: The overwhelming scent of raspberries fields forever is purely abundant. Sticking your nose in the glass reveals a host of events, starting with raspberries, then walking you though what you used to think was the signature farmhouse yeast smell. The use of their farmhouse yeast in this particular brew is foreshadowing of what is to come in their future fruit beers. Honed well and after almost three years of experimenting is coming to their fruition and well under their control. It's maybe not mastered at this point but Jester King completely understands what they are dealing with and how to make it work for what they do. Thus resulting in a bit of funk, though not enough for funk masters, still enough for people who appreciate the complexity going on here, while riding on the backside of light hints of oak barrels that do sit back to their 200 pounds (estimate) of raspberries per barrel.
Taste: Raspberries aged in oak barrels for months till the sugars have been totally consumed. If you're looking for sweeter fruit beer there are others elsewhere. The result of Atrial Rubicite is a masterful, well executed example of an American wild ale. Raspberries take the helm of this ride. Expect acidity to be way past average and the tart level high. The bitterness cuts though Texas 100 degree plus heat like a knife. Hints of cranberry skin tannins finish last in this one. Lemon has also been suggested due to the acidity. Funk and sour are major players here while again oak barrels sit back and lend a supporting backbone. The ending result of all this is a beer that ends in a lingering dry raspberry finish that might redefine your definition of wild, refreshing and crisp. All at the same time.
Mouthfeel: The mouth feel of Atrial Rubicite is completely governed by it's sour, tart and dry properties. The carbonation actually rides shot gun during the pouring then releases as the smell takes over. Atrial Rubicite dominates the tongue like a vest and but dries out a little quicker than most would like due to the carbonation of the amount raspberries used in the process I suspect. You still get the enveloping quality one would expect from such classics that utilize old world technics to brew beers that this one was inspired from. For this style, any thicker would be jammy and you would not have this rendition. 
Overall: As noted before, I've got to watch this beer mature more so than most. I'm proud to say this is from Austin, Texas. This a beer that I can completely stand behind and I hope you get to try it. Truly a magnificent concoction of imagination on the part of Jester King and I can't wait to see what they'll deliver after this. The bar has been set and only time will tell tell if they they can keep it up. Here's to knowing they won't disappoint. Cheers. 
PS: I'll be at Zwanze Day at Jester King this Saturday with one bottle from my allocation. If you have not tried this yet I'll share it with you. BM me. First come first served. Out of staters get first priority. 4,019 charactershash_tagger, Sep 02, 2013

The nose is tart and acidic with a raspberry note. You know you are about to dive in to something fantastic. I have been hearing friend talk of this beer for the last couple months. I have always seem to miss out on it (pre release) Also with Jester King sours they can be hit or miss. This one is a GOD DAMN homerun! The sourness is there, the tartness is there and has that reeal raspberry taste. not artificial like some raspberry sours can be. The carbonation level was spot on and I wish I could have gotten more than 3 bottles for drinking them. 632 charactersBgThang, Sep 02, 2013

Pours a little deeper than red with a pink head.
The aroma is insane. So much raspberry. You can pick up on the impending sour/tartness. Some grass and lemon.
The taste is big on the raspberry like the nose which is what I was hoping for. Lots of sour bacteria to tighten up the lips. 
Lighter bodied with light carbonation. Dry. 
This beer just wins over in sheer deliciousness. 418 charactersMattSweatshirt, Sep 01, 2013

Color is a deep raspberry red and is very appealing. 
Smell is of berries and oak, with the barrel taking a back seat to the raspberries.
Taste is similar, raspberries, raspberries and barrel, a nice tart sour and more raspberries, this is just delicious. 
Overall I am very pleased, this is a non-blended, barrel aged, wild ale (did I mention raspberries?) that isn't over sour and is refreshing and simply delightful. I was very surprised by this one, I knew the style and the hype but having had several misses and not always being one to go by popular opinion, my expectations were not high, but this beer very much surpassed all I had hoped for. 855 charactersjbeezification, Sep 01, 2013

Pours a hazy dark red with a foamy reddish-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Tiny dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour and tart with malt, raspberry, and oak aromas. Taste is much the same with sour raspberry and oak flavors on the finish. There is a medium amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a very nice fresh sour raspberry presence. 602 charactersUCLABrewN84, Aug 12, 2013

On tap at the brewery and served in a very nice over sized wine glass.. 
A- Beautiful, ruby, gem like appearances that glistens in the warm hill country weather. Fantastic red hue with very little head with the same color. This truly speaks wonders on the quality of the beer and the amount of fruit used to make this. 
S- Wow! Dominated by pronounced raspberry notes and a very fruity character that just drowns your mind in such a pleasant aroma. You also pick up a very tart sweetness that is very reminiscent of a very delicate sweet champagne, it is quite nice. Lastly, you can pick up the wild Hill Country yeast that reminds me of the cool air during my treks in the hill country as a kid, it truly is something wonderful to behold. 
T- Follows the nose very well. BIG raspberry flavors! Great balance with the tart and sweetness that really makes this something to behold. You get more of the funk characters in the taste than you would with the smell, and it is really a pleasant surprise when you get these flavor notes. Slight acidity at the end of the taste that one would encounter on a very light dry wine. Fantastic!
M- Big, thick, almost winey mouth feel in the beginning that is familiar with a nice dry wine. However, it fantastically mellows down with the acidity/carbonation that really ties down the flavors in this beer. Fantastic mouthfeel that is as enjoyable as the taste.
O- One of the best wild ales, hell I could say it is the best wild ale I have had produced in America at the moment. JK has always been known for making great stuff but this is a clear home run that only masterful hands could craft. The perfect balances and the delicate nature of this beer truly makes this something I am very glad to have tried and celebrated with the wonderful people at JK. 
Price point was a bit high but I would spend the $16 on a bottle time and time again for the quality one gets from this. Can't wait to drink this again! My only regret is that I only have a couple of bottles of this fantastic brew left to last me a year. 2,093 charactersHopAG, Jul 07, 2013

A: The color of this beer is beautiful! Pours a deep, bright, glowing red with a frothy pink head that quickly dissipates, I wish it stayed around longer. Slightly transparent with a small amount of yeast sediment.
S: Raspberry fields! Slighty tart and so rich in raspberry. There's a slight note of the oak as well. Very floral, and sour. It's hard to pull away from the smell on this one. 
T: Follows through with the smell. The raspberry is tart, slightly sweet, and mostly sour. The oak is there but takes more of a backseat to the raspberry. There's also an undertone of funk.
M: Light-medium bodied. It's crisp, refreshing, and soft. 
O: Jester King nailed this style. This is by far one of if not their best offering. I had this after Cantillon St. Lamnivus and Cantillon Oude Geuze and this blew those out of the water. The execution on this beer is just flawless, I haven't had a beer that incorporated raspberries this well. Cheers to Jester King and thanks to Jeff for sharing 2 bottles of this! 1,137 charactersUT-Alex, Jun 02, 2013
