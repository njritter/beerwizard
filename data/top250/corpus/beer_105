Canned 3/21/17
A- pours a hazy golden-yellow color with a one-finger foamy white head that has decent retention before settling to a thin film
S- earthy and herbal mosaic aromas up front gives some nice woodsy musty notes. Juicy tropical notes of mango and passionfruit, undertones of dank and resin
T- earthy/herbal and woodsy up front, quickly followed by juicy mango, guava & peach.  Mid-palate gives some lemon peel, along with some green resin, the finish is bone dry, with a peppery citrus linger
M- medium body and carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel and a crisp finish, high drinkability
O- a great variation of an already great pale ale.  Clean, juicy & super drinkable 715 charactersTreyliff, Apr 20, 2017

Pours a beautiful cloudy orange to deep straw yellow. Nose is woody, pine, pale malts and a kiss of lemon and orange pith. Taste is a beautiful fresh basket of light mangos, lemon zest and orange peel. A nice pale malt backbone to the beer that plays well. Medium to full body with a clean dry finish. Fort Point is spot on. Loved the mosaic dry hopped version. 444 charactersMFMB, Apr 19, 2017

3.77/5  rDev -16.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5From a 16oz can, dated 03/21/17. Served in a nonic.
Pours a heavily-hazed/lightly-murked dull-golden-pear colour with a bountiful, bouncy three-finger head of creamy, whipped foam. Retention is very good, on the order of five minutes, before settling back to lumpy islets and a ring so heavy and frothy it merges with the thick wads of sticky lacing coating the glass.
After the big buildup from the pour, the nose is disappointingly faint, mostly cereal and damp straw - none of the fruit and stuff I was expecting.
Oddly, taste follows the nose, or fails to follow the nose, or whatever it is that you say when both fail to go anywhere. Where the hell's my mosaic?!?! Very malt-forward, in a thin sort of way, with a bit of overripe cantaloupe way off on the horizon. Finishes a little sour.
Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, light-medium-thin bodied and no more than adequately carbonated.
I'm having a disappointing beer week. Let's assume that it's me and that maybe I have a cold or something and haven't noticed. I'll leave this review as a placeholder and revisit the beer on a happier day. 1,099 characterspapposilenus, Apr 01, 2017

Body is hazy dark golden-amber (more golden-orange when backlit) with a half-finger white head on top. Some particles floating in the beer knocks down the appearance score a bit. 
S: Very nice nose of peaches, apricots, pineapple and lemon. Fruit salad jumps out of the glass. Very nice.
T: Surprised to discover that it tastes better than it smells - tropical fruit salad, with pineapple, mango, apricot and lemon peel. Finishes with a slightly woodsy, tannic, drying bitterness lingering on the palate. Holy cow this is a great APA. I don't know how anyone could not absolutely love this beer. 
M: Medium in heft, with good fine carbonation. 
O: Phenomenal. This lone () can was a birthday gift from a co-worker. I wish I had more birthdays. 790 charactersKendo, Mar 30, 2017

L: 2F+ head with good retention, leaves spotty lacing and a cap and ring. Beer is an orange-bronze.
S: Pretty much max juicebomb levels of mango and passionfruit, with orange and tangerine. Some earthiness.
T: Largely follows nose with mango, passionfruit, and maybe a bit of peach, along with light citrus, some barley malt just to hold it all together and keep the bitterness from running amok, and a finish of moderate dank earth. Very very good.
F: Medium bodied, kinda chewy. Light to medium carbonation. Taste lingers as drying is minimal, but you want this taste to linger. Fabulous construction and balance.
O: I consider this Boston's make-up to America for the Red Sox and Patriots. Man, this is great. 830 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jan 15, 2017

Nose has some hint of tropical fruit and a bit of dank, but I was expecting much more from the mosaic dry hopping - improves some as the beer warms. Taste has a nice mix of earthy, tropical,  apricot, unripe peach and a hint of pineapple, a little dank at the end -- none dominating the other. Finishes with a nice lingering hoppy bitterness. Fairly dry in a good way. I am not blown away, but overall a very nice pale ale. 537 characters11-52_4hops, Jan 04, 2017

Nose is starfruit, grapefruit, pine and grass. Sweet with a fresh hop brightness. Beer opens grapefruit, grass, pine and starfruit sweetness. The hop presence is there but its muted and pushed to the back. Dry, filmy, piney finish. Delicious! Body is light to medium with moderate to low carbonation. Smooth and rich in the mouth without being heavy... more fluffy than anything. Goes down quenching and dry. Excellent.
Shocking that a beer classified as a pale ale could taste like this. 520 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 04, 2017

Smell is a nice amount of citrus notes of blood orange and grapefruit with candied mango in the backgrounds. Taste follows with a nice solid white bread malt backbone. Mouthfeel is medium with a nice spritzy feel. Overall this is a great balanced pale ale with orange and mango notes. It's so drinkable, want to drink this always. 409 charactersDamasen, Jan 02, 2017

4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured 1/1/17 from a 64oz growler that was filled at the brewery the previous day, into an imperial pint glass.
A: The beer is a deep cloudy gold color, with a large foamy off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick but spotty lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains strong grassy hops along with fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with a strong fruity citrus sweetness that is quickly followed by a big burst of floral hops bitterness that remains prevalent. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and provides a very good balance. The after-taste is hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer to drink for a long time. 876 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jan 01, 2017

4.46/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Looks like the classic hazy yellow orange in the glass that leans more towards the red spectrum.  Smell is fruity and juicy though nothing specific really comes out.  Some nonspecific sweet citrus; lemon rind, pineapple, slightest hint of lime.  Taste follows the smell with a slightly sweet front end followed by a not all too bitter finish.  Not much coating resin bite which is very pleasant.  Feel on this beer is medium with not all that much carbonation.  Feels silky smooth going down.  Definitely a good beer but I find the DDH version to be a bit more balanced and tastes more of oranges which is more to my liking.  This one is more nonspecific citrus and tropical fruit with not much you can put your finger on.  Still Great! 736 charactersAmguerra305, Dec 21, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A complex bouquet of tropical fruits immediately attacks the nose with deep undertones of Mosaic-derived candied fruits: hefty doses of passion fruit, papaya, mango, and guava leap out of the glass with each sip, reminding you of Trillium's mastery with the humble hops plant.
⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀
Where the intense mosaic bouquet ascended your olfactory sensation toward the heavens, the Columbus brings you back down to earth; tons of resinous pine, dank grass, onions, adjoined with some of the finer floral and herbal notes produce the back drop to the initial fruity surge. Mild caramel and some light grainy notes from the malt surface as the brew is given time to warm up and breathe.
Juice. If the palatal profile of this beer were a three-part essay, the thesis statement would be tropical/candied fruits with conjectures hypothesizing on the existence of citrus rinds; the crux of the main body would be something akin to low-pulp Tropicana orange juice, with evidence backed up by hints of grapefruit; and this wonderful zythological essay would definitely have a dank, yet somewhat mildly bitter conclusion accentuated by more earthy, grassy notes with hints of herbal plagiarism here and there.
I don't understand how it's possible to express such a complex aromatic/palatal profile without the brew becoming some sort of thick sloppy goop, but this brew is most certainly medium-light bodied. Before you have time to ponder the slight creamy sensation lingering on the tip of your lips, the lively tongue-tickling carbonation and the bone-dry finish reminds you it's time for another sip. 1,602 charactersamano_h, Oct 17, 2016

Pours gold with a thick haze but short of turbid. White fluff atop with nice retention and lacework.
Aromatics are lush and ripe with tropical fruit and peaches. Mango and guava with dank undertones. Medium bodied and creamy. A bit velvety. Zero bitterness or malt on the palate with waves of fresh, juicy hops. Peachy and dank.
Finishes with lingering fruit and extremely dry.

Pours a big foamy fizzy fluffy 1.5 finger head that fades at a med pace, nice soapy lacing, very murky milk shake orange tangerine color.
Nose super musty dank Mosaic hop, pine sap, a little oniony, orange rind, a little tropical note, horseradish?! spicy hop, a little papaya note, but not a lot of tropical, plenty of orange juice citrus as well.
Taste brings more pine sap hops, a little orange rind, more mild oniony Mosaic, again a touch of horseradish like character, plenty of rind, with mild tropical papaya musty thing, a little mango skin, orange tangerine flesh, spicy herbal hops, a little candy sweet malt, sticky even which is weird because I don't remember that from any other Fort Points. Finish is a little sticky sweet, little pine sap and onion lingering, just weird mosaic.
Mouth is med bod, decent carb.
Overall... I really don't understand how people love mosiac, its pine sap and green onion, so nasty, yeah some mild tropical notes but there are so many better hops for that, the hops just destroyed the base Fort Point. 1,186 charactersjlindros, Aug 30, 2016

poured into HF wine stem.
Appearance: Golden orange bodied beer with lots of white chunks of suspended sediment present. Pours a large head which is bone white in color. Great staying power on this beer. Head drops down to thick cap and leaves thick lacing on the glass.
Smell: Lots of sweet oranges in the hop profile from the Columbus hops. The mosaic adds a nice dank kick to the hop profile. Signature trillium house yeast. Smells fantastic.
Taste: On point with the nose. The backdrop of this beer is all sweet oranges and mangos with a dank mosiac hop kick. Light bitterness throughout the beer with light lingering bitterness in the finish. 
Mouthfeel: light bodied beer with moderate carbonation.  Creamy carbonation present. This beer has a juicy and oily character that makes for a luxurious feel on the palate, but it adds more body to this pale ale. I would prefer this to be more drinkable. Still a fantastic mouthfeel though.
Overall: Trillium makes some fantastic hoppy beers. This one is no exception. Colombus hops and mosiac hops work very well together. 1,099 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Aug 06, 2016

3.82/5  rDev -15.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.7516oz can, undated but purchased fresh from the brewery, generously shared by DB, poured into a 10oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 7.28.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a hazy and turbid copper and gold color, white head, about a finger high with little retention but some sticky lace. The aroma is decent, really intense mosaic expression, piney, fruity, floral with some sweet, doughy malt and mineral water character that is typical Trillium. The flavors are right in line, tons of sticky pine, resinous and lightly bitter, tropical fruits sneak their way out to brighten the beer with some almost stinky malt, a bit stale but doughy yet some juiciness and fruitiness is what lingers. The mouthfeel is coating and juicy, medium body, active carbonation keeps the beer lively and crisp with an easy finish that is lightly dry.
Verdict: Just a pure Mosaic hop assault on the senses. Really juicy, really piney yet moderate bitterness and pretty decent balance. That being said, Mosaic just isn't my favorite hop and while this is a good "yeast coast" pale ale, it's somewhat forgettable to me, especially after having the Galaxy dry hopped version about a week prior, which was a true standout for me. 1,216 characterskevanb, Aug 03, 2016

Sticky, overripe, slightly dank fruits, with spicy yeast filling the nose. There is just this super mouthwatering fruitiness that constantly perfumes the glass. Aromas of strawberry, lemon, orange, mango. Pink Starburst, watermelon and cotton candy bubblegum. Wow.
Taste is more down to earth, aromas are tamped down a touch, but paired with pear, a little toast, and a tingly yeast.
Tangy, dry finish. 495 charactersSabtos, Jul 30, 2016

Aromas of bright orange and grapefruit, papaya, and melon, all juicy and sweet. Subtle grassy hops notes in the nose, too. Amazingly aromatic. Flavors are extremely juicy forward, heavy on grapefruit, melon, papaya, and orange, with a quick follow of dried grass and pine tassels. Perfectly balanced, but with a subtle lean towards the juicy sweetness. Full bodied and smooth, with an orange juice and tropical sweet aftertaste. The finish is smooth, chewy, and with a slightly acidic and dry edge. Great beer! 641 charactersGarthDanielson, Jul 19, 2016

Pours a hazy yellow with two fingers of thick foam.  Lacing for miles.

S: Very floral and fruity. 
T: Also very floral and citrusy. Has a nice dry finish but remains crisp. IBU's seem pretty low but still a lot of hoppyness going on. 
M: Good feel. Nice body while still remaining very smooth. 
Final Thoughts: Great beer. This is my first try of Trillium and I can see the appeal. It remains very hoppy but not bitter, which is perfect for my tastes. I could easily drink a 6 pack of these. Also I rather like the modest can design. 574 charactersJamaral, Jul 14, 2016

A: Pours a cloudy gold bordering on pale amber. Nice head + retention.
S: Passion fruit bomb with the earthy notes that one would expect from a heavy Mosaic dry-hopping. 
T: Citric zest with some floral notes, followed by the signature Fort Point biscuity finish. Incredibly full for a pale ale.
M: Super smooth; very low bitterness with an extremely dry finish... Highly drinkable.
O: Fantastic take on the Trillium's signature pale ale. As I've come to expect from this superb brewery, it's a highly aromatic, intensely fruity, and extremely drinkable beer. While it doesn't quite match its Galaxy-dry-hopped sibling, it's a very special pale ale nonetheless. Worth seeking out for sure. 709 charactersavas, Jul 14, 2016

3.34/5  rDev -25.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Bottled 4/26/2016. A 6.6% pale ale, huh? Hmm, ok.
Appearance - Well, the appearance doesn't really scream 'pale ale' either as it looks almost identical to the other imperial beers from Trillium. It has a nice dark orange center before a gradient towards yellow. A small head quickly fills the glass then disappears.
Aroma - The nose is pleasant but not as strong as I thought it'd be. Perhaps I'm spoiled by Trillium's mastery in their imperial IPAs, but the aroma just doesn't pop as much. It has a citrus and floral component that make up the bulk, with a slightly minty note at the end.
Taste - The flavor is pretty much lock-step with the aroma, and this may be where the pale ale moniker is earned. While everything in this beer tastes enjoyable, there is a rather mundane and pedestrian barrier that I can't seem to bust through. It tries to permit entry with a juicy citrus bite, but fades as soon as the initial rush ends. Likewise, the earthy aspects are just as plain. It just doesn't have a remarkable flavor profile.
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with good carbonation. A good building block for the ingredients to jump off of, but they don't take advantage.
Closing Arguments - Overall, this ranks near the bottom of all of the Trillium I've had so far, which is disappointing since the person I received it from said it was a true sleeper. Make no mistake, this isn't a bad beer, just one that isn't very memorable, especially compared to the rest of the horses in Trillium's stable. 1,516 charactersnhindian, May 18, 2016

A: Pours a super cloudy orange with a good sized fizzy light tan head. Decent retention with spotty lacing.
S: Big time herbal spiciness backed with tropical fruits and lemons.
T: Up front, lots of tropical fruit and citrus. Herbal spiciness (almost garlicky at points) kicks in in the middle and in the finish. Semi-sweet initially, quite well balanced. Sweetness peters out to a nice dry, crisp finish. Earthy at times.
M: Full bodied and smooth. Quite dry.
O: On the herbal side of things for sure. Big chewy garlic taste. Smooth flavors and body with a dry finish. Well balanced and drinkable as all hell, naturally. 647 charactersDope, May 15, 2016

Pours a moderately hazy golden yellow body with an orange hue, two finger white head, appropriate retention and lacing. Typical Trillium; it's hazy but not to the point of looking like a pulpy screwdriver. Smells of massive tropical fruit and citrus; the Mosaic hops are exploding with juiciness in this beer. Mild grainy cereal, caramel and grapefruit rounds it out. This is upper level aromatics right here. Flavour is a huge juicy tropical fruit combined with mild caramel, citrus, grapefruit, cereal grain, a bit of floral hop, finishing with a mild citrus bitterness. It's nowhere near as bitter as it could be, which is about right for Trillium. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, perfectly creamy, a great delivery vehicle of getting hops into my mouth. Lots of grapefruit and tropical fruit flavours on the finish. Crazy good hoppy brew. 880 charactersStevedore, May 08, 2016

Palate Contaminants: salty dinner
Appearance is like a nice cloudy white grapefruit juice, with a nice foamy head. It's nice.
Smell establishes a sweet white grapefruit canvas. There's also a little pine and a little chardonnay.
Taste has everything that's on the nose, but I'd say that there's a pear flavor that matches the white grapefruit. I can't recall anything I've ever had before that I could literally describe as bittersweet, but it's not sour or savory. (The balance is good, too.) There's more sweet fruit as it warms up, mostly pineapple.
Feel is moderately carbonated. 608 charactersZythophile, May 08, 2016

Appearance: pours a very hazy, cloudy yellow, with a pure white head on top. Sticks around a loooooooong time and leaves plenty of lacing. There's a little bit of carbonation visible in the beer, with lots of little bubbles on the inside of the glass.
Aroma: very rich in tropical fruit, which is the Trillium standard. Tons of mango, grapefruit, etc., without any malt whatsoever or any bitterness.
Taste: following the aroma, this is an incredibly juicy pale ale. It's kind of a stretch to call it an APA, when the hop profile clearly suggest IPA or double IPA, but the flavors here are awesome. Peaches, mangos, lots of lemon. Malt isn't detectable in the taste, but the biscuity base really lets the hops shine.
Feel: medium-bodied and a little crisp on the finish, leaving lots of lingering hop flavor.
Overall: this is an amazing pale ale, and is definitely worth the price at $8. Seek it out. 950 charactersTheElectricOne, May 01, 2016

Bottled on: Mar-16-2016 (Consumed April 29)
A:
Pours an impenetrably cloudy gold  with an airy two fingers+ of white head that slowly settles to a chunky film.  Decent retention; cloud-like patches of lacing.  (4.25)
S:
Bright, tart, juicy peaches, with layered grapefruit and lemons, lightly resinous hop oils.  (4.5)
T:
Dryly hoppy with a sticky citrus flavor composed of grapefruit, limes, lemons and mango with some biscuity malt in the back.  (4.25)
M:
Medium bodied, not as creamy as their other beers, fairly active carbonation, lightly astringent (almost a tart feel), nice juicy-ish flavor with a bone dry finish.  (4.25)
O:
A very good PA and a very nice showcase for the Mosaic to boot.  
It pours about like all of their beers.  Neither bad nor gorgeous, decent, fluffy cap of white, though.  The smell is the winner here, with a sticky, juicy, tartish (it seriously tickled my nose), grapefruit/lemon rind/stonefruit aroma.  The flavor is a little more subdued with lots of similar flavors (especially oily, tart, bitter citrus )coming through.  Not a lemon bomb or anything, but it really highlights, oily, vaguely tart, dry lemony flavors throughout with juicy tropical highlights and a thicker woody/sappy vein and some malt in the background.  
Very drinkable, extremely hoppy, a nice balance (though it seems pretty IPA-ey, I don't know).  
I would definitely have it again.  (4.5) 1,421 charactersTheDoctor, Apr 30, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Thanks once a once again Kevin. Full review from a few nights back.
A- Rather hazy pour from the 750ml to a goblet with a head rising over a finger with a frothy texture. Wide ring with large bubbles stays around dropping small sheets and spotty lacing.
S- Dank herbs and tropical fruits ala Mosaic make for a particularly stanky brew, in a good way. A mix of passionfruit, melon and mango in the forefront with floral, herbal, citrus like tangerine and grapefruit, mint and orange juice hops. Just the hops as a hint of pale grains pales in the background.
T- See the aroma description and carry it over here adding a bit more pale cereal grain and some yeast bread in the base. Again the passionfruit, mango, apricot and general stone tropical fruit madness leading up to weedy herbal and floral tones. Tangerine and orange juice open up more with time. Dankness.
MF- Creamy and even a bit chewy as the body comes in at a medium overall thickness. High end carbonation elicits the puffy texture. Clean medium bitter finish.
Another dank and tropical version of Fort Point. No one would complain. 1,102 characterscbutova, Apr 21, 2016

3.65/5  rDev -18.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.5Picked up a bottle of this at Julio's. 
A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice not quite crystal clear golden hue with a two finger white head that faded slowly to leave a thin blanket and light side lacing.
S - Aromas of dank mango and papaya, nice citrus, wet spicy hops. Very earthy.
T - Taste is similar to the nose, for a brief moment. Most of the great tropical fruit is surprisingly nonexistant. The citrus is there, mostly as pith, along with some malt sweetness. Lots of earthy, musty, dank hops but no real flavour popping, just earthy dank. The finish is fairly bitter, but again, more orange peel pith than the fruit or oils. Actually quite messy. 
M - Mouthfeel is lightly carbonated, soft mouthfeel.
O - Overall this was a rather messy beer. Wish the tropical fruit on the nose came through on the taste, instead of just generic dankness. Really unfortunate.

Looks like yellow orange hazy Tropicana orange juice. Not very pungent besides slight citrus. The mosaic takes over. It reminds me of less bitter version of Abrasive. Feels great, soft, and silky.

S - wow, huge aroma! Tons of passionfruit, lemon zest, and melon. 
T - juicy mango with that distinct mosaic crackery goodness. Has a pointed bitterness that hits hard up front and keeps pushing throughout. Tingling. Lots of fruitiness. Berries. Cantaloupe. Blackberries, raspberries, this beer does not discriminate!
F - soft as usual with trillium! Low carbonation and very smooth. 
O - one of my favorite Fort Point variations. Mosaic does some crazy things to beer. The aroma is on point and super decadently juicy. 715 charactersagreenman19, Apr 01, 2016

Taste is full with guava, passionfruit, mango, peach, pineapple, fresh citrus, lightly bitter pine, dank earthy grass, with a lingering cereal grain finish.

Look - Pours a hazy orange with a nice fluffy 2 finger head. Lacing lingers on the glass.
Smell - Strong notes of papaya, mango, and other tropical fruits thanks to the mosaic. Citrus, pine, and a light aroma of hops are also present.
Taste - This is where the mosaic hops really shine. Those tropical fruits come through as soon as it hits your palate. There's a bit of pine and hoppiness towards the end that really pulls the beer together. 
Mouthfeel - A beautiful, medium bodied beer with a lighter feel. Finishes dry, almost like a red wine (without the flavor, of course).
Overall - Just WOW! I love Trillium's original Fort Point, but the addition of mosaic hops really made this beer much more special. I'd have to go ahead and say that so far, this is my favorite (non-stout) Trillium offering! 870 charactersSad_Larry, Feb 25, 2016

L = Golden, hazy but not near opaque.  White foamy head settles to sudsy ring around the glass.  Foam clings to the side of my snifter as I sip. 
S = The dry-hopping with Mosaic make the aroma really stand out.  A mix of citrus zest, earthy spice, pine, and nice tropical notes combine to make this really pleasing. 
T = Tropical flavor up front followed by crisp pine.  Light malt backbone balances the hop flavor. 
F = Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
O = Couldn't ask for much in line of improvement.  A great base brew that is always accentuated with the dry hop selections. 625 charactersjhavs, Feb 25, 2016

Smell - Definitely getting every bit of that mosaic dry hop on the aroma! Dank, tropical, berry, citrus, pine. Smells wonderful.
Taste - Pale ale? This crushes most IPAs, let along pale ales! Taste follows the aroma. Dank, topical fruits like mangos and pineapples. Grapefruit, grapefruit pith, citrus
Overall - My new favorite pale ale. Absolutely delightful. 440 charactersTonyjenlasc, Feb 23, 2016

the pour is of a golden haziness with a soft soapiness clinging to the sides.
the aroma is a balance of lemon, citrus and hop. 
the flavor is a quenchingly satisfactory balance of lemon and citrus and orange. light-to-medium bodied and just the most delicious elixir i believe i have tasted thus far. is this what the future of beer brings? definitely NOT the alleged "west coast style" of bitterness. but a beautiful balance of flavor and yumminess i could see the gods enjoying....... 534 characterspkalix, Feb 21, 2016

4.33/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This beer is a perfect example of the good and the bad in the hazy NE IPA trend. The good; it looks wonderful. Big rocky head with some staying power,  grapefruit juice color. It's not quite bright enough - a bit murky - nor does the lacing cling so the look isn't perfect. But it's hazy without being a lazy milkshake. Aroma is big on mango and eartiness. Flavor follows with waves of mango, apricot, herbal / marijuana hints ... but this is where the BAD comes in. The flavor finishes flat. Hollow. The mouthfeel ends up watery. Why? Bitterness. The lack of bitterness to balance and brighten is sorely missed. Personally, I could use a bit more of the pine resin from mosaic as well but I don't think it's as crucial as the bitterness. Like a brilliantly prepared meal made with the freshest ingredients that comes to the table under-seasoned. 846 charactersKurmaraja, Feb 15, 2016

4.2/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25From 02/11/16 notes. 22 oz. bottle purchased at the brewery a few days ago, poured into my Trillium tulip.
Pours a murky burnt orange color with one to two inches of white head and moderate carbonation evident. Citrus hops, piney hops, oranges, honeysuckle, fruity malts. Tastes a little bitter and more bready malts. Medium body and moderate carbonation 
Overall a very good pale ale with a great nose; super hoppy and a lot going on. Worth checking out and a nice twist on their normal Fort Point. 501 charactersmdfb79, Feb 12, 2016

4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company in Boston, MA.
This one pours a thick looking hazy orange, but not quick as turbid as some of their other stuff.
Smells like orange, blueberry, grapefruit, and cereal grain.
This really reminds me of something like the beer equivalent of Captain Crunch Oops! All Berries. The Mosaic berry fruity flavor is super dominant, they clearly dry-hopped the crap out of this one. Blueberry, mango, grapefruit, and orange, with a cereal grainy backbone that's light enough to not stand out and present enough to give the beer a little weight. The other versions of Fort Point that I've had (regular, Galaxy, and DDH) are better than this, but that's more my personal preference for hops. I like Mosaic, but it's definitely not my favorite single hop varietal.
This is medium bodied, with a crisp, clean, and very juicy mouthfeel.
Another super tight and clean hoppy delight from Trillium. They have got this down. 954 charactersGreesyFizeek, Feb 12, 2016

4.78/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75L: A dark golden ale with an orange hue with a murky appearances. The off white head is made of fine bubbles with a long retention that leave ropes of lacing on the glass.
S: An enveloping aroma of tropical and citrus hop. Extremely high hops aromas with the the main note being a tropical fruit, pineapple, and berry backed by notes of lemony citrus and some pine like, woodsy character. Also some  A moderate, clean malt sweetness with a hint of caramel.
T: A moderately strong hop bitterness and moderate hops flavors. The hops bring a good amount of orange flesh flavors with some tropical and herbal qualities to the hop character. A touch of malt sweetness and a faint caramel malt note. The balance is fairly bitter yet remaining so balanced.
O: A boundary pushing pale ale jammed with hops and excellently balanced. I love Mosaic hops and the aroma is so well expressed in in the nose with this beer. 911 charactersMadScientist, Feb 10, 2016

The aroma smacks of passion fruit, ripe mango, orange concentrate, peach, herbal-woodsy, hints of biscuity sweetness.
The flavor hits of that deep woodsy herbal flavor throughout, moved onto more passion fruit, mango, bitter orange peel and pith, a bit of peach, a light bready/biscuity malt, onto a dry and herbaceous finish. The mouthfeel is chewy, medium, and soft. 420 charactersdar482, Feb 09, 2016

S: Abrupt dankness supplemented by pineapple, lemons, and mangoes on the nose
T: The Mosaic hops really shine here and are a completely different taste profile vs. the more prominent citra hops so evident in northeastern pale ales/IPAs today - a beautiful collaboration of bitter hoppiness and citrus fruits combines with a slightly dry finish that does not overshadow the beer's juiciness
F: Evenly carbonated and a moderate feel
O: This is a fantastic showcase of the Mosaic (and Columbus) hop and profiles its distinctive flavor profile in the guise of one of the best pale ales on the scene in Fort Point. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer and highly recommend it as an elegant example of how to properly showcase one of the best hops in the game. 833 charactersFireman_RK, Feb 07, 2016

4.08/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I love regular Fort Point Pale Ale. Like love. So, I was pretty geeked to give this one a whirl, especially as I tend to dig Mosaic. Right out of the bottle, the differences were apparent, this brew far less hazy than regular Fort Point (although it seems like the haze levels have been varying lately. The one I had in Nov. '14 was murky as hell.) That said, it's still a pretty looking brew, a nice light, "signs of ample dry hopping" cloudiness, with nice foam and retention (Trillium brews tend to be great on that account). Nose is lighter and a little less saturated than normal for Trillium (it paled in comparison, for example, to the bottle of Pier I had a few days prior). Some light herbal notes -- cilantro maybe? perhaps a light hint of scallion? -- plus a little bit of sweet, tropical fruit and, as the glass wears on, a touch of pine. Palate is quite spritzy with the carb, and that combines with a pretty crackery malt profile to make this one less well-rounded and full feeling as regular FPPA. It kinda made me think of Ballast Point's Grunion (which I just checked does feature Mosaic hops, so there you go. Self-congratulatory pat-on-back accomplished), except that I think Grunion better features the Mosaic and has a slightly more agreeable malt profile. Don't get me wrong, this is a nice, tasty brew, but it doesn't have that "Wow" factor like Trillium's better offerings. As for me, give me good, old FPPA any day. 1,440 charactersbreadwinner, Oct 21, 2015

Nice and crisp. Clean beer and clean bitterness that keeps you coming back for more, sip after sip. 
Oranges, Tangerines, Peaches & & Mangoes. This runs the Guantlet of bright citrus fruits. This is focused on Mosaic, so garlic and Onion make themselves known here & there. Fruits are juicy and up front. Pine stays on the back end which works well keeping it dry and leaving you wanting more sip after sip. Solid IPA. However, as powerful as the "everything hop" Mosaic is, the  Garlic & Onion it brings to the table, no matter how subtle it is, brings flaws. Awesome beer. Minor knit-picking on my end.
Great beer. 743 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Oct 18, 2015

Pours a hazy golden orange body with a nice fluffy white head that reduces very slowly leaving thick lacing and retention. Very nice appearance.
Aromas are bursting with tropical fruits, clementine and oranges, kiwi and pineapple.
On the tongue is a nice medley of tropical fruit sitting on a sweet malt backbone. Lots of citrus and grapefruit, minimally bitter on the finish. Medium carbonation and a nice smooth body.

Pours a slightly hazy pale orange in color with a finger of white head; retention isn't great, lacing is sporadic. Great aroma, brightly hoppy; citrus, a bit of pine, subtle peach, and maybe a touch of grass. Great taste, lots of hoppy goodness. Citrus upfront with pine, a bit of mango and a subtle grassiness in the background. Solid bitterness but the hop flavors and aromas dominate. Good mouthfeel, medium light body and carbonation. Overall a great beer, its vibrant and hoppy without being overwhelming. I'm a big fan of the regular Fort Point and the dry hopping has had a decidedly positive effect here. 650 charactersmnj21655, Oct 10, 2015

The nose is, wow, when you smell this, just sit back and take a second.  This has an incredible fragrance.  Lots of fresh fruit, tropical, citrus, a little touch of pine, bit of berry. 
The flavor is almost as good as the nose, but that profile is insane.  Lots of mango, tropical fruit, good hop character with just enough bitterness and freshness. 
This is insanely delicious.  Glad I got to drink it fresh. 498 charactersnmann08, May 13, 2015

The pour gives a frothy, airy, pale white head. Lace is everywhere. The body looks like pineapple juice--- cloudy golden and dark brown blend of colors. 4.25
Has that pissy aroma, then mango, passionfruit and pineapple and a subtle malt touch. 4.25
The aroma and flavor are fairly consistent. Not quite as potent as the nose---hey it's dry-hopped--- but still has a nice pop of mango and passionfruit. A grassy note moves throughout and a bit of floral yeast or hops. A good medley. 4.25
Love the light body. Very easy to drink and the hop bitterness is hardly there. A tad less malt body than I want, but still feels excellent here. 4.5
Great brew. Hype is justified here. 714 charactersONovoMexicano, May 02, 2015

The aroma is huge with fruit taking center stage with massive citrus that is extremely juicy and the definition of hop overload, but yet refined and not messy. Barely any malt in the aroma other than a slight sweetness. Taste follows suit with a slightly lighter feel than I expected which makes this dangerously easy to drink, super refreshing but still with pronounced citrus, weed, but of pepper. Man this is great. Will trade for some. 513 charactersDreadnaught33, May 01, 2015

A: Pours orangish-pale with two fingers of sloppy, off white head.  Superb retention and solid walls of lacing. 
S: Citrus (red grapefruit, tangerine), some floral/grassy and tropical notes, sweetish pale malt.  Faint until it warms to near room temp.
T: Juice-like (tangerine, fresh oranges) in its fruit forwardness, with the analogy amplified by a mild sweetness.  Some floral notes.  Almost no bitterness except a lingering bit on the finish.

4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a hazy golden yellow color with a nice, frothy head. Leaves an OK amount of lacing around the top of the glass. 
The aroma is just ridiculous. So much citrus. So much tropical fruit. The faintest hint of grassy pine on the back end. A touch of sweet, cracker malt to balance things out. Glorious. 
The taste is just like the nose. Very tropical, with notes of mango, orange, and grapefruit. Very sweet, but not cloying. The bitter bite on the back end is very subtle. 
The mouth is medium-light bodied with decent carbonation. Very creamy and smooth. Slightly dry and spicy on the end. 
Overall, what else can be said about Fort Point and its various hop iterations? This is a fantastic beer and one of my favorite Trillium brews. The aroma and flavor drink like a far heavier beer than it really is. Amazing beer, and probably my favorite smelling beer of all time. 876 charactersScaryEd, Apr 15, 2015

Aroma is juicy and full of citrus. Taste is slightly bitter. mild hops, big orange juicy. Body has a fizzy carbonation and is slightly thick, almost pulpy mouthfeel to go along with the orange pulp finish. Another top notch IPA from the New England area. 370 charactersDrunkAl, Mar 30, 2015

Bottle to tulip, pours a hazy pale orange with a lingering white head.  Smells like peaches and pine, some sweet orange and pineapple or tropical notes as well.  Taste is all tropical and stone fruits.  Peaches for days, juicy as can be, full of bright hops, with some piney qualities that linger on the finish.  Mouthfeel is spot on for the style and abv.  This is a fantastic pale, perfect example of the style and I could drink this all day long. 508 charactersadapt313, Mar 13, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Bottle. Ahhh, another take on what is one of my favorite beers ever. Pours a hazy, dull orange hue. A frothy collar of tinted white head. Lots of lacing speckles. The excellent aroma of Fort Point meets the distinctness of Mosaic hops. Tropical fruits du jour. Peach, pineapple, tangerine, and the like. Mosaic adds extra fruit and a herbal, softly oniony and piney element. He best part is that it's still Fort Point at heart. Flavor explodes with hop-fruit-juice. Juicy and juicy! About 7 different types of citrus, peach, nectarine, apricot, nectarine, and hop-herb. Pale, pastry malt brings the balance that makes this beer one of my favorite before all the fancy dry-hopping. Bitterness isn't overwhelming. Feel has some hop resin and a very full, creaminess for its size. Softer bubbles. Fort Point, regardless of if it's quintuple dry-hopped or just plain and basic is a fantastic beer. I refuse to stop imbibing this beer in all its forms. 947 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 13, 2015

Appearance: Pours a hazy, nearly opaque apricot color and leaves a couple fingers of slightly off-white head that lingers for quite a while before finally fading to a foamy white layer atop the beer. (4.5)
Smell: Fresh spruce, pineapple, orange, a hint of grapefruit. Really nice combination of hop flavors in here. (4.75)
Taste: Earthy tones, pineapple, spruce, citrus, even a hint of juniper. Really fresh, vibrant flavors. Supremely drinkable. (4.75)
Mouth-feel: Medium, slightly creamy body, with a medium carbonation. Wonderful for the style. Real nice mix between bitter and juicy. (4.75)
Overall: This hop works wonders here, such a balanced, delicious flavor profile. There is nothing wrong with this beer, a top notch IPA. (4.75) 837 charactersResuin, Mar 07, 2015

A - 3 fingers of dense white head.  Excellent lacing and retention (no surpass).  Beautiful opaque/hazy/pulpy dark orange body.
S - Sharp, bright citrus (grapefruit), some blended tropical fruit behind (pineapple).  Dank.
T - Wow.  Juicy tropical, citrus, melon, tangerine, grapefruit (rind and flesh).  Some fresh hay.
M - Just like FPPA.  Bitter finish pleasantly cuts through the sticky fruitiness.
O - I'm a sucker for Mosaic hops.  This is outstanding and on par with FPPA.  I enjoyed it more than the Galaxy DH and DDH variants. 558 charactersAirBob, Feb 27, 2015

4.27/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25The beer pours a tarnished brass color topped by a sticky, foamy white head that lingers throughout drinking. There is some sediment, but no large flocs. The nose is a mix of pineapple, pine needles, grain, and some booze - there's a huge hop presence, but it's not a shovel full of hops to the face. The taste is similar with juicy hops upfront, but the grain is definitely starting to creep up on this 1/17 bottling. At this point, the yeast and grain presence plays well with the tropical fruit hop profile. Additionally, the beer stays well carbonated throughout drinking and has appropriate level of bitterness to balance out the malt base. I'd describe this beer has having a medium body, slight chewiness from the yeast, but minimal alcohol, and a semi-sweet and bitter finish. It's definitely a tasty APA, worth trying and sharing, but didn't quite have the crushability I was hoping for. 896 charactersThePorterSorter, Feb 07, 2015

Wonderful northeast hop aroma.  Huge and in balance - sweet pink grapefruit, concentrated lemon citrus, sugared lemon peal, dank note of orange.  Clean pine and light resin in the background. 
Full, incredibly smooth beer.   Very soft, light carbonation and flavor develops well.  Wash of grapefruit, citrus, resin.  Very clean.

4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA
Bottled 011715
Served in a pint glass
Super cloudy, yellow ochre appearance. An inch-tall, tight and bubbly, off white crown topped the liquid and faded to a thick, frothy cap. Drippy rings of lacing coated the top portion of the glass.
The aroma was super hoppy and fruity. Tropical fruits were quite apparent. Loads of passionfruit and guava. Dank, herbal, resiny, weed-like notes came through strong. Orange zest was noticeable. Perhaps some fresh orange or tangerine juice as well. Really crisp and bright. Subtle peach and apricot notes were also detectible.
Intense juicy and fruity hops dominated in the flavor profile as well. Peach, apricot and mango came through strong. Touch of pineapple. Zippy and spicy. Tart, zesty, lemony notes appeared mid-palate, lending the beer a nice brightness. Candied orange peel was noticeable in the ever-so-slightly bitter finish. Crisp, lemon notes lingered in the aftertaste.
The mouthfeel was super slick and silky smooth. Creamy and fluffy on the palate. A fine, subtle effervesce gave the liquid a nice suppleness.
It seems like every other week Trillium Brewing puts out another variation of their soon-to-be iconic pale ales, IPAs and double IPAs. Although this Mosaic Dry Hopped Fort Point release was incredibly flavorful and dangerously drinkabke, it is definitely a half step behind their galaxy and double dry hopped versions. Nevertheless, all of these beers are exceptional and worth seeking out. 1,549 charactersDamian, Jan 26, 2015

S: Great smelling beer but the downside of this beer. Has a hoppy fruity malty smell but i picke up on this background alcohol.
T: Amazing. Fruits hops, really well balanced with some delicious malts and a bit of pine flavor. Unlike the smell there is no sign of alcohol.
M: That amazing mouth feel. Not too thin its almost creamy. amazing
O: Trillium is making amazing beers one of my favorites 525 charactersGinjaSlice, Jan 26, 2015

4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served from a bottle dated 1/17/15. This this is super fresh and it shows in every way.
First off it pours a bright, hazy, yellowish orange with a nice fluffy head. This is exactly how I want my IPA's and APA's to look. The aroma is bursting with juicy citrus with a touch of breadiness. As you sip the nose follows suit with a nice bite to the finish. Not a ton of bitterness so this drinks so smooth. Great lacing. 
The Fort Point series has just been outstanding and I'm glad I've been lucky enough to try most if not all. They have yet to disappoint and I'd recommend to any hop lover. 591 charactershuddyball, Jan 19, 2015

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a hazy pale yellow color with no vision of anything.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank.
Smell:  Tropical, herbal, juicy, danky, floral, resiny, citrus, pale, and pilsner malts.
Taste:  Super awesome hop flavor balanced out by a nice malt backbone and light tingly bitterness.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, delicious, medium bodied, a little chewy, and slight bitterness.
Overall:  Just as good or maybe even better than the regular fort point. 579 charactersFlounder57, Jan 19, 2015
