The nose had me scared this beer would be to sweet as all I got was a cherry smell. At first taste the scare from the nose was right but the sweetness upfront balances out quickly with a gentle tartness. The feel is smooth for a beer that looks so highly carbonated but does have a little bite at the end. Overall this is a wonderful beer! 398 charactersMeyers1023, Jun 01, 2017

Far too much sweetness, a la cherry hard candies, combine with a syrupy body to create something that lacks drinability and is, dare I use the overemployed term, rather cloying. That this is as highly rated as it is speaks to not only to its storied history but also to the current craft palate, which sure does love itself sweetness + fruit. As for me, I'm gonna need a pack of Grand Cru to wash away the disappointment. 480 charactersbreadwinner, May 30, 2017

4.18/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Reviewed from notes. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into an El Catador teku glass.
A: Brownish red and hazy, with good visible carbonation. A finger's worth of light tan head fades quickly.
S: Juicy raspberries with moderate tartness. Lactic tart as well with some woody tannins. Modest acetic character to the tartness. It doesn’t smell terribly funky, and really not a huge aroma overall. But decent for what's there.
T: Raspberries – fresh and pie filling. Lactic and acetic tartness. Some woody tannins, and mild accompanying vanilla. Light biscuit malts. This isn't particularly sour – rather just a restrained tartness - and with no funk to speak of. More fresh raspberries and light lactic tart with the fruity tartness in the hang.
M: A light body and low alcohol presence. A fine-bubble carbonation sensation is nicely present without seeming over-carbonated.
O: A tasty enough beer to be sure, but not what I was expecting from reputation. I don't know if maybe other brewers have caught up to this from the initial release or what. I’d rather have Caractere Rouge every day of the week. That said, this does have some of the freshest, juiciest raspberries this side of New Glarus. 1,201 charactersmacrosmatic, May 20, 2017

Poured into a tulip a really nice clean/clear dark ruby red color, very nice carbonation, with a really nice thick/cream/fizzy one-finger plus off-white head, which leaves some sticky lacing behind. The nose is malty, yeasty, with some really nice cherries, tart, sweetness, some oakyness. The taste is really nice, malty, yeasty, very nice cherry note, really nice tartness, and some nice sweetness, nice little oak note. Medium body, with a nice little dry/bitter finish. Overall, this is a very tasty brew. Very cool looking bottle. Glad to have gotten a chance to try this. Thanks Arthur! 698 charactersWasatch, May 14, 2017

Pours a dark cherry brown maroon body with a big frothy light pink head that reduces slowly to leave a layer of foam and no lacing. 
Aromas of oak, cherry, fruity berries, acetic vinegar, a little plastic, yeasty funk. On the tongue is sweet and sour cherries, followed by sweet caramel and oak, finishing with an acetic / citrus sourness that lingers on the tongue and more wood. Mouthfeel is medium body with medium low carbonation.  A little syrupy. 
A nice treat, excellent representation of the style. 587 charactersgcamparone, Apr 14, 2017

A- Pours a ruby reddish light brown color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains decently before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a half sheet of sheer surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves a thick solid ring behind.
S- Huge bright cherry aroma with lots of lactic acid and a bit of Brett funk.
T- Definitely leans toward the sweeter side of things with the tartness acting as a balance component.  The fruit plays well off the oak and there are notes of crab apple, vanilla and cranberry.
M- Slightly syrupy with a medium amount of pucker.  Medium carbonation and a lightish body.
O- Has good character and the fruit flavor is good, but the focus seems to be on the sweetness rather than the oak or funk which keeps it from being world class for me. 838 charactersImmortale25, Apr 10, 2017

Aromas were of the sweet canned cherries with a touch of tartness. The flavors were outstanding. Jammy cherries and hint of raspberries all over. It's sour but not to the point it's a overkill. It's perfectly balanced between the sour and sweetness - you get two sides of this beer. It starts out sour but the sweetness takes over midway through.  Not so vinegary like many of the sour beers are. Actually a perfect intro to a sour. The mouthfeel is light bodied but the flavors being so rich for a low ABV beer makes up for it. 589 charactersBenish, Apr 02, 2017

Smooth, woody, excellent balance, the sour/tart cherries are there but there is a rich flavor and body so it's not like drinking something flat and the sweet fruit flavors (including sweet cherry aspects) come through in shining colors and the beer finishes clean and easy.  Really enjoyable and a must have. 450 charactersclayrock81, Mar 30, 2017

Pours a lovely clear, but deep ruby in color.  The head takes up just less than half the glass.  Settling is uniform, a puck remains before I actually take a sip.
Nose is cherry, a combination of sweet and tart.  There's a little wine-like note in there as well - a fruity wine with a hint of tartness.  If this were wine, it would likely not be considered good, as there is a vinegar lean as I sniff deeper, maybe red wine vinegar all together.
Taste is cherry, unsurprisingly; it's not overwhelming, and not alone.  A tart berry note opens, actually, with just a hint of sweet vinegar.  Carbonation is nice, light, and smooth - allowing the tart to tickle the tongue.  The cherry comes forth in the early middle - almost a little like a well done and not over-sugared cherry soda.  I could maybe also go a cherry flavored spritzer with a smoother feel.
I expected a little more tartness from the beer, even if it is a Rodenbach.  The time on the foeders might have smoothed out these more sour notes even more than usual, which might have also led to the nice smoothness of the feel.  I can't complain too much, and can see many people enjoying this from all walks of beerdom. 1,189 characterscjgiant, Mar 15, 2017

Only a slight tartness to it,  was expecting a bit more.  Reminds alot of one of those Lindeman's  fruited "lambics",  except maybe a bit less carbonated.  It's decent  but I'm not loving it,  and it is drinkable,  but it was a chore getting through the entire bottle over the course if a hockey game because of the sweetness.  After I finished,  i was craving a really dry, roasty stout.  Would maybe have it again if given to me or something,  but definitely not shelling out the money for a bottle. 605 charactersAngusOg, Mar 03, 2017

Tartness is minimal, yeasty funk or barrel presence is undetectable, aside from a slight lactic finish and the faintest oak flavor.  But yeah, mostly it's a tart cherry soda, though that luscious, soft texture is certainly rewarding.  So tasty, but not a complex or rewarding sour that I'd expect from these guys. 421 charactersjmasher85, Mar 02, 2017

4.3/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52016 version.
A- Corked 750ml from the bottle into three tulips with a ruby red body and an off-white, slightly pink foamy cap. The head makes it to about  two inches high with good retention. A wide ring at the edges remains leaving both sheets and webs of lace on the way down.
S- Fairly refined and even somewhat mild here. The dark fruits and tartness, both hints of lactic and acetic are the most obvious thing with cherry juice up front. A hint of wet oak but mostly the fruits and tartness.
T- Very juciy cherries and red fruits with a pleasant balance of tartness and sweets. Vinous wet oak, slight lemon acidity, a hint of slick Flanders acetic acid and some light fruits come to mind. An apparent mustiness.
MF- Foamy and puffy body which is of a medium thickness overall. Like a cloud on the palate and extremely smooth. High end carbonation and a tart finish.
Pleasant balance between the tartness from the ferment and aging process, the sour cherries and the sweetness. Surprisingly juicy and bursting cherry character. 1,037 characterscbutova, Mar 01, 2017

4.69/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Pours pretty, translucent tawny red, perhaps just a shade lighter and sparklier than their Grand Cru, with which I am enamored.
Smells sweeter than the Grand Cru, not nearly as a sharp or acidic.  Instead, the interplay lay more between the cherries and barleys than with any bacterial tartness. Very sweet, natural cherries envelop and soften the sharpness of sweet cherries.
Tastes a bit more like a traditional flanders red, though I would still primarily classify this is a kriek.  Light funk on the the start of the sip before the beer becomes dominated by the aforementioned cherry interplay. The finish is sweet and assertive without being cloying.  There are no puckering nodes to be found here, or something that's a rich and complex as the very best wines I've ever had. 782 charactersmynie, Mar 01, 2017

S: Smells of cherries in a very juicy way and also an immediate wine like character as well with a candied tartness bringing it all together.
T: Very crisp and rich, a great pinch of tart cherry but with a certain smoothness too it, it is not overpowering but it also tastes like real cherries, not concentrate or syrup, there is a cheesy funk here and a certain oakiness as well, what really does it here is that sweetness
M: medium, somewhat silky but not overly so
O: I had a bit of a cold when I had this, so I'm sure I missed a good bit of it's finer nuances but, it is phenomenal. What I was surprised about what was what I loved most about it. To me the smoothness and sweetness are what actually make this beer for me. I love sour beers, the more funk and the more vinegar the better, but this beer is somewhat pulled back in those respects in comparison to the Grand Cru and other Belgian sours and for some reason I think in this beer it makes all the difference. I love it, it is excellent (and I hate cherry beer), buy it if you can find it and buy as much as you can, it is a far better value for the money than the Caractère Rouge which to me is not different enough from the grand cru to justify the price hike.

Pours a beautiful ruby color, mostly clear, with a two finger foamy head with an aggressive pour and lots of foamy lacing.  The smell is cherries, cherries, and more cherries.  Also malt, some yeast, a little red wine and light raspberry.  Some tartness, as well.  A magnificent cherry flavor- intense, malt, light red wine, only a hint of oak.  Tart and sour, at a fairly low level, good amount of sweetness.  Smooth, dry, great body, well carbonated.
A true classic, just delicious.  Incredibly bright and true cherry flavor and aroma, not overly tart or sour or sweet- nice balance between them.  Also a good balance between the malt and the fruit.  It's a gotta have, when you see it.  A decent price point, too. 781 charactersstortore, Feb 23, 2017

Taste: follows the nose well. The cherry is intense and true in flavor. No artifical flavors here. Crackey maly, brown sugar, decent sweetness, no funk at all, very mild tartness, spicy finish
Overall: lives up to the hype in everything. When I heard they were releasing this beer again I had to find it  it took going on vacation to FL to track it down.

Cork and cage bottle BB 09/14/2019 stored at 42 degrees, served in a hand washed and dried absente flute.  Opens with a hissing “pop”, does not foam out of the bottle
Aroma – initially very strong sour cherries.  This fades as the glass sits.
Head small (Maximum 3.5 cm, controlled pour), off white with a slight pinkish cast.  Fizzy with low density and retention.  Rapidly diminishes to an irregular three to four mm ring and thin layer. 
Lacing - none
Body – slight chill haze, otherwise medium amber 
Flavor – definitely sour, medium pucker, oak and cherry.  Not detecting any yeast including Brettanomyces spp.  Malt and alcohol flavors and aromas are also absent.
Palate – light, watery, lively carbonation
This is a pleasantly drinkable beer but the cost/ounce means I won’t be seeking any more online.  The shipping kicks the price up 63%.

Aroma:  well first, off.. wow.  grape must, grapes, berries, cherries, creme/yogurt?, faint balsamic vinegar, who knows what else im not experienced enough to detect.
 Taste:  sour cherries are definitely up front but i dont know where to begin.  so much flavor going on without too much tartness, sourness, and sweetness.  everything is in balance.  as i said, cherries, some berry flavors in there as well.  some dark fruits.  sweetness that i imagine comes from the younger beer which is blended in.  so far the best sour beer I've ever had in terms of taste / complexity and not being overpowering in terms of tartness/sourness, with a touch of sweetness in the mix.  absolutely amazing. 783 characterskalosjakar, Jan 29, 2017

Smell: It has aromas of sour cherries that is quite prominent. It has a sweet sour cherry taste. There is also toasted elements in support. 
Taste: The sweetness to the flavor is strong, but not overbearing. 
Feel: It has a medium body with moderate carbonations. It has a bit of acidity to it throughout the taste experience.  
Overall, this is a sour cherry ale that is sweet, but not overly. It has good combinations of cherry flavors with toast in the background. 563 charactershman43, Jan 15, 2017
4.85/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Fresh from tap in a tulip glass. 
A- about 2 finders of medium darkness head with nice lacing. The color is a dark cherry red. produces about two fingers of head. Nice appealing color. 
S- Very tart with some sour funky taste. The cherry really comes through and that's what I loved. Some other flavors in there but I can't distinguish exactly what it is. 
T- Lots of flavor with multiple layers of awesomeness in there. The sugar and the sour taste evens everything out. Very evenly balanced with the sour a little more dominate. 
M- Some carbonation but super easy to drink. 
O-This is one of the best of the style I have had. If you want something sweet with a pucker up sour this is it. 695 charactersKdouble, Jan 14, 2017
5/5  rDev +12.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A lot of people will scroll by this, see a 5/5 and just scroll down, disapproving. But this is arguably the best beer I've ever had, and definitely the best sour. Poured from a 2016 750mL, part of Rodenbach's Limited Edition Sour Series.
Look: Pours a deep, translucent crimson; very minimal lacing; about an inch of slightly red-hued white foam.
Smell: Bitter, strong notes of cherry; mild, lingering oak notes.
Taste: Very balanced tartness initially, various fruit notes dominated by sour cherry, with a fantastic almond nuttiness in the finish (I'd imagine from the cherry pits)
Feel: Seltzery carbonation as would be expected of the style, quickly dissipating and replaced with a wonderful tartness.
Overall: What else is there to say? A truly unique experience, and even for those who aren't a fan of sour beer styles, this is truly a treat if you can get a hold of it. If you do your research, you'll see just how special it is to get a hold of this incredibly rare Rodenbach release. 993 charactersWickedBeer, Jan 12, 2017
4.42/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From a 750 ml bottle (date code says September 14, 2019) to a tulip.
A-A gentle pour produces about two fingers of head. The foam has a pink hue in amongst the tan colors and really good retention for the style. No lacing. The beer beneath also has a little red coloring in the rusty brown/copper liquid. The beer is murky, but not opaque. Nice looking!
S-The aroma is tart, but not overly sour or funky. Notes of sweet and sour cherry are obvious, but I also sniff a lot of balsamic sweetness, some almond, vanilla, and an earthy malt note that suggests fresh rye bread and soft leather. Yes...soft leather.
T-The taste is also quite tart with layers of flavor that open as soon as the beer hits my palate. Cherry (sweet and sour), balsamic, sugary sweet tart sour notes, white vinegar and granny smith apple tartness (especially on the finish), the aforementioned earthy notes of rye bread. They are all there. The beer is mostly balanced, but it packs a little too much sweetness for me to rank it at the top. 
M-The feel is medium in heft and smooth. Carbonation is chunky but easy to drink.
O-This is definitely up near the top of the style, especially if you like sweet more than funk or pucker. If I am picking nits, I could have used a little more oak and funkiness to dry this beer out. 1,300 charactersspoony, Jan 11, 2017
4.46/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Corked and caged 750mL bottle from Sprayberry Bottle Shop (Marietta, GA). 13.99. Bottled 9/14/16. Served in a Barrel and Barley teku. 
Pours a bright rose pink with three fingers of vaguely pink, pale head. An easily renewable blanket of retention reaches a wide, fluffy crown. Despite all that lingering foam no lacing finds purchase. 
Aromas of soured grains, wet wood and some noticeable cherry. The cherry comes through more as it warms. 
Delightful sour cherry rules the flavor. It's like a one-two combination of rart cherries and delicious fruity juice. Sparkling white grape juice, faint hay, wet oak, lightly funky earth and a hint of old leather. It all works well together and those cherries are absolutely delightful. 
Light yet somehow milky body with lively, dancing carbonation. The aftertaste is like sour, woodsy sparkling cherry soda. 
I'm a sucker for a cherry sour and Rodennbach's Alexander delivers in spades. It is, in fact, one of the best sour beers I've had. I really appreciate how fully the cherries were embraced because they meld beautifully with the base foederbier. 1,102 charactersThickNStout, Jan 11, 2017

A: Pours a deep ruby color with next to no head. Has some nice legs
S: Cherry and some acetic acid up front with an undertone of oak. Lightly tart
T: Follows the nose. Starts off with acetic acid and tart cherries and goes into the oak and some fruitiness. Grape, apple, and more cherry are predominant. Finished with lingering tartness and cherry
M: Medium bodied with low carbonation. On the edge of dry
O: Not the most complex Flanders red, but extremely good with what's there. Very nice cherry and oak going on with the perfect amount of acetic tartness. Highly recommended, if you can find any and want to shell out the dough 653 charactersBEERMILER12, Jan 06, 2017

5/5  rDev +12.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Could not, would not improve anything on this wonderful beer at all. The cherry and oak meld together to keep it all from getting either too sweet or too tart, with the carbonation right on the mark for me. I love cherry anyway, but this is superb, nicely balancing the potential soda pop character with a real Flanders red sour with no "puckering" factor at all.  This is a beer to share with those that are new to sour beers or coming from wine and yet this has what "sour-heads" want too. There was some apple and white grape sense to me, so well balanced with the oak softening every taste factor. Highly recommend picking this up, my favorite beer in the world. 666 charactersRockAZ, Jan 05, 2017

Appearance: Pours a deep brownish amber red with a moderate amount of bubbles. Slight finger of off white head that quickly settles into a thin creamy patch. 
Smell: A nicely tart and sweet aroma with a scent of cherries and oak. Good barrel presence with a scent of oak, vanilla, and wood. Huge scent of cherries that smell moderately sweet and tart. Also some fruit hints of apple and berry. Belgian yeast with some hints of pepper and farmhouse funk. Malt hints of grains, caramel, and cracker. Fairly acidic. A really good aroma. 
Taste: Like it smells, a fruity, sweet, and tart taste with notes of cherries and oak. Nice barrel presence with notes of oak, wood, and vanilla. Big taste of cherries with balanced sweetness and tartness. Also some good fruit notes of apple and berries. Belgian yeast with some mild notes of pepper and farmhouse funk. Some malt notes of cracker, grains, and caramel sweetness. Also some notes of acid, tannins, and a little vinegar. A really good fruity taste. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a medium to high level of carbonation. Nicely puckering and very smooth. 
Overall: A really great Belgian Flanders Ale. Great natural cherry flavors with some nice oak. 1,260 charactersMattyG85, Dec 30, 2016

4.18/5  rDev -6.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25The aroma accomplishes everything I want - it offers powerful cherry notes, but isn't overly sweet or diabetic. There's a natural tartness to the cherries that blends extremely well with the sour ale base. Oak and vanilla slowly but surely builds as this one opens up. It tastes a bit sweeter than expected, but still nails the essence the aroma promised nicely. Cherry flavor opens it up, giving way to a strong ending of candied sugar. Tartness is light yet wonderfully subtle - as are the oak barrels. The cherry pie aspect other reviewers are picking up is as vivid as it can be, with the oak adding that X factor to everything (read: it keeps things from getting too sweet). Despite having a full and sweet mouthfeel, it's tannic enough to go down with superb ease. I don't know if it's better than Caratere Rouge or the Rodenbach Vintage ales, but it's every bit as wonderful as those two. This is the kind of beer anyone could pick up and enjoy - it's deep yet dry enough to entice beer nerds tired of artificial and saccharine "krieks", and it's not too sour to rip out the tongues of non-beer drinkers. This is one to seek out.

Smell: super jammy... black cherry, strawberry, canned cranberry sauce, sweet oaky note, very faintly acetic. Taste: cherry is in charge upfront... kind of a cherry compote with a splash of tart cherry juice; beneath that it's the classic Rodenbach melange of granny smith, red plum, grape skin, vanilla-edged and herbal toasted oak, tannic and acetic notes. Sort of a languid start to the sip, but with considerable heft; then relaxed but palate coating carbonation slowly takes control, fading just as slowly at the end of the sip to finish with sticky cherry and drying herbal and tart components -- really chill layered finish, nowhere near "puckering." Really quite phenomenal. 842 charactersbabaracas, Oct 19, 2016

This one pours a mostly clear dark red, with a small head, and no lacing.
Smells like sour cherry, Maraschino cherry syrup, red wine vinegar, hibiscus, vanilla, oak, and slight lactic sourness.
This is absolutely fantastic, exceptional in basically every way. There's a nice soft cherry flavor, that's equally mixed between sweet and sour. I get sour cherry for sure, dark red in taste, and full, with some additional sweet cherry flavor that reminds me of Maraschino. There's some toasted oak, light red wine vinegar, a little bit of floral sweet thing that kinda reminds me of hibiscus, and some vanilla. This is really wonderful, and just insanely drinkable.
This has an awesome soft and creamy mouthfeel, with a good level of carbonation.
This is up there with the best sours I've ever had- just amazing stuff. 872 charactersGreesyFizeek, Oct 11, 2016

This smells acidic with plenty of cherry that gets slightly medicinal and then lemony lactic.
It is sweet cherry syrup uofront and then gets acidic with oak and vanilla with a mild lemony lactic aftertaste.
This is light bodied and moderately carbonated. Some pretty nice stuff but honestly for as much of a hassel it is to get, id rather drink the grand cru that sits on shelves year round. 565 charactersstakem, Oct 07, 2016

Smell is righteous jammy cherry and neutral sweet wtih rounded tart notes leading the way. Underneath there are light vinegar, floral notes, and a general fruity goodness, and slightest hint of oaky tannin. A very tempting aroma.
More barrel greets the palate, kind of oaky and light vanilla, but it is cherry jam and absolutely delectable tart notes that never bite and never build on which this baby hangs its hat. Along the way there are merest hints of herbal bitter that are almost not there, and add wonderfully. Leathery notes creep in as well. It is a sweet beer, but never gets too sweet, and the floral and lightest hints of vinegar give it nice complexity. Deeelicious.
Medium carb, med. bodied, nicely viscous, super clean and bright flavor profile with a clean as a whistle finish.
A jammy cherry dessert beer that is going down quite easily and enjoyably. Highly recommended for those who don't mind dropping some change for a serious treat. 1,127 characterscavedave, Oct 03, 2016

3.86/5  rDev -13.3%look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I've been trying to drink this beer for 4 years. Easily my biggest want of all time. Snatched up a bottle in NYC for $19.99. Shared with Schlimenhaumer.
White label. Unbranded gold wire cap and cage over a cork. 750ml. Enjoy before: 01-02-2016.
5.60% ABV. "Foederbier with sour cherries." Limited edition sour series.
Served into a tulip. Allowed to come to temperature over the course of consumption.
HEAD: ~2.5cm of foam. Off-white head colour with a faint pink hue. Nice consistency. Appears somewhat soft. No lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.
BODY: Not the red I expected. Kind of a faint ruby (or maybe a dark amber with ruby-brown tones). Translucent; nontransparent. Not the most vibrant body, to be honest. But I'm optimistic.
Appears naturally carbonated.
AROMA: Sour cherries? Yeah, but they aren't as tart as I might have expected. What this nails is the classic Rodenbach acetic character coupled with glorious notes of cherry pie filling. Malt profile is neutral, letting the bacterial notes and acetic acid do the talking. Gooey molten cherry, pie crust, downplayed backgrounded oak, perfect tartness. Cherry juice. Sourness is actually seemingly somewhat mild - maybe a 4-5/10 in terms of intensity. But the tartness really sells the brew, making me elated to try it.
Suggests a balanced brew with an ideal Flanders red flavour profile. Aromatic intensity is moderate.
No overt hops (to style). Belgian yeast is indicated by good attenuation, but there aren't too many fruity esters.
I considered a cinnamon or brown sugar vibe, but that's just me confusing the aroma given the cherry pie aromatics. In any case, it's damned appealing.
TASTE: Cherry pie comes to mind in classic Rodenbach fashion. Cherries are glorious here, striking a near ideal balance between tart and sour. Subtle acetic notes, ideal bacterial smackiness and sourness (though to be fair only a 5/10 in terms of perceived intensity), cherry pie filling, pie crust, expressive fruit. I don't get a lot of oak to be honest, but then it doesn't really need it. Balance is perfect. Build is great for a Flanders red, but I do think maybe one of the Rodenbach vintages exceeds this in terms of quality (or perhaps Caractere Rouge). Cherry juice.
Well layered, with superb depth of flavour. Sure, there's room for further complexity and subtlety in terms of execution, but it's lovely stuff.
Lacks any overt hop flavours, Belgian yeast, or off-flavours.
TEXTURE: Subtly smacky, refreshing, smooth, aptly medium-bodied, wet, and moderately filling with ideal weight and heft on the palate. There's a neat harmony of texture and taste.
Not oily, gushed, hot, astringent, harsh, scratchy, rough, or dragging.
OVERALL: The classic smacky cherry juice and pie filling notes make this beer for me, imbuing it with the classic Flanders red flavour profile that Rodenbach excels at delivering. I'm glad I picked this up even if it isn't the dazzling brew I hoped for, and I'd happily pick up another bottle even at its somewhat steep $19.99 price in Brooklyn. The smackiness really accentuates the tart cherry. I look forward to trying a 1990s vintage of Alexander (from the pre-Palm days), but this is lovely. I'd sooner buy another Rodenbach Vintage over this (which is around $14 in Manhattan), but I'd absolutely recommend this to others and I imagine it'll make my top 250.

Pours a medium darker ruby red body, one finger thick white head that settles into a thick film, bits of lacing, overall very nice retention. Smells of cherry flesh, touch of tart cherry juice, moderate acetic acidity, touch of dark fruit, light caramel sweetness, touch of oak and funk. Flavour is even nicer; more cherry fruit presence, dark fruit, light caramel, moderate acetic acidity, light oak. Somewhat musty as well, but not dirty, per se. Very balanced, good complexity. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, about perfect for the style, great carbonation, silky yet slightly drying finish with light earthy cherries lingering. Good complexity. Overall- it hits all the high marks for a Flanders Red, and the cherries add quite a bit on top. I enjoyed this one very much, and hopefully it is released more often than it has been. 886 charactersStevedore, Sep 18, 2016

4.92/5  rDev +10.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a luxurious ruby with some mild carbonation that settles into a very thin lacing. Aroma has a sharp jab of sweet lactic funk followed by decadent spot-on cherry. No artificality, no cloyingness. Not sugary. Just a great, pure cherry smell. Some dry yeast / hay underneath as well. 
Taste follows that same lead, and is equal in rich, sultry cherry notes.  There's a little tingle & pucker, but the sourness is so delicate & supports the body of the beer so well. There's certainly some classic notes - dry Belgian yeast primarily - but that cherry is just so perfectly represented. It doesn't overwhelm the pallete, it isn't syrupy or manufactured, and it's balanced flawlessly with the rest of the beer (which does it's just and doesn't distract from the main note).  Body has a playful carbonation, but is light and breezy to make the flavor profile.
I was not lucky enough to ever try the original brew, but this is an exceptional beer & certainly one I will use as a measuring stick for the style from here on out. 1,026 charactersajm5108, Sep 12, 2016

Glad I finally got my hands on this one... even if it is the 2016 vintage. Pours hugely frothy with a whispy, coarse, pink head that dissipates with time. This one is a dark, tempting ruby red. Great looking beer. Nose is huge on the cherry. Juicy with a cinnamon, raspberry and yumberry fruit profile. Excellent. Beer opens oak, cherry and raspberry. Tart but with a pleasant, sweet red fruit mix. Cinnamon and a light puckering spice at the finish. Every bit as good as I thought it'd be. Body is light with ample carbonation. Foamy on the palate and dry and puckering going down. This is what I want from the style every time but rarely get. 
As a Flanders, this is one of, if not the best offering I've come across in the style. Definitely worth trying as this will likely only get better with time. 878 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 10, 2016

Smother than the usual Rodenbach beer -- the blending of aged and newer beers make this one work better than many of their other beers. Think Kriek when trying this beer but a mellower version, making this very easy to drink.  Sweet and sour with a lot of cherry flavor. Tart aftertaste. 447 characterssmcolw, Aug 28, 2016

Look: deep slightly brown red, tiny very light pink head. 
Smell: fruit and more fruit. Cherry, strawberry, cranberry. Pretty much every berry, really. Even cold, it explodes out of the glass. 
Taste: sweet, but not cloying, and the fruit flavors are so bright and clean and present. A hint of tartness, but not a sour bomb. Amazing flavor though. 
Feel: light to medium, super fluffy, very juicy. Couldn't be more drinkable. 
Overall: a decade ago, Rodenbach was the first beer I ever liked. I can't think of a more fitting beer to celebrate that 10-year anniversary than this. 621 charactersneurobot01, Aug 21, 2016

Strong aroma of cherries, wine, vinegar, and some funk. Flavor is just phenomenal, big sweet cherries, a whollop of tartness, wine like notes mixed with oak, some barnyard funk notes, slight hints of balsamic vinegar, some acidity. Finish is tart and lingering, light body, killer flavor.
Paired this with my duck entrée and the flavors coalesced perfectly. Had to have another immediately after since I knew I was enjoying something special. Drink this! Hope to try the Caractere Rouge after this. 664 charactersBranfordBound, Aug 15, 2016

The aroma is of sour cherries, with underlying hazel nuts. The taste is much more interesting than the aroma. There is a puckering sourness up front that leading into a sweetness. Then the tart cherries come in on the back end. The finish is remarkably dry and clean with little residual sourness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with appropriately high carbonation, and a smooth texture. Overall, this is one of the best beers I've had in a long while. I will certainly be drinking this again. 604 charactersKarlHungus, Aug 06, 2016

4.53/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A big craft beer "welcome back" to this classic Flanders Red that has always signified quality, regal and rustic charm. Rodenbach's Alexander shows a dry backbone with piquant sourness and an error-free cornucopia of complexity.
Russet brown with rusty reds and hazy bronze, the beer's dark maroon pour carries a tarnish stained head of part froth and part fizz. Mouth-watering and jaw-tightening scents of sour dar fruit, balsamic, toast and chocolate flood the nose with a candied-sweet maltiness that splash the tongue. 
Nutty, hard candy, steely caramel and fruity juiciness all mingle on the middle palate with superior balsamic sourness teasing the tastebuds with dark cherry, plum, prune, green apple, lemon and dry red wine. Earthy and peppery late, the taste closes with hints of leather, worn oak, cellar and horsehair retreating through the retro-olfactory senses.
Semi-dry and medium-light, the beer's finish is malty dry with the sourness reinforcing notions of a crisp, palate-stripping and refreshing session. Peppercorn, vinous spice and light alcohol warmth prickle the tongue with a medium-length afterglow of cherry and oak. 1,146 charactersBEERchitect, Jul 25, 2016

The beer pours a somewhat hazy reddish brown color, with pretty good head retention and considerable lacing.  On the nose, there is some considerable sweet fruit, along with some light vanilla, light wine aroma and maybe a hint of lemon.  The flavor profile replicated the nose pretty closely, but I have to confess I was very surprised by how sweet this beer is.  Perhaps that sweetness will subside a bit over time, but right now, it's a  bit over the top.  There is definitely some nice cherry/berry flavor on the palate otherwise, with a light sweet tart kiss on the finish.  Mouth feel is medium bodied at most, and the finish is fairly long.  Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile I guess, but then the abv. is only 5.6%.
A decent effort, but a bit of a disappointment, as I was expecting much more from this beer.  Not sure this is one I need to visit again any time soon. 939 charactersJohn_M, Jul 22, 2016

750 ml brown glass bottle, corked and caged; "01-02-2019" sampled on 07-04-2016
$15.04 @ Beverage Warehouse, Winooski, VT
I used to be able to get Alexander years ago, and at a reasonable price, but they unfortunately stopped making it in 2000. Now it's back as part of their "Limited Edition Sour Series"! Years ago during the roll out of Duvel Green I ran into the head of the Palm brewery at Toronado in San Diego and he said that they'd had many requests for Alexander and that they were considering bringing it back. Hopefully this limited edition release is just the start.
Appearance: Clear ruby tinted light-chestnut body beneath a creamy pinkish head.
Aroma: Vinous with clear notes of cherry backed by a mild, but almost vinegary acidic twang.
Flavor: As the nose suggests with the addition of some wood and a hint of almond. Fruity with sour cherry, and zippy with acidity, the malt appears lightly sweet with a drop of caramel across the middle, and then the wood steps in to add character and help bring it to a clean dry finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium-light in body with a moderate, fine bubbled carbonation.
Overall: Not a sugary-sweet sour, and not overdone with cherry either - but certainly not lacking. Fantastic balance due to the vinegar-like acidity and oaky dryness. One of the best sour beers in the world, and one of the best fruit beers as well. Absolutely classic! 1,429 charactersNeroFiddled, Jul 14, 2016

Aroma is relatively restrained, berries and a hint of oak. 
Flavor is huge raspberry, cherry, cranberry  with the perfect amount of oaky tannins. Slightly tart, and not nearly as vinegary as the standard rodenbachs. 
On the sweeter side, but feels very balanced between fruit, tartness and sweetness. Awesome beer. 392 characterstrevorpost, Jul 10, 2016

3.96/5  rDev -11%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Draft at Owen & Engine, served in a small flute.
Deep ruby highlights, bright reddish orange tone, lasting creamy foam with ample lacing.
Aroma is lightly acidic with a sweet dark cherry note, natural and thankfully not artificial.
Taste is the best aspect, lightly tart with a deep satisfying cherry note that dominates. Vaguely musty with a slight cherry balsamic character. Smooth and somewhat light bodied with even carbonation. Made a nice apertif. Hard to pick up much oak character from the foeders though, it's a little one dimensional but certainly drinkable.
11/16: Bottle
A: 4.25 S: 3.75 T: 4 M:4 D: 4
Looks great, three fingers of pinkish soufflé foam and a brightly clear red crimson body. Minor sudsy lacing. 
Aroma borders on medicinal at first unfortunately, with some light mustiness underneath. Not sweet though. 
Taste is crisp and tart, cherries are front and center. Very slight notion of anything interpretable as funk or barrel presence.
Cherry juice, pie cherry, vague impression of oak in the bone dry finish. 
Enjoyable enough, light bodied with enough fruit and effervescence to be quenching, though not especially complex. 
After speaking with the brewmaster and hearing little beyond canned responses and wild unfounded claims, i'm a little underwhelmed by this iteration of Alexander and the majority of Rodenbach's line currently. The trend of backsweetening and blending away anything sour or complex is disheartening. Sanitizing, filtering, and pasteurizing away any traces of historical traditions... consumers savvy enough to know the difference won't buy the slick hype. 1,612 charactersemerge077, Jul 09, 2016
4.37/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Guest tap at Lunar brewing in Chicago. 10oz draft poured into snifter glass. $10 was the entry fee for a pour.
Appearance: Slightly translucent light red bodied beer with a thick white cap. 
Smell: loaded with sweet cherries and a light sourness. Hint of oak and rich malt. Smells like a fruit bomb as well. 
Taste: very cherry forward. It is a fruit bomb in the flavor as well. The sourness comes across as sweet and sour. Cherry pie and granny smith apples with hints of sweet tart candies. Light oak, vanilla, and leather.  Lots of richness abounding in this beer.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer with low carbonation. Drinks pretty easily despite the richness of the beer. No booze character or finish from the beer with a soft body. 
Overall: I really love these two fruit Flanders Reds that Brouwerij Rodenbach have crafted (Alexander and Caractère Rouge). Easily the best two beers of the Flanders Red beer style in my opinion. Though I do favor the Caractère Rouge over Alexander slightly. 1,002 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jul 08, 2016

It's an absolutely brilliant beer on all fronts. Starting with the rich garnet hue of the body it looks the part of a special beer. Aroma begins milder than anticipated - simple and clean lactic tartness followed by a bright cherry pop. Things get more complex on the palate. We can go into a string of descriptors, or I can say just imagine a perfect Flanders Red married with the perfect amount of cherry influence that enhances rather than detracts from the base beer. Superbly balanced between lactic tartness, faint acetic vinegar, earthy musk, and vibrant cherry. Truly a classic ale. 
The value at $15 for 750 mL of perfect beer is a wonder. 802 charactersbump8628, Jul 07, 2016

It is not quite opaque, but it's close to it. Definitely getting that cider-like character along with vinegar. Some sweetness from the cherries as well, though I know sour cherries were used. The first thing I notice is that it's not nearly as acidic as other Rodenbach's I've had. It's more balanced. There's some nice sweetness and there is still a bit of that sour cider character that I consider Rodenbach's trademark flavor. The finish is a little chewy bread. It is soft but not overly enamel erasing. It's a very good sour cherry foeder beer. 649 charactersSheppard, Jul 05, 2016

Good amount of carbonation with about a 2 finger white head that dissipated into a small white ring around the glass. Aroma of tart cherries, sour apple, vanilla, malt and oak. Starts off semi sweet then hits with tart cherries and other sour notes. I can taste the vanilla and oak within the malty liquid. Finishes with a lingering tart sourness. Not sour, but a nice sweet and very tart combination. Carbonation gives the beer a fizzy, bubbly quality. Drinkable, and refreshing. A masterpiece of a beer and highly recommended given the $13-$16 price. 633 charactersRi0, Jun 26, 2016
4.73/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from the bottle into a Rodenbach tulip glass.
An absolute gem looker in the glass.  Deep red ruby colored and almost purple, but with incredible clarity.  Sporadic but little carbonation coming up from the body , but with a shiny orb glow that is impeccable.  Head is fleeting pink, but settles to a thin and tan bowled puck that always stays populated and remains.  One of the most impressive body colors on any Rodenbach I have ever seen.
Aroma is a shocker.  The oak aging has taken the tartness level done and stepped far up front.  There's the classic interplay of mild sour cherry and sweet cream fruit, but there is a large oaky vanilla character that explodes off the beer.  Extremely thick vanilla aromas and oaky wood come off with exceptional mouth watering flavor.
The palate does not dissapoint.  The wood has taken over and while it dominates the classic Flanders Rodenbach character, it has taken this classic brew to a whole other level.  Mid palate just implodes in a soft and rounded vanilla sweetness that mixes with the cherry qualities into a sundae ice cream and large mouthwatering dessert.  The most mild acid and tartness imaginable on the finish, so much barrel aging has quieted down that classic sweet and sour character of this brew, but pulled it in amazing places in return.  Popping fizz at first sip, suggesting a regular Rodenbach is coming but hardly anything but.
The brew is just an immaculate creation.  It is though so shocking that it does taste like any other Rodenbach, and leaves a lot of that sweet and sour balance in the dust in favor of this oaky sweetness that dominates.  But it's far too impressive and just shockingly good.  Nearly perfect. 1,702 characterssmakawhat, Jun 25, 2016

S: Cherry, tartness, slight funk. After swirling in tulip glass, so much more of the aromas are released and you are able to really see what this beer is about. You get a pungent and acidic scent from the glass that finishes nicely with the sweetness of cherry notes. 
T: Cherry juice! wow. It first hits the palate with strong cherry notes and finishes with light acidity. It's great because the cherry is never overpowering.
M: Very clean, light body, finishes smooth. My only complaint would have to be the carbonation. I felt like it was a little undercarbed and a little more would have really given it a better mouthfeel and overall drinking experience.
Overall: This was an amazing beer. The cherry is never over powering and it's never too sour where you feel like you're getting heart burn with every drink you take. Glad I stocked up on these and looking forward to seeing how well it ages considering the last batch had bottles selling for over 1k. Grab one if you can. 1,153 charactersAshleyShafferBMW, Jun 24, 2016

A highly attractive looking reddish pour with decent clarity.
The aroma emits cherry, Belgian yeast, Belgian caramel malts  wood, but a low hop profile.  
The body is medium to full.
Yes, it did have an approachable sour./tart character with a hint of cherry juice in the taste but it was not a real pucker-up tartness.  A pretty drinkable beer. 436 characterspuboflyons, Jun 19, 2016

The aroma brings plenty of tart cherries and oak. I also get a bit of vinegar-soaked bread.
The cherry flavor is both sweet and tart, but never leaning too far either way. Finishes with some oak and sweet caramel malt. Lightly acidic on the finish as well.
Feel is medium bodied, but drinks heavier, fuller, and fluffy as a pillow. Very smooth and creamy.
Overall, a fantastic beer. This was my first introduction to the style and I was very impressed by the balance. It's sweet but not too sweet, and the tartness is present but not overpowering. Great beer. 773 charactersScaryEd, Jun 02, 2016

Best before: 01-02-2019
Served in a tulip
Beautiful appearance. The thinner bodied, crimson mahogany liquid was topped by a two-finger tall, super tight and creamy, light mauve crown. The head dropped to a thin, resilient film that eventually transformed into a lasting, frothy collar. No lacing whatsoever.
The nose was super yeasty and dry initially. Really powdery. Touch of cherry cough medicine. The yeasty notes really dominated, almost to an annoying degree. After the head died down, the cherry came forth. Bit of vinegar-like acidity. Hint of malty sweetness too. Touch oaky barrel. The nose turned even more interesting as the beer warmed. The cherry notes really intensified, and the medicinal quality subsided. There was a noticeable spiciness. Somewhet cola-like. Brown sugar was also detectible. Rich, complex and well balanced.
Flavor wise, the beer was also rather interesting. Nice sweet-tart balance. Malty and rich on the front end. Oaky and moderately sour. Cherry notes came through big time. Somewhat medicinal. Again, cherry cough medicine came to mind. Fairly syrupy and sweet. Loads of balsamic. Good dose of vanilla. Oaky and dry on the back end and the finish with a bit of lemon. Tart cherry notes lingered after the swallow. Like the aroma, the flavor profile got much better as the beer sat. The syrupy sweetness decreased and the oaky dryness and tartness intensified. The beer became more complex and reminded me of the original Rodenbach.
Terrific frothy, fluffy mouthfeel. Medium bodied for the style. The liquid contained a super fine, zippy effervescence that foamed up nicely on the palate. Really creamy, slick and smooth.
Rodenbach's Alexander started a bit sweet and slightly artificial tasting but finished up really strong. This reminded me a lot of the original Rodenbach, but with a bigger cherry presence. While I question older vintages of this beer's legendary status among beer geeks, I am definitely glad I tried it. 2,079 charactersDamian, May 29, 2016

Opaque reddish brown with a wispy off-white head, aroma of sour cherries, vanilla, oak and sherry. A creamy initial feel with juicy, fresh, sweet cherry taste with a lightness to the body. This yields to a nice tartness, ending on a dry note. Overall a very good beer. 331 charactersVABA, May 25, 2016

There is a nice mix of the fresh cherry juice and tartness in the initial aftertaste, which then finishes dry.  Medium bodied.  The cherry sweetness is very different than any Flanders I've ever had.  Glad to have tried it. 507 charactersthebeers, May 22, 2016

9 oz serving in a snifter.
Bright, ruby red color with great clarity. Topped off with a layer of off-white head that fades quickly. Complex nose that is filled with fruit (cherries) and sour notes. A light hint of vinegar as well. The cherry flavor is powerful without being overly sweet. Heavy sour/acidic finish. A hint of spice to it at the end, possibly from the oak Foeder aging. It's character is bold, but there is a lightness to it that keeps everything balanced and easy to drink.
A wonderful blend and a great treat. A must try if you happen to find it. I hope this comes back again in the very near future. 657 charactersJacobob10, May 02, 2016

Consumed 4/23/16
A: Pours a deep ruby red with some burnt orange tones - mostly clear - medium-large head, fades to a wispy cap, medium collar, leaves some spots of lacing
S: Juicy, big cherries - cherries are really center stage, fleshy and juicy, lightly sour, lightly tart - some additional yeasty funk and barrel funk - woody, chewy oak - just a touch of vinegar - hint of phenols - medium fruity sweetness
T: Like lightly tart, lightly sour cherry juice - some general funk with tart and mild sourness - some light hints of phenols and vinegar - some lightly bready malts at the base, touch of caramel - nicely woody, with some oak barrel funk - some lightly fruity sweetness, but not too much - still tastes fairly young, is only going to get better with time 
M: Medium body, smooth, touch of tart, lingering cherries
O: Worth reviving
This is quite lovely. Right now, it tastes young, and has so much cherry that it almost tastes like a fruit beer. This is nice to sip now and it's only going to get better. 1,063 charactersangrybabboon, Apr 24, 2016

Rating: 4.75
2016 notes: Pours deep reddish mahogany with a medium head. Nose/taste of sour cherries, little oak and a medium to heavy tartness. Needs oxidation to compete with the older examples. Overall, a great beer.

M - Mouthfeel is barely carbonated, sweet, little sticky.
O - Overall this beer was really awesome to try. Never thought I'd get to try it, tasty, though clearly past it's prime. Still, awesome.

I tasted this beer several years ago, before I was keeping track of my beers and before rating and reviewing.  I suspect that I would have graded this beer a strong 5 "back in the day."  I'm not sure it's fair to the beer to give it a score at this point.  However, it showed so well that I don't feel bad doing so.
Poured a red brick color with no head.  The nose is full rich cherry sherry.  Yes, one can still get some fruit in the nose which seems impossible but it's more than wishful thinking - it's there.  Really nice nose, really nice tart, citric body with a brightness in the mouth that all good beer should have.
Flavors are still appealing and inviting with brown sugar cherry notes and a finish of cherry and bright lime.  (Yep, for those of you from Los Angeles there was once a drink called a "cherry lime rickey" at a Beverly Hills hamburger drive-in.  The finish on this beer takes one back there with the cherry/lime finish.
All in all, and while showing some signs of oxidation, this one is still a treat to try and inviting to drink.  Thanks to Jeremy for giving me a good beer about which to write for my 6,000th on this site. 1,261 charactersGRG1313, Jun 07, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 533cl bottle poured into a Alexander flute glass. This bottle is from the first bottling produced in 1986 to commemorate the breweries 150th anniversary by naming the beer after one of it's founders. Stored in a cool wine cellar in Belgium since being purchased in the 1980s. Has a consume by date that isn't visibly marked but only goes up to 1988, now it's about 26 years old.
A- Pours a fairly translucent reddish brown with about two fingers worth of white frothy head that has excellent retention (not even considering it's age) leaving spotty white lacing along the sides of the glass and receding to a thin layer. After all these years there is still perfect carbonation with excellent consistency, even after 10 minutes sitting in the glass it hasn't died down. This beer has held up remarkably well, by appearance it doesn't even look like it's more then two years old nevermind 28 years.
S- After taking the cap off a burst of intense fruity sour cherries escapes from the bottle. Once letting it settle the cherries die down a bit but still remain very present along with some vinegar, hint of must, and very light (almost undetectable behind the cherries) cardboard oxidation in the back.
T- Very fruity tart cherries, light balanced vinegar, touch of oak and some very light cardboard oxidation that balances out the cherry sweetness, finishes with smooth balanced sweet cherry syrup flavor. The amount of cherry presence in this is absolutely insane, tastes like it was brewed a year ago nevermind 30 years ago.
M- Medium bodied, slightly syrupy, fairly minimal carbonation, very easy drinking.
O- This beer completely blew me away, I've never given a beer all 5s but this deserves that and more. The fact that this was brewed 30 years ago (aged two years in barrels before being bottled in '86) is almost unbelievable. This beer still has more of a cherry presence then most cherry fruited beers brewed only a year ago. It's a shame this isn't made anymore, however the bottles that do exist seem like they could hold up forever. Definitely seek this out if you can! 2,085 charactersjaasen64, May 02, 2014

The beer pours a nice lighter brown color tinged red with a great golden core, and a good ring of bubbly head around the glass. Nice clean look.
The smell reminds me of an apple cider farm near my parents house in north Connecticut, it has that earthy apple rind with a nice tinge of sour cherry and hints of vinegar. A very nice smell that shows no signs of oxidation or age surprisingly. 
The taste has a very warming and supple flavor, almost like a hot mulled cider with some light spice and definite apple cherry fruit notes, a nice light vanilla oak overtone presides over all. A nice touch of tartness and vinegar too that is not overpowering but compliments the fruit and malt very well. The age has actually added a very composed roundness as opposed to a mustyness which I found really pleasant. A very refined beer, it almost drinks like a fine aged red wine.
The feel is very nice, enough carbonation and enough body for the style, it's elegant and silky on the palate.
Overall I was pleasantly surprised how composed and settled this beer was, if only there was more to drink! 1,235 charactersDreadnaught33, Jan 12, 2013

Beer pours a beautiful ruddy, amber brown color with a small, but adequate, layer of white lace. The nose is amazing....sweet and sour cherries, dry oak, a slight bit of musty funk, a touch of sweet apple. The smell is absolutely sublime and very complex. The taste is sweet dark cherry with a slight bit of vinegary sourness to balance it. I also get just the right amount of barrel character, very smoothing. Everything about this beer is in perfect balance. Still perfectly carbonated for being 14 years old. This beer has held up incredibly well, and this is one of the masterpieces of brewing. This is an absolutely phenomenal sour that I wish was still in production. 729 charactersdgfair, Dec 04, 2012

Beer is nice and musky with a good tartness on the finish, a great cherry experience and I would have loved to try this fresher but I assume that this beer has held up well over time. I'd have it again for sure. 448 charactersdrabmuh, Nov 02, 2012

25cl bottle poured into namesake snifter
Vintage: 1998
Enjoyed at DHvL in early June 2012.
A: Medium burgundy. Single (khakis) fingernail head on gentle pour.
S: Mix of dark cherry, tannins, and oak. Not much else here, but very deep. Nose is quite inviting.
T: WOW - this beer is absolutely beautiful! Combination of cherry and oak. Touch of apple with hidden notes of faint vanilla too. Balance of sweet and sour is well executed and this beer is holding up quite well for being well older than a decade. Soft, smooth, and refreshing. Superb!
M: Medium bodied with low carbonation.
O: A thoroughly enjoyable beer! Very well-rounded and has withstood the age of time. A beautiful beer that I would highly recommend to anyone. Simply amazing! Wish I could drink this more often. 797 charactersspdyfire83, Jul 24, 2012
3.9/5  rDev -12.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Pours a cloudy dark amber color with a small off-white head. Much sweeter than I had expected. Lots of caramel and maple syrup. Heavy on the cherries, a bit of Maraschino cherry note to them. Oak and oxidation are also well represented. A moderate tartness, both lactic and acetic, with an almost cherry candy (Lifesavers) flavor. Fairly substantial caramel and maple sweetness on the palate as well. Nice, especially considering the beer is 16 years old. 455 characterswomencantsail, Jul 16, 2012

4.54/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle at De Heeren poured into original Rodenbach Alexander glass
Pours a full one inch head that dissipates to an uneven frothiness. Has a nice dark amber color.
Smells of dense, dark pitted cherries that aromatically is beautiful on the nose.
Wow, the flavor is again a rich dark cherry that melds wonderfully with the red, malty ale background. This has held up incredibly well as I do not detect any oxidation.
A little thin on the mouth and not quite enough carbonation to hold it well while drinking but this is to be expected considering it is about 15 years old.
Overall this is a great beer that has aged gracefully. Would love to have tried it fresh but still definitely worth seeking out, or another great reason to go to De Heeren and trying it there. 769 charactersmetalgdog, May 27, 2012

4.08/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks for opening this long-time want, Jason. I don't recall the vintage of this one; was from the '90s I believe.
Appearance: Cloudy reddish brown with a tall head that settles to a collar after a moment.
Smell: Mild nose, malty and bready with a subtle cherry element. A little acetic sourness, but it's more on the malty side. A subtle aroma overall, but pleasant. This has held up surprisingly well, I'm surprised the acetic acid hasn't taken over.
Palate: A nice mix of cherries, toasted malt and mild balsamic vinegar. Grainy, nice fruitiness. Doesn't beat you over the head with cherries, it's nicely integrated. Finishes toasty, fruity, lightly sour. A really nice easy drinking Flanders red with a subtle fruit character.
It's difficult to accurately review a beer like this in the context of a tasting, because it's a rather subtle and mild beer. If not for the rarity, I could see myself putting back a few of these in an evening. 946 characterslargadeer, Oct 20, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +9.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Transferring my tasting notes from 15 years ago so they don't get lost:
Medium carbonation creates a nice warm beige head. Rich deep garnet color with a tiny bit of haziness.
A complex aroma like dark red cherries, red delicious apples, red clay earth and a coppery metallic tang.
Medium body and slightly slick mouthfeel.
Lots of cherries and lactic tangyness in the flavor. A sourness like quinine (tonic water) and coppery metallic notes haunt the background flavors. The character of the Flemish Red Ale base stands out in the finish with an astringent dryness.
Overall impression. Bloody awesomely BIG, and good. The cherry essence is full, like those big fat ripe red ones that stain your fingers when you eat them. Combine bigtime cherries with the huge flavors and complexity of a Flemish red ale, this beer will make you take notice. This is like the roller coaster of fruited ales, where a Liefmans or Mort Subite would be the carousel. 951 charactersdfernandez77, Sep 22, 2011

dark red in color with a light tan head that came up to a height of around two inches before settling back down and leaving tons of lace all over the sides and bottom of the glass while never really falling much below the one inch level. The aroma was lightly tart, sour cherries, hints of earthy and spicy notes and even a touch of what seemed like brown sugar or something along those lines. Really very well done and quite complex. The flavor was a little less tart then what I would have liked but I have to admit was still done very well. 621 charactersmikesgroove, Aug 27, 2011

Thanks to Jason for opening this long time want.
A: Reddish brown with a fizzy white head. 
S: Lightly tart with notes of plum and grape. Moderate acetic acidity. Dash of chocolate. The grape is really strong and there's notable vinegar.
T: Lightly tart with a lower level of lactic sourness. Light citrus sweetness. Notes of apricot and vinegar with a low acetic acidity in the finish.
M: Lower medium body with upper moderate carbonation.

4.25/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle into my Cantillon wine glass. A good beer for Review #100.
Pour is a deep brown-gold color, with slight hints of ruby. Virtually no head, as most of the bubbles that arise were due to the vigor of the pour. Good clarity. 
Smell is pretty nice, I must say. Sour cherries, balsamic vinegar, a vague sweetness. Hints of random fruitiness in there too, perhaps strawberries.
Taste is better. Very nice. Perfect balance between sweet and sour, just like a good Flanders red should be. Sweet and sour cherries, raspberries, vinegar, sweet malt. Nice balance of acetic and lactic. There's a slight bit of oxidation here, but it doesn't detract much... just adds a layer of sherry complexity.
Mouthfeel - I'm going to dock it a little bit, but not too much because of the age of the bottle. It would have been better to have a few more bubbles, which would have lightened the load considerably. As it is, it's a bit heavy on the palate... but only just.
Overall - Really great experience, honestly. This bottle is about 14 years old, I think, and it's held up really well. It's a travesty that this isn't brewed anymore, because it's probably a better beer than any other Rodenbach offering around today. If this beer is as good as I think it is when it's fresh, I would have it on hand all the time. 1,320 charactersdavod23, Mar 23, 2011

This is called Rodenbach Alexander, in that order, not vice versa. Bottle, thanks Henrik! Pours a deep reddish brown with a nice soapy tan head. Cool color and look. Extremely vinegarish on the nose, so much so that it's difficult to pull out anything else. Some essence of wet wood and cherries floating about. Whoa, what a powerful, strange mix of flavors. Red wine vinegar, oak, deeply rich malt. Sweet cherries and oak unfold. Really strange, lovely progression. Endlessly complex. Deep, earthy, and a bit herbal. Almost hard to take the intensity of this. Perfectly bubbly, fine carbonation, sharp enough but soft enough. This is incredibly unique, much more complex and diverse than any Flanders Red, and more deep and rich than any sour I've had. Cherries and raspberries really start to come out as it warms. Killer stuff, absolutely blows everything else by Rodenbach out of the water. 906 charactersJAXSON, Dec 09, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 412oz bottle, 1 of 2 to be opened tonight (courtesy of Sean9689 & jrallen34). Big appreciation, for a long time I didn't think I'd actually get to try this, and all at once 2 bottles show up.
It pours a reddish copper, with minimal foam after a vigorous pour. Spotty bits of wet foam on the glass.
The aroma is obscene, sweet and vinegary at the same time. Cherries, maybe other dark fruit, and sweet liqueur.
Excellent taste also, not quite like any Flanders Red I've had before. I heard they last made this in 1998, so maybe the age is slightly responsible for the difference. Nice sweet notes up front with lasting cherry and sherry in the aftertaste. I had a small pour from 2 bottles but I could have easily gone for much more. 734 charactersTurdFurgison, Dec 04, 2010

A - Pours a light pink/reddish, nice thin cap, some good lacing along the sides of the glass, and some whisps on here and there.
S - Sweet cherries, caramel, slight tart/sour, some oak. The cherries are so awesome they really just take over the beer. So good!
T - Cherries, sugary sweetness, some oak, slight sour/tart notes. This is so good and I'm surely not going to be able to describe it in words. The cherry notes are just amazing.
M - Light, good carbonation, dry finish.

4.25/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Cheers to Sean and Jason for providing this at my Bachelor Weekend tasting.
A - Brown beer with some beautiful red notes. Small, off white head that receded quite quickly to a ring on the sides.
S - Big ripe cherry smell that is not overly sweet, and a distinct carmel sweetness that separates itself from the cherry smell. Little bit of vinegar if you look for it.
T - Carmel sugars, with a great cherry taste. It's a sweet beer, but it's not cherry sweet, which would make it seem artificial. A very candy-like taste that manages to not be cloying at all.
M - Smooth, a little syrupy, but I think it works well for this beer. Not a ton of carbonation, medium bodied, but feels very fleshed out.
D - This is a great sipper, I think some could down this quite easily, but the sweetness in it to me makes it one you should take time with. Very good beer. 858 charactersAgentZero, Dec 04, 2010

Pretty funny the $2.99 price tag is still on this one and now it is really hard to get. Wish I would have bought a lot of it back then! Pours a reddish clear color with a nice slight white head that is slow to settle. Lots of aromas in the nose, including cherry, caramel, vanilla, toffee, and vanilla. Actually smells quite sweet. The taste is really nice as well with a more sweet than sour overall flavor. Malty, grape, cherry, oak, and vanilla are all present in this one. Medium mouthfeel. Overall, I was really surprised how sweet this was for the age and also how well it has held up. Very easy drinking with no real presence of alcohol.

A. Really just looks like regular Rodenbach... nutty brown-red and not totally clear. A tiny bit of head, spotty lace. No surprises.
S. Big, open, sweet nose. Balsamic vinegar, soft cherry, oak. Very complimentary. No oxidization or off notes as far as I can tell - this simply smells fresh and good, if pretty similar to normal Rodenbach, oh well.
T. Hmm... fresh? Not sure how, but this really doesn't taste aged. No sherry notes, or old must, or flatness, or raging tartness. Everything is still well balanced twixt the cherry-oak-vinegar-sweet. Flavorful, enjoyable. I'm not sure what I was expecting... but aside from being a little richer and more blended, this is pretty much a standard... oh, you get the idea.
M / D. Low carbonation, but there. Dryish finish, sweet red cherry wine, quite nice. Nothing wrong here.
A fascinating beer, and one that I want to know the provenance of. I desperately want to know how this was stored, because as far as I can tell, age has simply left this one well alone. A fine Flanders Red, but not one that I'd go out of my way to acquire again, due to the scarcity. 1,289 characterskkipple, Sep 29, 2010

The beer poured a clear ruby-brown color without much of a head. Beer remains fizzy with bubbles running through the body of the beer. For a 15 year old bottle, there was quite a bit of carbination in the bottle. Though it's my first time trying it, those sharing the bottle with me claimed that it's "exactly the same as what it was ten years ago.." 
It smells of cherries with a vineous quality. Aroma is mostly of cherries and some woody oak. Tastes almost like it smells--tart with explosive sweet cherry flavor with some apple cider vinegar... a great balance of sweet and sour. At 6.5% ABV astringency is quite low. It's very different from Rodenbach's current offerings. Texture is rich and creamy. Extremely satisfying and refreshing. Some of the best beer I've ever had. 854 charactersshaunt0000, Jul 13, 2010

A - Pours with a thin wisp of foam that settles to a ring and haze. Only a few spots of lace are left behind. Transparent red-orange color.
S - More sweet and malt-forward than I expected after all these years. Somehow this still pops, with oaky vanilla, sour cherry, balsamic vinegar, and lactic sour notes. Very well balanced in all the flavor domains.
T - Taste is more tart, with sour and sweet flavors moving to the periphery. There's some tart apple in there as well. Wonderful integration, with no single element becoming overbearing or fatiguing. Some how there isn't any perceptible oxidation in this 12+-year old bottle.
M - Low carbonation, smooth medium body, and a lightly dry finish. Could have used a bit more spritz, but I won't be overly hard due to the age on this one.
D - Why did they stop making this? It's awesome. This would be a superb Belgian session sour if you could actually buy it. 1,019 charactersMasterSki, Jun 21, 2010

Very clear Orange/red.... not much of a head.
Aroma is incredibly complex mix of very balanced sweet and sour... cherries come out in full force with some mild acetic character. 
Flavor mirrors the nose with again a near perfect balance.... tons of cherries dominate from front to the back where a vinegar note shows and dries out... oak shows on later pours.. I wrote "red apple", but honestly don't remember that much now... maybe something to do with the sweetness and growing tannins as it really opened up.
Not alot of carbonation, but it was there and helped lean the mouthfeel toward a smoothness with just hints of bubbles that get zinged by the acids.
I could drink this stuff by the liter... there was sooo much going on, but my notes failed to get much more... thanks again Eric... Very impressive beer and impressed that you would share such a sought after wonder.

I heard a carbonation pop when I opened it! I'm very happy about that!
Appearance: Pours a transparent garnet brown with honey folds. The head is off white but minimal and it recedes quickly leaving no lace. Still more lively and vibrant than I was expecting on a 24 year old beer!
Smell: Amazing bouquet consisting of a perfect blending of malt and cherries, a hint of lightly charred barrel, and the faintest vinous note. 
Taste: Oh my god this is so incredibly sublime! Cherry sweetness, malt sweetness, with underlying charred barrel and a hint of salt coupled with a whisper of oxidation. The lactic quality presents itself in the finish. This is just amazingly balanced. The sweetness and the sourness are so melded.
Mouthfeel: Body is on the heavy side of light with an enjoyable but spritzy carbonation. 
Drinkability: I'm about to drink this bottle in less than 10 minutes. It is incredibly drinkable.

Very thin head atop a clear amber body. Red-shaded, but only a little.
Aroma was of berries and cherries, and quite vinous. This was actually one of the first beers I had that had a vinous character, so unfortunately I did not get too much of the character down.
Aroma was sweet and fruity, mostly cherries but some berry character as well. Light and vinous. A touch of sourness. Overall, quite good.
Mouthfeel was light and crisp, and it gave me a little bit of a pucker. Nice.
Drinkability - I wish I had gotten several of these to lay down and try over time. Alas, at that time, I was only cellaring a few things (1994 Triple Bock, some Thomas Hardy's.) 683 charactersconnecticutpoet, Mar 31, 2009

Aroma is a mouthwatering mix of sweet fruit, tart cherry, oak-aged red wine, and earth. 
Flavor is outstanding. A sweet and sour blend of cherry and oak, with vineous yeast and light earthy funkiness. Incredibly smooth and well-rounded with age, this is utterly delicious. The oak aged character of toasty vanilla and leather comes out as the elixer warms.
Mouthfeel is slick and creamy, with light carbonation and a slickery tart mouthfeel. Impossibly drinkable, my sample disappeared in no time. I really wish the brewery would revive this legendary beer. 618 charactersAlexJ, Dec 19, 2007

4.82/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I picked up this bottle in a trade about a year back. I loved the old Rodenbach and then when it came back a few years ago I was glad to see it. I had been waiting to try the Alexander for awhile and felt like last night was the time.
The beer poured a cloudy, deep brown/amber color with no head but some nice bubbles running through the body. There was a slight white island in the middle of the glass that ran away rather quickly. 
The nose was a nice mix of funk and tartness, almost brandy like. The taste seemed very fresh although the bottle was a few years old. There was a nice tart and somewhat sweet mix to this beer that was excellent. The body had a bit of carbonation to it so it was not flat but not overly carbonated, seemed to be the right amount. The body was medium and the taste this beer leaves in the mouth is truely enjoyable. I wish this beer was still readily available as I would scoop up more if I could. I was expecting alot for this one and was not let down at all. 1,000 charactersggaughan, Mar 18, 2007
4.4/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Originally reviewed November 23, 2006. Crisp saltine aroma, heavy on raspberry champagne vinegar. Very refined and tawny, edges of sherry. Many dripping cherry notes, with sweet crisp juices and dry pits. Very elegant and silky, but seems a little reserved and almost too straightforward (keeping it down 0.2 in the aroma). Flavor is damn near insanity. Its pure lubricious delight of all kinds of cherries, schaarsbeekse, montmortenci, rainier and Door County. All sweet, bright and lucious and right in front of me. So unique and rich. A truly original coalescence of creative flourish and tangy delight. The sharpy sour notes are incredibly enlightening, with blending notes of astringent fire. The palate and finish could have had a little more moment, except that tis sweetness paris with the crisp cutting acidit to create nice balance and increasingly dry finish. Distant hop cone thoughts. The oak really brings some nice touches of vanilla cherry sugars. Overall, a true masterpiece and a crying shame that its no longer produced. 1,045 charactersCharlesDarwin, Dec 19, 2006

Pours out of the bottle a dullish brown, much less red in color than I had expected. A surprising and flourishing head is produced, but leaves absolutely no lace or cling.
Nose is full of tart, acidic cherries.
Taste is much more of the same. This is one of those beers that I can't really add much to what the label's description offers, "tart, vinous, fruity, and with a tang".
Mouthfeel is predictably tart, and oddly refreshing for a beer of this sort. My dad said it tasted like an aged wine cooler.
Completely untouched by age. Might have held out another decade! 847 charactersGreenWBush, May 18, 2006

Pours clear ruby, with brown tinting, and an off- white head.
Retention is momentary at best, leaving only dots of foam, settling to 360 degree crescent, with an oasis of thin froth dead center.
Auditorily effervescent, prickly to the ear.
Cherry juice and cider vinegar up front in the nose.
Musty boards follow quickly, and cracked pepper.
Aromatics finish warm, zesty, and acidic.
Slickish mouthfeel, puckering and a bit syrupy.
Bitter and salty start the pallet, with a surge of crushed sour cherries becoming dominant.
A warming spiceyness comes forward, alongside some drying tannins. Hints of asian spice and cedar planks.
Vineousity takes main stage as the puckering acids and sweet juice fade.
Doesn't truly "finish" in any sense, as the brew has made an indelible mark on the back of the tongue.
I could not even guess how many years Alexander will continue to improve. 906 charactersbrewandbbq, Mar 12, 2006

pours a murky dark brown with tight, luxurious ring of satiny bubbles crowning the brew. murky and muddy, but intriguing. tiny bubbles lace the glass. aroma is woody, rich with port wine and other brisk vinous notes. aged. mild hints of apricot, apple and pear evolve with warming in the nose... perhaps different variations on what my mind thinks is 'cherry'. raw vanilla and clove spice things up a bit along with underripe tannins. expecting a blast of sweet stille nachtness, i am surprised by a crisp, hearty tang. loads and loads of sour cherry and even some dark corn syrup flavors here. finishes with leathery resin that carries the tartness and puckers the cheeks causing intense salivation. yeasty. perfectly smooth body of medium heft and just enough carbonation to kick some life into it and balance the sourness. intense and desserty without being anywhere close to overbearingly sweet, dry, or funky. absolutely a world class beer and one that i will have at any given opportunity. don't think a flanders red can get any better than this particular example. cheers, good luck finding this beer.

Well thanks to some serious begging and pleading, I was given the opportunity to try this beer one more time. The beer pours a brilliantly clear ruby-cherry-red color with barely a wisp of a head. The sediment was so compacted in the bottle that I was able to pour the entire liquid contents out with nary a speck of sediment. The aroma smells strongly of enticing cherry with a mix of sweet cherry meat, tannic cherry skin, and a tart acetic note that melds so well with it all. My first impression, this has lost a lot of the sweetness up front, but quickly gains a rich meaty, malty cherry skin note to it. The finish is lightly tannic with a slightly puckering note to it that is a combination of wood and a tart-sour character.
This beer has held up far better than the Pre-Palm Rodenbach Grand Cru. The cherry, it seems, has acted as a preserving influence. This really grabs the palate towards the end, it is mouth coating and malty with a very nice interplay between rich malt and cherry notes. As it warms up a bit the acetic light vinegar note really starts to come forward. The cherry note almost gets bigger (though not in a cloying or expressive way) and sort of spreads itself throughout the beer. What an incredibly well balanced beer this has turned into. The finish is long and gripping with notes of tannic cherry skin, yet still satisfyingly fruity with lots of cherry meat and a bit of balsamic character. This is quite exquisite, I so would love to have more of this. I find it really hard to not give this beer a really high score, it was very enjoyable, and the sweet cloying cherry character has really dropped out, just the opportunity to try this beer is almost a perfect experience. 1,733 charactersGueuzedude, Sep 01, 2005
4.7/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in the 330 mL bottle, into a goblet. The color is a dark amber, with a wispy head. The smell is a subdued tartness. The taste is very cherry sweet, with a more mellow tartness than other Flemish Reds (remarkable aging, though I haven't had this one young), and a remarkable complexity. Mouthfeel is very smooth and velvety. As for drinkability, though I won't be able to find another bottle, if I could, I would love to have tons of these.
Thank you to the Sharp Edge for putting these dandies out for sale, and as a great bargain at only $20! Though I don't know if I'll ever have another Rodenbach Alexander, I'm just thrilled that I got the chance to have this one. 678 charactersbeergeek279, May 13, 2004

Small sticky off-white head. Aroma is very vinous, sweet cherries in abundance, well defined with obvious oak aged character that I love. Downright excellence in here, makes you wish you could bathe in one of Rodenbach's legendary oak casks. Nose also deploys light tartness and a bit of brown sugar. Great taste, very refreshing, full-flavoured cherries, very sweet and tart at the same time. You actually feel the seeds and branches a bit which is surprising considering that they used a cherry extract to my knowledge. Tons of oak, just lovely. This is a glorious meeting, but I must confess it could be a bit drier to fit my tastes perfectly, they've already done that with the grand cru though! Great tart aftertaste with more barrel character being revealed, this seems to support age wonderfully and shows no signs of fatigue for those still holding on some bottles, wonderfully lactic still. Thin-medium body, just appropriate and supported by medium carbonation. There is no way any good reason exists and is sufficient to end the production of this fine beer. RIP Alex. 1,218 charactersRastacouere, Apr 05, 2004
4.72/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I felt it was time to open my last remaining bottle from the early 90's. It pours a reddish / copper color with a thick off white head. The aroma is extremely noticeable before the nose even approaches the glass. A unique sour cherry and mild maltiness sends the nose sensors into overdrive. 
The flavor is tough to describe. A slightly tart and sour cherry flavor hits the tongue immediately, but fades to a soft malty finish. The beer seems to put a protective coating on the tongue that last for a few seconds. 
The mouthfeel is tingling at the start but smooths out during the finish. The tartness / sourness lingers very softly. This was one of the best aged beers I have ever had. Truely an incredible beer. 719 charactersGavage, Feb 07, 2004

It pours a light reddish-brown color with half a finger of large bubble foam. There is only a little lace left on the glass. The smell is full of sour cherries and apple, very fruity. A good malty aroma as well. The taste has just a slight mustiness to it at first, then tart cherries and a hint of alcohol. The finish is very mellow. The mouthfeel is just a tad oily. The drinkability is fairly nice. A good Belgian red! 469 charactersSheepNutz, Nov 07, 2003
4.47/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This was a 1985 vintage bottle sampled at La Bier Circus in Brussells, Oct 2003.
Appearance: Served in a large wine glass this beer had a deep mohagany pour with almost no head whatsoever.
Smell: The nose is just bursting with dark, ripe cherries but it seems the highlight here might be the heavy dose of dark & rich sour plums that counter-balance the cherry sweetness nicely.
Taste: A huge fruit sweetness up front highlighted again by cherry and plum. The fruity sweetness is nicely balanced by an oaky tartness and a nice acidity level.
Mouthfeel: the sweet n sour smooth mouthfeel leaves a satified palate.
Drinkability: A great beer. Like many aged beers there are similarities with fine port...dark, rich fruit. woddy notes. sweetness & tartness all at once. But to know a beer can change over time and increase in complexity is an exciting feeling. 872 charactersPopsinc, Nov 06, 2003
5/5  rDev +12.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sampled at the Kulminator in Antwerp, BE. This was a 1995 (?) vintage, as this beer is no longer produced. The aromas are that of the familiar regular Rodenbach or Grand Cru, except that this version of good ole' Rodenbach is filled with cherry essence. The taste is like Rodenback with cherries added, and that's exactly what this beer is. The mouthfeel is perfect and the drinkability is excellent!
I recently had a 1997 vintage at the Beer Circus. Damn this shit is good. Rodenbach with a cherry explosion on top. Try some! Now!
Pre-palm vintage is almost opaque brown in colour. Small off-white head that leaves nice lacing. Aromas are more funky, and less cherry-ish, but excellent, none-the-less. The taste is very lactic, sour, acidic, and beautiful. Mouthfeel is sharp and vinous and drinkability is awesome. I'd guess that this is a 93 bottle...still extremely complex and imminenlty drinkable after a good long nap. To bad these run like $25 around here if you can find them these days! 1,002 charactersfrancisweizen, Nov 05, 2003

4.69/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Presentation: A bottle that was blindly purchased at the Stuffed Sandwich, San Gabriel, California for $7.50 during the Stone Brewing Event on the 25th July 2003. It had the new gold edged style white label which the Alexander sported in its latter years of existence.
Appearance: Dark brown copper color that poured with a good inherent carbonation. Full of life. Off-white colored head that was large & rocky in places. Has good staying power. Tremendous levels of dissolved carbon dioxide add vitality to the beer when swirled.
Nose: The odors tell you this beer should be cherry red - such is the fruitiness that the cherry essence adds to this beer. 
Taste: Gorgeous cherries drowned in sour red ale that complement each other like sweet and sour, dark & light, up & down. They are opposites, yet this synergistic beer is so much more than the sum of its component parts. Tartness spikes here & there, it comes & goes like the sweetness. A real mish-mash of extreme flavors that just works so well.
Mouthfeel: Above average feel, complicated by the battle between the sweet & sour aspects. Sweet, yet dry & tartly sour at times. A bit of a roller coaster at times. It improves no end with additional aging I find.
Drinkability: Every time I have a bottle of this wonder, I always tipped it upside-down, at least twice to make absolutely sure that I never leave any beer in the bottle. Suffice it to say, I find this Ale extremely drinkable & mourn its passing every time.
Overall: A totally unique blend of cherry essence & sour red ale that just simply works for me. Hard to describe & often loathed by some, hell even ridiculed by some so-called Belgium Beer Experts, but I enjoy it for what it is (was!)  a truly unique beer. The Alexander is the Rodenbach Grand Cru with just cherry essence added. Simply that, a Cherry 'flavored' Flemish Red Ale. It definitely worked well in its time, & many of my drinking friends from England dearly loved this beer, so often we would all order a round whenever we found it on our Easter Trips to Belgium. Alexander Rodenbach only ever represented a low single figure percentage of the Breweries overall production. Whether it was truly an inconvenience to produce, or simply never given the support it so dearly deserved and never properly marketed  whatever the reason; this marvelous one of a kind beer, is so dearly missed by this Belgium beer fan. I so wish I had stashed away a few bottles of this when I had the chance to do so.

5/5  rDev +12.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had one bottle of this beer sitting in a sealed box in my closet waiting for a special day; but then I happened across 2 more bottles at a local store that had recently remodelled and temporarily hidden their Belgian beers. I broke one out this evening to re-sample one of my all-time favorite brews.
The color is of a rich, lacquered piece of mahogony -- deep brown with hints of red when even the thinnest light hits it. The reddish tint is unique, as I understand it, to Rodenbach among the oud bruin beers. This particular sour ale is exceptional as it's blended with cherries, as it states on the bottle. The dance of the light is just such a treat compared to the cloudier, more opaque visual presented by beers like Goudenband. Anyhow, there's little to no head on this beer as the bubbly, soda-like head disappears quickly. A *very* thin lace sticks to the sides of the glass with each sip, however.
Obvious aromas of some sort of cherry vinegarette salad dressing -- slightly tart but very richly sweet like Michigan black cherries. This has most potpourris beat, hands down.
The taste is of dried cherries -- lightly sour with an intensely sweet cherry flavor. It begins with a heavy sweetness and finishes with a crisp acidity similar to that of other Flemish browns/reds or lambics. The body is fairly thin, but the beer is nonetheless powerful and the flavors intense.
I could drink this beer all night. It's exceptional. 1,448 charactersmarburg, Apr 28, 2003
3.2/5  rDev -28.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Acquired a couple bottles of this from a trade. Pours a ruddy dark amber with a medium thin light tan head. Thin lacing. Aroma is just waiting to burst like a mob of Saturday morning shoppers waiting at the doors for a store to open during a big sale. Strong sherry, citrus, apple and grapes almost overwhelm. Unfortunately my first impression of the flavor reminded me of a cheap screw-top wine like Boone's. Sour and fruity with a light effervescent character. I am glad I got to try it as this is an interesting and complex beer, but honestly I don't think I would get it again if I had the chance. 601 charactersDogbrick, Mar 31, 2003
4/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bubbly head, and deep, dark cherry red color. Aroma is loud and sweet, projecting a fierce cherry flavor far and wide. Sour cherries! Tantalizing, lively. Not a kriek lambic, but merely a "sour ale" flavored with "cherry essence." And that's just the thing. It's simple and consistent. You get sour, you get cherry. I like it, and I can imagine it as an excellent dessert treat, but it's not the sort of thing you can imagine drinking very often. 446 charactersfeloniousmonk, Feb 12, 2003

4.35/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer pours a beautiful deep scarlet red color.  A slight tan head dwindles quickly and soon just rims the glass.   A sour mash like smell is perceived on the nose.  The tartness of this beer can be smelled.  This beer has a very light body. Drinking this is almost like drinking a liquid version of the green apple taffy/candy.  It's very unique and there are both sweet and sour characteristics.  The sour properties seem to win in my mouth.   Vinegar like presence is detected although balanced pretty effectively. 
 I definitely prefer the New Glarus Belgium Red over this brew.  (I gave the Belgian Red from NG a 4.9.)  I realize that they are a bit different beer styles, but as for the few beers I've tried with cherries in them, NG is outstanding and this one is pretty good. 790 charactersBighuge, Aug 03, 2002

If the news I heard about its impending lack of availability in the US is true, I'm really glad that one of my friends picked up a bottle on our last trip to Tennesse (couldn't buy the stuff in Georgia anyway since it's over 6%). The sad part was that I didn't buy any for my self. It's got a dark ruby color. Both the smell and taste are sweet, sour and very cherry. It reminds me of a fruit lambic with the tartness, actually. A very, very good beer. 479 charactersaracauna, Mar 26, 2002
4.84/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Presentation: 11.2 oz brown bottle with a white foiled top, no freshness date though a tart beer like this will stay for months if not years.
Appearance: Bright mahogany colour with a light tan lace to boot, sediment in the bottle stayed well packed even when the bottle was totally poured out.
Smell: Sweet aroma of bing and black cherries, big fruity tart back ground with an odd yet light tobacco smell.
Taste: Smooth on the palate with a huge puckering tartness, not sour bit tart because as soon as it comes in it leaves to let a flipside of flavours in. Tartness holds the fruit, the fruit of sweet then quickly to sour cherries that bring on the tartness. Hops are belittled and are nearly non-existent but this is par for the style. As soon as the tartness subsides a sweet vanilla flavour sneaks in with a quick flash of malt also within the undertones of earth and wood. Dry without a doubt, especially the finish and the finish is pretty clean.
Notes: This is the in comparison to what wine drinkers would want in a complex top notch wine, guess what it&#8217;s a beer. Complex is not the word for this beer, better than wine is bold and fitting.
After an eight day trip to Belgium this beer makes me feel all fuzzy and warm. Then I realize that I am in America and have to pay two to three times the $$$ for the same beer just to drink it at home and not in a warm and inviting cafe or beer bar in Brugge. :-( 1,436 charactersJason, Oct 19, 2001
