L-thick, black, motor oil, nice lacing, minimal head...one of the thickest beers I have had
S/T-wow this is amazing.  the barrel alone without adjuncts is unbelieveable.  The bourbon, VANILLA-y oak, and barrel come through exceptionally well
F-thick, oily, amazing
Overall-I am amazing at how different these BA DLs are compared to the base.  The barreling is outstanding at Floyd's and maybe even underrated (if possible) based on how the gen pop seems to feel about the base DL (which I still enjoy).  This is for sure underrated as it definitely held its own with BVDL and FVM.  AMAZING!!! 666 charactersrabbott2, Dec 15, 2016
4.34/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a snifter. An opaque bark brown color with a thin dark tan head. Little retention and lacing. A big whiff of chocolate and vanilla on the first sniff. Some bourbon and roasted malt. The taste followed with sweet vanilla, chocolate, candied sugar, and whisky. A very thick, viscous drink. Well-balanced but heavy and sweet. Definitely a sipper with friends. Great brew. 380 charactersBuck89, Dec 12, 2016

It's insanely sweet and the barrel aging does little to counteract this. Was extremely excited to try this and severely let down. Not sure why it's rated so high to be honest. Almost tastes like a wine/liqueur than a beer. 302 charactersDrel, Oct 23, 2016

O: This was a decadent boozy and sweet treat. I really enjoyed this one - even though it was a 2012 bottle, the BA Dark Lord still retained a certain high ABV-forward profile, but was equally matched with its sweet and flavorful taste profile. This is a gorgeous variant of a heralded stout in the beer world and should be relished accordingly. Beautifully done. 605 charactersFireman_RK, Apr 03, 2016

4.51/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Ben for sharing this. Incredibly sweet and fruity from the nose to the taste. It does go overboard on the sweetness, but the fruit character is amazing. It has all the dark fruit normally associated with imperial stout like raisins and especially figs, but it goes beyond that to blend in brighter fruit flavors like apple and cherry that really make it pop. I checked the bottle to make sure this was the bourbon version and not Portuguese brandy. All of that fruit shows in the slight reddish hue of the pour and blends perfectly with the chocolate and molasses flavors. This never gets tart and you never feel like the fruit is taking the place of other stout flavors. I don't get a lot of barrel character or bourbon and the booze is barely noticeable considering the abv. The mouth feel is full but super smooth at the same time. I wish it had more barrel character and less sweetness, but it's so rich and smooth and full of complex fruit flavors. 963 charactersdanh53, Oct 24, 2015

I was skeptical about it as I think the regular Dark Lord is way to cloying and needs a couple years to mellow in the bottle. But the BBA DL I enjoyed was a 2015 bottle at Kane on 8/14/15 and boy was it amazing. Was still a little sweet  but killed it in every aspect. A lot of great dark fruit flavors melded extremely well with the bourbon barrel aging! 419 charactersthampel09, Aug 19, 2015

Appearance - Viscous black body.  Small khaki head.  Thin collar.
Smell - Very nutty.  Dark chocolate.  Not much distinct bourbon.  Lots of sugar.  Not quite soy sauce, but it's close to that.
Taste - Outrageously sweet.  Caramel.  Dark chocolate.  I get some bourbon here, but it's still not a standout flavor.  That pseudo-soy-sauce flavor sneaks in into the finish.
Mouthfeel - Heavy and sweet.  Medium low carbonation and tingly carbonation.
Overall - This just isn't pleasant to drink.  Absurdly sweet.  Quite a struggle. 602 charactersAlieniloquium, May 26, 2015

Vintage 2012
#68/688
650th BA rating, 630th BA review, and #96 out of the top 100 that I began ticking away at a few years ago.  Only 4 more to go!
A big thanks to rjjhoffman for sending this long time want over in a trade.
A: Opaque black with some browning on the edges and 1 fingers width of mocha colored head.  Head dissipates down quickly and leaves essentially no lacing, but some alcohol legs.  4.25
S: Lots of sweetness, lots of booze, and big barrel notes.  Chocolate fudge, fusel ethanol, subtle dark fruits.  Barrel notes include a fairly big bourbon charred oak, and a peat like character. Lots going on, and very nice.  A bit too boozy perhaps.  4.5
T: Huge sweetness, particularly upfront.  Its a sugary, syrup sweetness, which   would be a bit much, but it fades quickly and nicely into some absolutely wonderful flavors or charred oak, roasted malt and chocolate. Tons of bourbon barrel notes, which complement the otherwise cloying sweetness of regular Dark Lord. Some boozy ethanol to round out for palate profile.   Its simply fantastic.  4.75
M/D: Full bodied, carbonation very low which is appropriate, its smooth but is a bit syrupy, ABV is noticeable but its not hot.  Drinkability is good, all things considered. 4.5
O: Overall, this is a great beer.  I can confidently say that I’ve never had a beer which was so significantly improved by barrel aging.  I am not a big fan of regular Dark Lord, but the Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord is wonderful.  Definitely worth seeking out.  Looking forward to someday landing a BVDL for comparison.  Merry Christmas! 4.75 1,621 characterszac16125, Dec 25, 2014

Pours very dark brown near black oil, very minimal heavily burnt over-roasted head.  Oily consistency in the glass.
Smooth sweet aroma of port, umami-soy sauce, vanilla, dark chocolate, sweet oak, dark fruits and a touch of bourbon.  Tastes follows the nose well - a lot of port, umami, dark fruit and chocolate.  Very nice sweet vanilla and booze on the finish. Very vanilla forwards as it warms.  
Beast of a beer, drinks like a port - kind of strange liquor.  Do not pick up on nearly as much bourbon as I anticipated and hoped for, but it still works well.  I anticipated this being much richer in espresso and dark chocolate considering the 2011 is the base.  The PVW was significantly better 708 characterstimc100, Sep 06, 2014

L- opaque black with a tan head
S - very rich with dark chocolate, coffee, caramel, boozy bourbon, toffee, toasted grain, vanilla, oak

Thanks Adam for trading me this delicious beer. Poured into a Three Floyds teku glass today, 3/22/2014 as part of our celebratory whale tasting that's celebrating success and prolonged friendships. Cheers guys!
No better beer to meet the milestone of beer #800 and review #500!
App- Pitch black body, similar to the base Dark Lord, minimal half-finger mocha head with very good retention, not much lacing.
Smell- Holy moly! Lots of sweet brown sugar, vanilla (from the barrel), port sweetness, milk chocolate, charred malts, roast body, even a bit of coffee. This is a beautiful smelling, very complex nose that is about 90% of what Murda'd Out smells like. So decadent smelling. It's almost as good smelling as BVDL, though I really enjoyed the even more marshmallow bourbon-forward nature of BVDL.
Flavour- Falls a little bit short of the nose, very very diabeetus sweet like the base Dark Lord, yet complemented with a nice sweet bourbon flavour, some strong oak vanilla (which comes about a quarter of the way to replicating BVDL's vanilla bomb), charred malts, brown sugar, molasses, dark fruits. This is a very complex beer here, and you have to take your time drinking this to savor all the nuances of this beer. Basically, this is a Dark Lord beer with a nice barrel vanilla contribution with a splash of bourbon. This was very good, but I expected more bourbon presence.
Mouthfeel- Thick bodied, creamy, just the right carbonation, so sweet yet so drinkable. I could have domed this beer. Zero ABV heat.
Overall- Very enjoyable tasting experience. A lot of complexity despite its sugary sweetness. I do think the bourbon would have been more present had this been drank at a younger age. As with the contrasting experiences between '12 and '13 BVDL, it's clear that any bourbon-barrel aged Dark Lord beers should be drank fresher. Regardless, I really enjoyed this beer! 1,963 charactersStevedore, Mar 23, 2014

A- Dark brown. Lacing is sticky. When I bob the glass left and right, the lacing sticks. Good retention. 
S- Bourbon, dark fruit/fig, molasses, light woody oak hint in the back. I am getting soy sauce in this too. ha
T- This has more of the base beer character than the vanilla. Very sweet, almost comes off as rum because of the sweet base beer. I know that people say that the ba DL's shed their sweet DL characteristics. I am not getting that much here. I enjoyed vanilla a lot more. I am getting a lot of that sweet soy characteristic. 
M- This is the shining part of this beer for me. Not the category that I want my Bourbon DL to shine, but it is what it is. Nice and chewy. Viscous
O- I was a bit disappointed with this variant. I have only had vanilla, but I am excited to try the other variants. 861 charactersgueuzedreg, Dec 09, 2013

I was hooked once I caught the bourbon aromatics escaping the bottle upon opening it up. The nose picked up cococa, roast, chocolate, vanilla, light coffee, faint cherries, molasses and, of course, bourbon. The flavors refected the same attributes that the aroma picked up in addition to some brown sugar. This was incredibly smooth and dangerously easy-drinking. Full-bodied mouthfeel and the finishe was a smooth roast bitter. What a treat! 495 charactersCuriousMonk, Jul 22, 2013

Dark chocolate, short of jet black, with a modest dark tan head that abates quickly to a resilient collar.
Decent amounts of burnt toast, tarry volatile barrel notes, woody liquorice, vanilla and coconut. Doesn't hint at what's to come.
Unabashedly decadent. Choc-caramel slice, big-time vanilla fudge, chocolate mud cake. Dessert in a glass.
Thick and viscous but super smooth. Zero, repeat zero hint of booze. Unreal.
Utterly transformative barrel-aged treatment of a base beer that I ordinarily don't care for at all. The barrel reins in and smoothes out the sickly excesses of regular Dark Lord brilliantly. 695 charactersspicelab, Jul 14, 2013
4.62/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle, 2012 vintage with red wax, poured into a Three Floyds Mini Snifter.
The beer pours like thick motor oil, deep black in color, hues of cola brown with a thick khaki head that sticks around for a brief moment and leaves no lace or film behind. The aroma is of wonderful barrel presence, soft and subtle bourbon, chocolate, rich, sweet grain, soft char and some potent astringency from the alcohol. The flavors are superb, lots of soft bitter chocolate, bourbon, charred oak and vanilla, nice marshmallow hints with dark grain and dark pitted stone fruit at the finish. The body is remarkably smooth, rich and coats the mouth well. It finishes with a lovely creamy touch and a nice warming sensation as it goes down. 
Verdict: A really spectacular take on Dark Lord. This beer is sweet, very sweet but still remarkably balanced and extremely complex. This was by far my favorite Dark Lord variant of the 2012 or 2013 sets and one of the more exemplary takes on the barrel aged stouts. 997 characterskevanb, Jul 14, 2013

At a tasting hosted by Mulder1010 who kindly provided this I was totally unaware of what this beer was in my glass. Not wearing my glasses, and evening room light, meant it was a blind taste.
However, quite simply one of the most flavoursome and complex beers (the barrel effect was amazing) it has been my pleasure to drink. I did guess it had to be highly rated, and thought 'Top 10' but I was not quite expecting it to be where it was tho, on the 'other' beer site...
World Class, and then some.... 528 charactersheygeebee, Jul 07, 2013

Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, vanilla, bourbon, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa and vanilla flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roasty and woody bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with some nice barrel aged aromas and flavors. 685 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jun 03, 2013

From a 750 into a snifter
2012 vintage
Bottle 197 of 685
APPEARANCE: Just like all the rest of them. Pours relatively clear for an imperial stout. Produces a small, one finger medium-looking head that quickly fades to a wisp and ring. Black body in the glass with some carbonation evident. Only a ring remains until the end and leaves no real lacing down the glass. A little too light a pour and an average head at best. 
SMELL: Pretty bold nose of bourbon barrel, oak and caramel notes. Some sweet cream and light vanilla from the barrel as well. Hints of molasses and dark chocolate from the base Dark Lord as well, but this is more about the bourbon barrel, thankfully enough. Pretty nice actually. Impressed. 
TASTE: A bit hot up front perhaps, but the bourbon barrel, oak, vanilla and sweet cream from the barrel is very enjoyable. A big and persistent finish of sweet molasses, caramel, a hint of dark chocolate and some bitter coffee from the 2011 base beer, as well as lots of bourbon and oak flavors from the barrel as well. Lots of barrel flavors, meshing well with the normally overly sweet Dark Lord base beer. These two players compliment each other surprisingly well. 
PALATE: Slightly lighter than the base beer, but still big enough. Just like the other DL variants as well. Medium body with medium levels of carbonation. Creamy enough, goes down fine and finishes rather sticky on the palate. A bit of a burn and some heat lingers. 
OVERALL: This was the first BA DL we drank, so it basically just went downhill from here. Surprsingly enjoyable and well balanced, this is more proof that Dark Lord is better in the right barrels. I'd go as far as suggesting FFF just bourbon barrel age the whole batch and charge $40 a bottle. Much better use of Dark Lord. This was the second place finisher for me, just behind the PvW version and ahead of the Cognac variant. Lots of good barrel flavors that mellow the overly sweet base beer, but also allow the enjoyable parts of Dark Lord to play a role. Good stuff. Cheers for the fun day gents! 2,181 charactersJeffo, May 15, 2013

A - Basically identical to the regular version. Perhaps a tad more of that rich oil coating. 
S - Plentiful bourbon whiskey melding over raisins, fudge, batter, pencil shavings, and sherry.
T - Dense oak that's been super-saturated with bourbon (albeit slightly generic). Deep cocoa, honey graham cracker, molasses, prune, and massive raisin. 
M - Medium-heavy body, carbonation low enough to not be immediately detectable, dry finish. 
D - Few base beers change as much in a barrel as Dark Lord. I certainly appreciate the transportation and would never decline a taste. 732 charactersAuracom, Apr 29, 2013

A - Jet black just like the standard dark lord. Thin brown lacing after a faint cocoa head.
S - Bourbon up front of course with lots of dark fruit, figs, milk chocolate, caramel, sugar
T - What you smell is what you get. An intense whiskey bomb that is very mellow. Lots of chocolate and dark fruit but not as pronounced as in the regular version. Less sweet and more woody for lack of better words. The barrel character really shines through and highlights the base beer. 
M - No carbonation really but that is to be expected. Almost a little too sweet to the point where it hurts to drink. Alcohol is there but it goes down smooth enough that you can't feel it right away.
O - Absoulteley delicious and more well rounded than most bourbon barrel stouts. I am not sure if the bottle cost is worth it but this is a nice beer and that is what counts. 906 charactersbeerhan, Apr 28, 2013

Aroma was strong, but "typical Dark Lord ".
Appearance very black with just a tip of dark tan around the edge, not too much foam, drops away fast.
mouthfeel is VERY typically Dark Lord, sweet, thick, deliciously so.
Taste - OMG - so frickin' good, wow ! we also had Rare, Choco Rain and others, this stood way taller than the rest, totally my favorite right now. Sweet, coats your mouth with delicious vanilla, cherry and bourbon flavors, not at all hot after sitting for almost a year.
If I can trade for more, I won't think twice about trading away most anything for more of this monsterously flavorful beast. 740 charactersstouts4me, Feb 13, 2013

Palate: Quite drinkable albeit being on the sweet side. Plenty of carbonation.

Poured into a tulip glass from a 750ml bottle.
2012 Vintage (Red Wax, Red Skull)
Bottle: 355/688
Pours as thick as mud. With some dark dark abyss like hues. There is a nice 1 inch tan colored head that neatly forms with some great dense bubbles; nice and creamy looking. The head recedes very slowly. (5.0)
Aroma starts off with intense sweetness. Wow. Molasses and toffee. Dark fruit notes of prunes and some raisins as well. Very sweet nose. Bourbon and boozy heat are noticed in the nose as well as some nice slight honey and vanilla sweetness notes. I can’t state it enough. Very sweet. (4.5)
Taste follows the nose. Starts off with some intense sugary, caramel and molasses notes. Very sweet yet delicious. There is some slight chocolate sweetness as well but then is overtaken buy the caramel and molasses again. Wow. There is some woody notes in there with hints of vanilla and some honey. The Bourbon barrel shines adding some intense booze notes as well as some woody notes. However, these notes are not harsh. Dangerously smooth with the 15% not very noticeable. Mouthfeel is nice and thick and silky at the same time. As the beer warm some of the boozy heat is perceived a bit more. Great brew. (4.5)(5.0)
Overall this is a gem. I know a lot of people find it overrated but this version of Dark Lord is pretty good. It has great sweetness and heavy thick rich molasses notes. Very well done. (4.5) 1,463 charactersJoEBoBpr, Dec 21, 2012

2012 Vintage 
Bottle Number: 393/688
I am not sure I can thank futura123 enough for sending this my way, I never thought I would get the chance to try the bourbon version of one of my favorite beers! 
Appearance: As with the regular Dark Lord, the barrel aged version pours out thick and viscous. The beer appears pitch black in the glass, but a back light reveals some deep red along the edges. A rough pour yields a small, creamy, tan coloured head that, as expected, fizzes away pretty quickly. A swirl coats the glass in a thick yellow tinted film, that fades into heavy alcohol legs. 
Smell: Good lord, as with the regular DL, the nose here is absolutely sublime! If you don’t like sweet beers, I think this is one to avoid! The initial nose offers copious amounts of sweet toffee, chocolate fudge, salted caramel, caramelized (nearly burned) brown sugar, bourbon and sweet vanilla. Further contemplation and warming yields: Liquorice, a little coffee, dark fruits (cherries and raisins), oak and molasses. 
Taste: As the nose promised, this is one of the most delicious beers in all of beerdom, I have a feeling that my glass is going to disappear far quicker than it should! Flavour notes include: Sweet toffee, chocolate, caramel, fudge, butterscotch, bourbon, vanilla, oak, caramelized sugar, dark fruits, molasses and liquorice. There is a touch of the 15% noted in the finish, but I couldn’t bring myself to dock a point for this as the rest of the flavour is just that good! 
Mouthfeel: Perfect, absolutely perfect! The body is thick, chewy and quite sticky, with a medium level (usually too high for my tastes, but it works so well in this case) of insanely smooth carbonation. 
Overall: Bourbon Dark Lord is one of the few beers that far exceeds any and all hype surrounding it - this is easily one of the best beers I have ever had had! I would absolutely kill for a shot at the vanilla bean version! 2,001 charactersThehuntmaster, Dec 17, 2012

This is bottle number 4 out of 420. We consumed this bottle as part of a Dark Lord (and Behemoth) vertical to celebrate the then-impending, now-official marriage of my friend Scott Nicholas. Thanks again for bringing the bottle Scott, and congratulations! 
Score: 99
2012 vintage bottle served in a stemmed wine-style glass and enjoyed on 09/19/12.
Appearance: Pours an ink black color with a thin layer of beige head that settles to a ring around the glass. Poor lacing, but excellent cling and retention with what little lacing there is. 4/5
Smell: Smooth bourbon, milk chocolate, oak, dark chocolate and a surprising amount vanilla (though there is less vanilla than the Bourbon Barrel Aged Vanilla Bean Dark Lord). Brown sugar and dark fruit too. There is the faintest hint of coffee in the nose. Huge doses of chocolate and smooth bourbon are present in the aroma. A slight roastiness and more oak comes out as the beer warms up. The aroma is bold and perfectly balanced. 5/5
Taste: Brown sugar, sweet bourbon and light vanilla. The sweetness is nowhere near the level of the base beer, which greatly lends to its drinkability. This tastes a lot like the Bourbon Barrel Aged Vanilla Bean Dark Lord, but with less vanilla character -- shocking, right? The Bourbon Barrel Aged Vanilla Bean Dark Lord seemed sweeter than this variant as well, though I would not characterize either variant as remotely being "too sweet." Molasses and raisin flavor too. No coffee. Like the nose, the flavor is bold and balanced. There is a light alcohol warming effect on the palate in the finish, as might be expected from a 15% ABV beer, but this beer is far from boozy. To the contrary, it is smooth and easy to drink. 5/5
Mouthfeel: Viscous and full-bodied with minimal carbonation. The beer is sweet, slightly sticky and creamy on the palate. 5/5
Overall: This beer's only real flaw is it's cost. As with all barrel aged Dark Lord variants, this beer cost $50 retail and was only obtainable at retail pricing by having a winning scratch off lotto ticket that each person got after buying a ticket to Dark Lord Day (and even then, you had to claim one of the four variants before they ran out). Those who struck out on the Dark Lord Day lotto would have to pay an even higher premium via trade or otherwise, as this beer sold for $300+ on eBay before eBay halted alcohol sales earlier this year. This beer is substantially less sweet than the base beer, but it's still a sweet (just not "overly sweet") brew.
Recommendation: This is one of those few highly hyped, hard-to-get, extra-premium priced beers that absolutely delivers, but there are plenty of comparable beers out there that cost half as much (or less). This is one to seek out and try for the purpose of ticking, but I recommend trying to acquire one with a group of friends to share to ease the cost.
Pairings: Drink this decadent beer as it's own digestif. It's heavy enough to suffice.
Cost: $50 for a 750 ml bottle. 3,102 charactersjegross2, Nov 27, 2012

2012 750mL bottle poured into taster - thanks Pat. Opened alongside DL 10-12 and Brandy Vanilla DL 11 as part of our holiday StoutFest tasting.
Pours a viscous blackness with a thin crop of darkly tanned, brownie colored head. Dissolves swiftly into a collar of film with a few spots of lacing on the glass while drinking. 
Absolutely explosive nose filled with thunderous bourbon character. Warm and boozy layered with syrupy sweetness, chocolate, smooth vanilla and charred oak. Leathery and slightly smoky with a hint of dark fruit and roasted dark malts. Intense, complex and intoxicating - even before sipping. 
Aggressive, yet delicious bourbon character right up front on the tongue, driven by boozy heat and sticky, syrupy sweetness. Rich vanilla and oak with light touches of dark fruit and raisin. Chocolate dark malt with warming roastiness. Having this alongside the base beer, this isn't remotely the same - the barrel aging completely elevates Dark Lord to a new level and somehow seems to temper the near-sickening cloying sweetness. Finishes rich, sweet and boozy with a chocolately note. 
Fullest of the full bodies, heavy on the tongue, sticky and chewy on the tongue. While the 2011 Brandy Vanilla Dark Lord stole the show, this was a completely awe-inspiring beer. As I come to the realization that I really don't enjoy Dark Lord all that much, the barrel aged variations are some of the finest stouts I've ever had. I honestly had a hard time believing they were the same beer. 1,516 charactersxnicknj, Nov 26, 2012

4.9/5  rDev +8.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I had this one at the 20th anniversary party of the Map Room in Chicago. Served on tap, I received about a 10oz pour into a short hourglass shaped glass.
A= Poured opaque and sporting a 1/4" rich brown head. Once the glass was full this ale looked as black as motor oil. Once it was almost gone and the light got into it I could start to see traces of ruby and amber. By the way, I took the last sip and put the glass down and was amused to see that a lot of liquid still clung to the sides. 
S= Huge complexity in the nose. Aside from the bourbon (which was giving me amazingly big and rich aromas), I noted heavy syrupy malt, roasted grain, some toffee-like richness, hints of coffee, and alcohol. Not overpowering or solvent-y in any way though.
T= My God, it was amazing. This beer was custom made for a bourbon barrel. Often times I thing the bourbon barrel overpowers a beer. Not the Dark Lord. Things started off with the best parts of bourbon (sweet complexity) plus vanilla, roasted grain, coffee, toffee, and an almost indescribable richness that was not heavy or cloying despite the ten ton weight of this beer. It was a sipping experience for sure, but I never felt that it was overwhelming. The hops were pretty much non-existent. The finish was smooooth, warm with a pleasant alcohol, and sweet.
MF= Beyond heavy body...it's in a class by itself. When I had finished it, there was enough liquid sticking to the sides of the glass to make the glass look brown for a few seconds and allow me another small sip (and lots of aroma for a long time after the experience was over). Carbonation was there but otherwise not really a factor.
D= Despite the 15% abv, despite the syrupy thick body, despite the sweetness, this beer was really a joy to experience and ultimately the drinkability was high. Unexpectedly high. A moving experience that I will not hesitate to repeat. 1,886 charactersspointon, Nov 24, 2012

I had two bottles of this in two days of crazy beer tasting. This review is from day #2 in comparison with the other DL variants
A - as expected, pours black with a chocolaty head
S - sweet bourbon with lots of fudgy chocolates and a bit of soy
T - sweet vanilla opens this up, and is quickly replaced by fudgy chocolates. Spicy bourbon flavors move in and are cut into by more chocolate flavors. This is really sweet and the bourbon is very well integrated into this.
M - smooth and full like all of the other DL barrel aged varieties
D - nice version of DL...this is my 2nd favorite barrel aged bottle version behind the vanilla bean. The bourbon adds a nice complexity and takes away from some of the cloying sweetness that plagues the regular version of DL.

Motor oil pour as is typical with good DL vintages. Jet black with a small tan ring of foam leaving some legs down the glass though the retention fades a bit.
Big bourbon notes up front in the aroma. Dark fruit, wood, chocolate and burnt malts.
Again barrel stands out in the taste. Bourbon is nicely integrated and smooth. Toasted oak, vanilla, dark chocolate, fudge and roasted malts play a part with some dark fruit in the background.
As with something that pours like motor oil, mouthfeel is thick and chewy. Carbonation levels low, but still present. Alcohol is felt, but very well integrated.
Surprisingly enjoyed this one much more than the Vanilla I had a few months ago. My main complaint with regular DL is the intense sweetness and the bourbon does a wonderful job of cutting through and balancing this beer. At the same time, there is enough sweetness that the bourbon doesn't come in too hot. Fantastic beer and hope they make this variant again (and I have better luck) next time around. 1,087 charactersjmarsh123, Sep 19, 2012

It’s a whole new level for imperial stouts that I didn’t know existed. All those other reviews of other imperial stouts that talk about "fudge" and "brownies" and "roasted coffee" and "barrel notes" may as well be talking about dog food. This beer is so vivid, so delicious, it’s like brownie concentrate with caramel, nuts, syrup. Body is full and soft, unlike the oily chore that is regular Dark Lord. It’s definitely really really sweet, but in sample size it’s unparalleled. Maybe the biggest highlight of a great night. 625 charactersillidurit, Aug 16, 2012

I shared this bad boy at the Star Wars tasting. 750 ml waxed bottle, 567/688, served in a Deschutes tulip.
A: Pours a dark black color, viscous like motor oil. A nice ring mocha foam is left over after the pour. As it recedes and swishes around there is some nice legs and splotchy lace left behind.
A: Bourbon up front with some dark fruits. smooth oak, some caramel, milk chocolate sweetness and nice toasted malts.
T: Nice barrel presence right away. Smooth bourbon, smoked oak, caramel and light vanilla. Sweet chocolate, some fudge and roasted malts. Toasted marshmallow as well. Very well integrated.
M: Thick and chewy. Medium to low carbonation. So smooth and it goes down with some slight heat.
O: This is drinking really, really well right now. No harsh booze and the barrel is just integrated very well. My personal favorite of the day. 866 charactersTreebs, Aug 11, 2012

Dark brown flat in the center, tan to the edges. No head.
Solid Aroma, easily the best part of this. Molasses, boooze, vanilla, brown sugar.
Taste is a bit thin. Vanilla extract, bourbon, malt. Notacibly different from the regular DL which I often find soy/burned/malt. This was solid, if unspectacular.
Not much to the body, a bit of a sticky mouthfeel, and still a bit thin. Odd, more bourbon than stout.
Really good, enjoyed it. The other people I split it with enjoyed it as well.

Same appearance as the others.
Big bourbon notes on the nose. Very sweet. Some chocolate, dark fruit, fudge, and cocoa powder. Solid.
Sweet plum, prune, chocolate. Low booziness lingers in the background. Sweet soy sauce in the middle. Molasses, fudge in the finish. Some chocolate also. Fudge in the aftertaste. Really good. Not as bold as the Pappy version.
Same feel as the others. Oily, slick, viscous, slightly sticky aftertaste. 
This isn't as impressive as the Pappy Dark Lord. However, there's more balance here and a touch more subtlety. A solid beer. 686 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jul 30, 2012

A- Pours a standard DL pitch black with a thin mocha head that leaves minimal lacing.
S- Similar to last year's Bourbon DL with loads of earthy bourbon upfront, oak, dark chocolate, caramel, roasted malt, dark fruit and wood with hints of vanilla and molasses 
T- Again bourbon is prominent, but is smooth and complex with notes of dark fruits including raisins, fig, black cherry as well as roasted malt, vanilla, oak, molasses and some roasted malt. 
M- Low to medium carbonation. A little hot, but the abv is still hidden fairly well.
O- A superb bourbon aged RIS that I consider to be a tad better than last year's DL PVW treatment. The bourbon is so smooth and well integrated into the base beer. It's incredible what barrels do to DL. My favorite treatment of the '12 varieties . 867 charactersiadler, Jul 28, 2012

Thanks for opening this with me, MarkIntihar!
Nearly black, though very heavy and substantial looking in the glass. Shiny and oily, with a small brown head that leaves dots of stick.
Rich, inviting, monstrous aroma of bourbon (vanilla, oak, maple, alcohol hint), chocolates, and roast. This combines marvelously well. As this warms, there's just a hint of an off vegetable-like note, but it's certainly not distracting, especially because it tastes so good.
Any flaw found in the aroma is completley hidden in the flavor. Rich, layered notes of vanilla, bourbon barrel, molasses, chocolates, and roast combine for an incredilby drinkable, though incredibly significant, substantial barrel-aged RIS.
Full in body, thick, heavy, luscious.
One of the finest beers I've had. 790 charactersehammond1, Jul 15, 2012

2012 Bourbon Barrel Aged Dark Lord: 241/420
A: Black as sin
S: Bourbon, alcohol
T: Bourbon, no coffee flavors here (almost 4 months old, so no surprised there), sweet sugary fruits, wood
M: Absolutely my favorite part next to taste for this beer, it's so damn ridiculously smooth, I can't describe it, and the carbonation is very minimal, but perfect for the style. Absolutely love the mouthfeel on this one, smooth, smooth, smooth.
O: I can't wait to get tickets for Darklord Day 2013 to have more of this lovely brew. I am looking forward to getting a bottle of the vanilla bean version next year, as this years vanilla bean DL on tap was just amazing. If you get the chance to trade, try this fresh, or try this at all, I highly recommend it. Amazing. Godly. 992 charactersSynergy87, Jul 14, 2012

Pitch black and syrupy as all dark lords tend to be. Oak comes through more in this version than it does in the vanilla. And the sweetness and heat from the bourbon seems subdued and dried by that oak. 
The dark fruit flavors come through more in this version rather than vanilla also. I don't know if this is aged longer than vanilla bean but the beer seems much less sweet and much richer in flavor. 
But it's also not quite as big or rich as vanilla. I would call those two a tie or maybe vanilla has a very slight edge. 557 charactersbirderbeerer, Jun 18, 2012

Decent looking, nothing special here though. Strong, smooth bourbon aroma takes over to blend with roasty malts and sugary sweetness.
The underlying taste is a more mature version of DL complimented by sweet, smooth, rounded bourbon. Not too much complexity here: just bourbon. Cognac DL was much more interesting, and a significantly better variant overall.
Still a great beer, but a big step down from the Cognac in my book. But then again, I'm not a bourbon lover. 504 charactersbrystmar, Jun 03, 2012

This was another epiphany for me. Pour is dark and black with virtually no head. Smell lights up your nose with burnt, sweet, and no heat. Mouthfeel is really think and wonderful. Taste is an expolosion of coffee, carmel, chocolate, coffee, dark wood. Awesome RIS!!! I am gald to have 4 bottles resting comfortably that I wont open until mid 2012. Every so often, I go to the closet just to stare at them.... 513 charactersgbbass16, Nov 24, 2011

4.55/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I think 6 oz. draft into a plastic cup @ DLD the past two years (rating is from 4/08).
This pours jet black with no real head to speak of; perhaps a few tan bubbles scattered about. It is so thick that it refuses to leave the sides of the cup.
The aroma has the big sweet caramel malt, roast,etc from the base Darklord and adds bourbon, light oak, anise, and hints at the abv. 
The flavors are intense and include roasted malt, chocolate,coffee, caramel, vanilla,oak, bourbon, and anise. There is a dark chocolate like bitterness.
Definetly full bodied, with the flavor lingering for quite some time. It is worth the time away from the tasting tables to enjoy this special brew once a year. 694 charactersajsdad06, Jul 20, 2011

T- Has a strong bitter chocolate flavor up front followed by a nice malty middle and then finishs with a pur bourbon kick. 
M-Full bodied with nice carbonation
O-Overall this was a top notch beer. Not as good as Vanilla DLD by any means. Well atleast in my opinion. In my little circle of 8 guys at DLD this was all their fav. besides me. Very good beer but just alittle too much bite and hottness to love it. Will have it again at DLD for sure. 660 characterszrab11, Jul 02, 2011

A: Dark with no head just like the others.
S: Damn fine Bourbon bliss! 
T: Ok, I tasted the bourbon at first and it was smooth, but after going back and forth between this and the vanilla DL I developed this Graham cracker taste which complemented the vanilla's marshmallow flavor, unreal!

A: Definitely pours black as hell with a small tan ring of head and great legs of alcohol. Very nice look.
S: Wow, the best mix of amazing sweet and savory bourbon with huge dark malt of any bourbon aged stout I've had to date. Raisin, Vanilla, burnt malt, dark fruit all combine amazingly. Complex and exceptional.
T: Taste does not disappoint, Might be the best tasting beer I've ever had even better than Vanilla IMHO. More flavors from the already bourbon and dark malt smell characters include molasses, vanilla bean, dark fruit, some coffee roast, and more. Tastes like the stout I think God would want to have.
M: Smooth and mostly not too hot, but a little alcohol lingers here. Would easily be a 5 with some age.
D: Totally amazing and just a pleasure to try. I beginning to think Dark Lord might be the best stout the barrel age in history. 976 charactersDreadnaught33, May 09, 2011
3.87/5  rDev -14.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Poured from the tap at Dark Lord Day, served in the brewpub inside a tiny snifter. This particular variant of Dark Lord spent time in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels. 
Inky black with a teeny tiny head that fizzled away to nothingness. Very thin ring. 
Sweet nose. Molasses, light coffee, dark cherry, vanilla, hints of oak. Sugared and syrupy. 
Heavy bourbon at first, though the flavor lightens at the swallow. Lots of dark cherries, vanilla, brandy, molasses, hints of coffee, toffee and dark chocolate. Mostly the sweet stuff. 
Medium, buttery body expands in the mouth. Oodles of alcohol on the tongue and in the nose. Heavy, syrupy, but not cloying. Fairly clean finish. 
I’ve enjoyed the oak-aged Dark Lord in previous years, but this isn’t as smooth as I remember. I might actually prefer the un-aged version, and I definitely prefer the vanilla-aged version. 873 charactersPhelps, May 09, 2011

Appearance: Pours a pitch black color with no light coming through. There is hardly any head.
Smell: The smell is very sweet and roasty with bourbon hitting the nose right away. I'm also picking up some chocolate and vanilla notes.
Taste: This is an awesome tasting beer. Very sweet and roasty with some bourbon heat. I'm picking up hints of cocoa and vanilla. Very smooth.
Mouthfeel: Very thick and mouth coating. The carbonation is mild and the finish is dry.
Overall: I liked the vanilla version a little bit better, but I really enjoyed this one as well. The balance is wonderful and it is a smooth drinker. 680 charactersoline73, May 07, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A - Black and oily, capped with some reddish-mocha bubbles.
S - The nose is an outrageous combination of deeply roasted notes, coffee and chocolate, dark fruit, and oaky vanilla. The booze is obvious as a flavor component, but not as hotness at all.
T - The delectability offered by the nose is fully realized in the flavor. Big luscious notes are leaping from the glass - ranging from coffee, toffee, and cocoa, to anise-licorice, vinous dark fruit and whisky - and covering up the staggering ABV along the way. This is just phenomenally delicious, nothing more need be said.
M - Sticky, oily, hugely decadent.
O - This is definitely worthy of the hype; it is so much better than the base beer that it boggles my mind. 723 charactersktrillionaire, May 07, 2011

A: The beer looked no different than the vanilla version. A super thick BLACK beer with no head with only a few bubbles. Also this beer had legs.
S: The nose was so rich and not as one dimensional as the vanilla. The bourbon was a real treat. Also this was 2010 dark lord so it had some time to chill out. The bourbon was up front but with the diminished booziness of fresh DL it worked out well and took that and replaced it with something you wanted to smell.
T: One of the best bourbon barrel beers that I have ever had. The complexity was off the charts and it did not come across as sweet like the vanilla version. Both were excellent but I preferred this.
M: Super thick with almost no carbonation. A joy.
D: I had 2 samples of each version. I tried going back for a third but friends settled me into getting a dreadnaught and calming down. It was worth the price and the blend of both was amazing. It was worth the 5 hours we were in line to get some. 968 charactersaerozeppl, May 06, 2011

A - Pours jet black with almost no head. Looks chewy and awesome!
S - Maple bourbon on the nose at first, followed by some dark fruits and raisins. Also pick up some of the traditional Dark Lord soy sauce type of scent.
T - Taste is initially bitter dark chocolate, followed nicely with the vanilla bourbon presence. Finish is very hot, almost pure bourbon. Delicious!
M - Very smooth at first, with the bourbon sting again coming through slightly in the finish.

A: Thick and black. You could use it to lube up an old engine. Slowly dissipating, tan head. Legs like a supermodel.
S: Nice balance of bourbon, malt sweetness and a little coffee hiding in the background.
T: Wonderful balance of all things awesome. Bourbon most certainly played a supporting role in this one. Far less angular that non-BBA 2010, it doesn't have the eccentric bitter bite that it's little brother has. Nice boozy warmth and plenty of fig, coffee and toffee. Delicious.
M: Thick enough to brush your teeth with. Very low carbonation. The time in the barrel and this being a year old now make it nice and smooth.
O: I'm very impressed with this one. I was lucky enough to be at the brew pub right when they opened the day after DLD. It allowed me to really dissect this one without the craziness of the previous day's festivities surrounding me.
If you're ever in a situation in which you can try this guy out, take advantage of it. This was magical beer. 1,029 charactersGreencoat, May 02, 2011

After searching high and low for a way to get this on the outside of the pub and giving up, someone with a red jacket handed me a cup and said "enjoy". Very gracious, thanks! Poured into my snifter - about 6oz but certainly enough for a rating!
The beer looks great in terms of color but is lacking in terms of head. Pretty dead looking, a voracious swirl reawakens a touch of lace but perhaps the most interesting aspect is the way this coats the sides of the glass. Not exceptional looking, but, for a 13% BA Beer, we'll still say the color is fantastic!
The smell is the best part of this beer. The layers of intricate depth of the base beer are still kicking. I get tons of dark fruit, chocolate, and burned malt. But an additional layer of bourbon and oak adds complexity where the base beer has smoothed out. Not a booze bomb at all, this has improved the base beer tremendously in the nose.
The taste is a slightly different story. Maybe I see BA huge stouts in a different light than others. To me, a beer like Dark Lord already has so many layers of flavor that I'm really just looking for the booze to mellow and the flavors to gel. To me, this BA version is quite good but I almost like the base beer more by itself. The barrel tastes and bourbon seem to stand on the side of the base instead of integrating. Don't ge me wrong, there are great flavors of dark fruit, chocolate, molasses and licorice. The barrel treatment was well executed, lending some wood, vanilla and bourbon, but I'm not convinced it was necessary or an improvement that warrented the investment.
The mouthfeel also takes just a small step back from the original beer. There's just a bit of a duality here, where it seems the base sludge and the bourbon are dancing but at different speeds. Still a great beer overall, and one I will happily revisit every year at DLD. 1,870 charactersjampics2, May 02, 2011

Looks like Dl generally does, opaque and inky, thick and viscous. I personally love how Dl looks, it has everything i want in a big stout.
The aroma only shows a glimpse of the power this beer has, there is a bourbon wisp but nothing that overburdens the rest of the base beers great attributes, incorporated and building.
The flavors have that quick bourbon and oak jab, and comes in some melted dense caramel, with some light dark fruit notes. Rounded out by a mixture of chocolates both milky and semi-sweet and you have the best of the vintage(pre-11) DL variants. 592 charactersChadQuest, May 02, 2011

The menu said that it was 2010 DL aged for one year in Heaven Hill bourbon barrels. The nose was of sweet chocolate, vanilla, and light bourbon. The vanilla and bourbon were predominant but neither was overpowering. The flavors were nice and superbly well meshed. The chocolate and bourbon finished quite well together. It was exceptionally smooth, perfect in body. This beer was fantastic. 500 charactersaasher, May 02, 2011

Dark black liquid with no head. Anyone who rates a beer like this as a 5 in appearance is an idiot. The smell is potent booze. If you close your eyes you might think you're smelling a glass of bourbon. Not a plus for a beer. The bourbon should complement but not dominate. The flavor is all booze and caramel. It's almost like the beer itself is completely gone. They could have just barrel aged miller light and with this level of alcohol it would taste the same. Not worth the wait or the price. 549 charactersdrseamus, May 01, 2011

The aroma is massively boozy chocolate, dark fruits, and coffee just like regular Dark Lord but with a very oaky/woody overtone. It's not like the typical oak aroma from most bourbon barrel beers. It has sort of a green/fresh woody quality to it. The flavor is also again dominated by massive waves of chocolate, molasses, dark fruit, and coffee. Again though, like the aroma, the oak comes off as sort of harsh and green. The regular '10 Dark Lord seemed a bit smoother and more balanced. 572 characterspunkrkr27, Dec 01, 2010

Poured a pitch black color with minimal head (I'm sure the plastic cup helped with that). Smells like DL but with huge hints of the oak barrels. Subtle sweetness. Slight smokiness. Adding the DL to the Oak barrels was a great move that only added additional complexity to this beer. Would be great to see it bottled instead of having to drink it from a plastic cup at DLD. 449 characterskbutler1, Aug 20, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From old notes The beer is black, and it doesn't appear as viscous or syrupy as regular Dark Lord. The beer looks near.
The nose is unadulterated decadence. It's reminiscent of chocolate cookies, brown sugar, fudge, chocolate chips, and brownies. Oak isn't prominent, like I was expecting, but it is noticeable. I detect a little molasses and a whisper of vanilla. No oxidation in the nose? I'm astounded!
The flavor is fudge and chocolate cake with light vanilla and a little sugar. The chocolate is insanely rich. I detect a touch of astringency and subtle oak. So decadent. The finish is chocolate desert with a slight roast and a little heat. The mouthfeel is light and silky, not at all like the viscous and syrupy regular mouthfeel on Dark Lord. There's just a dash of oxidation in the flavor, but it's not detrimental. I was expecting this to suck, but it far exceeded my expectations. 894 charactersHopHead84, Jul 23, 2010

A: Pours nearly black with a motor oil quality with no head to speak of. This is a thick beer that looks quite syrupy and leaves nice legs on the inside of the glass. This was served along with Vanilla Bean Dark Lord and both looked pretty much identical.
S: The oak is really showcased in this and it is really nicely done. Notes of chocolate, molasses, roasted malts, vanilla, and booze.
T: The oak yet again is quite forward and coats the based beer beautifully and is never overpowering. Chocolate appears along with roasted malts, vanilla, and just a hint of alcohol. 
M: Full-bodied and extremely thick with just a hint of carbonation. Nothing to complain about here.
D: If it weren't for the extreme richness of this Imperial Stout, I feel that I could drink this all day long.
Overall I must say that beer is absolutely fantastic and I am still shocked that I was able to try this! My Highest Recommendation. 1,061 charactersLunch, Jun 15, 2010

a - Pours a pure black color with little head and carbonation.
s - Smells of whiskey, oak, and maybe a little vanilla. Also some sweet malts.
t - Tastes of whiskey, oak, sweet dark fruits, and vanilla. Has a touch of heat to it.
m - Medium to full body and low carbonation.
d - I enjoyed this beer quite a bit. I'm a big fan of whiskey and oak in stouts, and this one was great. Also enjoyed the sweetness in the smell and taste. Very interested to open one of my bottles of regular DL now to compare the two, and would love to try again some day.

Edit: Got to try this again on tap at Dark Lord Day at the brewery on 04/30/11 and liked it a lot more than the first time I had it. I thought the nose was absolutely amazing; the bourbon and vanilla really shone through. Bumping the nose from a 4.5 to a 5.0. 965 charactersmdfb79, Jun 05, 2010
4.12/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.54 ozish pour in a plastic cup at Brickskeller 3F tasting. I interpreted this to be the 2010 release of the 2009 DL aged in whiskey barrels, not the 2009 Oak Aged Dark Lord. Either way...
Pours an extremely sludgy, viscous syrup like dark brown, near black with a non-existent head and no signs of carbonation. So yea, appearance is pretty much as expected for style, but nothing exciting. Aroma is hot and abrasive, assaulting you while the glass is still on the table. Immediately hits you with bourbon and oak. After letting acclimating to the booze and burn, other notes from the base DL are apparent, including chocolate, coffee and more oak. Very sweet, raw and complex aroma. Mouthfeel is very thick and chewy, silky and long lasting on the palate, near perfect. Flavors follow similar pattern to the nose; overall extremely sweet and it takes a moment to get past the oak and bourbon to pick out the subtleties of the original dark lord, and it that its primarily chocolatey. This isn't a 13% ABV beer that you can said hides its alcohol well either as there is a noticeable burn associated with each sip. This was an unexpected to treat to try, but overall I was left feeling like this in an instance of an amazing beer + more amazingness (barrel aging) != doubly amazingness. Overall some of the complexity is sapped out of this by the dominance of the boozy and oak flavors. 1,385 charactersyourefragile, Jun 04, 2010
4.31/5  rDev -4.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3On tap at the Brickskellar last night. The 3 Floyd's rep indicated this was the 2009 whiskey barrel aged version of DL.
The beer pours the expected viscuous looking, blackish brown color with minimal head retention and/or lacing. On the other hand, I can smell this bad boy from a foot away... the nose is profound, showing milk duds, coffee, whiskey, vanilla and considerable booze. This beer just smells flat out decadent. For the most part, the flavor profile replicates the nose, though it's a bit one dimensional and is dominated by sweet chocolate and coffee. The beer is decidedly on the sweet side, and is almost ponderous on the palate. Mouthfeel is absolute perfection and the beer is a huge presence on the palate. The beer feels like spun silk on the palate, with a buttery, creamy texture that is plush, soft, smooth and long. There is a hint of bitterness on the finish, which I think keeps this beer from being over the top rich and sweet. Considering how sweet, boozy and alcoholic this beer is, it's no surpirse that drinkability is not its best attribute. This beer is really more like an after dinner liquer, and it's hard to imagine too many other occasions when I'd want to drink a beer like this. Originally I had contemplated ordering another glass after the tasting, but after my finishing off my 3 or ounce "sampler," I really couldn't bring myself to drink any more. Regardless, this beer is a stunner and is absolutely outstanding. 1,459 charactersJohn_M, Jun 03, 2010

A: Jet black with no head and thin dark brown lacing
S: Incredible aromas of oak, bourbon (Woodford Reserve barrels), and chocolate.
T: Wow, this is as good as it gets for a bourbon barrel stout. It's not overly sweet like I was expecting (based on 2009 Dark Lord). There are huge vanilla, oak, bourbon, dark fruit, and milk chocolate flavors - all in harmony. Also, a hint of coffee and caramel comes through, giving it an added complexity.
M: Mouthfeel is thick, but not as thick as bottled Dark Lord. It is, however, very creamy, velvety smooth and coats the mouth very well.
D: The only knock on this beer is the slight alcohol burn - you can tell it's 13% (or more).
Overall this is one of the best bourbon barrel stouts out there, and I feel so lucky to have gotten the opportunity to try it outside of Dark Lord Day. Big thanks to Barnaby and Nick for bringing it to the Brickskeller tasting! 996 charactersbmanning, Jun 03, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42010 vintage served in a tulip with the vanilla bean and 2009 DL. Beer is black and thick in the glass. Coats the wall and the swirl leaves legs of alcohol on the walls. There isn't a head or carbonation to speak of but it looks good.
The aroma is slightly hot, oaky, with a lot of roast and a nice smoothness to it. Very liquor. Hints of vanilla, very subtle. 
Beer is full bodied and completely coats the mouth. Surprisingly smooth for such a high alcohol beer with such a strong aroma. The woodsiness of the beer mellows out the heat a lot. Lots of roast in the back palate. Drinkability good. 598 charactersdrabmuh, May 17, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Brad for sharing this at his tasting on Saturday!
2010 vintage, served side by side with Dark Lord and Vanilla Bean Dark Lord. 
Oak Aged Dark Lord pours a near jet black, with hints of brown visible at the upper edges of the glass when held to the light. Head and lacing are somewhat subdued, but given the serving medium, I couldn't ask for more. A great big aroma of rich roasted malt and oak barrels. Wow. Dark Lord is one of my favorite beers, and I find the addition of oak barrels to be quite wonderful. There is a prominent licorice note in the taste. Someone described the feel as "oil slick in the gulf" and I have to agree. Thick and chewy, this beer leaves a coating of stout residue in your mouth that utterly blankets the palate. This is remarkably smooth, given the high alcohol (it is higher this year than previous vintages), and gives a nice, warm burn as it slides down. I really hope I can go to DLD next year and get some of this fresh from the tap.

Simply delicious. Similar in some regards to Goose Island Bourbon County Rare. The beer is full of flavor and wonderfully smooth. Alcohol content hidden beautifully. Lingering aftertaste of delicious bourbon. Warming sensation as it goes down. World class. 1,347 charactersHuhzubendah, May 17, 2010
4.94/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Was definitely looking forward to having a few glasses of the oak-aged Dark Lord again this year. This was my favorite the last few years and being that one can only have it once per year, I was getting anxious! Judging by the number of people at the event several hours before the gates even opened, we figured it would behoove us to get in there quickly!
Poured into the cheap plastic cup, it really just doesn't do this beer any justice. It is still a nice looking pour - thick, oily, black, and messy. Just enough juice on the pour to create a slight frothy head. I have a feeling this would be quite nice in a snifter, but I digress.
Ah yes - wood and bourbon. Really doesn't smell that much like standard Dark Lord, but damn impressive. Sweet smelling, with some syrup or maple and some chocolate. I really like what the barrel has done to this beer.
And every bit as impressive on the palate as I remember. As expected from the smell, there is quite a bit of bourbon presence that is not around in the standard version of Dark Lord. I'm not as good at detecting the woodiness in the taste, but the smoothness given by the barrel-aging process is amazing. This is by far my favorite of the three Dark Lords - if not for being served in a plastic cup, it would certainly receive a perfect score. Very thick, chewy, and oily - I love the way it coats the mouth and hangs around long after the beer is gone. One of the detractors of Dark Lord over the past couple of years has been the sweetness. The oak-aging replaces that sweetness with a more mellow smooth taste - this is why it is so amazing.
Tough to rank the drinkability on a three ounce pour - which is why it is imperative that one gets several glasses! And even after several glasses, I'm lining up for more. I still contend that Three Floyd's should bottle about 50 bottles of this per year, and then produce 50 "golden tickets" that are different than the normal ones. A true Willy Wonka experience. If you get one of the special golden tickets in the mail, you can redeem it for a bottle of the oak-aged. Something to think about Nick.
Regardless of the chaos of Dark Lord Day (which I truly enjoy), the oak-aged Dark Lord alone is enough to bring me back every year. A masterpiece.

Appearance: Black, thick, no head to speak of.
Smell: Luscious.
Taste: As I drank this, I honestly thought that it was a taste of Heaven itself. Malty. Vanilla. Chocolate. Coffee. Clearly oak-aged. Absolutely heavenly.
Mouthfeel: Sooo smooth and thick. It reminded me of silk or velvet. 
Drinkability: If not for the ABV I could drink it for all eternity. 391 charactersslimstout, May 06, 2010

Served into a tumbler/snifter glass. 
Served with 1/2 finger of creamy tan head. Color is just like vanilla bean dl: pitch black. 
Aroma: Straight up oak, chocolate, and malty. Rich. Big caramel sweetness. Subtle aroma, but awesome. Very well done.
Taste: sweet malts with lots of caramel and cream. Some toffee flavors. The oak is present with a big wood flavor (yes I just typed big wood). Some raisins and molasses. Chocolaty goodness.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, warming, and creamy. Full bodied with a lower amount of carbonation. Hot aftertaste. Ends malty and warm.
Overall, not bad at all. Very fine beer. The VB is better, but I am not complaining with this one. Very drinkable and I am glad I got a chance to try this one. 773 charactersmothman, May 04, 2010

The aroma is nice with the oak dominating the front, nice notes of vanilla and sweet chocolate. The taste is also lots of oak but not overpowering or annoying. It really adds a lot to the original dl but not quite as good as the vanilla. 340 charactersjrallen34, May 03, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A: The pour is viscous and black with just a bit of tan foam around the edge of the glass.
S: A definite oak and bourbon presence to the nose without the intense sweetness Dark Lord usually has. Certainly some sweet chocolate and vanilla with a bit of dark fruits.
T: The oak aging gives this one a bit of a tannic character and some bitterness that the original does not exhibit. The bourbon, vanilla, and oak flavors are quite strong but still allow the chocolate, roast, licorice, and dark fruits to show.
M: The body is thick and chewy with a low, smooth carbonation.
D: I like this one much better than Dark Lord. The oak aging here has helped to balance the beer out and mitigate the overwhelming sweetness. 717 characterswomencantsail, May 02, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a viscous black, oily with coating properties from both malt and alcohol. A few bubbles around the rim of the glass are compact and stick around. Aromas waft up of dark malts, maple, dark fruit, oak, umami, bourbon, and mineral elements. Most of the overly sweet malt characters from Dark Lord are here replaced by thick oak with spirit notes and a bit saltier than the regular liquid dessert. 
The flavor brings the same loads of dark malts to the tongue, in addition to being brownie batter a lot of oak pops up, minteral, even tealike and oxidized flavors pop up a bit. I could see how some people would prefer this to regular Dark Lord, as the oak changes a lot of the sweetness into an oaky more savory experience, though molasses and malt is still here. Body is full and viscous with a coating feeling on the palate and a palpable low-moderate carbonation to match. 
Interesting twist on Dark Lord, not as sweet, but I think I prefer the sweeter malts to the oaky twist in this case. The flavor is intense, which is fine if the taste is perfection, but this isn't quite it. 1,087 charactersvacax, May 02, 2010

A-Black, nuff said there. Out of the tap and "rested" there was no head or lacing to comment on. 
S-Rich and complex with bourbon, roasted malts, oak and chocolate aromas with hints of vanilla and dark fruits.
T-If someone made a mocha flavored bourbon, it would taste like this. Very, very nice and the flavors linger and remind you why this beer is so highly rated.
M-Creamy, thick and low carbonation. 
D-Excellent beer and one of my all time favorites. Well worth the wait and deserving of the hype. 629 charactersbierenutz, May 02, 2010

A: Jet black oily in color with a thin brown head.
S: Bourbon and oak flavors dominate the aroma
T: More bourbon and oak in the taste, with notes of chocolate and alcohol. 
M: Thick and syrupy mouthfeel with a dry cocoa finish. More alcohol flavors in the finish.
D: I realize drinkability and availability are different, but given the beer is only available 1 day a year for a 3 oz serving, I'm not sure how drinkable you can rate the beer. Saying that it pairs really well with my Italian Sub that I got standing in line doesn't quite sound right. 680 characterschaz01, May 01, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Had this on tap at Dark Lord Day 2010, poured into a plastic cup. Nicely black with some brown lacing sticking to the sides, I kind of think the plastic cup adds to the lacing effect, but it looked very cool. 
S - It smells like Dark Lord, but with some nice subtle wood flavor added. Great chocolate, bourbon, oak smells with the normal Dark Lord greatness.
T - I love Dark Lord, especially the 2010 batch, and this is an improvement. Great cocoa, caramel, and a touch of espresso and huge oak influence that is perfectly done. Hints of vanilla and a bit of bourbon. Wow.
M - Thick, full bodied, coats the tongue.
D - So heavy, it would be hard to drink tons of, but all things considered, could do a lot more of this than anyone reasonably should be able t. 767 charactersAgentZero, Apr 29, 2010

I was too late to get any VBDL, but was very excited to get to try this one. Appearance is definitive Dark Lord, a small dark tan head. The nose on this one is awesome. Oak and bourbon up front, with dark lord sweetness behind. Chocolate and dark fruit. The taste follows the smell and really delivers. The barrel comes through strong with bourbon and vanilla. The oak really smooths out all of the complex dark lord flavors. Coating and thick mouthfeel, that lingers until you can have another sip. Dark Lord is an incredible beer, but this is an unbelievable beer. One of the best beers I've had the pleasure of having. Can't wait until next year. 748 characterskhumbard, Apr 28, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4I had the pleasure of trying both the Oak Aged and Vanilla Bean Dark Lord at DLD 2010. While I would describe the VB DL as a kinder, gentler version of regular Dark Lord, the Oak Aged version is every bit as brutally massive (and then some). 
The Oak Aged Dark Lord is simply a more complex version of the real deal. The added wood character slaps you around with yet one more characteristic compounding something that is already very complex.
As with the VB DL, the only advice I would recommend for further improvement is to allow this to mellow out with some age. Being freshly tapped from a new keg obviously doesn't allow this - but it would be cool to have a bottled version of Oak Aged Dark Lord to lay down for a few more months.
In all, I like the Oak Aged Dark Lord that much more than the regular version. I hope they produce more next year! 855 charactersPrinceDarren, Apr 27, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Got to have a small glass of this at Dark Lord Day 2010. The pour was pitch black with some dark chocolate lacing clinging to the sides of the glass. It's one of the darkest and thickest looking stouts I think I've ever seen. It left a little lacing on the glass but not a lot.
The aroma had a big vanilla and oak wood presence with a good amount of bourbony alcohol flavor to it as well. It also had dark chocolate, roasted malts and a little dark fruit to it. The barrel added a very nice complex aroma to it, it was a little strong but didn't overwhelm the beer.
The taste also has a large oak, vanilla and bourbon presence to it. The bourbon flavor gave it a warming alcohol finish. Also present were some dark roasted and chocolate flavors but they definitely took a backseat to the barrel flavors.
The mouthfeel was nice and thick with low carbonation. Very nice mouthfeel on it considering I like thick and heavy stouts. Drinkability was decent although the alcohol and barrel characteristics were a little strong. The 4-5 oz glass that I got was plenty for me.
Overall a very nice modification of Dark Lord. I enjoyed the glass I had but probably wouldn't have gotten another one, especially if this was a beer available all the time. It felt like the barrel characteristics were a little overpowering and became the main flavor of the beer instead of Dark Lord being the main flavor with some barrel characteristics to enhance the complexity. Don't get me wrong it was delicious and great for the serving size they gave out, just couldn't justify any higher scores for it based on that. 1,599 charactersbillab914, Apr 27, 2010

On-tap in the parking lot into a plastic cup, then transferred to my tasting tulip.
A: Viscous black body with some nice dark brown foam. Looks amazing.
S: Very sweet, very potent aroma of roasted malts (lots of chocolate, some coffee), bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Lovely.
T: Follows the nose, with restrained booze overseeing a luscious medley of sweet, malty, oaky, bourbony goodness. Awesome.
M: Smooth, thick, creamy body. Sticky, but enjoyable, with expectedly low carbonation.
D: Super sweet and super strong, but the oak aging makes this tasty enough to make me want far more than the small sample. Considering how many high-test beers I've sampled today, though, that probably isn't the best idea.
Notes: This is an awesome, delicious beer, and is far more impressive than this years fresh regular DL. While I look forward to seeing how that ages (and I have very high hopes), there's no question that today this is the more delectable beverage. I'm still kicking myself for not getting in line for the Vanilla Bean DL right away, though. Here's hoping I can make it back next year!

A - Poured a deathly black, lovely dark brown hue in the light with a scant tan head. No lace remained. 4.0
S - Big, roasty, and lots of caramel. Hint of vanilla and charred oak in the background. Touch of figs and dark fruit as well. 4.5
T - This robust beer is definitely a highlight of the day. The intense cocoa, caramel, and roasted barley mingles with the delicate tones of vanilla and wood, finishing extremely rich with an everlasting dark chocolate and plum finish. 4.5

D - For the abv, highly drinkable. 4.5 683 charactersDmanGTR, Apr 27, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.56 oz tap pour into a clear plastic cup at Dark Lord Day 2010.
A - The syrupy pour is totally black with a tiny ring of dark tan foam. Like VBDL, it's not much to look at. It's got even less foam on this pour.
S - The aroma is very heavy of roasted malts and strong oak wood. A small chocolate and alcohol hint comes out with a warming finish. Bold presence and deep nose.
T - It starts with a big oak flavor with tons of chocolate and roasted malt flavors going on. The alcohol is smooth and kept under control by a well-balanced barrel finish.
M - Oak-Aged DL is just as thick and viscous as VBDL with a rich, full body and smooth, throat-coating finish. The alcohol adds a soft warming sensation to the finish too.
D - For how rich and full-bodied this bold RIS is, it's a winner that deserves it's recognition. I think the balance of oak flavor without the pesky and cliché alcohol burn in this RIS is very well done. Nicely drinkable for it's potency too. 965 charactersBeerFMAndy, Apr 27, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +10%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had on tap at the pub of three floyds on Dark Lord Day 2010.
A-pours a completely black, opaque, motor oil looking liquid that is thick and viscous looking. Tan colored head that is tight, thick and creamy. Some light retention and lace
S-the nose is amazing, bourbon forward and right up front. Notes of vanilla and oak set in next with some nice dark chocolate and notes of espresso.
T-The bourbon and vanilla oakiness comes in right up front. Tons of dark chocolate set it next melding with the vanilla from the oak, chocolate brownie. Sweetness takes over, but in a soft well orchestrated way. Anise turns to dark cherries and plums with a hint of alcohol in there to let you know how big this is.
M-this is the biggest stout I've ever had. It is huge, somehow bigger than any dark lord and bigger than the vanilla bean that I sipped right next to this. It should be higher than a five if possible. It is extremely smooth and creamy, soft on the palate, this needs a knife to get through it in the best of ways.
D-this is the best stout I have ever had. This is also the best beer I have ever had and is in a league of it's own. Beers could potentially get a higher rank with me b/c of the typically lack of head retention and lace of Dark Lord; but it will take quite a brew to ever top this! 1,302 characterscpetrone84, Apr 27, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +7.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at DLD, finally! Brings me up to 95/100 on the Best of BA, but what a moving target that list is. Maybe I was a little drunk when I had this (ok, let's change that "maybe" to a "definitely"), but this one really stopped me in my tracks and made me appreciate just what the hell I was drinking: one of the greatest beers of all time!
Pours as black as the BeerAdvocate website background, and as thick as Aunt Jemima syrup. A well-formed brown head sits on top and leaves some lacing on the glass...er...plastic cup.
The nose on this one is out of this world. So much going on. It smells like a rich chocolate cake, along with coffee, roastiness, candied fruits, oak, and bourbon. Even puts regular Dark Lord to shame here.
Flavor is similarly amazing. The sweetness of Dark Lord really mellows out with the oak aging. Lots of milk and dark chocolate, coffee, molasses, brown sugar, and candied plums and raisins. Oak and bourbon blend seamlessly and do not overwhelm in the least bit.
Incredibly full-bodied and rich on the palate. Carbonation level is medium-low, exactly as appropriate for a beer like this.
Overall, wow, this is unbelievably good. I'll knock it down a half-point on the drinkability just because it's so overwhelming, but as drunk and full as I was, I had no problem taking down the 6oz pour. (Wish it hadn't been so easy!) Hope I get to have this awesomeness again at some point in the future. 1,426 charactersnickd717, Apr 26, 2010
4.49/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I was sure to get my sample of this at Dark Lord Day 2010 and thoroughly enjoyed it. Review is from notes taken on 4/24/2010 and poured from the tap to a plastic cup (blasphemy, I know, but it's what they were offering).
Appearance: Comes to me very black and viscous looking (I should note that it's not nearly as thick as the '08 DL that I was able to sample - didn't get to review though as my pour was not quite deep enough to get everything out of it); has about a 1/4 finger of deep dark brown head that fades quickly to nothing other than a thin ring around the surface of the same color; the body is, of course, entirely opaque (I think this actually feeding off of any light around it) and it leaves behind no lacing. 
Smell: About what I would expect, actually, and it's awesome. Tons of smoke, wood (with a bit of a sweet vanilla aspect to it from the barrel aging); big alcohol that is a little bourbonesque in nature; lots of dark, burnt and roasty malts and bit of a deep and dark, ripe fruity (cherry?) aspect hiding out in there.
Taste: Pretty much matches the nose to a "T." Lots of that smokey and woody aspect and followed with a hint of sweet vanilla; that big alcohol is definitely present and it's quite hot (I have no idea what year this was made, but if I had to guess I would say it's relatively fresh); again those nice dark, burnt and roasty malts provide tons of flavor and that cherry-like flavor hiding out continues to do so and makes the occasional appearance between the other, more dominant flavors.
Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy, with tons of thick sticky coating holding all over the mouth that allows the nice roasty and bitter flavors to linger for what seems an eternity. In the end, it's a tad gritty, but I like that in a stout, and one of this magnitude certainly does not disappoint.
Drinkability: The flavors and smells alone are enough to keep this high, despite the very present ABV. Also, the mystique and rarity of this beer alone would perhaps keep me coming back for more if it was something that was actually more available. I'm pleased that I got to try it though. 2,119 charactersbamadog, Apr 26, 2010

The oak aged DL pours jet black with a small ebony head that quickly fades and leaves no lacing. Smell is chocolate, sugar and LOTS of oak. The wood characteristics dominate all other aspects of this beer. The taste is similar to the nose with Oak up front, some chocolate malts and nuts in the middle, followed by a wood finish. Mouthfeel is thick and syrupy. Great tasting stout but I agree with others in that the oak may be just too much. It is a great cousin of Dark Lord but not sure I could handle much more than the small sample I received. 632 charactersabrand, Apr 26, 2010

A- Poured a dark, chocolate brown color. Looked very thick, like motor oil. Produced minimal amount of head. Dissipated instantly. 
S- Sweet malts with molasses. The sweetness in the aroma was very potent. The background had a slight hint of vanilla, bourbon and tons of oak.
T- Much like the aroma, actually exactly like the aroma. Sweetness upfront from various malts and molasses. Some bourbon and vanilla in there as well. The finish was dominated by an overwhelming amount of oak. Really wanted to give this a 4.25, but couldn't...so I rounded up. 
M- I loved the mouthfeel of this beer. Thick, chewy and viscous. Coated the palate very well. 
D- I'm glad they served this in a small 6 oz. glass (could of been 8 oz.). If I had any more it would have been very difficult to put down.
Overall, a very good beer. That being said, at $9 a pour, I will pass from now on...much better bourbon, oak-aged beers out there at a better value. 991 charactersrhinos00, Apr 26, 2010

(A)- Pours thick & black as night. Produced a quickly dissipating brown head.
(S)- A rich dense molasses with a rather potent woody bourbon-like burn
(T)- Rich, with a big woody & bourbon-like sweetness with some dark cocoa & molasses. Very similar to the smell.
(M)- Dense, but thinner than the vanilla bean variation. Has a good carbonation level. A big, almost dry woodiness, yet has a bitterness too from the roasted malts.
(D)- A good stout. Not as successful as their vanilla bean variation in my opinion, but has its own special qualities the other ones do not. Unique and interesting on its own. I would also like to see how this one ages, but yet again, this is only available one day a year! 792 characterssweemzander, Apr 25, 2010

tons of oak with subtle hints of vanilla and booze. light scents of dark fruits
mild sweetness, tons of oak which gave off a nice subtle vanilla favor. bits of molasses. the roasted malts took the back seat and the hops were also overpowered by the brute oak flavor.
very thick, a bit syrupy, mouth coating

I had a 4 oz glass and it was a bit too much. Still one of the most flavorful and unique beers I've come across. 376 characterspepsican, Apr 19, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is the true definition of what a world class stout should be all about. I've had this 3 years in a row now at DLD and it never fail to impress and you will find me in the pub again and again on DLD. Pours a chocolate blackness and delivers everything you could imagine or ever dream of in a stout. Bourbon and oak seem to melt flawlessly into the background of this monster stout that does truly make this a treat to be savored. If there is a flaw it would be that it's not bottled and sold as a one bottle kicker on DLD along with it's standard version. Everything is here oak,vanilla,bourbon,chocolate fudge goodness.. the best way is fresh off the tap but to see this end up bottled would be awesome..Keep up the good work FFF's you started this whole craft beer craze and one off stout release everyone else is copying what FFF's started..the true kings of craft beer! 877 charactershrking, Dec 29, 2009

Jet black, no head with dark brown highlights. Not as sludgy as the regular Dark Lord. A solid looking beer.
Holy fucking fuck, what a nose! Chocolate chip cookies with bourbon come right to mind. Just massive, intensely good. A ton of vanilla with a relatively low booze character, with bourbon noticeable. Not hot in the least, the vanilla character is actually quite tastefully done. Mildly raisiny with cocoa powder and chocolate fudge. Just over the top.
The palate isn't as exceptional, but opens with all the fantastic chocolate complexity with cocoa, dark chocolate and fudge. Plenty sweet with caramel, burnt sugar and an incredible accent of bourbon. The oak aging is most noticeable in the vanilla character of this beer, along with a mildly boozy character. Coffee isn't noticeable, though there's enough molasses and licorice to make an effort at countering the chocolate character. Mild dark fruit character is present with raisins soaked in sugar syrup. An incredibly long finish with a bit of booze, a lot of vanilla, mild roast and some chocolate. Thick and HUGE, this big beer has low carbonation and has a perfect body. My belief is reaffirmed, and I'm almost tempted to go to DLD next year and session this and the VB DL. Awesome stuff. 1,366 charactersDefenCorps, Nov 10, 2009
4.74/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Got this one from stfun37. Brought this down to San Diego last week and shared it with HopHead84 and dyan. I think this exceeded all of our expectations.
Sludgy opaque black, no head forms from the pour - this is pretty much still. Plenty thick, but not as viscous as the regular Dark Lord, which can only be a good thing.
Huge aroma of chocolate, fudge, chocolate cake, chocolate syrup, vanilla and caramel. Inhaling anywhere near the vicinity of a glass of this is like walking into a chocolatier. Unbelievably sweet and decadent. Oak and bourbon are noticeable, but the chocolate/caramel/vanilla trifecta is dominant.
The taste is brimming with rich chocolate and vanilla, molasses, licorice and oaky tannins. Bourbon is there too, well-integrated and balanced with the base beer. The body is thick and viscous, carbonation non-existent. The finish is mildly tannic, roasty and semi-dry, coffee lingering on the palate.
It's amazing what a little -bal aging will do to a beer. While I'm not at all a fan of the regular Dark Lord, this iteration of it is incredible. 1,072 characterslargadeer, Nov 10, 2009
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Hand bottle provided by gunhaver.
A: Pours as dark as night, flat pitch black with only a bubble or two for a head. The beer is thick, dense, it literally coats the glass.
S: Huge vanilla aromas, from the wood I guess. Nothing artifical about the vanilla though, it is like creamy buttery vanilla. The wood component is huge as well. Like fresh cut oak. Strong roasty notes are there along with hints of molasses and chocolate.
T: Holy Hell! There is nothing like this beer. It is the king of barrel aged beers in my mind without a doubt. Fudge like chocolate up front along with a big blast of roast. The oak component is huge and so enjoyable. Vanilla manages to push through with hints of bourbon. A slight milky coco puffs flavor can be picked up as well. Simple flavors that seem to just meld together perfectly. Really is a perfect beer.
M: Full bodied, lacks carbonation from the hand bottling, but it really don't suffer. I like lower levels of carbonation on RIS' anyway.
D: Wonderful, would love to drink all night until I pass out. Reason enough to make a trip to Dark Lord Day. 1,094 characterstpd975, Sep 04, 2009
4.59/5  rDev +1.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap at DLD 09. Pour to a jet black with just a hint of brown, a thin dark brown skim of head that lingers well and okay lacing. But it ain't about appearances. Nose was a very potent and pleasant mix of aged wood, pourbon, chocolate, toffee and caramel, and as it warmed, the alcohol snuck in as well. Mouthfeel was full, a tad biting and oily. Taste was the highlight, as it took all the scents of the nose and blended them into a very complex taste where every sip seemed to accentuate a different aspect.
Finish was log, smooth and warming. FFF served this in small cups, which was a good thing, given the various beers to be tasted and the 14% abv. 656 characterskimcgolf, Aug 23, 2009

A-Deep, non-light penetrating black. A small, dark tan head dissipates to a thin ring and leaves spotty lace along with remnants of the beer, it being that viscous.
S-Whoa! Like sticking your head into a bourbon barrel filled with Dark Lord! Huge notes of oak, dark chocolate, espresso, dark fruit, toffee, turbinado and vanilla. 
T-All the positive qualities of DL with a BIG bourbon pressence....and IMHO too big. FFF is never one to shy away from flavour and they didn't start with this one! I like it, but it's simply too much for me.
M-Full/heavy-bodied and Christ! This may be THE smoothest, creamy and most viscous beer I have ever had. This one slides down like oil. Rich beyond measure with LONG lasting flavours. 
D-Certainly a fine brew, but the alcohol and bourbon character is a bit too much for me in this one to drink en masse. I prefer Vanilla DL over the Oaked version. 1,073 charactersDeuane, Aug 19, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Yet another version of this fine beer. 
This one took me by surprise - by oaked, I assumed this beer was "oaked" so the big bourbon slap in the face almost made me cry. 
Again, just like the regular Dark Lord in most respects, but with a massive overdosing of barrel aging that's up front & in your cage. Kudos to 3F for trying to improve & tamper with an already great beer, but this one feel just a bit short; the bourbon was over-aggressive for me, drowning out some of the best aspects of the regular Dark Lord. Some of the creaminess was disrupted, & the great towering blade of malts was compromised. 
Still a very good beer & one I'd never turn my nose up at, but also a good example of turning a great beer into just a very good one by laying too much of the barrel into the glass. 792 charactersmaximum12, Aug 16, 2009

Smell: Only a hint of oak on the scent. Lots of roast malt and molasses.
Taste: Did they add sugar to this one as well? If so, why? Roast malt, molasses, brown sugar, milk chocolate, semi-sweet baking chocolate. The oak is huge on the taste, like a fresh oak barrel. Too much barrel actually. Much hasher than the regular DL or VB DL.
Mouthfeel: Great - thick, chewy, smooth, near perfect.
Drinkability: To much fresh, wet oak and I get some added sugar. Regular DL is better, but honestly none of the three is T-50 worthy in my opinion. 601 characterscraytonic, Aug 14, 2009

Pours a dark black, some deep tan bubbling froth, and a bit of a foamy crust. 
Smells like ... Dark Lord. I feel like cutting and pasting my review. Hmmm ... Chocolate, dark fruits, a roasted malt backing. So far, not much oak.
Well, the oak makes its appearance in the flavor, in a big ... kind of distracting way. Vanilla, bourbon-y oak, and the familiar chocolate, roasted malt, and velvety dark fruit of the base Dark Lord. They laid a heavy -bal aging on this beer. And yes, there's more than a bit of sherry to it. Thick, viscous, and creamy. Noticeable bourbon component.
Much better on my second sampling. 734 charactersOverlord, Aug 13, 2009

Pours like liquid sludge, when I was finished with this I couldn't even pour the remaining few drops out because they were stuck to the walls of the glass like maple syrup. Huge dark fruit nose just like regular Dark Lord, with the oak also being prominent. Taste was very sweet, the oak stands out and unfortunately has a bit of a harshness to it, so I couldn't rate the taste a 5. Full bodied and thick, I prefer the regular Dark Lord to this version though just because of the harshness. My 3 oz. was more than enough to satisfy.
UPDATE 4/26: Had a chance to try the newest batch of this beer and I must say, it was MUCH better this year. The harshness from the oak was gone, and all the flavors melded together very well. I'm still not sure it is an improvement on the base beer, but it is good enough that I have to bump the taste score up to a 5 900 charactersalcstradamus, Aug 09, 2009
4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally getting around to reviewing my notes from DLD. Had on tap of course!
A- Pours a thick dark motor oil black color. I held this up to the light and it had no accent to it at all....just dark black. It had about a half finger mocha/tan head that wasn't very impressive and went down rather quickly. Lacing was sticky on the sides of the glass but I think regular DL beats this one out in the appearance catagory.
S- This has the same highlights as the DL with the coffee and chocolate I think dominating along with some darker fruits and something else I can't place my finger on. Some distinct oak and bourbony undertones come and go when I sniff at this along with faint vanillia aromas as well. This beer is making my mouth water just smelling it.
T- Big oaky...bourbon taste right upfront that powers with the chocolate and coffee taste of the DL. The balance is maybe a little off but that is only opinion. I get hints of the vanillia blending almost perfect with a brown sugar taste I get. This beer is big and it knows it. A heavy hitter with different tastes around every turn. Can taste the alcohol a little more with this one.
M- This is a heavy hitting mouthfeel. Not a huge carbonation leaves this beer knocking on your palate until you force it to leave. Leaves a nice amount oaky, coffee, chocolate taste on the tounge. This beer feels good in the mouth still after being so big and heavy.
D- This beer is sadly for me a one beer and move onto the next for me. It is good but so damn heavy that it feels like I'm drinking a meal. Plus there was two other DL's I had to try while I was talking with friends. 1,630 charactersalleykatking, Jul 08, 2009
4.18/5  rDev -7.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4The '09 was, in my opinion, a step down from the regular Dark Lord and two steps down from Vanilla Bean Dark Lord. This seem the least polished of the three. The nose was hotter, the mouthfeel had lost some of the rich creaminess in exchange for a bitter wood tannin, and just did not leave a great impression. Still a solid beer that most breweries would sell their soul to produce, but for the perfection that is expected with Three Floyds it was good, but not great. 469 charactersSteamhead, May 14, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap @ the Three Floyds brewpub on 4/25/09 during DLD. Served in a snifter. 
Pours as black as an oil slick into the glass with a burnt and charred mocha colored tan head. Standard D look for this, except that the head looks a tad thin and more foamy than the regular Dark Lord. The aroma is just thick with bourbon warmth and pervasive accents of wood and vanilla that lie on top of the RIS notes of chocolate, coffee, molasses, and dark fruit tang, giving an extra level of hugeness to this bouqet. Wow, this is big in the nose! 
The taste starts with massive barrel notes of boozy bourbon and oaky accents that is more than an equal for the massive sweetness and roast of the Dark Lord. The bourbon never seems to get overpowering to me because the original flavor profile was so huge to begin with. Finishes with a tangy, boozy, and dry feel that warms the palate and sticks in the mouth. The mouthfeel is hugely chewy and viscous with most of the heat from the beer appearing to come more from the bourbon notes and less from the ABV of the body itself. A warming, steady sipper here. 
Well there's certainly nothing understated about this beer. Bourbon-aged Dark Lord is what you want and bourbon-aged Dark Lord is what you GET! Luckily I greatly enjoy both and found a good balance between the two aspects, despite just the overall mammoth flavors and strength going on here. I greatly enjoyed this. 1,411 charactersKegatron, May 06, 2009

Pitch black, motor oil, no highlights, and a thin but fluffy dark tan head that holds for a little bit and leaves some lacing that coats the side of the glass.
Aroma is quite impressive, dark fruits abounding, molasses, coffee but not too much coffee, chocolate, bread and alcohol. Oakiness and vanilla, perhaps some extra heat as compared to the regular version. 
It is a very thick, oily beer as expected, complex, with coffee, bittersweet chocolate, sweet caramel, molasses, fruits, vanilla but some noticeable heat, brandy like, which does not blend perfectly. 
This is an incredible beer, but IMHO, one step down from regular DL. The oak aging did not match perfectly. Still a fantastic beer. 726 charactersbrdc, May 04, 2009

VINTAGE 2009 (Had @ DLD)
Much like Dark Lord, this one is solid black. It has a small head of tan foam that dissipates to a ring aound the edge of the surface. Lacing is a touch better than the 'regular' version, but still not very much. It's still very thick and viscous, sliding down the sides of the glass.
This is where it steps out away from it's brother. Nice big oakiness joins the chocolate and coffee notes. Dark fruits are still present, just a little more subdued. Wonderful bourbon-like notes. The vanilla is brought a little more forward. Nice caramel toffee notes.
Taste follows the 'regular' version, as well. This one brings along nice notes of charred oak, vanilla and bourbon. Molasses comes forward a touch. Lots of brown sugar notes. Slight hint of tobacco.
The oak aging really mellows the flavor profile out, making this one not nearly as sweet as the 'regular' version and giving it a drier finish.
While this one is still full-bodied and creamy and yes, thick, it loses just a touch, comparatively. If I weren't comparing it to it's brother it would score perfect anyway, but this one is slightly less, in that sense. In the 'regular' DL review, I said it deserved to be rated with a 7 for mouthfeel. This one still deserves a 6.
While this beer is incredible and totally worth the wait to get the chance to try it, I think that I actually prefer the 'regular' DL just slightly better. That shocks me, because I love barrel-aged brews, in general. I just like the big, bold, malty sweetness in the other one, which is toned down in this one.
Also, the booziness is more prominent in this one, which is not a bad thing, but it's better when you don't know that it's there. 1,744 characterscoldmeat23, May 01, 2009

Poured in a little plastic cup, I would have transferred it to my sampling glass but a few of us bought several glasses of each to pass around, so it stayed in the plastic.
The stuff is rich and black, just a wisp or two of mocha around the edge.
It smells richly of roasted malts, espresso, and the with the certainty of oak. Not as stunning as the vanilla variant but good in its own right.
Tastes like Dark Lord would - rich with dark malt and bitter chocolate, but with an oak edge that is very nice. The wood pushes the sweetness of the beer back a little, providing some nice balance. Lots of espresso and booziness on the swallow, and a long finish of the same. The thickness of the beer helps it hang around, also subduing carbonation somewhat.
An awesome part of the day, we had one and ordered three more. 843 charactersbrewdlyhooked13, May 01, 2009

Served in a plastic cup
The beer poured super thick and dense, like used motor oil. Not a ray of light penetrated this sludgy mass. A small, frothy, clingy, coffee-colored head capped the liquid.
The aroma was simply amazing. Sweet, robust and complex with strong indications of oak and bourbon. Lots of vanilla-like sweetness. Some brown sugar and caramel notes appeared as well. Boozy without being overly alcoholic.
The taste was just as astounding as the smell. Sweet, rich malts came through strong up front. Coffee-like. Deep and dark yet super smooth and not overly roasty. Bourbon and molasses were also noticeable. Lots of vanilla and oak too. Dark fruits appeared in the center. The lingering finish was oaky and whiskey-like. Brown sugar notes were apparent. Overall, incredibly interesting and quite complex.
The mouthfeel was ridiculously good. Ultra-heavy and creamy with a fine, mild carbonation. If there is a more rich and dense brew out there, I have yet to try it.
Drinkability was simply off the charts. The beer was incredibly smooth and balanced. Sweet for the style without being cloying. At 15% ABV, it drank like something half its strength.
This beer alone made my 1,000 mile journey to Dark Lord Day 2009 worth it. Simply put, Oak Aged Dark Lord Imperial Stout is the best beer to ever pass my lips. 1,367 charactersDamian, May 01, 2009

Poured into a plastic cup. It pours a thick, motor oil black. A minimal dark brown head forms and quickly reduces to almost nothing. The left over oil slick on the glass is great.
The aroma was fantastic. There were nice levels of oak mixed with the usual suspects of intense dark chocolate and sweet malts. There was also a nice mixture of tobacco. Mild coffee notes.
The flavor was fantastic. This was a nice blend of the standard dark lord with a healthy, but not overwhelming oak taste along with a pleasant bourbon that rounds out the complexity.
The mouthfeel as expected, thick and smooth. It has a low level of carbonation that highlights the flavor superbly. Full bodied and somewhat sticky at the finish with a nice level lingering on the tongue.
This was fantastic. I love Dark Lord and this is comparable and I believe I am actually rating it better. I would love to compare this head to head with the original. It is very drinkable and about the only thing that may hinder drinkability is the strength but I will getting my hands on this again in the future, extremely good. 1,135 charactersSykDoc, Apr 30, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A huge thanks goes out to an unnamed BA who helped me out with this one. Quite possibly the biggest think on my bucket list of beers. I have been waiting far too long to try this one. Served chilled and poured into a pint glass.
The pour was black as night. Small head of tan faded quickly leaving behind only the slightest bit of brown clinging to the sides of the glass. Seriously black as night on the pour here though with an intensly dark look to it. The aroma was wonderful. Tons of oak notes here hit you first with the sweet molasses and tobacco notes following up nicely. Smooth, subtle and wonderfully complex flavor here. Not the harsh oak, I found this to be very close in flavor to the 03 BA speedway, mature would be the best word for how it tasted. Really very well done. Very sweet tasting, especially on the finish here with notable light vanilla touches that mingled well with the oak notes and really full feel on this one, about as thick and creamy as a beer can get. Alcohol noted, but not overwhelming.
Overall this was soo worth the wait for me. A wonderfully complex beer that was accented perfectly. A different beast the the DL itself, this is something I would love to see come around much more often. 1,230 charactersmikesgroove, Apr 30, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This would be my favorite beer of all time if it weren't recently dethroned by its brother, Vanillabean. One of the best liquids on the planet. Every year I build it up, but it just never ceases to blow me away. 
Appearance: black tar, with a thin mocha head that soon dissipates into psychedelic swirls--coats the sides of the cup with a translucent film that does not budge. LOOK AT IT!!!
Nose: HAHAHAAA!!! All I can do is laugh. What kind of BEER is this?!?! Toasted oak, bourbon, molasses, vanilla, butter toffee, still a trace of dark fruit, and then just so much more that I just can't even describe--maybe the byproducts of yeast reactions that I don't understand--I don't know. 
Flavor: Holy god. This stuff brings tears to your eyes. It just makes you shake your head and wonder how the hell something like this is even made by humans. This is in the same tier as Napa reserve cabernets and Ardbeg single malts. In the words of my Uncle, upon trying it for the first time two years ago, "HOLY SHIT THERE ARE FLAVORS FLYING AT ME FROM ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!" Again, dark chocolate, buttery charred oak, bourbon, vanilla, intelligentsia espresso, yeast flavors, mineral flavors, molasses, port, fruit, but listing these words simply do not do it justice. A lot of oak aged beers have a similar flavor profile to this....but just do not even approach the mind-boggling sophistication of this elixir. Astoundingly good.
Mouthfeel: Heavenly. Like a mature, top-tier wine or a mature, barrel strength whiskey--oily, viscous, creamy, silky,....but way heavier! 
Drinkability: what more can I say? I still vividly recall the first time I tried this at Dark Lord Day '06. I had never tried any version of DL before, and while waiting in line to pick up my bottles, a friend of a friend walked up to me and handed me the rest of his cup and I swear I do not remember anything that happened for the next five minutes. Time slowed down, others' voices became distant...I had an out of body experience. All I could do was shake my head, flail my arms, and grin like an idiot. 
And as others have attested, somehow the vanilla bean version is better...so do I have to change one of my 5's to 4.5? 2,196 charactersBeerkovich, Apr 30, 2009

S: Big bold roasted malt, bourbon, chocolate, molasses, alcohol.
T: The barrel adds what I picked up as bourbon and some dryness akin to oak barrels.

A: Pours like a black hole, with no light getting through and some copperish/khaki colored bubbles that settled down to almost nothing.
S: Smells very similar to the original of course with some additions; major chocolate, slight roast, but more vanilla/butterscotch flavors similar in most oak aged beers
T: just like the scent, the flavor was also obviously very similar to its regular DL brethren; chocolate big time, slight roast, and the addition of some vanilla, butterscotch with much more of a boozy flavor finish. I don't know if this had ANY bourbon addition to the aging process or if they were just normal barrels or oak chips or what, but it definitely seemed like there was some bourbon in this.
M: Super creamy and coated everything it touched. Low carbonation, similar to a syrup but it matched the rest of the beer excellently.
D: I really enjoyed the flavor and addition of different tastes from the oak aging, although it seemed to increase the boozy alcohol flavor big time which sort of cancels out each other. If they could keep the flavor additions and knock down the alcohol, then this would easily overtake the regular DL for me. 1,212 charactersdukedevil0, Apr 27, 2009

Pours jet black, no light, thick as motor oil. Oily and resinous on the glass. A moderate head forms and has some retention. Decent lacing throughout. Great depth from the barrel aging. Very woody and oaky with that wisp of vanilla. A very small smoky character in the back that I wish was bigger. The barrel really rounds the beer out, making the deeply roasted malts more enjoyable. Taste is much the same. The barrel blends everything very nicely. A touch of cherry comes out as it warms but it's nearly hidden behind all the other potent flavors. Body is fuller than full and is a bit chewy. Carbonation is somewhat low but manages to make the beer velvety nonethelss. This a very big beer. It drinks decent for the size but it's huge and wants you to know it. The barrel and aging does wonders for the beer. 832 characterspwoods, Apr 27, 2009
3.63/5  rDev -19.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Had this yesterday at Dark Lord Day '09. It was so nice to be able to get a glass of Oak Aged Dark Lord and Vanilla Bean Dark Lord, plop down on a couch and compare/review them. Great job by FFF this year. Drank from a classy plastic cup.
Appearance- Pours a jet black with a sort of soft, creamy dark tan head that sticks around for quite some time. A weak cap and thick collar remain the rest of the beer leaving a light bit of lacing (copied from the Vanilla Bean Dark Lord, they were exactly the same).
Smell- Loads of deeply roasted malts, a bit of sweet molasses and some very woody oak. The smell isn't necessarily harsh but the oak is fairly pungent. Some vanilla and milk chocolate along with some licorice and a touch of smoke. Some dark fruits as well but the oak really is fairly dominant.
Taste- I don't necessarily think that the barrel aging really helps Dark Lord (unlike the Vanilla Bean). I find it to be semi astringent with almost too much barrel. Plenty of vanilla still though and a bit of bitter roasted coffee. The sweetness seems to be quite a bit more advanced that the regular Dark Lord as well. Tons of bourbon soaked cherries, prunes, dates, figs and any other overly ripe dark fruit you can think of. Finishes with a touch of smoke and a bit of boozy oaky bourbon like quality.
Mouthfeel- Big and rich and creamy with a smooth silkiness and a bit of boozy astringency.
Drinkability- Uhh... Out of the three Dark Lords this one was by far my least favorite. Just not a big fan of the barrel aging which is weird because I usually enjoy the added complexity. Maybe I was just a bit spoiled by the Vanilla Bean? Either way glad I got to try it. 1,672 charactersyounger35, Apr 26, 2009

Pours black with a brown head with nice lacing along the cup. Smell is amazing, you just want to eat it! Chocolate, malts, oak, roasted nuts. Very rich on the nose, I was excited what it's going to taste like! Taste is just as good. Very rich, sweet, and epic. Mouthfeel is think/rich, perfect for a RIS. 323 charactersSean9689, Apr 26, 2009
4.12/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5I've had this two years in a row in a plastic cup pour. I took some brief notes this year, so here it goes - a lot of this will be complementary to my review of Dark Lord (when I finally get around to reviewing the regular variety). Some of this text is borrowed from my Vanilla-bean review, where appropriate.
A - Think quick-dissolving mocha foam, nice ring of lace, pitch black with a hint of red at the edges. It's about all I expect from a 13% RIS.
S - Oak-barrel, but not the stupid amount I experienced in oak-aged Behemoth. There's also a touch of vanilla and almond that I get from most good barrel-aged brews, plus the cadre of "regular" Dark Lord smells. It's different from regular Dark Lord, but not a huge improvement.
T - I found the oak-aging to simplify the taste of Dark Lord in a way that wasn't altogether positive. The oak-aging really brings out the booziness and heat and smooths out a lot of the really interesting flavors from the regular Dark Lord. It's still pretty delicious, but just slightly acerbic.
M - Thick, near milk-shake consistency, with tons of residual stickiness, and low carbonation. This is the way RISes should be down - other brewer's take note.
D - This is a mild step in the wrong direction - takes the least drinkable elements of Dark Lord and amplifies them a little bit. It's hot, palate-beating, and not really much more interesting than the regular variety. Worth trying, but not worth waiting hours in line to try. 1,472 charactersMasterSki, Apr 26, 2009
2.76/5  rDev -38.9%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 2 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3So...yeah, I had one full glass of OA Dark Lord an hour ago. It's was horrendous. I got my toes crushed by the keg and then when I tasted it after waiting a couple hours for it, it just was a huge let down.
Looked pretty good, the smell was average of average DL, no Vanilla or Oak in the scent.
Taste- Wow, this sucks. I'm sorry, normal '09 DL = OMG. '09 OA DL=bad. No taste of Oak at all and overpoweringly sweet. The few drops I had of Kaggen and Surly Two beat the shit out of this brew.
Mouthfeel- Good, just like normal DL, thick and delicious.
Drinkability- It tasted awful, somewhat like '08 Darkness awful. I can see if people like it, but it had no taste of Oak at all. NONE. No wood. Vanilla bean DL was AMAZING though. 734 charactersCedromar, Apr 25, 2009

Everything the original Dark Lord is, both in aroma and taste, but now given a hearty soak in bourbon -- something I highly recommend. Strong bourbony accents blend in well with the other strong flavors. Thick, somewhat sticky body with almost nil carbonation. Enjoyed at this year's DLD, it really helped take the edge off standing around for hours upon hours in a line. 420 charactersChainGangGuy, Nov 21, 2008

Aroma of bourbon, roasted malts, chocolate, smoke, nuts, and dried fruits. Taste of sweet chocolate, roasted malts, mocha, maple syrup. brown sugar, smoke, bourbon, with a fair amount of alcohol coming across. A Dark Lord mouthfeel should be a little more vicious, but either way, it's a pretty solid beer... I still prefer the cask of regular DL I had at the Maproom in 04. 494 charactersegajdzis, Nov 09, 2008

Pours compact dark brown to black. The aroma is fat with oak/bourbon up front bringing tones of vanilla, coconut, light smoke and alcohol. In addition, lots of malt roasts with dark chocolate and chocolate ice cream as the most notable but there is also some room for coffee/espresso. Sweet sugary and dark fruity with tones of molasses, maple syrup, rum raisins and prunes. Hints of raspberries, nuts and celery. The flavour is medium to heavily sweet, light to medium bitter and medium to heavily roasted/burned. Bourbon, vanilla, coconut, dark chocolate, rum raisins, burned caramel, some coffee, mint-ish alcohol warmth, molasses and light smoke. The mouthfeel is extremely fat and oily yet smooth, soft and velvety with a balanced sticky ending. Aftertaste of bitter chocolate, coffee, bourbon hop dryness and molasses. Full bodied. Extreme but well balanced. Wow! 988 charactersBlursimarsi, Oct 04, 2008

Poured pitch black with zero head and enjoyed in a small plastic cup, just the way it was meant to be had. Smell is rich sweet, sticky molassesy malt with a light bourbon and alcoholic vanilla aroma. Taste is rich, semi sweet, chocolatey, dark fruit fig like flavor with some soy sauce like quality too. Rich oily mouthfeel and light carbonation but a sufficient amount. Really good stuff. 454 charactersJDV, Jun 09, 2008
4.85/5  rDev +7.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Sampled this many times at Dark Lord Day the past few years. Always arrives in the plastic cup, but that doesn't detract from this massive brew. Impenetrable black, oily, viscous and thick with a layer of deep dark tan foam on top. Looks like 10K+ mile used motor oil. Aromas reek of deep dark malts with notes of coffee and chocolate all drenched in a wonderful, woody bourbon that jumps out of the cup to greet you. It's really hard to describe but it all comes together perfectly and the aroma is divine.
Sipping this brings you immediate warmth as the big, dense malts collide with the rich bourbon and wood notes. Chocolate, caramel, coffee and molasses all work in as it flows down. The brew is on the sweeter side but never becomes too sweet as it's nicely balanced with a solid bitterness. Finishes with lingering bourbon notes. Simply amazing.
Mouthfeel is big, viscous, chewy and heavy. It's so damn good, albeit a bit hard to drink when you are standing out in the sun. After the tasting tables, a cup of this is usually what does me in every Dark Lord Day. Still, given the chance I would drink this until I fell down. Spectacular stuff that I look forward to every year! 1,185 charactersorbitalr0x, Jun 09, 2008
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bought a cup of this for $5 at Dark Lord Day. Definitely worth it.
It has all the great characteristics of the regular Dark Lord (great mouthfeel, incredible malts, you know...), but the oak aging mellowed the super-sticky sweetness which was my least favorite thing about regular DL. It's great what the aging did for this beer.
I generally say that aging isn't worth the expense, but in this case it mellows the beer and further adds to the great complexity. 462 charactersbassmantin, May 20, 2008

Not so much lace, but a thick oily residue was left clinging to the sides of the cup. The aroma was robust and full of strong coffee and chocolate with a hint of detectable bourbon. Same for the flavor. The bourbon was not overpowering or intense, it just added another layer of complexity. The mouthfeel did not suffer from the barrel-aging. It was thick and sticky as ever. A great beer, but I still prefer my Dark Lord without the bourbon. 534 charactersmdm46410, May 19, 2008

4.22/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Got to sample this one at DLD 08.
Poured into a tiny plastic cup a black charcoal color with a thin layer of light tan head resting on top the entire time. Had more lacing than the original Dark Lord. 
Smell was bourbony, oaky and kind of like a port with big dark fruit notes. 
Taste was very complex with sweetness and smokiness dancing together on the palate. 
Mouthfeel was very smooth and creamy, with a warming alcohol presence. 438 charactersgenog, Apr 30, 2008
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer poured with virtually no head what so ever. It was probably served a little cold but I was probably the 10th person to get this so I'm guessing it was due to that. 
The color of this brew was as dark as a beer could get, IMO. It coated the cup like the nastiest motor oil from the most run down POS you could imagine. (I still have the cup) 
The smells was phenomenal. Smells of vanilla, bourbon, chocolate, chocolate cake, and a little burnt coffee made up this beast. 
The taste simply cant be put into words but I will make a poor attempt at it. It was probably the most balanced beer I've ever had. At no point did this beer reveal any of its 13%. It was super creamy, Bourbon-y, and very chocolaty. 
The mouth was so rich and creamy and thick and malty. I am honored to have tried this brew. 
Overall, this beer is the best beer I've ever tried. It, IMO, can't get much better than this. I'm excited to see what can top it. 943 charactersiconoklaztor, Apr 30, 2008

A: Looks like Norwegian black metal served in a plastic cup. Awe inspiring viscous body that clings to the inside of the cup when swirled. Small dark brown/espresso crema colored head.

T: See above. That's all you have to do.
M: Incredibly chewey. Feels like taking a swig of half & half but has the look of old nasty gear oil drained out of a junkyard diff.

4.83/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had a chance to try this the Tuesday after DLD in an empty FFF brewpub so I had a chance to write a proper review. Served in a stemless goblet that looked like a rounded old fashioned glass.
A - Black as anything. Super dark and absolutely no light can get through this one. Nice and thick as well as they body just coats the glass. There was a bit of a mocha colored head when it came out but as with any beer with this much head, it had no chance at all of surviving. Have to say it managed to leave a few bubbles on the surface that reminded me a bit of a black swamp that one would see in a horror movie. Have to say this did leave a lot of lacing for a beer that barely had any head as the whole little glass was spotted with lacing.
S - A huge nose that is filled with odors of vanilla, caramel, and toffee. Definitely can tell the effects of the BA as I could smell the cinnamon and whiskey spices even from far away. I was surprised to notice that I actually smelled some cherry and plum/prune dark fruits odors in there as well that gave this beer some added complexity.
T - Yikes, this is one beer that manages to be both flavor packed and yet subdued and balanced. At first, i get a big sweet, vanilla, toffee, and caramel flavors that roll in. After this and towards the end of the beer is when I start to notice how those spicy Woodford reserve barrels have affected this beer. Can just taste the effects of the oak and the spicy cinnamon and pepper it imparts. Also seemed to get a hint of cherry and plum in the beer as well as roasted cocoa and chocolate. Have to love having all that in there together.
MF - Just a bit thinner than I like my RIS's to feel. It does have really nice prickly feeling on the tongue that goes well with all of the spiciness that we find as a result of the oak aging. 
D - Lets just say that this is a 13% huge stout and yet I have no trouble at all drinking the whole glass. This is a beer that just makes you want to have more of it. It is complex and flavor packed and I never felt overwhelmed or tired of drinking it. Each sip brought a new experience to me. Love that I got a chance to actually sit down and try it in an experience other than DLD because it let me really appreciate all that it is. 2,253 charactersjeonseh, Apr 29, 2008

Insane, Black Death (mixed with a shovel full of Black Plague) and a little charred motor oil (after being removed from a car that hasn't had an oil change in 10,000 miles). 
Brown, slimy, super-sticky legs (maybe tentacles) that don't fade, ever. Fine bourbon all over the nose, all in one glass cup. This beer sticks to the glass (and may actually be melting it).
In a word, "Ferocious".
I am not a fan of most bourbon barrel-aged beers. Most are too sweet for my palate. This beer represented the bourbon-style of beers the way I like 'em. It kept true to form, in that it wasn't overpoweringly sweet, but fiercely "bourbonie" or carried a very strong alcohol in the nose and mouth. 
This drink is truly a meal in itself. Not for the tame drinker - this beer kicked my ass and it will kick your ass, as well.
If FFF's ever bottled this, I recommend Flame grilling a super-thick porterhouse to crack open one of these with friends. Don't drink it alone! 1,017 charactersbeachbum1975, Apr 29, 2008

Black as sin with tan rays of hope coating the sides of the cup. Thick, oily, and sweet smelled like dark fruits and bourbon-ey. The taste was definitely chocolate-y (like a cupcake almost) and roasty with hints of coffee.
It was a cold day so this beer was a great warmer. The oak aging was not as prominent, but still served as one piece of the complex flavor-tasting puzzle. 405 charactersbgramer, Apr 28, 2008

Opaque, black. In the light of day with the sun shining brightly, had just a bit of brown at the edges. Thick & viscous, lots of leg and no lacing. No head, just a few stray bubbles at the edge, dark brown in color.
Scent that first struck me was bourbon, followed by molasses. This was a very sweet smelling beer. Roast character was not really coming through at all. The dark fruit character present in regular DL also seemed toned down, but it was present.
Taste was more sweet than bitter, and was similar to the aroma. Bourbon, dark chocolate, hint of coffee and molasses. Fruit character minimized at this time. Very mild herbal bittering at the finish.
Mouthfeel was fantastic, but again, to me, not quite as good as the bottled version. Thick, smooth body. Minimal carbonation. Quite sweet. Alcohol starts to warm you up quickly.
An exceptional stout, but I prefer the regular. I think the oak aging covers up some of the complexity that I enjoyed in the regular version. Also, for some reason, the mouthfeel was not quite as impressive as in the bottled version, still very good, just not exceptional. Still feel like this beer lives up to the hype! 1,184 characters, Apr 28, 2008

The Bourbon barrel DL, was really amazing. It is not something I would drink every day (even if I could). The mouthfeel is what really stands out about this beer, it is very coating and penetrating, a very different sensation from most other beers. The taste and smell are all wonderful, as I could remember the taste and smell for hours after drinking the beer. (that or it dried up on my nose and no one told me).

Thick and really brooding, this is what blackness should taste like. The song "Paint it black" comes to mind. Incredible complexity from dark rich sweetness and smooth long dryness on the end of the tongue. Very port like as expected. This would challange Raspberry Eisbock for my favorite after dinner beer. An attractively brooding mouthfeel. Surprisingly drinkable for its strength. 629 charactersSPLITGRIN, Apr 28, 2008

This beer is rich, so full of flavor and so filling, it's an experience which is hard to describe. Oily black beer, thick enough that it almost feels like solid chocolate cake, complete annihilation of the senses in terms of aroma, flavor, and presence. I couldn't really detect any oak flavors, probably because subtle nuances like that are hard to separate from the overkill of flavors.
Probably you can only find this at special festivals (such as DLD), but I recommend you try it if you have the opportunity. 631 charactersTurdFurgison, Apr 27, 2008

While the alcohol lever is high (15%) and you know it is there, it is never hot. The flavors from the nose burst into the palate covering every nook and cranny. This is an intese freak of a beer that one can only drink in small quantities. However credit needs to be given as it is balanced which is not an easy feat for something this size. 644 charactersSQNfan, Apr 24, 2008

Pours a deep opaque black, no light escapes, thin tan head, some lace spots, very oily. Smell is powerful, sweet, lots of cherries, and chocolate, oaky vanilla, alcohol, and oranges. Taste is similar, strong oaky vanilla, caramel, chocolate, roasty goodness, more tangerine/orange and alcohol. Mouthfeel is full bodied with low carbonation.

Smells of wood, rich roasted malts, bittersweet cocoa, dark coffee, and vanilla oak.
 Tastes of very smooth bourbon - rich and boozy(in a very good way), dark chocolate, strong coffee and vanilla. Completely coats the mouth with each sip. Thick and oily. I could sip on this excellent beer all day. 517 charactersClockworkOrange, Jun 16, 2007

I got inside maybe 20 minutes after they tapped this, while they were still serving it in glass glasses.
Nice pour, although the head isn't as retentive as I live in a perfect impy. Real dark black, no red at all.
Smells like bourbon barrells, pornographic malts, roasted nuts, wood, alcohol, fire yeast, fruity oak.
Tastes much less complex than it smells. Big fiery bourbon outweighs most everything else, leading into a middle of fire burnt dark malt and a very rough and dry finish. Fantastic, but not perfect. 
I'd say that regular DL is probably my 3rd favorite beer and well deserving of a perfect five. But I am keeping the bottles I bought at this year's DLD for at least a few more months before I try drinking them. They're just too powerful right now, and not as many of the complexities shine through. Add barrel aging to the mix, and you get a fantastic beer that's just too much to judge. 1,060 charactersmynie, Jun 02, 2007
4.52/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4From my understanding, barrel-aged Dark Lord is only available at the brewery once a year during Dark Lord Day. I've sampled this one at a previous gathering, but this one was sampled during my recent visit to the FFF Brewpub at the 2007 Dark Lord Day. The intoxicating aroma starts filling the area as soon as it's poured. Big vinous woody-bourbon notes from the Woodford Reserve barrels are the first thing you notice then the mochachino notes start wafering along riding the waves of darkness. The intense flavor is amazing complex with lots of dark fruitiness, caramel, and chocolate. The body borderlines on syrupy, but there's more than enough alcohol and bitterness to make it all work nicely. Amazing really. More of an elixir or a potion than a beer. The Dark Lord Cometh!

4.27/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5this was the 2006 woodford reserve barrel-aged version on cask at dl day. poured into a clear plastic solo cup, this was unlike any beer i have ever had. dark and thick like well-used motor oil. and i mean thick. this beer just left remnants of itself on the sides of the cup, turning the cup from clear to brown. brown head. the nose was absolutely huge, dominated by the whiskey notes along with chocolate, coffee, vanilla, smoke, toffee, and raisins. taste was a huge malt sweetness balanced a little by the 3f hops and roasty malts, but more to the malt/sweet side. mouthfeel was more viscous and thick than i have ever experienced. this had very little carbonation from the cask leaving it thickly sweet. long, long finish is ended by whiskey flavors and warming alcohol. still somehow smooth, though. this took a while just to drink a little bit and i probably could have just one of these in a sitting. a real sipper.
update: have had a few more of these, carbonation has been better, would add some serious charred fruit to the above. have enjoyed it more from the regular taps with the added Co2.

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I promised not to review anything from Dark Lord Day. There was too much happening. This is my one exception. I had glass after glass because several people kept saying wow that it too hot for me here you want to finish mine. Oh my God what were they thinking. This was the most easy drinking whiskey I have ever had. It is certainly closer to bourbon than to beer. The beer seemed much higher than 13% ABV to me but the hot alcohol had the softness of a 10 - 20 year old bourbon. WOW! Everyone who has been to my house knows that Woodford Reserve is my favorite go-to Bourbon. I am not makin this up for the sake of this review. I always have it on hand. Wouldnt you know, the wonderful geniuses at Three Floyds that hand crafted this beer JUST FOR ME, picked my regular bourbon for aging this beer. Yes, This is Dark Lord, aged for a year in none other than Woodford Reserve Bourbon Barrels. Oh my God! I just about passed out this was so freaking good. I went week in the knees and I was not drunk.
Appearance: When I received this beer in a plastic cup there was no head on it. I poured it into my snifter glass and it stirred up very little head but in the glass it did showcase a nice tan head. Several times through drinking this beer various friend emptied there plastic cups into my snifter each time revitalizing a tiny bit of head in this otherwise murky black body. 
Smell: Everything I love about bourbon and more flooded my nose. Rich scent of various woods, just like the Woodford Reserve I makes me think of my freshly moistened humidor. Dark roasted malts and barley, black coffer and thick bitter sweet chocolate and of course a wallop of vanilla oak bourbon flavors.
Taste: The biggest complaint people had on this hot day was the beer is too much like bourbon. If that is the biggest gripe, then gripe on my friends. I LOVE IT! This is absolutely everything I could ever want in a drink. It is the best of both world. It is what I love about two different drinks met in one glass. Yes the alcohol does not hide. So you sip the beer like you would any other liquor. It takes drinking it differently than a more typical beer but it is certainly worth it. The dark chocolate malts and fruits blend right into the woody vanilla oak and somehow it creates what feels like very layers of flavors and leaves your mouth with the feel of bourbon on the tongue and throat and face.
Mouthfeel: The swallow is very hot but the massive rich oily smooth feel coats every inch of your mouth and then some. I can feel the hot alcohol and warm boozy black grains making my face go numb as works its way from my tongue to my cheeks, my tonsils and up through my sinuses until my whole face seems to going flush enjoying the magnificence that this masterpiece exudes. 
Drinkability: When I sit down with my favorite liquor I dont start just putting them back one after another. Drinkability is the duration for which I can enjoy that drink. I would take it slowly, but I could enjoy this dink all day long.
Hope this is helpful.

4.25/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Draft at DLD.
Served dark as night with only a slight ring of head around the perimeter of the glass. Smell is absolutley luxurious. Deep roasted malts, chocolate, and bourbon are the front runners. This is a big beer, no doubt, the alcohol is there and warming.
This beer is mellowed a bit by the oak aging. Not the brute that the DL bottle is. This is a great beer, but not huge and robust as say a GI BCS.
The guys at FFF have taken barrel aging to a whole nother level. Other brewers could take notes from them. 520 charactersFtownThrowDown, May 04, 2007
4.43/5  rDev -2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Was pitch black in color with a brown head that retained very well and managed to leave some lacing behind. Nice aromas of vanilla and bourbon, with oak coming into play as well. There was also some roastiness, but the vanilla and bourbon seemed to be the strongest. Taste is a blending of vanilla, maple syrup, bourbon, wood, with a finish of some coffee and bourbon. Mouthfeel is thick and very smooth, the bourbon seems to almost lighten it up just a tad, however. Carbonation was on the lower side of medium. Great beer, and probably even more enjoyed in the winter months by a fire, but this sample was enjoyed out in the sun at DLD.
If you are desperate to find out what this beer is like, buy a Bourbon County Stout. BCS is 99% of what this beer is, IMO. 764 charactersbadbeer, May 03, 2007

pours deep inky black with a small very fine dense brown head. drops very fast to a ring around the glass. no lace.
aroma is nice. the first thing that hits is a blast of orangey citrus. alcohol. oak and vanilla. dark chocolate. huge bready malt. bourbon.
taste is good. tons of orange and tangerine. alcohol. bittersweet chocolate. bready malt. bit of vanilla. light alcohol. medium bitterness level.
mouthfeel is good. super smooth. light carbonation. full bodied but without feeling thick.

4.67/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3.5On tap at Dark Lord Day 2007-- appearance is slightly damaged by the plastic cup, but I'll try not to hold that against the beer.
The appearance is basically an imperial stout with the knobs turned up to eleven, a mixture of equal parts espresso, roof tar, and castor oil. The head is a dark brown whisp that still manages to leave a little lace on the plastic cup. Bubbles are otherwise nonexistent.
The aroma is coffee, probably the best coffee I've ever smelled in a beer. All the usual suspects are there, too: bourbon, vanilla, maple syrup, molasses, dark malts, oak (wood, really, I don't know if oak smells different from any other wood), and alcohol. 
The taste opens up light with just a little maltiness, folllowed by a swell of coffee and dark malts. Coffee flavor grows continuously to the finish, while maple syrup, vanilla, and woody flavors come in. Maple syrup flavor is stronger the taste than in the aroma. Everything in the nose shows up in the flavor profile, with wood, boubon, and alcohol coming in last. The finish lasts for at least a decade. What I can't believe (and contrary to everything I've been told) is how balanced this is. The beer really handles the coffee beans, the bourbon barrels, and the stupidly high alcohol content unbelievably well, with a flavor profile that's complex instead of overwhelming. 
The mouthfeel is super-thick and viscous, chewy and oily. A little hot (it is 13% ABV after all), but not at all out of control-- pretty much what I'd expect when I wanted a bourbon-aged imperial stout. Carbonation is totally absent and I like it that way.
Drinkable for a 13%ABV oak-aged imperial stout with coffee beans added to it, which is to say, no, for the love of God, don't try drinking twenty of them.
As far as imps are concerned, I think this is about as good as it gets. 1,841 characterskajerm, Apr 30, 2007
4.32/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This is the 2006 Dark Lord, aged for a year in Woodford's Reserve Bourbon Barrels, and released on draught only just in time for the release of the 2007 Dark Lord in bottles. Better than the 2006 non-BA release, though I think the 2007 non-BA Dark Lord is easily better than both. I can't wait for the 2008 Dark Lord Day so I can try the 2007 BA Dark Lord.
The beer pours to a thick dark sludge with very little head, probably destroyed by the spirits it has been aging with. Shows off thick caramel colored legs as it is swished around, and by the time the glass is empty, the glass looks almost like the brown bottle the beer was poured from (err... maybe not, since this is actually a draught, but you get the point).
The smell is great. Has a strong whiff of bourbon/alcohol with vanilla and coconut notes from the barrel. Smells quite sweet, remnant of all of the sugars used in the production of this beer, namely molasses and brown sugar. Little dark roasted malt in the nose, but a generous hit of caramel.
The taste is good. Very rich and sweet up front with a huge taste of bourbon, namely the aforementioned vanilla and coconut. Has a middle taste of rich, dark chocolate, coffee roast, and soy sauce. The finish refuses to go away.
The body is a bit thinner than the non-BA Dark Lord, also with a little less carbonation. Still coats the mouth with a thick molasses consistency. Turns your teeth into a caramel brown color. Not an easy beer to drink on a hot and sunny day after I've already been drinking several beers of considerable strength and body. I REALLY wanted to drink a Gumballhead at that time, but I simply couldn't pass up a one-time opportunity like this. 1,695 charactersneonbrown82, Apr 30, 2007
4.22/5  rDev -6.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4This had a thin, dark brown ring of head at the top of the beer. There was absolutely no carbonation visible and it was like looking at the surface of a still, dark lake. It was black, black, black in color. Even the white bits was black. The nose was hugely sweet and malty with notes of chocolate, vanilla, and bourbon. The mouthfeel was incredibly thick, like pudding. It was incredibly viscous and could probably stand in as heavy-weight motor oil during the summer, in a pinch. There was also an intense heat on the tongue and I simply could not get past the combined heat and bourbon flavor. The finish continued with a lingering heat. 641 characterswoodychandler, May 24, 2006
4.95/5  rDev +9.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5(This was tasted on tap at the DL release day 2006. It was served in a plastic cup and I transferred it to a pint glass).
The head was small and redish tan with some swirls on the top. The appearance of the beer was densely black. 
The smell was of coffee, oak, bourbon, chocolate, rasins and vanilla. Faint hint of hops.
The taste was heavenly! I savored each sip. Rich chocolate, bourbon, rasins and coffee with a slight bitterness at the back end.
The mouthfeel was thick and not too carbonated. This coated the tongue nicely.
Drinkability was wonderful. The aging did this 2005 vintage DL well. The flavors have all blended nicely and the bourbon gives you a real kick in the palate. 
I would have to say that this is the best barrel aged beer I have ever had. I was privilaged to try this one. Way to go Nick and all the folks at Three Floyds!! 867 characterstyee, May 17, 2006
4.55/5  rDev +0.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3(Notes from 2006 Dark Lord release day)
Served in a small opaque plastic cup.
Black with the smallest ruby-port hints with a small old-gold persistent head.
Smell: amazing. The anticipation from the smell is just beyond imagining--my mouth is watering. Dark dried fruit, coffee, caramel, cocoa, and some hops bitterness. Maybe some fennel and licorice? 
Everything in the nose is in the taste plus a rich syrupy dark soy sauce like savoriness. Some bourbon- and vanilla extract- like alcohol, especially in the out breath. Some oak-y barrel and vine threaded through the deep rich flavors. Complex bitterness with hops, coffee, and unsweetened chocolate sharing the spotlight. 
Thick, velvety, oily mouth feel, but not too tongue-coating--I don't feel the need for a tongue scraper after few minutes like some thicker beers leave me.
Here is where I will be controversial. I don't want a bunch of this. It is definitely in the plus 70 cocoa chocolates and port camp in that a small amount satisfies. I want it often, just not glasses of it. 1,058 charactersmonkeytoe, May 10, 2006
4.58/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Sorry to say, I did not like this as much as the Dark Lord in a bottle. The sharpness imparted by the oak aging was almost a non-sequitur amid the usual hearty, strong, nourishing flood of savory liquor that is the Dark Lord. It was almost like having a Dark Lord Boilermaker, and that just doesn't make sense. Maybe with a few years (5 or so) it would be an improvement, but since I didn't enter the lottery for the bottle of Oak Aged Dark Lord, I may never know. 
All this aside, it was one of the best beers I have had the honor to sip. 542 characterslungboy, May 06, 2006
4.69/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Special filled hand bottle from an un-named source creating a raving mystery much like the Dark Lord itself...
Appears a dark black with a small tan head that fades into a a gentle tan collar.
Smell is of rich maple sweet vanilla, dark chocolate, bourbon, oak, fresh brownie batter, and raisins.
Mouthfeel is heavy on the palate, warming, sweet, raisiny, and sticky with a mildly rich burn in the swallow.
Drinkability is pretty good on this despite the instant warming bourbon burn that makes it pretty intense with an alcohol presence. Nice! 547 charactersweeare138, May 04, 2006
4.68/5  rDev +3.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5When every one lined up to get their bottles, I headed straight to the bar to get a little low-ball of a terrific beer.
This beer came a mirrored obsidian with a small collar of tan and copper head. There were also a few mysterious wisps of head swirling about the surface. 
Smelled of gentle fruity bourbon, dark creamy chocolate, maple syrup, chocolate pudding and a warm, aromatic alcohol that hid behind the bourbon and an oak dryness. As it warmed, the alcohol became very (overly?) prominent, but carried with it a sweet vanilla. 
Tasted of pasty, rich chocolate pudding that took root in my tongue and turned it brown (seriously, I checked). Through this floated an electric tingly sting of flowing woody bourbon, fresh cut oak and a Jagermeister-like herbiness. I also got some sweet marachino cherry and creamy oak burps! Never had a stout do that before! Sadly, the alcohol was hot to the point of becoming distracting. 
The mouth feel was heavy as hell with a thick creamy viscosity added by a micro-fine carbonation giving this the feel of pudding. Wheres my spoon! 
This ones just a trip. The alcohol was a little much and could stand to be aged for a while. Hopefully, FFF has a keg of this sitting somewhere waiting to be cracked in a year or so. A cool version of this would be off the charts! 1,328 charactersDarkerTheBetter, May 01, 2006
4.95/5  rDev +9.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My sweet little cup of joy. I saw one of the barrels (a Woodford Reserve barrel! YAY!) at FFF in October, and was nearly in tears, knowing I'd never get to try it. I live in Alabama, and can't just hop on up to the brewpub when something special is on tap....so I was overjoyed to hear it was in the lineup for DLD. Oh JOY!
I forked over my cash, and got my lil' plastic cup. dangit! Spilled a bit on my hand. Never before has my own hand been so lickable. Syrupy, sticky when it dried....oh, a beer-pop would be heaven now.
But seriously....thick black, some slight cola fringe around it, and a deep bronze head that seemes a bit thin, but is adequate...sort of like my brain cells.
On the nose, the bourbon hits right up frount- a nice round, not too sharp bourbon at that. Sweet, dark maltiness follows.
The flavour is paradisal to my humble tongue. Once more, the bourbon up front. Nice and thick and sweet, it almost instantly shuts off and is replaced by coffee and bittersweet chocolate. The bourbon hits again at the end, along with a mellow bitterness.
On the mouth, it's velvety and a little oily all at once- nice and thick, with very little apparent carbonation. Just the way I like it.. ;)
Drinakble? Understatement. If I could have this one on tap all the time, I'd be dead now.
Be well

4.92/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5(Served in a short plastic cup)
A- This beer has an inky black body that stains the side of the cup after each sip the head is a thin cinnamon brown that turns to a small ring around the edge pretty quickly. 
S- The powerful smell of oak and coffee roasted malt come through even as I lift the cup of the table. The complex smell is very smooth and blended but notes of bourbon and coffee come through with faint molasses and a hint of vanilla. 
T- This slightly sweet black malt has flavors similar to the smell with bourbon and vanilla coming through with a nice wood flavor. The soft taste of coffee beans comes through at the finish. 
M- This beer has a full creamy mouthfeel with no alcohol warmth or astringency. 
D- This is what Dark Lord has been missing. I like DL for its big punch in the face flavor but the aged in oak DL is blended all those flavors an added some more mysterious layers. This was truly an amazing beer.
Thanks to Diesel for buying this round. 990 charactersrhoadsrage, May 01, 2006
4.9/5  rDev +8.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served on-tap @ the 2006 Dark Lord Release Party. 
Pours a thick, syrupy black..the head is modest and a dark caramel color. Aroma is heavy coffee, oak, vanilla, and chocolate, with some alcohol creeping out as well. There's definitely an oaky, bourbon kick to it, but the bitter chocolate and roasted coffee flavors still take the stage similar to the bottled Dark Lord. Amazingly balanced between the bold hop character and the array of tastes..just fantastic. Mouthfeel is expectedly thick, and very coating..yet smooth as velvet. Remains remarkably easy to drink for a beer of this magnitude.
Felt privileged to try this one. 631 charactershero27, Apr 30, 2006
5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served at the 2006 Dark Lord release party. $6 per serving - priceless!
Dark that is espected from a monster stout. Fine golden head rest above the darkness of the glass.
Aromal of oak barrel that complements the espresso, dark roasted barleys, chocolate, dark fruit nothing in the Three Floyds pub rivals this aroma.
Taste of decadent dark chocolate espresso malt with prunes, figs and caramel/chocolate-covered-cherries. 
Mouthfeel is prototypical - the oak permeates all and seems to clean up the intense flavors. Alcohol is unnoticable in a sea of aromas and flavors. Perilously drinkable.
The pre- release Imperial Stouts offered up by those making the pilgrimage were a nice prelude but quickly fade from memory with the arrival of this at the booth. An excellent meal from the whole roasted hog added to the experience.
My complements to Nick Floyd and his crew for all their efforts in bringing another excellent vintage of the Dark Lord. Hope to return soon. Enjoy the bottle of Cherry Stout from Missouri! 1,033 characterskarst, Apr 30, 2006

Black as hell. Just dark, and oily. The smell is coffee, caramel, nuts, hops (go figure) and acrid bitters. Hint of anise too.
The taste is rather balanced. Thick as hell too. A lot like Founders KBB in it's bourbon/coffee balance. I really thought this would have a lot more grip to it, but it is deadly smooth.
I cry knowing I have to wait a year to try this again. 417 charactersmurrayswine, Apr 30, 2006

The nose was coffee rich, slight chocolate, but heavy on the bourbon. The tongue has everything you'd expect from a Dark Lord, smoother on the hop,but very rich chocolate, a nice roasted coffee flavor, but once again, a lot of bourbon. I had a bit of a difficulty drinking this one down, the alcohol burn was a bit much for me, I think the beer could do well just aging in a barrel as opposed to a bourbon barrel, that's my two cents though. 555 charactersHoboAGoGo, Apr 30, 2006

Appearance- Given to me an oily, iscous, black. No highlights in this soul stealing, liver pickling bad boy. Head was a lovely coffee like beige with great retention. 
Smell- Like French Roast coffee, bakers bitter chocolate, with hints of heavy whipping cream and cascade hops. 
Taste- Very dense and thick in the coffee department. But this taste does not let you forget that it was aged in a barrel. The wood sugars certainly give your balls a hows your father. Coffee and oak mixed with some black licorice and a well balanced American hop and malt balance. 
Mouthfeel- Very oily, sludgy and thick. This is a dense beer with a lot of palate coating ability. All the dark flavors really stick to the palate the most, all parts of the tongue. Something to nibble on chocolate with. 872 charactersscruffwhor, Apr 29, 2006

Huge beer, delicious cappuccino, fresh coffee grounds, toasty coconut, malty caramel, and dark choclate, heavy cream, honey, mollasses. Massive and uncannily silky smooth. Slight alcohol burn in the chest. Somewhat high is residual sweetness but not coyingly so. Could drink this monster all day long if the high alcohol doesn't get you first.
