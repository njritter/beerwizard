Bourbon finishing it off. The lingering flavor is that dark chocolate, bourbon taste. Mouthfeel is pretty smooth, velvety, somewhat low carbonation is perfect. Overall- very delicious beer. Very sweet. Quite the dessert. The flavors all mix real well. Loving this. 557 charactersNoYouDidnt, Apr 25, 2017

My virgin pallette has problems distinguishing this style from many of the BA stouts I've tried. Maybe a little sweeter and not quite as dark but I still can't quite see what divides the two (open to suggestions and I'll be reading more about what goes into and is expected of a barleywine).
Pours a really dark brown reddish color with a finger of tan head. Initial aromas of barrel, bourbon, dark fruit, some toffee like sweetness.
Taste is definitely bourbon up front followed with the plum figgy sweetness.
I took my time on this one (a little over an hour with a few sips to go), as it warmed it seemed sweeter, a little syrupy, maybe some cherry there too.
Regardless of my inability to distinguish the style this was quite tasty! 805 charactersJBowenGeorgia, Apr 17, 2017

Half a finger of light brown foam that recedes quickly to a small ring around the glass. No lacing. The aroma is phenomenal. Big bourbon and oak character, slight spice notes. The barleywine gives notes of raisins, figs, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla. Absolutely delicious. Bourbon hits most powerfully. Also dark fruits, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, caramel. Very rich, sweet, and a slight lingering bitterness of the finish. Full bodied, low carbonation, and a balanced finish. Some alcohol heat and again, that slight bitterness on the aftertaste. Unquestionably a top tier BA barleywine. 664 charactersBSiegs, Apr 15, 2017

Misc.: Bottled on Oct. 18, 2016; 2016 version is 13.6 pct. alcohol
Huge get to see this in the stores earlier today. Said I would come back and did about 10 minutes later. Wasn’t mad about the $14.99 price. Seemed fair considering the style and it being the first time I had seen this variant in stores. Super excited for this beer.
Poured a dark-to-light black brown color (almost black) with 1-to-2 fingers of fizzy tan head. Light bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass at certain spots. Average watery lacing. Below average retention. (Sight - 3.25)
Smelled dueling notes of boozy bourbon, leathery oak and earthy tobacco up front. Also got chewy caramel squares, toffee, smooth milk chocolate, thick molasses, subdued vanilla, and hints of dark fruits. Seemed just a tad hot early, but was smoothing out toward the end. (Smell - 4.25)
Tasted much better than the nose initially. Got chewy caramel, tobacco, oaky bourbon, vanilla, toffee, sugary milk chocolate, rich molasses, honey (wishful?), maple syrup, dark plum notes and subtle hints of woody anise. (Taste - 4.75)
Full body. Sticky texture. Average carbonation. Long, smooth, warming finish. (Feel - 4.75)
Very good. Was all over the place on the ratings. Not as good as I was hoping, but still just an exceptional beer. Would like to see a bottle of this sit for a bit. (Overall - 4.50)

$12.79 @ Spaz Beverage, West Chester, PA
Notes via stream of consciousness: 2016, listed at 13.6% ABV. Not a lot of head. I had to force it up and then it dropped away fairly readily. I find that odd. It's got to have a lot of malt to it, and it's not that much alcohol. Odd. What I got was beige, about a finger thick, and fairly creamy. The body is a hazy dark mahogany brown with some ruby and orange highlights when held to the light. No surprise in the aroma. It's malty, reminiscent of Ovaltine, and Bourbon soaked - Bourbon itself, and oak - a little dark skinned fruit as well. The flavor is much, much bigger! It's almost too much. I don't really see this as a barleywine, it's more of a Bourbon barrel beer. Not that I can't see the barleywine aspect of it, but the Bourbon and wood ride roughshod over it. Wow! It's a head turner, and eye opener, whatever you want to call it, it's BOLD in capital letters. Notes of cereal grains, Bourbon, caramel, coconut, oak, toffee, vanilla, subtle dark skinned fruit, brown sugar, almost burnt sugar, molasses, raw honey, grass, cherry pit, almond, and perhaps leather. I would imagine that I could keep going on, that it'll evolve as your palate adapts to it and its alcoholic strength, which, by the way, helps to balance it. It's pretty strong, and with the sweetness it's reminiscent of Bourbon to me. I had an Even Williams last night, and I can see a similarity. Ahh, I see the bottle also mentions tobacco, I get that. I think I like the Bourbon County Stout better, but then again that's really a Bourbon barrel beer as well, rather than a stout that's Bourbon barrel aged, although closer. Is it possible to have too much Bourbon barrel goodness? I think... both the stout and the barleywine... there's not another beer in the world like them. Some may come close but none have the richness. Leave it to Americans to take it to the limit, right? Thomas Hardy's or Samichlaus used to be my big beers, and then came Sam Adam's Triple Bock and World Wide Stout, (now I'm showing my age) but these beers are just that much better - "These go to eleven". 2,247 charactersNeroFiddled, Mar 08, 2017

3.96/5  rDev -11.8%look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Wow can't believe I haven't reviewed this gem yet.   An interesting color, has that earthy presence of brown, dark red going on for it.  Beige head only props up to about 1/4" and quickly recedes.  Aroma is very little bourbon actually.  Goes more for the earthen dirt, tobacco, vanilla in the nose.
Taste is nice.  Nice and smooth.  The barrel notes come out a little more, this is a nicer, easier drink than the bourbon county stout.  Not as hot either it seems.  Just less barrel impact on this one, but still a worthy contribution.   Carbonation is spot on in the mouth feel, a mild dark fruit presence and bitterness, comes out more as it warms.  Brown malt and toffee notes.  Its weird, as heavy as BCS stout goes in on the barrel power, this one is much more restrained.  Both good, but each year, becomes less and less of a good value as the cost per oz goes up and the formatting goes meh. 899 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 02, 2017

Either way, chill it, pour it, let it sit around for a bit, and then dive into a smooth, thick, luxurious pool of sweet malt, cherry esters, and just enough vanilla and oak bourbon barrel impression to make this one a standout. 482 charactersjmasher85, Mar 02, 2017

Pours a deep garnet, ruby-red with tinges of lighter hue at the edges. A small head surfaces after a rough pour but quickly fades. Looks like flat cola. Aroma is stewed dark fruits, roasted malt, oak, bourbon and vanilla. Outstanding aroma. It pulls you in like a tractor beam for your first sip. Taste is dark rich fruits - raisin, plums, dates, figs - dark roasted malt, sweet bread, toasted coconut, vanilla, oak. The bourbon is there as warmth not heat but it slows you down. Luscious mouthfeel as the liquid coats your palate. Slightly sweet due to the fruits. Amazing beer; second in style only to Sucaba, and that would probably change depending on my mood. Epic. 741 charactersManapuaMan, Feb 26, 2017

4.09/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Reddish brown with a thin half-finger of tan head that's quick to dissipate into a crown.
Bourbon forward aroma with strong vanilla notes, followed by fig, plum, toffee, black bread and a touch of alcohol.  
The tastes are less distinctive, with chocolate, dark bread, vanilla, caramel and fruit blended together into a smooth and creamy concoction that's cut by strong carbonation.  The fruit stands out more when I lick what's caught in my whiskers, and there's a strong bourbon alcohol burn and a nice balancing bitterness on the backend.  Gives way to a cough medicine cherry sweetness in the aftertaste.  
A bit of the leather I like in an English barleywine peaks through from behind the vanilla, chocolate and cream as it warms.  Honestly, the chocolate surprised me.
I love regular BCBS for its smooth, creamy goodness.  To my taste, for a barleywine, this is too smooth.  There's not enough depth of flavor here.  It's too polished.  I'm not getting any tobacco, oak or much else to really hold my interest.  Goes down way too fast and easy.  With a beer this big, and this expensive, I prefer slow sippers that keep me pondering.  
I'm not saying this isn't excellent.  I just prefer something a little rougher around the edges. 1,243 charactersthebeers, Feb 20, 2017

It's the densest barleywine i've ever seen. Dark brown and translucent, almost like maple syrup. Barely any sign of carbonation.
Smell is rich and savory. Figs and raisins, caramel, honey, brown sugar. A little bit leathery.
Same flavor notes, but super smooth.
Feel is excellent. Dense and oily. Smooth and creamy. Alcohol is almost completely hidden. No heat or burn despite the 12.3% ABV.
This is the best BA barleywine I've ever had. We're drinking this 2014 BCBBW side-by-side with Sucaba 2015 and Central Waters 2015 BA barleywine. They all good, but BCBBW is the clear winner, by far. 637 charactersccg, Feb 17, 2017

13.6% so dwamm
pours a deep deep mahogany to the point of it nearly being black. solid head to this as well, looks good.
smell is beautifully sweet. clearly a barleywine and also clearly a barrel aged beer. notes of barleywine and whiskey shine through. the aroma is nice too, mellow notes of whiskey with barleywine sweetness.
the taste is like velvet. like sweet barleywine with bourbon creeping in. very smooth and nice, light alcohol burn at the end but this is really nice.
i LOVE beer and i also LOVE bourbon but i usually hate barrel aged beer (for some odd reason). this is really nice. obviously a BIG beer at 13%+ but this is smooth and velvety. tons of flavor to this and easy to drink, quite the nice sipper 778 charactersWiffler27, Feb 05, 2017

Aroma of brown sugar, caramel, dark plummy fruit, oak, bourbon, and vanilla. The sweet aroma leads to a blast of caramel and burnt sugar on the palate with bourbon and dark fruit in the palate. Sweet but not too sweet. Wonderfully complex with a finish that brings notes of tobacco leaf, fig, plum, milk chocolate and vanilla. 390 charactersspark3148857, Jan 16, 2017
3.91/5  rDev -12.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75I was lucky enough to score this at my local liquor store without having to go to one of the big chains that are around here.  Finally getting around to trying this beauty after buying it over a month ago.  This beer pours a dark ruby color that is mostly opaque so that I cannot see what type of carbonation is present.  The head is dark khaki and a fizzy froth that dissipates quite quickly to a rocky layer with a neck that is retained.  4/5  The aroma is very fruity and malty with red wine grapes, dates, rains, toffee, caramel, charred wood, dark toasted bread, and plums as the primary notes.  The aroma really is much more like a wine than a beer.  As the beer sits, a bit of smokiness comes out along with a hint of tobacco and baker's chocolate.  Very complex and deep.  4.25/5  Toffee, caramel, and candi sugar come out right away before exploding into red wine grapes (more of a sweet red table wine than the dry reds), plums, dates, and raisins.  This fruitiness is very powerful and dominates that palate.  The dark chocolate does not really come out in the flavor for me like it did in the aroma, but the charred wood and tobacco do come out, mainly in the final third.  There is an earthiness/mustiness (sorghum) that runs concurrent with all other notes throughout the profile along with just a slight booziness.  This thing is after all 12.9%, so that's not surprising.  Bitterness is incredibly light, with the mustiness and booziness being the lingering notes.  3.75/5  A very light carbonation tickle develops on the tongue before leading into the full bodied nature of the beer.  A light dryness develops on the back of the tongue over time which lingers on the tongue just a bit.  4/5  I like this beer, although it's not my favorite.  The sorghum mustiness and earthiness throws me for a loop, even with everything else that is going on here.  Very complex and a great beer to sip on one in a while, but definitely not something that I would go for on a consistent basis.  3.75/5 2,003 charactersbwood06, Jan 16, 2017

Light in the edges of the glass is able to pierce through the beer. For the first time ever, I can see actual alcohol legs on a beer. Carbonation seems minimal, as the head was small and I don't see much activity bubble wise
Smell: Bourbon is what I initially get, as well as raisin. swirling brings out more caramel/toffee notes to the forefront. 
Taste: Bourbon, dark fruit, some toffee peaks it head, as does brown sugar 
Feel: I get a nice syrupy feel, minimal bitterness, and some carbonation. This is a nice feel, and typical of the style.
Overall: I've had BCBS a few times, and I'd say that the barleywine holds up. I like the bourbon flavors imparted, and some of the complexity, but it's not my top BA Barleywine 781 charactersCfred371, Jan 12, 2017

Smell is toasty toffee and nuts, graham, heavy and dark raisin, deep but faint char, and an abundance of dates.
Taste is very deep--almost as if roasted--raisin, with gingersnaps, molasses, chocolate covered dates, and charred oak, finishing with a hint of raspberry and bourbon toffee.
Feel is sticky up front, thick for a barleywine, with a nice light froth, a little sting on the way down while a bit sticky again.
BCBW almost transitions into a stout at room temp. Almost. It is definitely more intense and rich than most BBBWs.
2014 vintage
----
What follows is a separate review for the 2016 vintage, as it is the first time this beer has been aged strictly in second-use barrels which had only held bourbon. Prior to this vintage, BCBW had been a blend of barleywine aged both in regular bourbon barrels as well as bourbon barrels that held BCBS.
Appearance isn't all that different, possibly darker, much darker than most Barleywines, almost like melted dark chocolate.
Smell is smooth, delicate leather, oak, vanilla, bourbon, then it gets a little hotter in aroma, to almost brandy levels, with molasses, spiced date, and sassafras.
Taste is sweet grape, date, dark cherry, and prune, with charred oak, dark ginger snap, and bourbon, as hints of coconut and raspberry rise back up through the nose. Deep, dark, complex spiced raisin is always present in the background with a little rich toastiness and woodiness.
Feel is thick and almost gooey, enveloping the palate, with a little sting and some minimal tangy fizz, going down warm and finishing slightly dry, slightly sticky. Wow, for a big ole Barleywine, this is exceptionally smooth and drinkable. So rounded.
I actually think I like the new version better than the 2014 I'd had, and considering my belief that Barleywine's tend to get better with age, this is saying a lot! 2,041 charactersSabtos, Jan 07, 2017
4.01/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A majestic deep ruby in the light, with a moonlit rim of a head. The aroma is plenty nice, but light for the style. Candied dates and maple syrup mature under the impression of oak and black cherries. Dark berries and figs are both sweet and sophisticated. However, were it not for the delicacy of the overall flavor profile, the melanoidins' sticky candy characteristics would carry things into cloying territory. Less complex than other barleywines, this beer pleads for a dash of spice and/or or bitters. Some additional layers of smoke and vanilla bean can be appreciated, however, as it opens, and a real-deal maple syrup flavor hunkers down in the aftertaste. The mouthfeel is excellent: medium-full bodied, with a chewy creaminess which makes the flavors stick to the lips, the teeth, the tip of the tongue. This beer needs some time and warmth to show it's full colors, which may not be the absolute best the barleywine world has to offer, but are certainly not without unique merits. 992 charactersBethanyB, Jan 07, 2017

4.99/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Look:  darker than I expected for a barleywine.  Very dark brown, not a lot of carbonation or head.
Smell:  The warm malty-toffee-vanilla smell you expect from a barleywine with oaky bourbon smell too.
Taste:  A little sweet, malty-toffee-vanilla.  And the bourbon really shows through, much more than the stout.  You even get a little burn (very little, but noticeable), which normally I don't like, but it works with this one for some reason.
Feel:  goes down surprisingly easy for a beer that has a little bit of a burn from the bourbon.
Overall:  Fantastic.  I really don't know how this beer could be better.  Say what you want about Goose Island, but they are at the absolute top of the game when it comes to barrel aging.  A lot of breweries just take a good beer and put it in a good barrel, and it ends up good.  Goose Island seems to design the beers and select the barrels specifically so they will go well together, and it ends up fantastic.
This beer is just awesome. 985 charactersminiditka77, Jan 02, 2017

The only thing I might add is the honey, as typical of many barleywines, on the very front of the first sip. Wonderful complexity in the flavor. Great viscosity and mouthfeel. Absolute decadence in a glass. 285 charactersbonesTdog, Dec 10, 2016

4.58/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On the flag wrapped around the neck of the bottle: "2016"
On the rear label: "BOTTLED ON: 18OCT16 1107 13.6% ALC/VOL"
Appearance: The body of the beer is a dark tawny brown that mixes with black. The head is a short-lived fizzy and foamy light tan and tobacco stained yellow. No head retention although it does maintain a very thin ring around the glass.
Aroma: It has a very sweet caramel aroma that is strong. There is also a woody oak aroma. It smells very nice but not a lot of complexity.
Taste: The flavor is amazing. I am getting a wonderful chocolate flavor with a bit of coffee and a sweet rich caramel flavor. The caramel flavor actually tastes better than most caramels I can buy in candy stores. There is this sweet slightly vanilla tasting finish that is great. I'm sitting here trying to think if there is anything that I don't like in the flavor and I am left without a single thing. It's perfect. I could drink this forever and be happy.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel on this beer is perfect. It literally could not be improved upon. It is nice and thick without being heavy. It coats the mouth like liquid chocolate and the texture alone just makes you want to take another sip.
Overall: When I smelled the beer I wasn't very impressed. I have had other Barleywines that had a lot more complexity with a breadth of aromas to keep you lingering at the rim of the glass for days. This beer smelled nice but it just wasn't very diverse. All of this was shot out of the sky when I tasted the beer. It is fantastic. I was hit by this wonderful well rounded texture that just lathered my palate with wonderful flavors. Everything is just so well put together in this beer that it makes you want to stay in the moment and enjoy the bottle forever. I want to touch on the fact that this is a 13.6% ABV beer aged in bourbon barrels and at no point did it taste or smell like an alcohol swab. I would not only highly recommend this beer but I would go as far as to recommend going out of your way to get it if you can. This beer was bottled less than six weeks ago and it already has enough age on it to drink right now. I will be buying it again. 2,154 charactersteromous, Dec 01, 2016

Didn't have last 2 years. Did read used first run  barrels this time, did that make the difference? IDK. What I do know is this maybe better than the 2016 stout I had yesterday ... and now I wish I would've got the other 2 (maybe 3 more if I would've bugged) had the chance to yesterday. On the other hand, 4 paks of Backwoods Bastard are still available for the same $12.
Burgundy, beautiful, second pour an improvement in appearance over the first. The crimson highlighting I love,
 and now it looks alive in teh snifter. Huge aroma. whiskey, barrel, caramel, vanilla forward as advertised. Taste to 
follow, huge whiskey barrel, vanilla, caramel, fresh and dark fruits, smooooooth. Mouthfeel spot on perfect, thick 
and so rich, liquid desert. Perfect.
OK, along with this years Parabola (another surprise) the best beer Ive had this year. And I only got one? that's what I hate about limited beer, chances are I could've felt the same meh I felt 2 years ago and regretted my 3 or 4 
purchase. so I'm gonna say Fuck limited beer ... Enjoyed at 4 AM I woke up in anticipation of trying this ... Outstanding. 1,214 charactersRacerX5k, Nov 26, 2016

L: light darkness, red hue, no head. 
S: sharp and sour, not unlike cherry. No notes of bourbon. 
T: follows smell. A tart sourness. No maltiness, no notes of bourbon. Still syrup sweetness. Everything is masked by a sour funk and it holds none of its original features. 
F: viscous but very thin for the style. 
O: as GI releases BCBS today, I revisit this brew to reminded myself of last year's failure. Under normal situations, this barley-wine is a fine brew. But I can only review what is given... and it is a mess. Frankly, it is a sour, sweet mass that shows the horrors of "spontaneous fermentation." Any bourbon flavor has been destroyed. The sweet maltiness? Transformed into some sort of rotten cherry. While lines form at bottle shops around the country, I doubt few would wait for this offering despite GI's claims that some may enjoy it. Perhaps they right the ship this year. last years venture is certainly worth forgetting. 977 charactersnola1988, Nov 26, 2016

L - 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours a thick ruby hued mahogany color with thin white head. Thick alcohol on the glass. It's extremely, extremely viscous and I'm hopeful the mouthfeel is as thick and chewy as BCBS.
S - White grapes, doughy yeast, figs, raisens, mild alcohol, leather, champagne all mixed into one seemless aroma.
T - mmm. Brown sugar and molasses. Stupid sweet. The alcohol is there but it isn't hot at all... Though this has had over three years to mellow. Very little to no detectable bitterness. Heavy, heavy on the fruit with a tobacco like smoke on the backend. 
M - Love it. It's everything I ever wanted in a >12% beer. It's a meal with it's chewy syrupy goodness.
O - Love it. 743 charactersrypkr, Nov 21, 2016

Dark mahogany body with some sediment that eventually settles to the bottom of the glass. 
Aroma: ABV over 12% is evident, as is bourbon barrel.  Hints of dark dried fruits, vanilla, dried cherries, and wood. 
Flavor: less boozy, but no less complex than the aroma suggests. Lightly sweet.  Very rich.
Feel: full, creamy smooth body with well hidden alcohol.

Getting some bourbon notes as it warms. Dark fruit on the tongue, reminiscent of the best Thomas Hardy's Ale or JW Lees Harvest Ales, Additional depth comes from the barrel aging. Three years of aging has moderated the heat from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is suitably syrupy. Barleywines are not my favorite thing, but this is really really good. Would like be to try one fresh, 477 characterskwakwhore, Sep 12, 2016
4.65/5  rDev +3.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Picked up a single of the 2014 edition at the Tops Liquors 2015 Black Friday event for $6.99.  Bottled on 9-18-14.
Beer poured a deep reddish brown with a smallish off white head on the initial pour.
Nose is wonderful, toffee, vanilla, oaken barrel, and bourbon round very nicely together.
Taste has hints of bourbon, vanilla, a touch of leather, and toffee meld together very well.
Mouthfeel is medium to full bodied and very smooth.
Overall this is an awesome beer, definitely one worth seeking out.  Unfortunately with the 2015 release disaster has left me questioning whether I should stand in line for two hours again in cold Phoenix weather for something that might be tainted.  But this edition is swaying me to be one of the crazies out there on Black Friday!
6-24-17:  Drinking the 2016 edition, it is awesome!  Rates up there with the FW Anniversary ales and Sucaba/Abacus.  Bourbon, Vanilla, leather, moderate alcohol warming all melding together extremely well - what an enjoyable brew! 1,004 charactersarizcards, Sep 11, 2016

Pours a murky translucent dark mahogany. Head is a bit foamy and disapates quickly. I found it a rather ugly beer. But the aroma was lovely -- bourbon forward, a bit of Sherry oxidation, smells sweet and boozy. 
The tastes followed suit. Pretty much exactly what one would expect. Much like BCBS...but a bit less boozy perhaps, and definitely less roasty. There's a hint of cocoa powder in the taste, but it's far more raisin and plum forward. Sticky caramel. A bit of oak. Possibly a hint of vanilla and spice if I search for it. Mouthfeel is pretty sticky and lush. Still quite a bit of alcohol burn after 18 months in the bottle.
Enjoyable, if rather un-memorable. Maybe it's just too similar to what I would expect of a beer aged in BCBS barrels, exhibiting so many of the flavors i have enjoyed so many times in their stout. I guess i was secretly hoping for a more significant contrast. I would want to try some other BA Barleywines before I return to this one again. 1,010 charactersPDXAmbassador, Jul 17, 2016

Bottle
Appearance: Dark-brown root beer color with a small light beige head that slowly faded to a ring.
Smell: Bourbon, brown sugar/toffee, mild vanilla, and moderate dark fruit notes.
Taste: Upfront bourbon, brown sugar notes followed by toffee, vanilla, modest oak, , and some dark fruit notes. The beer is mildly sweet initially but the finish is reasonably dry with tannic oak notes present in the end. Very restrained alcohol presence
Mouth-feel: On the heavy side of medium bodied with a modest level of carbonation. Very nice.
Overall: 2013 Vintage but this one has held up well.  A top notch English Barleywine. 638 charactersIKR, Jul 10, 2016

Pours a dark brown color with glowing ember hints, woven into the beers appearance, which comes along with almost no head at all. It produces a small, bubbly ring of lacing, revealing alcohol legs after swirling.
Smells of bright, sugar coated malts and boozy, ripe plums. Bakers chocolate blends into molasses and a warming oak quality. Roasted walnut shell compliments dried, scented wood and sun burned earth.
Has a pleasantly low carbonation, while featuring a decadent huge, sweet body, defined by sweet malts together with a spicy, oaken dryness. Does not have the thick, creamy mouthfeel the regular version provides, although it offers a pleasant silkness on the tongue.
Tastes of soft earth, hazelnuts, toasted malts and melted caramel among dried, sweet plums. Creates a pleasant sweetness of milk chocolate, wild honey, rock sugar and licorice, finding its balance in the dry, spicy Boubon barrel. Finishes with caramel, fudge and more molasses and a pleasant, boozy dryness, with a nice, bubbly refreshment from the carbonation, preventing the beer from becoming cloyingly sweet. 
Comes very well together, its prominent, taste defining sweeter qualities find their balance in the perfect nuanced Bourbon barrel, which provides enough body to the malts to make this interesting till the last sip. 1,345 charactersaleigator, May 17, 2016
5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5OK, first of all: this is the best BBA beer I've ever had. 
Once you open the bottle, the aroma is intoxicating. Maple syrup, toasty bourbon, caramel, molasses, have mercy. Once of the best-smelling BBA beer's I've ever had, too.
Taste is...wow. So good. Thick, dense, formidable. I've had a lot of BBA's, and many times, the bourbon is simply ttoo overwhelming, taking away from other base ingredients. Not so with Goose Island's. The bourbon is smack-your-lips tasty, sweet, and residual. Aftertaste is very pleasant; I was going to smoke a cigar with this one, but I didn't want to do anything to change the flavor. Caramel chocolate, mocha, vanilla. Wow.
Very warming. I got shivers from drinking it. 
Overall, I'm glad I picked it up. I love great beers, but I normally avoid going over $15 for a bottle - still, I'm very happy with this selection. A must-try. Definitely looking forward to trying the other Bourbon County's by Goose! (I stumbled upon this one in a janky, sketchy-looking liquor store on the way home. Can't judge a liquor store by the outside!) 1,071 charactersFinestCityBeerGuy, May 17, 2016

This beer is simply amazing.  It has great thickness and feel, and the nose and flavors are phenomenal.  Notes of vanilla, oak, and chocolate shine through.  The bourbon heat is perfect.  It was so good that I had trouble letting it warm up further to see how it changes.
Overall, an amazing beer and something I will look to attain at all costs. 363 charactersnawpnawp, May 15, 2016

Poured into a snifter.
A - Pours a very dark brown, maybe black, with a small tan head that settles quickly to a very thin ring.
S - Aroma is molasses and raisins and bourbon.
T - There's a lot going on here. A lot of raisin or prune, vanilla and bourbon.  If this beer was hot when new it has certainly mellowed over the year into warm perfection.
M - Carbonation is low. Mouth feel is creamy and a little sticky.
O - I like barleywines and this is the finest I have ever tasted. I don't know how anyone could do better.

Pours a deep ruby, brownish as well.  Cloudy, not much head or lacing.  Smell brings malt, plums, dates, prunes, figs, bourbon, some oak, some vanilla.  Smells great.  The taste is where this baby really kicks in.  Malt, bourbon- more as it warms, vanilla, figs, dates, prunes, some oak, raisins, caramel, some cherries.  The depth of the flavor is what I think sets it apart.  Very smooth, great body, the taste lingers on the tongue.
This one is a Hall of Famer, for me.  So well blended, such depth in both the flavor and aroma.  Still not easy to get, but if you have the chance, and it's at the intended price, go for it. 710 charactersstortore, Apr 26, 2016

Not much head or lacing left behind. 8oz from the tap poured at 45 degree angle into a snifter. Aroma is ripe with sweet toffee and caramel notes with a blast of malts. Huge notes of caramel and toffee in the taste. Sublime, but a little sweet. As it warms up, the bourbon and oak start to show up at the finish of the beer. Medium-length finish. Mouth feel is bold, robust, filling, and full. Overall, amazing, but not a 100% for me. Definitely worth a try though.

L: Pours a near-black with minimal foam. Fairly clear, with tinges of mahogany around the edges and an off-white head.
S: Lots of oak, with big notes of vanilla, chocolate syrup and rich, smooth wheated bourbon. Very sweet and bready, with pastries and lots of caramel and a touch of grassy hops. Absolutely delicious on the nose.
T: Bread, dark fruits and vanilla right off the bat. Very deep and rich with lots of nuanced oak and sweet bourbon notes. Sweet, boozy oaky finish. Really well put-together.
F: Very full-bodied, with very moderate, creamy carbonation. Huge chewy mouthfeel, with a nice slickness and a pretty decent amount of heat in the finish.
Thoughts: A more delicious dessert beer I have difficulty conjuring up. So rich, nice balance of flavors and great bourbon and oak notes. Not sure why it took me this long to try this one, it’s superb. I would gladly  take this over BCBS any day of the week. 938 charactersthepenguin, Mar 08, 2016

4.55/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I believe the 2013 release was the first and I shared it at Thanksgiving 2015.
As highly-rated as this offering is, I believe they are still figuring it out.
While the interplay of stout and whiskey flavors certainly are rich, they also seem difficult to predict and, hence, when to drink.
I have some form of notes on at least ten of the most popular 50 barleywines. 
While I give preference to local brewers for my first review in a BA style, I'm guessing that when the dozen reviews are done, Bourbon County will be very, very close to the top. 548 charactersBeginner2, Feb 26, 2016

Pitch black with no discernable head.  Vanilla and bourbon on the nose.  Sweet and syrupy with a plethora of flavours; burnt sugar, vanilla, toffee.  Boozy but very pleasant.  A real treat! 196 charactersCoronaeus, Feb 20, 2016

Looks: It's a Bourbon County, with some ruby tints and a hair of transparency compared to BCBS. 
Smell: Bourbon, incredibly stout like compared to some other barleywines, e.g. sucaba. Boozy, vanilla, leathery tobacco as described by others (love that "leathery tobacco" is a positive)
Taste: Booze is very disguised, big and sweet like a bourbon county. It keeps changing as I drink it.
Feel: Motor oil viscosity. Usually the thicker the better for me, I've never had a BA stout where I said to myself "this is too thick" or syrupy.
Overall: Like others have said this is a different barleywine, drinking more like a BA stout, which greatly appeals to me. 2+ years has done it good but I honestly don't think it tastes that different than the 2014, and 2015 BC Barleywine. Would enjoy again, again, and again, looking forward to how it tastes with another two years on it. 914 charactersShermski, Feb 20, 2016

Looks: Pours a dark crimson color which looks completely black in the glass. No light shines through and almost no head formation which I would expect from a 12.9% beer.
Smell: Bourbon, raisin, fig, cherry, tons of dark fruit if you can't tell already. Also a sweet almost leather aroma going for it. Really awesome smelling stuff.
Taste: The taste follows the aroma exactly with a huge dark fruit palate. Definitely has that sweet, vanilla, oak Bourbon County taste to it with is just out of this world.
Feel: Thick, full bodied feel on this beer. Mouthfeel perfectly compliments the taste, wouldn't ask for any thiner or thicker.
Overall: Its hard to pick out a negative from this beer. Everything just seems to work. I am not normally a barleywine kind of guy but this beer is just amazing. Perfect mouthfeel, huge bourbon notes, tons of dark fruit and vanilla. This beer hits on every mark! 1,096 charactersThat_Bearded_Guy, Feb 05, 2016

Tastes slightly tangy with malty finish. Overall much more drinkable than other Bourbon Counties.  I don't know if the tanginess was intentional but it really adds to the complexity and drinkability. Brew more like this. 324 charactersYeastInception, Feb 05, 2016

Smell is hints of bourbon, but faint enough to let the dark fruits poke through the nose. Really inviting aroma. Feels creamy with light carbonation, medium to high bitterness. 
Taste is layers of raisin and oak and some other fruits. Not a significant bourbon taste, which might be well blended in, but either way it all blends wonderfully. I'm not huge on Barleywine but I could drink this all day. 
Overall this is nice and sweet but has a strong malty backbone that balances it perfectly. One of the most enjoyable beers I've ever had. 699 charactersGreatStoutman, Jan 23, 2016

Definitely infected. Earlier bottle had a slight cherry taste - this bottle has fully developed sour and cardboard flavored. Highly carbonated but looks fine - dark root beer color with some garnet at edges. Smell is larger yeast, cardboard and a sour aroma. Taste follows with an acidic carmel blend with some cherry at the finish. Not enjoyable. Overall not a good follow for the big-beer/craft alliance. Thought qc was their strong suit.. 467 charactersJoeySchlitz, Jan 23, 2016

Look - Little to no head. More on second warmer pour. It was tan. No lacing. Dark Ruby red.
Smell - Booze. Fruit. Raspberry. Raisin. Chocolate. Vanilla.
Taste - Booze. Fruit. Raspberry. Raisin. Chocolate. Vanilla. Plum.
Feel - Heavy. Doesn't sit well but expected. Not as mellow as I hoped. Dries up with an alcohol burn.
Overall - Surprised when the bartender brought me a 2014. Not too far off from 2015 even with age. 528 charactersmadelfonatree, Jan 18, 2016

Had a very strong lacto taste on the end. I also am not a huge BW fan in general its just not my go to style. This pour from the 500ml bottle into a teku glass, it pours a dark ruby color with minimal head and translucent. Just off appearance and taste this is much thinner than the regular BCBS. SImilar bourbon and vanilla oaky notes like other BCBS variants. Tons of dark fruit and raisins on the taste, some heat to this with a bad lacto finish that clearly wasnt supposed to be in this beer. I would try this again for older vintages to see how it was supposed to taste. 689 charactersvicinandp, Jan 12, 2016

Consumed: 1.8.16
A: 4.5 Pours dark, reddish-brown, nearly black. The small, light tan head lasts about half a minute.
S: 4.5 Aromas are great; a really nice blend of classic, English barleywine flavors and bourbon. Lots of vanilla, oak, toffee, caramel, cherries and brandy. Faint roasted malt and earthy aromas in there as well. 
T: 4.5 Taste is rather sweet, but offset slightly by some roast bitterness. Similar flavors as the nose suggested with caramel, bourbon, and berries dominating a bit more than expected. The finish has a really nice, raspberry and dark chocolate quality that lingers for a very long time.
M: 4.5 Good body and carbonation. Intense, but still surprisingly drinkable.
O: 4.5 Was worried about possible infection, but no problems here. Pretty terrific barleywine, up there with Sucaba. This vintage is a little more restrained and less sweet than 2013 and 2014, which is appreciated. 962 charactersTele, Jan 09, 2016

Bottle to Snifter.
I obviously sold this beer a little short in 2014.   WOW!    So much toasted coconut, vanilla and leathery tanin's that make this wonderfully delicious.   Was the last beer in a 7 beer tasting flight with MCD   (Terrapin Krunkles Down Under, RR Redemption, Dogfish Head WWS, Magic Hat #9, Weyerbacher Sunday Mole, Abyss), and despite the quality of the others, this still stood out as one of the best.

Smell - The nose was modestly boozy with malty notes. 
Taste - The first impression is light booze. Other notes include caramel, root beer, and sweet boozy malts. The booze blends well with the sweetness that clings to the tongue through the aftertaste. 
Mouthfeel - I expected a little more thickness in this one. There was still some stickiness that allows lingering. 
Overall - It is not perfect, but certainly very good. 535 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jan 03, 2016

Pours a translucent dark brown with reddish tint and with a very small and quickly dissipating head.  Very bold aromas, with dark fruits dominating and bourbon sweetness very apparent in the nose.  Taste is great - very much like a late harvest Zinfandel, but without the vinous qualities from grapes.  Lots of raisin, plum, brown sugar, bourbon, candy.  Very much a dessert beer.  Mouth feel is just right for a barleywine - medium-full, low carbonation, yet not overly sweet or cloying.  Overall, a wonderful barleywine. 608 charactersFFreak, Jan 01, 2016

4.26/5  rDev -5.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured into a Fremont small snifter. 2015 edition (12.9%). Pours a very dark mahogany brown, appearing opaque black in the glass, with a thin khaki head that dissipates to a thin ring with light lacing. Aroma of sweet caramel malt, fresh and dried plums, raisins, figs  and dates, light bourbon and oak. Flavor follows, with rich fresh and dried plum, dark dried fruit, bourbon and oaky vanilla, finishing with warming bourbon and a slight tartness. Medium to heavy bodied with modest carbonation. A classic English barleywine base with the expected robust bourbon flavors. Initially complex with nice dried fruit flavors, the finish is slightly tart and boozy from the bourbon. Although enjoyable, I think the stout holds up to the strong bourbon better than this barleywine base. A well made and enjoyable barreled barleywine. I think this would get better with aging, but it has become such a nightmare (with a deliberate Black Friday circus release) to purchase the Bourbon County line of ales, that this is certain to be my one evening of enjoyment. Fine, but not irreplaceable. 1,083 charactersLiquidAmber, Dec 27, 2015

4.13/5  rDev -8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.252013-2015 vintages, poured into tulips. 2015 is reviewed here:
Appearance: pours a visibly thick, viscous dark brown color. Looks like dark maple syrup or molasses in it's appearance. Too dark to be translucent, but not totally black by any means. Medium tan head that dissipates rather quickly, but leaves tons of lacing.
Aroma: smells incredibly sweet. Caramel and molasses, along with some toffee, are the dominant scents for me, with a little bit of burnt sugar as well. I didn't really get any dark fruit as mentioned in some of the reviews here, but did in the taste.
Taste: Very, very sweet. I liked the 12oz size of the past vintages more for the barleywine as a result, but liked the new 16.9oz size for the stouts. As for actual flavors, I got layers of vanilla and molasses, as well as lots of caramel. Light notes of figs and date. 
Feel: heavy-bodied, with a molasses like feel. Definitely a slow-sipper in my opinion, but a very good one at that. Carbonation is minimal but present, which is perfect in my book here.
Overall: incredible barleywine. Go back to the 12oz 4 packs. 1,096 charactersTheElectricOne, Dec 22, 2015

Look: Dark brown with a brown head. Darker than expected. Medium retention. 
Smell: Strong bourbon aromas. Also get some caramel. Surprising amount off vanilla and oak.
Taste: Much like the aroma bourbon, caramel, vanilla. Also get leather, toffee and dark fruits.
Feel: Heavy bodied. Not as chewy as BCBS but almost there. Slight sharpness from alcohol.
Overall: Not usually big on barleywines but this one is really great! I'm sure it's because of the barrel aging but damn is this good! Just wish this wasn't so difficult to acquire. Cheers! 570 characterssittinggc, Dec 22, 2015

3.0 A:  Deep deep amber color that looks black unless held to a light.  A short fizzy head formed with an aggressive pour and vanished almost immediately leaving no lacing.
4.75 S:  Like BCS, the nose is overflowing with bourbon.  Leather, brown sugar, molasses, and light smoke.  Oak and vanilla.  The base offers a thick goopy caramel and toffee backbone.  Next comes a bevy of fruits including raisin, fig, date, sugar plums, and black currants (and then more black currants).  Despite the strong bourbon, the booze is well hidden.  Complex and powerful, everything I want in a Bourbon County beer.
4.5 T:  So many potent flavors.  Molasses comes out even stronger than the bourbon with black currants and dates almost as powerful.  Then caramel, leather, raisin, figs, prunes/plums, toffee, chocolate, and brown sugar.  Woodiness, smoke, and vanilla follow.  It's sticky sweet, perhaps too much so.
4.25 M:  Heavy, viscous body.  Quite sticky and almost chewy.  Moderate carbonation level.  Sticky finish with some warming booziness.
4.5 D:  It's insanely complex and powerful, but I feel that it's much stickier than BCS and because of that it's less drinkable.  Still, it's a wonderful beer! 1,237 charactersDavoleBomb, Dec 20, 2015

A: Pours the color of dry caramel (those cooking shows are good for something...). Black in the glass with a little dark brown/cola towards the top; glowing red in the light. Medium brown in the dimple. Clear meniscus on top. Strong sheeting. No lacing, at all.
S: Slightly earthy toffee. Lighter caramel. Oak. Raisin, Oatmeal cookie. Slight sweet char.
T/MF: Still really sweet, but not quite as much as the Stout. More raisin and sweet oatmeal cookie, Toffee, brown sugar. Sweet char, even moving slightly into graphite territory. Raisin is more prominent upon swallowing. Dry baking chocolate on the finish.
This is more subtle than the stout, an because of that, more drinkable, though still a sipper.
Poured from a 16.9 oz. bottle into a Belgian tulip glass. 832 charactersTruePerception, Dec 06, 2015

O: I am surprised I haven't reviewed this beer sooner. Fresh this beer is jaw dropping the plum fig and raisin flavors pound your senses while the soft vanilla and toffee of the bourbon caress your palate.  2 years later this beer is still a dynamo it has lost a little of the dark fruit flavor, but the toffee vanilla and light burnt sugars it has lost none of its nose. Easily the best of the bourbon county beers I have this is a leap over your neighbors dead body to grab kind of beer. 1,004 charactersSomethingClever, Dec 06, 2015

5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottled on 09/18/2014.  Poured from the bottle into a snifter at 55F.  It's dark, but when held up to the light, a nice ruby red shines through.  I inverted the bottle before I poured, so there is some sediment.  I love a big, unfiltered beer.  About a finger of khaki head that goes away completely within a minute leaving about a mm wide ring around the edge of the glass with no lacing - *even the ring is gone after I finish my review*.  On the nose there is raisin, caramel, plum, fig, and an almost cashew like smell lingering in the background.  The most robust, complex smelling beer I've tried in a long time.  And since it's over a year old (on top of 5 years of age at the brewery), there are no hops to speak of.  To taste, chocolate shines through the most, then some ripe dark fruits (raisins, figs mostly) as if they've been soaking in some of the smoothest bourbon on the planet for a long, long time, followed up by a distinct oak aftertaste with a tiny bit of char at the end. Minutes after each sip, there's caramel left on the palette, which is very pleasing to me. It's relatively dry, and I would guess around 10% abv, but 12.3% abv has mellowed very nicely due to the years of age - mellowed to the point that it really only warms me from the inside.  It's actually very smooth on the palate, not a whole lot of carbonation to speak of, but it's there, sort of brightening up and bringing out the flavor profile.  Very, very good beer.  For 22 bucks a 4 pack, it had better be good...  Anyone hesitant to shell out the dough should take my advice: buy this beer.  It's definitely the best barleywine I've ever tried, and probably in my top 3 favorites of all time. 1,687 charactersnizzle8287, Dec 01, 2015

Look: a hearty, viscous burnt orangeish brown; looks a lot like brandy.
Smell: my favorite part of this beer. Lots of fruity/jammy notes, basically to the exclusion of anything else, except for maybe a little pipe tobacco. Very reminiscent of brandy (without the heat).
Taste: more of the same—dark fruits, jammy berry, hints of super-dark chocolate, tobacco, brown sugar.
Feel: thick, and a bit undercarbonated. Impairs drinkability a bit.
Overall: first time trying this beer. I like the jammy/brandy profile. It's very good, but it's a little cloying and of a chore to drink, without the reward of incredible depths of complexity. 737 charactersneurobot01, Dec 01, 2015

Already can tell this is going to be a treat. First sip brings some sweet molasses and caramel, before the bourbon hits you. Slight chocolate and even less roast follow the bourbon, albeit they are present. The beginning of the finish brings some prunes and dark fruits as the beer warms in your mouth, before a wave of coconut and oak character bring you to a vanilla and caramel oak lasting aftertaste. This beer has opened my eyes to English barley wines. 544 charactersDustin_Sallitt, Nov 30, 2015

Look - Jet black. Motor oil in a glass with a very thin caramel colored lacing. 
Smell - Vanilla and raisin and a slightly... smokey essence. I'm not sure how to describe that last whiff I got, but the beer itself is very inviting.
Taste - Chocolate, vanilla, raisin - the hops are very feint. Sweetness and slight malt are the main stars in this show. I love it. There is a very feint "hot, sweet" taste to it as well that I assume has to do with the whiskey barrels.
Feel - Thick and rich, slight carbonation, and a slight alcohol heat at the end. The alcohol heat itself is present but not overbearing. Fantastic.
Overall - While this tastes better than a lot of stouts, the fruity malt nature of a barley wine is very present and adds to the experience. Absolutely gorgeous beer in every aspect. A true sipper and goes perfect with the cold winter. Best barrel aged barley wine I have tried. 1,000 characterssentimetal, Nov 29, 2015

L - Dark mahogany with less than a finger of tan head
S - sweet malts, bourbon-soaked raisins, toffee, caramel.
T - Smooth as all hell. Rich, sweet malty flavor with sugary caramel and toffee. Bourbon is present, but more subdued than standard BCBS, but it works to enhance other flavors.
F - Smooth again and even has times where it is mouth-coating. No alcohol taste, but a slight warming on each sip as it warms.
O - Arguably at the head of the class for the style. Smooth-tasting with barrel-aging that made all flavors of the base beer better. 566 charactersThrewRedButter, Nov 29, 2015

I have the give it to Goose Island, these bottles are pretty rad. The pour was nice, a little darker than I was anticipating. It smelled pretty good, like a good English Barleywine aged in bourbon barrels should. The taste left me a little unhappy though. I could taste the sweetness from the malt, a nice oaky, vanilla, caramel flavor, but it was missing something. As I let it warm, more of the flavors came out, and I enjoyed it a bit more. Honestly, its still pretty hot, so I think it could stand a bit of aging. Overall, it's a good BBA English Barleywine, I had heard so many glowing reviews about it I was expecting something life changing. 765 charactersivegot3Dvision, Nov 29, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a very dark chestnut brown color that's completely opaque with a 1.5 finger frothy beige head that very slowly settles into a thick, lasting ring.  Excellent retention, taking a while to finally settle and leaving large chunks of soapy lacing behind. 
Very inviting aroma with beautiful barrel character that's perfectly integrated into the barleywine notes of the base beer.  Nicely charred oak with subtle dry toothpick as well as some sweet, spicy bourbon, toasted coconut and a silky vanilla bean sweetness.  Lots of spirit and barrel but it doesn't overpower the leathery malts and vinous dark fruit notes of the barleywine.  Hints of caramel, toffee and tobacco along with some raisin, plum and fig.  Smells amazing and I'm not sure how much it could improve. 
Full body wih a strong boozy barrel character that's excellently integrated into the barleywine flavors of the base.  Sweet and boozy but not overwhelmingly hot or one-dimensional.  The barrel flavors are very strong but the leathery malts and dark fruit sweetness still stand out.  Lots of sweet, spicy bourbon along with dry, toasted oak, marshmallow, toasted coconut and vanilla bean. Underneath the barrel, there is some slightly smokey, leathery malt followed by dark fruit and lighter malt sweetness.  Leathery tobacco flavor countered by caramel, toffee, hazelnut and very sweet dark fruit notes, notably raisin, fig and plum.  The spirit flavor is pretty strong but this beer only has slight heat and subtle warmth in the chest.  The high ABV is relatively well masked making this complex and near perfectly balanced beer dangerously drinkable.  Excellent!   Hard to find fault with a barrel aged barleywine that's so strong right out of the gate.  This should age gracefully and I'm looking forward to seeing how it develops over time. 1,819 characterscorby112, Nov 23, 2015

This is one of the best beers I have ever had. Although I have not had a huge experience with Barleywine, this beer is amazing regardless of a style classification. Beautiful red/amber color. The smell is sweet. The taste is the only beer I've given a 5. What tastes like a 5 you ask? That my friend you cannot explain in words..but if I were to try, I'd say - harmonious balance between bourbon and malts, strong oak presense and toffee, caramel notes. DIdn't really take "feel" into consideration, but I'm sure it was ok. Overall - save this beer for who you are celebrating something big. It's hard enough to get it, so don't give it away...this goose is for you. 709 charactersLostbeer35, Nov 19, 2015

Brown sugar and caramel are there along with some chocolate booze. This is one year old and it still has some heat to it. Aroma is similar and really comes a live as it warms. The mouth feel is medium and smooth. Its a very sweet beer without being syrupy.  Booze leaves a strong after taste. 391 charactersdanh53, Nov 07, 2015

The head on the pour was very minimal. It smells of rich bourbon barrel, vanilla, chocolate, cherries, chocolate. The taste is similar to the other variants: big and bold. It tastes just as it smells too. The feel is thick but silky with low levels of carbonation. Overall this is a delicious offering from Goose Island, cheers! 445 characterstregan_20, Nov 02, 2015

The beer pours a pretty dark brown color with light lacing and decent head retention.  The beer has the look of one that has seen some serious barrel aging.  On the nose, there is a huge presence of vanilla and brown sugar, with some underlying chocolate and light coffee as well.  The flavor profile replicates, though this beer is so rich and sweet, it's almost cloying.  Alcohol is pretty well integrated into the flavor profile, though you can tell it's up there a bit.  Mouthfeel is pretty full, and the finish is very sweet and long.
Nice beer, but a little bit of this goes a very long way. 704 charactersJohn_M, Oct 26, 2015

Cloyingly sweet, sticky syrupy bourbony choclate, smokey vanilla, roasted caramel and brown sugar..
Probably one of the most complex beers I've had. Everything about this one is just great. My first taste of BC anything, and this has got me itching to try more. 473 charactersdo_ob, Oct 04, 2015

A: Moderate pour yields lace of tan bubbles. More head please.  Translucent dark brown liquid.
S: Raisin, bourbon, oak.
T: Sweet, grass and earth, not boozy! Slight bourbon tang in the finish.  Nice job done with the barrel aging - the barrel didn't hijack this beer.
M: Full, rich, warming but not hot.
O: Delicious, a great barrel aged beer.  Splendid restraint in the barrel characteristics. 434 charactersdfillius, Sep 27, 2015

Pours an unattractive murky coca cola color, but holding the glass up to the light showcases a dark crimson body, littered with particles, being stirred up by numerous streams of carbonation heading towards a quickly dissipating tan colored head.  This one has a lot going on!  Absolutely dominating in the dark fruit department; dried figs, dates, raisins, dark chocolate covered cherry cordial, with vanilla, char, coconut, tobacco, burnt caramel, brown sugar, and it goes on and on.  Huge on the palate, full body, sticky, well balanced goodness.  Taste has more going on than the aroma.  Still get a small amount of the booze but it has matured very nicely.  Lots of the dark fruit characteristics still come through but the flavor brings out more of the barrel notes - bourbon, oak, vanilla, coffee roast, dark chocolate fudge.  BCBS is definitely present within this beer without calling for too much attention.  An enormous, sweet, complex barleywine with a ton of barrel character. 1,008 charactersCzarkazm, Sep 23, 2015

I purchased and consumed a fresh 2015 during the Black Friday release. Usually the barleywine is overshadowed by the stouts, but I enjoy some reprieve from the darkness with a different kind of sweetness. The fresh bottle was just as rich as the stouts, large date and fig notes that dance on your taste buds. 368 charactersTrevor11, Sep 21, 2015

L: Deep red, dark amber blackness. The head is there initially, but soon is gone completely. This could be due to the maturation? Definitely some sediment at the bottom.
S: Bourbon warmth. Maybe a little fig or raisin.
T: Really nice bourbon flavor with dried fruits, apricots, plums, lots of malt. Incredible warmth.
F: Wonderful smoothness that wasn't there when the beer was younger. It floats on your tongue, closely approaching the "T-1000 liquid metal" feel of Surly Darkness. At the bottom of the glass, at the end of the drink, you definitely encounter that trademark Bourbon County tackiness.
O: This beer is WAY too sweet when it's young. But after aging a couple years, it was wonderful. I can't wait to try one after 5 years. 802 charactersMichaelNeelsen, Sep 03, 2015

Pours dark brown with a reddish garnet hue, and despite trying to pour smoothly, some chunks of sediment made it into the glass.  A few bubbles accompany the pour, but almost no carbonation visibly hanging around.  Smell is strong caramel, vanilla, and tobacco, with hints of bourbon essence and oak.  No tingly heat on the nose, but plenty of rich aromas.  Taste is WOW.  A lot in this.  Rich, creamy, dark caramel dominates, chewy malt sugars, milk chocolate, dried dark fruit richness, date sugars, vanilla, Demerara, oak, and even a cedary twang creeps in. Feel is appropriately thick and still, but a sloshing around in the mouth yields some fizzy bubbles.  Leggy and lingering on the palate.  Overall, an absolute classic.  Extremely smooth with some age, a great sipper, as the flavors come out as it warms. 851 charactersSaisonRichBiere, Sep 03, 2015

Barely a half-finger head that quickly dissipates, leaving a tiny ring. Beer is a deep, leathery cordovan.
Smell immediately after pouring is dominated by bourbon. You can also pick up dried fruits. Vanilla and coffee come in as it warms.
Taste immediately after pouring is the dominant malt profile, some bourbon, some plum/prune. Very little alcohol detected despite monster ABV. Vanilla and coffee come in as it warms.
Well-balanced, medium-bodied, maybe closer to full; practically no carbonation to speak of, a small amount of alcohol burn. Sweet, but not cloyingly so.
Definitely a relative to the BC stout because of the barrelling, but it has its own character. I'm not a huge barleywine fan, but this is a special beer 848 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Sep 02, 2015

A - Pours a dark brown with just a bit of carbed head, reminiscent of cola.
S - Bourbon, sweet dark fruits, a bit of vanilla.
T - Mostly bourbon, with a fruity sweetness like candied raisins/figs/dates.
F - Perfectly thick and viscous, although a bit thinner than BCBS.
O - Solid BA barleywine, but I was expecting a bit more. A bit too much of the sweet, dark fruits to me. 418 charactersSoCal_Matt, Aug 14, 2015

Subtle sweetness.  Very nice.  Finish is chocolaty and roasty with a little bit of alcohol burn.  IMO, very similar to FW DDBA flavor profile, but not nearly as subtle.  This takes those flavors and punches you in the face with them.  Overall, outstanding.  My first time trying a Bourbon County offering and it did not disappoint. 436 charactersLADaveBN, Aug 09, 2015

The nose gives off the classic English style in its truest form. Rather than the chocolate/coffee/vanilla/bourbon dominant concoction indicative of most other Bourbon County brews, though, this particular batch is more sophisticated; you smell dates, roasted malt, and brown sugar and taste these same components as well. Caramely barley wine is absolutely stacked with sweetness and the style makes these beautiful flavors more perceptible than they are in the context of a dark stout. A little more carbonated. A little more sophisticated. A little better. Yes. A little better than BCBS. The barley wine is the perfect partner in crime to Bourbon County with its light booze and oak. 781 charactersljjpowers, Aug 07, 2015

A - Rich, ruby red appearance w a half finger of khaki head.  Super tight bubbles.
S - Wow.  Massive bourbon, dark fruits - cherries, plums, figs.  Tons of caramel, toffee, some vanilla from the barrels.  Very "desserty".
T - Amazing, especially for an 11% beer.  Sweet dark fruits up front - cherries, plums.  Some caramel and toffee, with bourbon on the finish.  Stupid easy drinking for the ABV.  So darn good.
M - Full bodied, velvety, low carbonation.
O - for my money and availability this is the best BABW I've had.  100/100. 586 charactersjow_42, Jul 22, 2015

A — Pours a deep ruby hued brown into the glass, actually quite dark for a BW. Little bit black around the edges, there is a puffy, but quickly fading off-white colored head. Looks quite thick.
S — Smells very boozy and rich, notes of vanilla, cinnamon, brown sugar, caramel, oak, and bourbon.
T — Much like the nose, though quite a bit sweeter, lots of caramel, vanilla, sugar, plum, fig, bourbon, oak, chocolate.
M — Full bodied, sticky and long finish, hot.
O — Good overall, I kind of expected more, but this is still a good beer. 585 charactersMoose90, Jul 21, 2015

Appearance: Pours cloudy dark brown with a very thin off-white lacing which dissipates quickly. Similarly to King Henry it looks somewhat lifeless.
Smell: Bourbon, tons of dark fruit - raisin, fig, plum - oak, vanilla, hints of coffee and chocolate. Extraordinary complexity. Tons of depth. Despite everything that is going on it melds beautifully. 
Taste: Everything suggested by the smell and then some. Very big bourbon presence up front (which is extremely smooth, virtually no alcohol heat) which transitions into fig, raisin, chocolate covered cherries. Once again just a touch of coffee presence from the residual BCBS in the barrels. Nowhere near enough to come off anything like a stout but enough to add another layer to an already complex barleywine. Finish is more bourbon and dark fruit with a touch of alcohol heat. 
Mouthfeel: Full-bodied, smooth, viscous. Very low carbonation.
Overall: After King Henry I had pretty enormous expectations for this beer, and it was exactly what I hoped it would be. Not quite at level of King Henry, but captures all of the components that were present. Another example of Goose Island's world class skill with barrels. 1,246 charactersemyers, Jul 10, 2015

Granted this is my first barrel aged barleywine, it seemed a bit more like a stout to me. I loved it though!
Great smell, fantastically smooth. Drank at cellar temp, and no hint of booze the entire way. Can't wait to see how this one develops. 258 charactersAwolter, Jun 26, 2015

Look:  Pitch black body that is more dark brown around the edges.  The darker mocha head is thin and very fine.  The initial pour created a smallish, skinny head that quickly retreated to a thin film over the top, then to a slim halo around the glass.  Lacing is slick. 
Smell:  Bourbon barrel, cherries, prunes, vanilla, bakers chocolate, molasses, and Big Red chew...Very rich aroma.   
Taste:  Big.  Bold.  Robust.  The taste follows the nose.  Among the other tastes, dark fruit is apparent.  This becomes syrupy as it warms.        
Feel:  Thick and silky in the mouth.  Lower level of carbonation.  The lather is very thin and fades away smoothly.
Overall - A superbly crafted, fine piece of art. 754 charactersmabermud, Jun 13, 2015

Did a mini vertical, 2014 and 2016 , avoiding the cherry/bile 2015 anomaly.
2014: 12oz bottle
2016: 500ml bottle
Both poured into a The Bruery 750ml snifter
2014: dark brown with a, touch of red, off white very small head, which quickly diminished
2016: dark brown, off white small head, which quickly diminished
Nose:
2014:  Cherry
2016: Cherry, oak, caramel
Taste:
2014: Cherry, Oak, Vanilla
2016: cherry, Oak, Vanilla, Caramel
Feel:
Both where full bodies, syrupy/sticky beers
Overall:
Clearly these were the same beers. but the 2014 flavors had faded making them much more subtle. The 2016 flavors were more lively, I preferred the 2016.  The lesson here. This beer is ready to be drank when released by the brewer, aging doesn't improve it.

4.6/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer poured a deep opaque brown to black with slight ruby hints and an almost imperceptible head.  The pour left some strange whitish oil slick like traces on the top which I found odd but that wasn’t going to stop me from forging through this phenomenal beer.  The aroma was very similar to the Bourbon County Stout that was heavy on the bourbon with slight hints of vanilla but mostly Bourbon.  The taste had those familiar Bourbon County flavors of Bourbon and vanilla with the slight coconut hints coming at the tail end.  Very malty and very bourbon forward the Bourbon County Brand Barelywine is one beast of a beer.  Another barrel-aged masterpiece from Goose Island that takes over your palate as it warms and becomes a divine drinking experience. 761 charactersbrurevu, May 27, 2015

4.24/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Innocent and mundane in appearance, the insane raisin-y sweetness smacks you across the face with a solid, almost cloying strength. It was almost enough to turn me off, but the taste comes through very well-balanced in comparison, with loads of sweetness handsomely accompanied by earthy roastiness. A smooth, spicy burn from the alcohol thins the mouthfeel a bit and let's the bourbon really shine. This style isn't something I am in the mood for too often, but this is a damn solid recipe. 491 charactersIan_B, May 25, 2015

4.51/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52013 bottle.
A: Very dark brown with a quite large but fizzy mocha head which doesn't last. No lacing to speak of.
S: Smell is sweet and boozy with tons of vanilla, chocolate, ripe and dark fruits. It gets more mellow as it opens, with the vanilla dominating the scent.
T: Chocolate, caramel, vanilla, oak, leather, prune and fig. Complex with a good balance but with a quite boozy aftertaste, with ashes and cold tobacco lingering in the back of the throat. It really get better and better as it opens but the booziness also gets more overpowering as it warms up.
M: High bodied, with a thick, oily mouthfeel, which fits the style very well. The booziness on the finish is a bit harsh though.
O: This is pretty much focused on the barrel treatment (as expected for a bourbon county variant). Very good, not in par with King Henry but still a very enjoyable sipper. 865 charactersFux, May 24, 2015

Brownish merlot color that is opaque when held to the light.  Minimal head during the pour that quickly dissipated.  Smells of fruit, vanilla and sugar sweet grapes or raisins.  Beautiful aroma.  Tastes like a traditional English barleywine but thick and full in the mouth.  Big blast of raisins, vanilla with subtle undertones of bourbon aged in oak barrels.  Huge abv and slight burn.  Amazingly doesn't taste like bourbon.  Sweet.  Grapes, raisins and vanilla.  Chewy almost. Really complex.  Struggling to identify flavors.  Really smooth and drinkable for such an abv bomb.  One of those "Let's get everyone up in here pregnant" beers.  Will definitely acquire more!  Got this as an extra for crying out loud!  Dang this is good! 805 charactersuvachief, Apr 18, 2015

The beer pours thick like liquor. Aromas of rich caramel and molasses forward, solid booze undertone, notes of pineapple and cream, vanilla, woody highlights, and subtle char notes. Very rich and sweet nose. Flavors are richly sweet forward, with a heavy dose of vanilla, molasses, and caramel, all rich and sweet, on a roasted backbone with a booze kick and building warmth. Amazingly balanced, with old world fruit notes of date, plum, and raisin layering on. Woody and bourbon highlights, with some char notes, too. This is layered, yet balanced and super smooth. The body is robust and velvety smooth, with a building warmth adding to the molasses and toffee rich aftertaste. The finish is heavy and smooth, with a sugary sweet and boozy linger. Fantastic beer, and amazingly drinkable despite the depth, weight, and robust flavors. Wow! 946 charactersGarthDanielson, Apr 13, 2015

Pours dark black but with the occasional red/purple when swirled. Head looks nice, decently tanned. It's not that aggressive but can be summoned with a swirl and becomes markedly more vigorous.
Nose is first off plum. Then chocolate. Lots of chocolate actually. Bourbon and muscatel grapes. Comes across like a Christmas pudding with stewed fruits and lots of brandy. And chocolate veers into caramel at times.
Appearance and nose are truly exceptional.
Taste has lots of grapey muscatel, hint of chocolate but more subtle and fruits. Definitely can feel there's a lot of sugar there but it's kept in check to some extent by the barrel char and a bit of booze.
Plummy sweetness does creep up a bit in the mouthfeel but it stops short of cloying.
Overall an amazing beer. Nose is potentially the best of a barleywine I've ever had. Just love the huge dark fruits, bourbon but also chocolate and caramel. Best of both worlds. 961 charactersdanieelol, Apr 05, 2015

Look - Probably the darkest barley wine i've ever seen,  it looks more like a stout than anything, very dark brown, appears black in most lights.  Gorgeous.
Smell - Very pleasant smell.  Slightly sweet, mixed with a malty smell and a small amount of booze.  much less of a boozy smell than most barleywine.
Taste - The best part of any beer (or else your drinkin' the wrong stuff).  This is crazy smooth for an 11%+ barleywine.  It is very earthy, nuts, figs, and maybe a little sugar cane.  It truly is delicious.  The burn of the alcohol is very discreet but it's definitely the flavor that stays with you the longest in between sips.
Feel - Not as thick as I was expecting, but that is most definitely not a bad thing.  Based on the flavor profile the thinner mouthfeel is spot on to complement the flavors.
Overall - Can't think of many other beers of this style I would rank ahead of this.  Maybe J.W. Lee's off the top of my head but this is an excellent representation of the barleywine style.  If you find it, don't pay attention to the price just buy it.  I promise it will be worth it. 1,195 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Mar 21, 2015

A - Very dark garnet. Has a light tan head that subsides quickly to leave no trace of carbonation or head.
S - Sweet bourbon smell mixed with strong maltiness and some coconut and light chocolate notes as well. Very complex smell but predominately sweet and barrel forward.
T - The bourbon barrel is the main event. The full bourbon flavor is accompanied by the malt and the sweet caramel tones of the base beer. The barrel also carries with it oak, vanilla, and a distinct toasted coconut character. There seems to be no bitterness and the only slight salvation for the sweetness is the alcohol on the back end.
M - High mouth-feel with almost no carbonation. Very much like taking a shot of bourbon and dropping it into a tepid barleywine.
Overall, this is a very complex beer with a sweet bourbon forward flavor. If you don't like sweet beers or bourbon this one is probably not a good choice. I wouldn't pay $10 for this beer again but I could see someone wanting this beer occasionally. I do not feel that this is a good representation of the style and you shouldn't judge your experience of the past on this beer. This beer is a beast of it's own that you need to make your own decision on.

Poured from a bottle into a snifter. 
A - Pours an opaque ruby-brown with a one-finger tan head which quickly vaporized, leaving a thin, bubbly film behind. Rings of lacing consisting of teeny, tiny, bubbles. 
S - Powerful aroma of toffee, fruit cake, date, plum, fig, and prune. Smells delicious.
T - Matches the nose well, with extra caramel, oak, and sherry/port notes not as prevalent in the aroma. Rich sweet plums and cherries in the mid palate. Hints of tobacco, leather, vanilla bean, and molasses. Some earthy hop comes through in the long finish. ABV present as a bite in the finish but still well hidden. The flavors blend and swirl in seemingly endless complexities. Fantastic.
M - Full body with delicately low carbonation. Slick, slightly syrupy finish; coats the tongue completely Overall feel is smooth. 
O - Lives up to the hype, and pretty much perfection. Certainly the best barleywine ever to grace my lips. 5/5. 950 charactersTempeBeerMan, Feb 27, 2015

4.85/5  rDev +8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A: Very dark ruby red. Almost black. Basically zero head and retention from a careful pour.
S: Vanilla, sweet molasses and caramel, chocolate, huge bourbon and slight earthy hops.
T: Vanilla, molasses, chocolate and dark fruit take a back seat to the huge sweet bourbon. Slight hoppy and bitter aftermath.
M: Medium to heavy bodied, decent carbonation. Little bitterness from the hops of a typical barleywine but barely detectable due to the bourbon.
O: Absolutely amazing. Usually I prefer this beer with a year or two on it but the freshness of the base beer coupled with the hands-down best bourbon barrel technique has this beer in a class of its own. Sucuba, sit back down. 682 charactersBoardwalkBock, Feb 21, 2015

4.93/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Serving: 12 oz. bottle poured into a CBS snifter. Bottled on 9/24/14, making this just over 4 months old. 
A: Pours a very dark mahogany. Some light getting through the edges. Lots of flakes and sediment in this one, unsure what it's from. Very calm, minimal head retention. Occasional bubbles rise from the depths when agitated.
S: Vanilla, oak, caramel, bourbon. Some dark fruits. Very, very sweet. Some maple syrup and toffee notes as well. The aroma doesn't quite "pop" like the other BC beers, but that may be due to the third-use barrels. 
T: Oh, this is amazing. Tons of caramel and toffee up front. Vanilla, oak, some smokiness. Lots of molasses and maple syrup notes. Bourbon comes through mostly in the finish, and it's very subtle. The bourbon imparts more of a booziness than a flavor. Tons and tons of balance here. Not a single off note, really. Everything in perfect harmony from beginning to end. 
M: Stunningly full mouthfeel. Perfect carbonation for this beer. Perfect amount of boozy sweetness. 
O: So this is probably my #1 or #2 favorite BA Barleywine. The only thing that comes close is Kuhnhenn's BBBW, but it's been a while since I've had that. This beer is just great. Is does everything it's supposed to. Each taste reveals a new complexity and layer to the beer. So many flavors at once. Some might be scared by it's overt sweetness, but I think it totally works here. I think the nose could be a bit stronger, but I'm wondering if that's where the third-use barrels hurt it here. But for the most part, this beer is just so well balanced and constructed. 
Recommendation: Must-try. Plus, this one isn't too hard to get. 1,653 charactersSparty1224, Feb 09, 2015

4.18/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25500 ml bottle (October 28, 2015) into a snifter. This review is an update to a earlier rating of the 2013 vintage.
A-The head is short and greyish-tan. The foam fades immediately like you would expect for a beer with this ABV. The beer is a nice ruby-garnet color and quite dark. I can see a bubble or two of carbonation in there.
S-The aroma is hugely sweet. I sniff grape juice, prunes, figs, and some dates. There is a bit of heat (alcohol) and some raspy oak, but the barrel is seriously overwhelmed by the malts here. I also pick up some caramel and toffee. Nicely complex.
T-The taste is also hugely sweet. Complex malts linger on the palate and make for a nice sipping experience. Flavors on the palate match the aroma closely.
M-The feel is medium in heft for the style with lower levels of carbonation. Sips well, but does get a bit sticky.
O-Like the stout, this is a good example of the style. I don't think this is the best barleywine I've tried, or the best BA barleywine I've tried, but it certainly drinks well and (hype aside) is worth buying a bottle or two each year. 1,090 charactersspoony, Feb 06, 2015

Smell- beautiful and blended smells of vanilla, oak, bourbon, toffee, more dark fruits as it warms, and caramel, reminds me of its stout brother. Taste- wow, just wow. For a bottle with no age on it, it blends so well with some alcohol presence. Starts with a smooth vanilla and caramel which gives way to plenty of malt, oak, tobacco, dark fruits and bourbon, finishes with a nice hop presence temporarily which gives way to a creamy and boozy finish. Mouthfeel- holy crap, this is one of the best if not the best mouthfeels I've ever had with a beer. So syrupy and creamy, very dangerous, I really think I could session this with ease which is surprising given what it is. Overall- an amazing experience. I'm really surprised, I like this way better than bcbs, and I'm more of a stout guy. This lives up to the billing. 914 charactersER527, Feb 02, 2015

Oddly, there wasn't much aroma: some vanilla and bourbon.
The taste was basically the usual bourbon and oaky vanilla. The interesting part was in the nuances: a trace of gingerbread, dried dark fruit with a definite and very pleasant caramelization. The aftertaste was a strong sweetness with a slight hoppy astringency.
The mouthfeel was perhaps my favorite part: very full and thick -- on the verge of syrupy. Perfect carbonation.
Overall, I'm glad I had a chance to try this. In many ways it was like other bourbon barrel aged beers. But what sets it apart were the nuances (for example, the hint of caramelized dried dark fruits) and the full, deep body. 806 charactersbreakingbland, Jan 23, 2015
4.41/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25A: Pours a tawny brown with limited head, and perhaps some black cheery highlights.
S: Very malty and lots of dark fruits--raisins, prunes, blackberry. Extremely rich port-like qualities, 
M: Attenuation is incredible. Feels a tad sharp at times. Pleasant warmth on the way down; it takes some time to develop. 
T: Has a mellow character bordering on blasé. Moments of molasses. Some dark bready malts. Dried plums, grapes. Some oxidated metallic, Definition of balance. Would pair very well with cheese. A very mature beer. 528 charactersorcrist_cleaver, Jan 23, 2015

While 2013 has a bit more "port" warmth, thinner body, earthy grain taste, and more bourbon compared to 2014 which had more plum/port fruit and fig sweetness to it. I'd be curious to see if it translated in to a side by side bottle comparison. 403 charactersTubaManJack, Jan 22, 2015

4.55/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75The beer pours very little caramel colored head such that it didn't even take over the complete surface area. The beer itself is an opaque, very dark brown with a little bit of dark purple notes. The beer isn't quite black as a result.
The beer has a very strong aroma that carries over quite a distance. The various notes that come out are mainly dark fruits with a vanilla note from the barrel. The dark fruit notes are plum, fig, and raisin; all of which mix very well with the vanilla. The vanilla note is wonderful because it doesn't overwhelm but does not let itself get trapped.
The beer taste is delicious and sinful. The beer has very strong dark fruit notes with a vanilla note that runs through it pretty well. The dark fruits that really come out are plum and raisin. Additionally, the taste has a bitter hop note that makes a strong contrast to the fruits.
The mouthfeel is very heavy bodied but feels lighter due to the carbonation. The beer itself is pretty smooth. Also, a slight alcohol is present in the beer.
Overall, this barleywine is fantastic. This beer has the right notes in the right places in the right degrees. 1,142 charactersHattedClassic, Jan 15, 2015

Pours a very dark brown, nearly black, with a smallish, thick dark tan head. Very good lacing for this strong a beer.
Aroma has some roasted character reminiscent of a stout but it is bolstered by plums and figs and somewhat of a sherry note. The bourbon is a bit subdued with just a touch of vanilla coming through.
The flavor really gives you a sense of everything these barrels have been through.  Touches of vanilla, oak, and chocolate up front with dark fruit coming in a bit later. Sherry is more subdued. Big, thick mouthfeel with decent sweetness but it is not overly sweet. Alcohol warmth is present but the strength of this beer is well hidden.
Overall, I was very fortunate to be able to track this down in East Tennessee after years of wanting to try it. This beer does not disappoint as there is just so much going on. Truly world-class. 882 charactersrangerred, Jan 12, 2015

The aroma is strong, boozy with vanilla and oak notes. Taste is unexpectedly as smooth as it is complex. It's boozy and very sweet. The bourbon barrels really come through again with those same oak and vanilla notes. There is also an element of dark dried fruit (raisins/figs). As it warms, the bourbon aspect becomes even more prominent. The feel is absolutely perfect, it's creamy and full-bodied, and it sticks to your mouth. Carbonation is perfect. Honestly, this whole experience borders on perfect. It's hard to imagine improving this beer, I just wish I could get more of it. 702 charactersZebraCakez, Jan 11, 2015

S: Moderate aromas of bourbon and vanilla are present in the nose. The smell becomes stronger as the beer warms up. 
T: Just like the smell, the taste has flavors of bourbon and associated vanilla; these linger into the finish. Hints of the underlying barleywine are also apparent. 
M: air feels medium-bodied and silky smooth on the palate, coating your mouth with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: This beer is very drinkable considering its strength—the only alcohol you get is from the bourbon.

Appearance - dark mahogany/ruby red color with dark tan head
Smell - caramel, toffee, oak, bourbon, chocolate
Taste - this is complex and full of flavor - toffee, caramel, chocolate, coconut, oak, bourbon
Mouthfeel - full bodied, medium carbonation,  sweetness upfront from the candy like toffee/caramel/chocolate notes, complexity is apparent on the backend as the flavors stick around for long after the initial swallow, barrel characteristics are well integrated into the flavors as well. So silky smooth.
Overall - this is a hell of a beer, full flavored, bold, complex yet easy to drink and enjoy. Much better beer than Bourbon County stout. Every beer lover owes it to themself to try this.

Deep, dark brown color.  Despite the solid hiss when prying off the cap, it pours with an almost still look, only a slim tan head forming before quickly dissolving to a fine collar.  Smells highly oaky right out of the gate before giving way to brown bread, molasses, dates, nuts, and raisins.  The wood mellows out a bit as it warms, developing more sticky breadiness, cherry, and slight oxidation. Flavor is less wooden, which is a definite improvement.  Rich, malty flavors like figs, dates, toffee, raisin bread, tobacco, and chocolate coated in coconut and vanilla Bourbon notes.  Sweet, but complex and layered.  Amazingly silky, oily feel that is chewy, if not super thick (which is fine by me).  Not a huge fan of the aggressive barrel in the nose, but the flavor and mouthfeel are excellent.  Accomplishes being rich and decadent without being cloying or hot.  Excellent! 901 characterswedge, Dec 30, 2014
4.3/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25I'm just all over the place with the BC series these days. Some nights they're stellar, others just good. For me, this one's relative thinness and growing sweet/fruity character really impinge upon its drinkability. 6-8oz is right about the, er, sweet spot for me. Nose is very nice, some of those great coconut notes you get from really well done BA beer, some caramel/vanilla too. Rich, decadent, you get the idea. Palate has a bit of dark, caramelized malt, then the dark fruit swings into play. Eventually, that character threatens to get a touch cough syrupy. I'm not sure it ever gets there, but the threat is enough to keep this from being a true upper echelon beer for me. A little thin for my tastes as well. Overall, if you like BA barleywines, you'll almost certainly like this. It's always solid. Whether it's a killer experience or not seems to depend a bit on the bottle (or tap line) and the night. 913 charactersbreadwinner, Dec 30, 2014

A: Poured a very reddish-black (almost burgundy looking for me) with a pretty substantial amount of head at first but it quickly dissipates.
S: Strong bourbon smell with lots of vanilla mixed in. If I try to go a bit deeper there is some dark fruit, caramel, and slight toffee essence there as well.
T: Lots of sugary-sweetness, toffee, caramel and a strong bourbon flavor.
M: Thick, full bodied. A small amount of carbonation.
O: A very good barleywine. It was a little too sweet for me; although the sugary taste did calm over time as it warmed. I'd drink this again however next time I would drink it substantially warmer. 652 charactersembass, Dec 29, 2014

12oz bottle split into four samplers (of various size, shapes, and materials).
Pours dark brown, slightly translucent. Aroma is alcohol and wood, slight cherry, slight smoke.
Taste is dominated by alcohol, but fades into a lighter fruitier, sweeter flavor. Mild roast bitterness.
Mouthfeel is smooth and mild. Overall, very good. 343 characterssnaotheus, Dec 29, 2014

Pours inky dark and opaque with no head/foam.
An amazingly deep aroma, with the presence of dark dried fruits, leather, and sweetness.
The taste again exhibits a rich and complex mixture of flavors including dark fruits and a healthy level of sweetness.  The high ABV is well masked by other characteristics present in this beer, and thus does not come off as being overly boozy.
The beer coats the mouth with a syrupy consistency and has no perceptible carbonation.
Overall, this is an amazing beer, and should be experienced by all those interested 597 charactersT-34-85, Dec 29, 2014

A: Rich mahogany, cognac tint in the shallower areas. Thick looking with mini suspended bubbles, minimal cola like foam dissipates quickly. Viscous coating on top
S: Malt bomb, earthy sweetness. Strong bourbon and oak scents, vanilla as well.
T: Sugar cane like sweetness, toffee, caramel, strong bourbon flavor. As the beer warms it seems the sugar cane is either less present or I got used to the flavor, which is for the best. 
M: Thick, full bodied and heavy. Very little carbonation.
O: Good barleywine, although I was a little bit underwhelmed on the hype. Through the duration of drinking this I could not shake the strong sugar cane sweetness that was a bit overpowering. Personally I think the Uinta Anniversary barleywine is a more balanced example of the style. 826 charactersriTLce, Dec 28, 2014

12 oz bottle, red wine glass
A – Very dark brown, with a light brown foam head of less than a centimeter.  Very short retention.  Thick, viscous, sweet-looking.
S – Sherry, port wine, dark raisins, dark semi-sweet molasses.  Seems to have taken on a lot of the BCS character.  Bourbon and booze are strong, but don’t seem to be hot.  Some cherries, toffee, and other fruity esters.  Not much bitterness or hop aroma.
T – A ton of sweet, malty sugars, dark but not roasty.  The sherry and port are prominent here, as well as golden raisins and perhaps cooked apples.  Bourbon, BCS, booze are very apparent but very smooth.  Some mild bitterness but not a lot of hop flavor.  Very sweet, perhaps slightly unbalanced in that direction.
M – Very sweet, thick but somewhat light considering the depth here.  Bitterness comes through on the finish.  Alcohol warmth lasts throughout.
O – An incredibly well-constructed, complex beer. However, I would like to revisit after additional aging.  There is a bit of a bite that I didn’t get in the ’13 vintage that should smooth out over time.  Still, quite fantastic as is. 1,151 charactersinfinitebruner, Dec 28, 2014

A:  Good.  Beer pours reddish-black with a massive head (far larger than BCBS) that readily dissipates, giving way to substantial lacing.
S:  Excellent.  Lots of vanilla from the oak.  Substantial darkly-kilned caramel and amber malts give off dark fruit, caramel, and toffee flavors
T:  Perfect.  Taste follows the nose.  Lots of vanilla from the oak; toffee, caramael, plum, and raisins from the malt.  The flavors, however, are perfectly balanced - nothing feels excessive or out-of-place.
M:   Sticky, thick bourbony mouthfeel.  Great.
O:  Great beer.  Liked it slightly more than BCBS 663 charactersleantom, Dec 26, 2014

One finger light brown head that disapates leaving nice ring on tulip glass and a cool center swerl. Smells of sweet molasses and caramel. Quite a nice aroma. Taste is out of this world! Way better then the one I had a year ago. I love how barleywines seem to mellow out and get more complex over time. The over the top sweetness of last years example has been replaced with this smooth barrel aged warmth and malty complexity. Great barleywine. 569 charactersKensWorld, Dec 26, 2014

Aroma of big bourbon booze, vanilla, damp wood, and a touch of coconut.  Taste is much like other BC ales that smack you around with the intense sweetness unlike many others.  Syrupy with dark fruits, toffee, caramels, and more oaky-vanilla notes.  Feel is creamy, somewhat boozy, and silky smooth.  Obviously, a very solid BA barleywine.  Right there with Sucaba, but a step or 2 below Straight Jacket for me. 477 charactersBosoxfan20, Dec 26, 2014

Deep rich color. Nose is almost shy. It's soft sweet bread, rich maltiness, molasses and a hint of alcohol. Wood, sweet bourbon and pretty vanilla. A very subtle bacnote of fruit. It's perfect to the nose. There are no hop scents. taste is unbelievably smooth. The malt is like ribbons and it flows. The mouthfeel is full and creamy. The molasses is sweet and the bread is luscious. Leather. A taste of brown sugar makes you smile a bit and then a light hearted touch of bitterness from alcohol on the way down. A happy warmth finishes this beer with a lingering taste of bourbon and rich brown sugar.
One of the best beers you will ever have. 765 charactersutopiajane, Dec 25, 2014

Dark brown in color with deep ruby highlights. A thin film of head upon pouring dissipates quickly, leaving a tiny ring of foam around the edges. Wonderfully complex aroma. Figs, raisins, and port with faint heavily toasted malts. Vanilla and a touch of bourbon are present as well. Sweet flavor without being cloying or syrupy. The heat is noticeable but does not overpower. Medium to full bodied. Hops and carbonation are basically non existent.
This is a truly delicious beer. Maybe it's unfair to compare, as they are completely different beers, but it's not quite on the level of BCBS for me. This drinks like a port wine and makes an excellent digestif. 716 charactersJacobob10, Dec 21, 2014

12 Fluid Ounce Bottle
Bottled on September 24th, 2014
Reviewed on December 19th, 2014
Served in a Snifter
Eyes
Dark brown body… nearly black. Other than a mahogany glow around the edges of the glass, no light broke through this one. The thinnest of the thin heads formed and quickly collapsed. A few patches of tan foam clung to the edges of the glass.
Nose
Plenty of sweet malts. Caramel, toffee, chocolate, and toasted grains were the prominent aromas. Subtle notes of tobacco and smoke cut through the dominating sweet notes, enhancing the complexity of the toasted malts. Bourbon was definitely present but not overwhelming. 
Mouth
Toasted grains blended with brown sugar,  caramel, and toffee hit the tongue first. Sweet dark fruits contributed a great deal of flavors. Fig, date, and raisin. The alcohol was masked very well. Mild notes of bourbon occasionally broke through but the focus of this beer was definitely on the toasted grains. Low-moderate carbonation. Full body. 
Overall
One of the best barleywines I have consumed. I was very impressed with how well the alcohol was masked. This brew was not over-sweetened which really brought out the best flavors in the malts. A must have year after year. 1,230 charactersChiefy770, Dec 20, 2014

A: Dark brown/burgundy. Pours with a thin, tan head that quickly dissipates. Thick on the glass as I swirl it around.
S: Blown away when I first took a whiff. Such a powerful and beautiful aroma. Dark fruits and caramel with big time vanilla, bourbon sweetness. Maybe a little nuttiness? Enough roastiness to make it almost seem like a stout.
T: Delicious. Starts with a big, smooth hit of caramel and toffee,  but not too sweet. Has some initial dark notes like a stout would. As the carbonation leaves your tongue the dark fruits come out. It ends with a slightly sticky bourbon vanilla roasted sweetness.
M: Smooth and thick. This beer just rolls around in your mouth. Smooth bubbles. A bit of alcohol warming at the very end.
O: This is a fantastic beer. From my experience, this is the most complex Bourbon County beer I have had (compared to BCBS and BCBCS), and borderline my favorite, though I'm a sucker for stouts. In my mind this had always been the younger brother of the two yearly bigs BCBS and BCBCS, but this has earned a big deal of respect from me. Utterly fantastic. 1,122 characterspjvie, Dec 19, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.4%I haven't had many barleywines but this one set the bar pretty high for me. I savored this beer for a good 90 minutes, and I appreciated every single sniff and sip. I drank this one in a 16oz wine glass, gave some room for some swirling.
I also made sure I wasn't eating anything during the tasting, wanted my palate clean. This was one of those ales where you just want it to never leave your mouth. It's that delectable. For my first Bourbon County beer, this one greatly exceeded my expectations. 500 charactersShaneHarris, Dec 14, 2014

4.68/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 12 oz. bottle into a chalice. 2014 Vintage with a bottled on date of 24/Sep/14. ABV listed as 11.7. 
Appearance: Pours a dark blackish brown with a moderate amount of bubbles. Slight tan head that quickly fades away. Noticeable alcohol legs. 
Smell: A rich, sweet, and toasty malt forward aroma with hints of bourbon, fruit, and caramel malt. Upfront barrel presence with hints of bourbon whiskey, sweet vanilla, oak, and wood. Toasted malt with hints of caramel, toffee, toast, biscuit, chocolate, and yeast. Subtle hints of tobacco, leather, and smoke. Sweet scent of molasses, brown sugar, and syrup. Big presence of dark fruit with hints of cherry, raisin, prune, fig, and date. Hops are very light. A really good complex aroma. 
Taste: Like the smell hints at, a rich, sweet, toasty, and complex malt forward taste with big notes of bourbon, dark fruit, and caramel malt. Big barrel presence upfront with notes of bourbon whiskey, vanilla sweetness, oak, and wood. Toasted barley malt with notes of biscuit, toast, toffee, caramel, chocolate, and yeast. Also some tones of leather, tobacco, and smoked malt. Sweet taste of molasses and brown sugar. Big presence of dark fruit with notes of raisin, prune, cherry, fig, and date. Hops are pretty subtle. A really great taste. 
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a lower level of carbonation. Creamy, slick, and nicely juicy and sludgy. Sweet but not to the point of being overly syrupy. Alcohol heat is surprisingly tame. 
Overall: A really great Barleywine that lives up to the hype. Great complex mix of bourbon, malt, and dark fruit flavors. It’s a big sipper but still manages to be smooth considering its size. 1,682 charactersMattyG85, Dec 14, 2014

Pour is very deep brown with dark garnet highlights.  tiny little head dissipates rapidly, leaving behind not a single bubble a few minutes later.
Aroma is sweet with brown sugar, bourbon, wood and dates.
Flavor is much like the nose: sweet with a dark pitted fruit note.  Some cinnamon.  Bourbon note is subdued but noticed.  Some alcohol warmth at the end.  Low bitterness.
Mouthfeel is smooth and a bit thick and chewy.  Warmth from alcohol is present but not overpowering.  Will make your lips sticky.  Carbonation is somewhat missed as this beer is utterly still.
A very nice barleywine, to be sure, but not one of the best I have had. 795 characterscharlzm, Dec 11, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -5.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5My local taproom just tapped this a few days ago.  I have always passed on this in 4 packs but now I decided it was time to give it a go.
A 4 oz pour was brought to me in a snifter.  A/The beer was a dark ruby color with a thin tan color head.  S/The bourbon was most present being followed with toffee maybe caramel and I thought a piney hint. T/Bourbon again was first and foremost and was very pleasant.  It was then a caramel, apricot hint, maybe brown sugar.  M/Fairly thick and coating and very syrupy! O/I enjoyed the 4 oz pour for $4.50 but that was about my limit.  While I enjoyed the first few sips it did not seem to open up to me as it warmed.  I thought it tasted best fairly chilled.  It was too syrupy and way to sweet to me.  I would not enjoy drinking more than what I had.  I do not know if I would go out of my way to find this but I would order it again if it was on tap for a reasonable price.
Since my review I have revisited this on tap and in a bottle.  I found that I like this best out of the bottle or maybe my local taproom doesn't clean their lines that well.  Rating has been changed to reflect this. 1,133 charactersVTR, Dec 10, 2014

Smell is bourbon, dark fruits, sweet, a little cigar,  almost a smell of a red wine a little.  
Taste is simar but there is some caramel and vanilla in there. I think the flavors are more enjoyable as it warms.

4.6/5  rDev +2.4%2014 vintage (12.3% ABV).  Poured from 12 oz bottle into snifter.  Bottled on 18SEP14.
A: Pours a very dark, clear copper brown with essentially no head. (4)
S: Can smell the boozy bourbon waft to your nose from a couple feet away.  Upon closer inspection, dark caramel malt, toffee, sweet bourbon, vanilla, charred oak, sweet tobacco, and a hint of chocolate and dark dried fruit are appreciated.  Nice.  (4.5)
T: Sweet caramel malt, dark dried fruit, hint of berry, milk chocolate, sweet bourbon, toffee, and spice (cinnamon).  With warming, vanilla, sweet tobacco, and charred oak emerge. (4.75)
M: Oh, so smooth.  Sweet and silky feel.  Medium-heavy body...actually drinks lighter than its hefty ABV.  ABV is extremely well hidden...dangerously so.  Mild boozy bourbon burn and tingle hits in the finish...and lingers...and grows on the palate.  Outstanding, especially for style. (5)
D: A simply outstanding example of the style.  Lives up to the hype.  A wonderful winter sipper.  Seek it out! (4.75) 1,006 charactersmwilbur, Dec 08, 2014

A: Pours an almost opaque yet still clear very dark brown (approaching black) in color with moderate to heavy amounts of active visible carbonation rising from the bottom of the glass along the edges and a hint of dark cola brown highlights. The beer has a half finger tall fizzy foamy dark tan head that slowly reduces to a medium to large sized mottled patch of thin film and a large patch of thick film with a thick ring at the edges of the glass. 
S: Moderate to strong aromas of caramel and toffee malts with a moderate amount of sweetness, brown sugar, molasses, and bourbon. Moderate aromas of vanilla and oak with just a hint of alcohol.
T: Upfront there is a moderate to strong flavor of toasted, caramel, and toffee malts with a moderate amount of brown sugar + molasses sweetness. That is followed by moderate to strong flavors of bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Light flavors of alcohol and just a touch of coffee-like bitterness in the finish.
M: Full bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Smooth with a moderate amount of alcohol warming in the finish.
O: Truly a great example of a Bourbon Barrel Aged Barleywine, a style that sometimes is just too sweet for my palate to enjoy but this is one I would gladly drink over and over again. Wonderful complexity and balance to the flavors. 1,357 charactersdbrauneis, Dec 06, 2014

O  Bizarre palate. Bourbon came through at first, followed by malts– an experience comparable to the first sip of a mixed drink. Then tobacco came through, out of nowhere! Prunes and a woody aroma followed. Not something I'd drink frequently, but certainly enjoyable and bewildering. Also, much preferred over Goose Island's 2014 Bourbon County Coffee Stout. 552 charactersJonoesh5, Dec 04, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.8%Absolutely gorgeous in the glass. Dark red/amber/brown approaching burgundy, it could be mistaken for wine. Almost no head, just a few tan bubble wandering around. 
Hugely fruity nose, plums and figs I think. There is definitely some bourbon on the nose, but not nearly as much as BCBS. Some alcohol present as well. 
The taste is like drinking juice concentrate syrup, like stealing some ZaRex from the cabinet when you were a kid. Seriously sweet and fruity, with some sourness to back it up. Then the bourbon comes in with some vanilla and oak, very warming. Finally, as the beer approaches room temp, the remnants of the BCBS in the barrel comes out. Toffee and toasted malts mellow everything out. 
Truly a complex beverage, there's so much to enjoy at every point, and nothing is too overpowering. ABV is well hidden and the mouthfeel is just right. It's thick, but has enough carbonation to prevent it from being cloying. 931 charactersrebel-fist, Dec 02, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.2%Looks to be dark red as it is being poured, then looks black in the glass until you hold it up to the light. then you see it is a very dark ruby red color. Very nice looking, with just a small tan head that quickly dissipated to a little lacing across the top and on the side of the glass.
Smell is dark fruit, like raisin and prune, with hints of caramel, toffee, and brown sugar.
Taste is fruity, like dried dark fruit, mainly raisin and prune. There's come caramel and toffee, brown sugar, and Belgian candy sugar. The alcohol is mainly present as a warming at the finish.
The feel is smooth and silky, feels nice going down.
This is a really nice beer, it is a touch on the boozy side, but full of flavor, and hides the ABV well. It is a bit easier to drink than regular BCS, and a worthy member of the Bourbon County family. 833 charactersVixie, Nov 30, 2014
4.77/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This beer is good, no doubt a well crafted beer. As far as barley wines go, this is on the upper level. I cant say it's better then Sucaba, then again I didnt look as to what I rated Sucaba before I reviewed this beer. This has a molasses, strong ale kinda taste to it. With all the hassle it takes to get this brew, I feel there are others out there that can satisfy my cravings without having to chase after this mini whale and pay a bundle.
Bottom Line: Great beer but to what end?

Pours thin tan head.
Smells of  raisins, figs, and vanilla and booze
Mouth feel is slightly sticky and medium body and slightly sweet
Taste is a complex dance of balanced flavors over a booze aftertaste. Taste comes back to raisins, dates, vanilla, wood and booze.
Just an awesome beer overall that could make an impact on your wallet and liver.

O:  An enjoyable beer, overall.  I'd like it if it weren't quite so sweet and if it were a bit smoother, but it's not so cloying and boozy as the BCBS line. 660 charactersn2185, Nov 29, 2014

A:  Deep dark mahogany brown tinged with a reddish hue.  This viscous vixen pours slowly into a teku and churns up only the slightest foam before quickly settling into a tight ring that frames a perfectly mirror-like dark surface.  I did a double-take while pouring to make sure I wasn't actually squeezing dark maple syrup into my glass.
S:  I hope I like drinking puréed raisins that have been macerated in bourbon and poured over burnt marshmallows.  That's what this smells like.
T:  I like them.  Initial wave of caramelized brown sugar and dark fruit sweetness fades into a leathery tobacco as it coats the mouth and finishes with a beautiful bourbon spice and tingle.  This has definitely mellowed in a really nice way.
M:  just what you want in a BW.  Sticky, but not cloying.  Thick and creamy, but with enough carb to let it dance.
O:  A real treat.  It's hard to understand why this variant always seems to be the red headed stepchild of the BC lineup. Perhaps it's because the stouts are so damn good as well.  All I know is that King Henry is quickly rising up my list of must-try beers.  If it's markedly better than this, then I'm bound to love it. 1,237 charactersTampaRainman, Nov 28, 2014

A soft and persistent fluffy tan head crowns this dark brown brew.  Robust notes of chocolate and cherry float supersede fainter notes of cotton candy, oak and vanilla.  Creamy and cake-like with more chocolate, cherry and other dark fruits, followed by a hint of grain, pine right down the middle, slight fusel alcohol and vanilla.  Slightly medicinal as it warms.  Full-bodied, delicate despite it's stature, and smooth until the very end.  
All politics of business aside, this is an outstanding brew.  Too bad I will never pay for it. 594 charactersstephens101, Nov 25, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +5.8%appearance-color is a rich, prominent brown, with a bot of shine to it. pours a half finger of silky, brown head that settles into a thin layer that stubbornly retains.
Smell-Tons of dark fruit, shortbread like malt sweetness,molasses, a little coffee in the edges.
Taste- dark fruit upfront, dates, figs, cherries, then comes coffee and cake from a combination of the  thick, sweet malt and the bourbon notes. super smooth. almost no abv detected
Feel-very thick, very mildly carbonated. either from the head or the beer itself there is a very creamy feel in the finish.
overall-a near perfect beer. extremely delicious, drinks dangerously smooth yet is very warming and satisfying. 683 charactersSteveB24, Nov 24, 2014

Flavor is not near as boozy as the smell. Lots of great dark fruit notes with a mild alcohol burn. Very conolex flavors. Definitely a sipper. Although this is not my favorite style, I did enjoy this beer. Definitely some unique, rich flavors. Worth the price to pick one up if you can get it. I imagine drinking a fresh one would be entirely too boozy for my palate. 546 charactersBrewThru_29, Nov 24, 2014

A: 3/3 - deep mahogany brown; low clarity (cannot read or see through), pours motor oil thick and carbonation emerges from within as the beer settles into the glass; thin tannish glass lacing, large alcohol legs clinging to the glass even asymmetrically!
S: 11/12 - large raisin, stone fruit, vanilla, coconut and alcohol aroma; little-to-no hop aroma; no diacetyl, no DMS
T: 17/20 - on the front of the tongue, there is an immediate sweetness (with very little bitterness) that is replaced by flavors that compliment the nose - cola, tobacco, molasses, stone fruit, vanilla, coconut and toffee; there is a large warming heat on the back end; finishes sweet but not cloying
M: 5/5 - very thick, chewy body; oily even with the high ABV; low-to-moderate carbonation that is appropriate (or, better yet, perfect for style)
O: 9/10 - one of the best American takes on an EBW that is a total palate assault; the only thing that I don't like is the cola flavor, and, for this reason, I detracted a point; if this flavor was absent (here's to hoping for the 2014 vintage), this is a clear 10; yet, for me, this a slight step down from Sucaba, whose flavors are more subtle, gentle and well-placed without any unwarranted character

4.25/5  rDev -5.3%Bottle: Poured a deep murky brown color ale with a medium size foamy head with medium retention and limited lacing. Aroma of toffee, heavy caramelized malt notes and some vanilla and bourbon notes. Taste is also dominated by loads of toffee and caramelized notes with a healthy dose of residual sugar notes with some nice bourbon and vanilla notes. Body is quite full with a good amount of carbonation with light warming alcohol notes. Very well brewed with nice balanced with the barrel-aging notes. Maybe a tad too much residual sugars. 538 charactersPhyl21ca, Nov 20, 2014

This is the darkest barleywine I've seen. It's practically black, which must come from the stout that was in the barrels before it?
The main aroma is bourbon and boozy, with a hint of caramel.
The flavor is similar to BCBS: Boozy and woody, with heavy malt sweetness. After a few sips the barleywine qualities emerge: malt syrup notes and hops.
Great body. Smooth and glassy and thick.
Overall? It's excellent. 461 charactersShaw, Nov 16, 2014

Pours a dark mahogany color with a less than finger head that disappears quickly. No lacing or head at all!
Smell is rich on the brown sugar, vanilla, apple, figs, and a tiny hint of cinnamon and even a pumpkin spice.
Taste is huge on the vanilla and brown sugar. Fig, raisin, cinnamon apple, bourbon, along with some oaky dark fruit. 
Feel is nearly perfect. A luxuriously thick mouthfeel with a nice bourbon and spicy tang at the end of it. Not much carbonation. 
Overall probably the best BA or regular Barleywine I've had. I'll have to seek out others in this style but damn this seems like perfection! 653 charactersaoampm, Nov 14, 2014

From a bottle into a snifter
Bottled 24 September 2013
Drunk with King Henry for comparative purposes
APPEARANCE: Pours a 1 ½ finger, slightly looser, crackly and fizzy, foamy, light tan head with half decent retention. Head quickly fades to a half wisp and ring. Clear deep maroon red or seal brown with a stream of carbonation up the middle. Wisp and ring eventually vanish making it look rather flat by the end of the show. Much like KH but perhaps a touch lighter in color. 
SMELL: Bourbon, oak, lots of vanilla and caramel, with some milk chocolate as well. Notes of coconut as well. Bold and impressive for sure. Really lovely. Only the touch of pure chocolate in KH sets it apart. Excellent here. 
TASTE: Oak, bourbon, notes of toffee up front, then lots of wood flavors and some alcohol at the swallow. Bold and lingering finish of bourbon, wood, caramel and toffee sweetness, dark fruits and spicy alcohol. Notes of milk chocolate and vanilla from the barrel make an appearance long after the swallow as well. Really good stuff. Enjoyable for sure. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. A touch lighter on the palate perhaps, but very creamy smooth, surprisingly so, goes down fine with a little scratch and finishes rather sticky. Some heat lingers, but nothing off-putting. A touch lighter than desired perhaps, but plenty creamy and smooth. Same as KH here. 
OVERALL: This was really good. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed this one just as much as King Henry, and I wasn’t sure that would be the case. To be sure, people have said that KH has fallen off a cliff, but the bottle we opened was still in excellent shape and we enjoyed it immensely. Compared to the King, this one has more oak and toffee in the flavor, while it is also smoother and creamier in the feel. KH in a bit sharper in the barrel and alcohol flavors at this point and there is a hint of bitter pure chocolate that lends some nice balance. In any case, this is a quality barleywine and I wish Goose Island could somehow produce their stout with the same creamy feel that they’ve pulled off here. Good stuff, and would gladly drink more. Cheers Doops! 2,240 charactersJeffo, Nov 09, 2014
4/5  rDev -10.9%*This one I had was bottled 9/13/2013*
A- Dark purple. Sediment cannot be seen in the glass until held up in the light. It's just a very dark beer. You get some thick, tan, khaki head. The head in general the head completely dies. Pretty sticky lacing on this one.
S- Right away from opening the smell jumped out. Not even sticking my nose into my snifter glass, big sweetness, bourbon, and alcohol jump out. Upon closer inspection, charred oak notes and vanilla show up. Dark fruits and alcohol stand out as well. Bready. When swirled, more boozy notes show up. Maybe some cocoanut too. Very big nose.
T- I am now reviewing this beer closer to room temperature. When it was cooler, I did not get as much coconut as I am now. It's a very sweet beer. The booze still comes out warmed up, but not so strong. But the alcohol is unmistakable. Lots of dark fruit and charred oak barrel notes in here. Bourbon and vanilla as well. Fairly bready. It does have an agressive bitterness, but it's not a hoppy bitterness. I tend to find that high ABV beers have a different layer of bitterness than just from hops. Complex overall. I've probably missed things it's so complex. That's just the style.
M- Full bodied. Very chewy like a big old red wine. The body of the beer is very slick, sticky, and oily. The rim of my glass is very sticky.  When you take the your first sip, you notice the beer immediately starts to coat the entire palate and works it way to the back of the throat. I don't think this has a very strong alcohol burn at all for as big of a beer as it is, but it is there in feel all the way down the throat. At this point, my throat feels like I have been drinking a few shots of whiskey. It could be that beer is giving me a pretty good buzz from the 12.10% ABV!
Overall, this is an intense, rich, complex, and extremely flavorful beer. It's very, very sweet with a nice boozy kick. This is a pretty good beer to sip and enjoy. Take your time with this one. I'm glad I bought a 4 pack of this when I saw it. 2,021 charactersThomasMetal75, Nov 09, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.8%Poured a dark opaque chocolate in a snifter, the suggested glass, with no head. 
Aroma- deep cask oak. This is the deepest oak I have experienced in a barrel aged beer: cherry, oak barrel, vanilla, plum, vanilla.
It's very carbonated, and light bodied- unlike other barrel aged English Barleywines.
The taste and finish are interlocked- heavy pium, barrel oak. The cherry, oak is phenomenal. 
The oak and plum intensify with warming.
The light alcoholic finish doesn't overwhelm the taste. With warming, chocolate appears.
The beer's tastes are smoother with warming, and the alcoholic finish becomes more pronounced.
The beer is a masterpiece of blending diverse aromas and taste. In contrast to other beers in the style, it stands out as an exceptional brew. Perhaps I will find another bottle to cellar. 811 charactersbrureview, Nov 06, 2014

Appearance. Pours a thick looking cola brown with a half finger of light tan head that fades to a thin collar.
Smell. Caramel and plump juicy raisins, toasted oak and sweet bourbon with a little heat, a little chocolate, coconut, and demerara sugar.
Taste. Nice caramel, brown sugar, molasses, toasted oak, raisins, vanilla, smooth booze, a little coconut. Really nice stuff.
Mouthfeel. Very full, slightly sticky but nothing annoying, smooth low carbonation. 
Overall. Great stuff. Betting it will be even better with a year or two on it. Can't wait to see! 606 charactersRutager, Nov 05, 2014

A - Almost no head.  Visible carbonation.  Muddy, cloudy dark brown body.  Poor lacing.
S - Barrel and chocolate notes.  Toffee and butterscotch.  Some alcohol comes through especially as it warms.
T - Toffee and caramel.  Some sweet bourbon notes.  Tons of caramel/butterscotch in the finish with some chocolate and some slight coffee ground bitterness.  More booze, cocoa and butterscotch as it warms.
M - A little thin and flat to start.  The middle becomes more creamy and syrupy, and the flavors really open up.  Sticky finish.
O - Delicious and super complex.  Not the prettiest looking beer, but damn good.
Same bottle date as above - consumed 10/22/15
A- same as above but with a significant amount of floating sediment.  Guess I should have taken more care pouring.  Started with about 1/2 inch of light tan head which dissipated quickly.
S- toffee, caramel, bourbon, a hint of banana.  No booze at all.
T-  again, tons of Toffee and caramel.  Some sweet bourbon and oak notes and a little banana again.  Tons of caramel/butterscotch in the finish with a very slight chocolate touch.  Like the aroma, I detect no heat.
M - fuller bodied.  Finish is still sticky.  Definitely a desert beer.
O - not sure if this is any better with another year, but there are definitely some changes to all characteristics.  Still an incredible barley wine.  Looking forward to another year of aging.  Kind of reminds me of Pierre Ferdinand Millionaire. 1,496 charactersAirBob, Nov 01, 2014

Hints of roasty malts from the stout that was in the barrels before this?  Mouthfeel is sticky, thick, and soft.  Tasty bourbon barrel aged barleywine. 445 charactersgoochpunch, Oct 31, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.8%Look: Opaque black-amber with a thin vanilla head that rims the glass. Minimal legs.
 Smell: Huge bourbon, vanilla, lots of oak, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, more vanilla, and oak again. 
 Taste: Huge chocolate covered raisins, dates, toasted cinnamon bread, molasses notes, huge bourbon, lots of vanilla, toffee, prunes, dark grapes, and the oak really makes an appearance on finish with more raisins.
 Mouthfeel: This is a huge beer. Thick and sticky clings to the palate and coats the mouth and throat. Slight alcohol but nothing considering the ABV. The booze does warm the body as you drink though.
 Overall: Another great barrel aged brew from goose island. Loving the huge vanilla, bourbon, and dark fruit notes. They are all separate but make for big beer that has no business being this ridiculously tasty. A perfect desert sipper to celebrate a special occasion. Another world class barrel aged beer from Goose Island. 934 charactersBergBeer, Oct 28, 2014

Bottle, 2013 release. Thanks, Chris. A syrupy dark brown with a dense, foamy head with excellent retention and minimal lacing, this beer has nice legs. The nose is big, boozy, sweet and decadent. Leather, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, molasses, jaggery - all kinds of sweetness - is present. Bourbon character is shockingly mellow given this beers siblings. Vanilla and rum; a little bit of oak and char are present. Moderately fruity with plums and raisins present. Yum. The palate opens with a big sweetness and a moderate heat. In the vein of an English BW, Thankfully, not as prune-heavy as King Henry was. Caramel, toffee, brown sugar, a little bit of burnt sugar, a little earth and leather are noticeable, along with a blend of raisins and dates deglazed with rum. Vanilla, a little oak, some rum and bourbon character are present. A dusting of cocoa is present, particularly in the way the roasted malt flavors play off the fruity and sweet flavors. Full in body with a soft carbonation, this beer has a long, sweet finish with caramel and toffee dominating. Excellent stuff 1,095 charactersDefenCorps, Oct 26, 2014

Review #950
A frothy, one-finger tall, cappuccino colored crown topped the shimmery, garnet-tinged mahogany liquid. The head quickly dissipated to a thin ring. A few small dots of lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was fantastic. Overtly boozy and sweet with intense bourbon and brown sugar notes. Very malt-centric and almost candy-like. Super fruity. Cherry and raspberry notes were apparent. Luxardo Maraschino cherry juice came to mind. Somewhat spicy. Fragrant vanilla bean notes were detectible as well.
The flavor profile was also incredibly rich and intense. Sweet and boozy with strong brown sugar notes. Touch of chocolate and roast. This beer is all about the malts. Loads of caramel and toffee. Quite spicy and very berry-like. As in the nose, notes of Maraschino cherry juice came through strong. Vanilla was also quite noticeable. The finish contained strong notes of bourbon and oak. Boozy, but in a really good sort of way.
Outstanding mouthfeel. The liquid was thick, rich and almost chewy. The beer turned super creamy and smooth on the palate. An ultra fine, fluffy, tongue blanketing effervescence gave the beer a perfect frothy quality. After every sip, the liquid left a sticky film on my lips.
Bourbon County Brand Barleywine Ale is an intense, bourbon-forward beer that would make for a perfect after dinner sipper on a cold winter night. Even though the barrels used to age this beer had previously aged two beers before it, they still lent an immense amount of bourbon flavor and complexity. I looking forward to seeing how this beer evolves with time. 1,703 charactersDamian, Oct 23, 2014

A  dark brownish maroon, thick looking liquid, just a short lived finger of foam and it leaves no lace and I suppose that's to be expected at this strength, some wide legs try to form on the side of the glass
S  plenty of soft caramel, toffee, and butterscotch, smells sweet, vanilla, bourbon soaked wood, faint chocolate, maple fudge comes out strong, brown sugar, and a hint of candied cherry, a little booze but well hidden for 12+%, smells great 
T  more of the same really but I was expecting it to be a little sweeter after smelling it, more bourbon and booze but it doesn't hinder,  faint dark roast notes work well for it just hiding out in the background
M  thick and syrupy, almost foams up much too my surprise but it stays creamy, a little heat going down but you feel more in you chest and head then your throat, my lips are stuck together, lots of wood and caramel lingering
O  beautiful beer, great base, the barrel choice gives just a hint of stout popping here and there, plenty going on, a mellow sipper that could injure me if I had a couple more bottles 
this one lives up to the hype, I wish I had more to age but I'm just stoked I got to try it, drinking well for a big young BW, well done Goose Island 1,307 characterswordemupg, Oct 22, 2014

A: Pours dark brown/black with very little head. Black at first glance, but a nice brown amber color emerges when viewed under light.
S: Stone fruit, caramel, vanilla, chocolate, cinnamon. Smells like a cinnamon roll and french toast. A bit of alcohol is present as well.
T:  Caramel, vanilla, and bourbon/oak, fig. Might be a little bit too sweet for some, but this is truly a treat. The alcohol is well hidden under all the sweetness but provides a nice burn.
F: Perfect body, perfect mouthfeel.
O: Overall this is one of the the best beers I've ever had the privilege to enjoy; a masterpiece. Drinking this and writing this review reminds me why I love and continue to spend my time and money on craft beer. Cheers! 735 charactersalexk307, Oct 21, 2014

4.08/5  rDev -9.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Pours a black body with a muddy brown hue. Head is 1/5 an inch and tan in color. Head retention and lacing are average for the style.
Smell is of sweet bourbon soaked fudge. caramelized sugar and charred oak. 
Taste is very sweet, kinda reminds me of dark lord. Caramelized bourbon soaked dates, chocolate syrup, tobacco and burnt malt dominate palate. Aftertaste is big on bourbon.
Mouthfeel is pretty viscous, carbonation levels are average for style. Head was pretty weak and didn't contribute much.
Overall this beer was pretty tasty but a bit on the sweet side. Not too boozy for 12 percent but theres nothing there to offset the cloying sweetness. Probably my least favorite of the bourbon county series. 714 charactersangelmonster, Oct 14, 2014

The smell is all bourbon upfront with hints of vanilla, caramel, and raisins. The flavor is very sweet, lots of dark fruits, molasses, and char from the barrels. The feel is thick, smooth, and coats the mouth. Outstanding barley as expected. I enjoy grabbing a few of these each year. 350 charactersMeyers1023, Oct 13, 2014

Pours mahogany with a head that becomes a lasting ring, leaving some trailing lace.
The smell is very rich and malty - toffee, nougat, with dried fruits
The taste is of rich, sweet malt - toffee and nougat backed by dried fruits. A touch of vanilla comes through. Alcohol warmth well-integrated adding to the complexity and taste.
Smooth despite the abv.
This is a wonderful English Barleywine! Incredible! It's a great "sipping" beer to say the least.  The long finish lingered in a pleasant for hours after my 8 oz. drink was done.  It's somewhat like a softly carbonated liqueur for beer drinkers! Sweet, but not sticky. An amazingly rich, great example of an English-style Barleywine! 734 charactersjwc215, Sep 12, 2014

4.58/5  rDev +2%A special occasion for my 400th Beer Advocate review.
Bottled on September 24, 2013.
Pours opaque dark brown. The faint khaki head quickly disappears completely and leaves no lace. 
The smell is an amazing combination of caramel, molasses, raisin, black cherry, vanilla, pipe tobacco and faint cocoa. 
The taste is equally complex with raisins, figs, plums, molasses, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, maple syrup and faint dark chocolate. Each and every flavor is amplified as the beer warms. 
The texture is thick and syrupy with low carbonation. 
An unbelievable barleywine, even in comparison to other "world class" examples of the style. So many aromas and flavors blended together in perfect harmony. A pleasure to the senses. 732 charactersFurlinator, Sep 12, 2014

Aromas of big raisin, prune, fig, caramel, toffee, toast, brown sugar, molasses, vanilla, coconut, oak, bourbon, light tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness. Very nice aromas with good balance and complexity of dark malt, fruitiness, and bourbon barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big raisin, prune, fig, chocolate, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, coconut, light tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness. Light earthy oak bitterness/spice on the finish; with lingering notes of raisin, prune, fig, chocolate, caramel, molasses, toast, brown sugar, toffee, vanilla, oak, bourbon, coconut, light tobacco, and toast/oak earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity and big robustness of dark malt, fruitiness, and bourbon barrel flavors; with a fantastic malt/barrel balance and zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and very full bodied; with a very creamy, slick, and fairly syrupy mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a light warming present after the finish. Overall this is an outstanding barrel aged barleywine. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of dark malt, fruitiness, and bourbon barrel flavors; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering. 1,568 characterssuperspak, Sep 06, 2014

I could drink this and still wonder if it contained alcohol even though it was laid to rest in a bourbon barrel. If you like barleywines this is it! 253 charactersFlight317, Aug 28, 2014

A: dark garnet or amber appearance, hazy, with absolutely zero head drawn from an admittedly slow pour. there's no alcohol cling
S: aroma reflects the fact that this was aged in third use barrels (first bourbon, then the bcbs). there are aspects of the barleywine, the bourbon barrels, and the underlying stout. dark fruit, roasted barley, but very high cacao dark chocolate, toasted coconut, caramel too. the alcohol phenols are present, but there is so much else going on that they're not overwhelming. damn, this is fine
T: again, dark fruit dominates, but there's dark chocolate and booze too. true to style, earthy hops are present, but aren't distracting
M: the mouthfeel's not so much thick as buttery. very pleasant stickiness. low to mild carbonation 814 charactersStoutItOutLoud, Aug 04, 2014

Sep 24 2013 bottling date. Nose is malt, caramel, whiskey and cigar with background notes of brown sugary sweetness. Taste follows the nose..slow and sweet with just a little heat.

4.66/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Served as the start to the goose island themed tasting (we did start with Fred from Hair of the Dog). Short notes from 7/27/14. Bottled 9/17/13. Served in a snifter.
A&S: The beer is a murky brown color. Pieces of unfiltered specks float around the bottom of this beer. No head present when poured. The aroma was amazing, it was the kind of smell you wish could be stuck in your nose all day. Caramel tones blended with raisins, sugary belgian candy sweetness, and boozy bourbon tones. Really about as good as I have seen it.
T&M: This beer was extremely complex, transforming and opening up continuously as it sat in the glass. It started with a characteristic that most decent barleywines share dark fruit tones. The dark fruits were primarily raisins but later on I think I got some plums. Towards the end I was odd enough picking up on some dark chocolate flavors. No real hop presence. The carbonation quantity was excellent, just right to make it not completely dead, but not too much to make it any bit sharp. Body wasn't as thick as it could have been, but I was for sure more than just a medium thickness. 
Overall: The was the opener for the afternoon and I have to say I like it the best! All three (this one, the cherry rye, and the coffee) of the goose island specialties were spectacular, but for me, this one took the cake. I would be interested to see how this beer develops, however it would be a tough task considering it was so epic at this stage. One of my favorite beers I have had the pleasure to try this year. 1,536 charactersminterro, Jul 31, 2014

Barleywines, nowadays, seem to lack that barley presence in favor of the coffee/chocolate tastes. This is not one of those. The head lacing are virtually nonexistent. So what? If you have no fear of the dark you will feel right at home here.
2016 Still my fav of all the GIBC releases. 393 charactersseedyone, Jul 23, 2014

A: dark, deep English chestnut, not quite fully opaque. Short lived head minimal lacing. 
S: like someone carmelizing figs with molasses and butter. The smell on the finish persists forv long, long time. 
T: same as the smell, but the buttery flavors are stronger. The bourbon and the alcohol are hidden. Unlike the stout this just picks up toffee and caramel along with some vanilla oak. 
M: again buttery. This coats your whole mouth, and remains after you swallow. It's is viscous and the carbonation is just right. 
O: can't conceive of something better. As good perhaps, but this is sublime. 629 charactersHuskyHawk, Jul 20, 2014

S: Up front I got booze, bourbon, and dark fruits, then it mellowed out with some caramel, toffee, and coconut. I absolutely love how this beer smells, a perfect blend of barley wine and stout!
T: Initial flavors are bourbon chocolate and dark fruits, very reminiscent of BCBS, but then transitions to the barley wine side and you get booze, caramel toffee, and light hints of coconut, again I love how this beer tastes, stout/barleywine mix, it is crazy good!
M: Very much like the bourbon county line ups, syrupy, smooth, dries quickly, and the taste lingers but compliments the beer!
O: It is not a very traditional barley wine, but damn it is good! 1,056 charactersKnowYourCraft, Jul 18, 2014

Drank Fresh, as they all should be in my opinion. Sticky icky icky barrel at the front. Werther's Original and Toffee up front, followed by a huge dose of Bourbon and Vanilla. Brown Sugar and raisins. Some Chocolate, but this is all about the vanilla bourbon barrel and toffee. Raw bourbon barrel forward as these series of beers always seem to be and follow suit. Bourbon county barrel flavor profile follows suit. 
Highly recommended. 569 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Jul 10, 2014

L - pours thick with a dark brown body, very thin beige head
S - sweet, brown sugar, bourbon, booze, caramel, toffee, fruity esters, vanilla, oak
T - sweet and rich with bourbon at the forefront, brown sugar, toffee, caramel, earth, oak, vanilla, some faint roasted barley and stout qualities do come through from the BCBS barrel usage, which add to its complexity
F - full body, smooth, sticky and rich, excellent balance, quite boozy at times but it's supposed to be, finishes with the bourbon and oak lingering
O - a real treat! Excellent bourbon barrel aged barleywine! 616 charactersbarnzy78, Jul 09, 2014

4.11/5  rDev -8.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Pours a deep brown color almost black. The beige head is dense and settles into an off balance chunky ring.
The aroma is very sweet; dessert beer like. Big caramel and toffee. Big bourbon and vanilla. I imagine this is what a crazy English toffee bread pudding dessert would smell like. Some dark fruit notes as well, mainly prune.
The taste is similar to the aroma but smoother and more balanced. More of the roasted flavors from the BCBS barrel come through. Caramel, toffee, and bourbon come through strong. Vanilla and light oak pop from the barrel and there appears to be a sour cherry fruit note.
The beer is full bodied with semi soft carbonation. Quite sweet on the palate, a bit sticky. The abv peaks through but for the most part is blended well. Despite the stickiness, the beer is smooth.
A very flavorful barleywine. It is quite sweet and could use a touch of bitter offset. Unlike the stout, the bourbon doesn't hit you over the head. 952 charactersGmann, Jul 07, 2014

A: pours a deep maroon / brown. nice ring of foam surrounds the glass. little retention, however, that is to be expected with a beer that is 12% abv
S: I got bourbon, oaky vanilla, sweetness from the malt, a bit of hops, traces of alcohol. dark fruit. plum, raisin, fig.
T: upfront the bourbon barrel makes itself known, this then gives way into a ton of dark fruits, plum, raisin, fig. and malt sweetness. then finish is oaky, vanilla. delicious. slight trace of alcohol, but nicely hidden. sweetly dry finish.
M: thick and delicious. coats the mouth.

A: darkest shade of brown on the spectrum. looks like cola. no carb or head to speak of, but plenty of legs. looks to be a boozy beast, and i'm ok with that
S: dominant aromas were burnt toffee, brown sugar, and wood. also some sweet roastiness
T: sweet dark fruit (raisins, figs), dark cherries covered in dark chocolate, and bitter roastiness. lots of booze integrated nicely with all those subtle flavors. just vanilla, toffee, brown sugar, and oak everywhere. incredible stuff.
M: perfect, again: it's got the mouthfeel of BCBS (thick, viscous, syrupy), which feels so right next to those tight english barleywine flavors. i've never had a BA barleywine with this kind of mouthfeel; it surpasses even the mouthfeel of the finest such beer known to man, MOAS.

A: Pours a deep dark caramel brown with a very short lived and surprisingly fizzy light brown head that quickly disappeared into nothingness. No lace. 
S: Sweet notes of bourbon, caramel, brown sugar and molasses. Booze comes through as well. Not as potent or rich as I was hoping. 
T: Rich and potent flavors of chocolate fudge, boozy bourbon barrel, vanilla, toast and caramel come through. Sticky raisin, brown sugar sweetness, and candied dates come to mind as well. I get notes of leather and honey in the finish, and the aftertaste is full of brown sugar sweetness, melted chocolate, and smooth bourbon. More chocolate flavors in this than I was expecting.
M: Very thick and heavy body, heavy and chew mouthfeel, and surprisingly frothy carbonation that foams up on my palate. The finish has a touch of alcohol warmth to it, but overall the booze is hidden very nicely. The mouthfeel is very smooth and decadent, but it also has a strong bitter punch in the finish. 
O: A very solid easy to drink barrel aged barleywine. I think another year or two on this and it will be even better. Not my favorite at the moment, but definitely top tier. 1,189 charactersscottfrie, Jul 01, 2014

Looks wonderful, smells wonderful, tastes incredible. Dark fruits, Vanilla, bourbon, heaven (that's a flavor right?).
I really wish this beer was easier to get. 241 charactersAdmiralOzone, Jun 28, 2014

4.83/5  rDev +7.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bottle into a snifter.
Appearance: Dark clear brown with a one finger dark tan head. Bit of an oil slick top as the head fades.
Aroma: Dark fruits, figs and plums, with some cocoa and brown sugar. Little bit of a raisiny/coconut alcohol. Barrel comes through clearly.
Taste: Sweet vanilla and figs, dark fruit crumble coconut and brown sugar and a bit of alcohol burn. Vanilla shines as it warms
Mouth feel: Rich and full. Carbonation is low, only a slight prickle. Right in line with the the rest of the bourbon county line.
Overall: An awesome sipper. Its incredibly pleasant as the bcbs barrels really take this barleywine to the next level. the alcohol heat is a little more present than in some other barleywines but it doesn't take away from the beer much at all.

Once swirled, a short lived head forms to release the aroma. The booze is well hidden in both the aroma and taste. I smell dark fruit, strong sweet licorice, vanilla. Taste is licorice, oak, with a lasting raisin on the mouth. Mouthful is full, slightly sticky. Overall this beer is perfect! Bought 3 4-packs and am cellaring 2 packs, can't wait. I also plan on doing a side by side with other barleywines. 494 charactersarlo19, Jun 21, 2014

Beautiful stout like pour from a bottle into a snifter, minimal head along the glass as expected. Darkness surprised me a bit, but it has me excited to try it.
On the nose it's malty, milky and caramel throughout. I'm distinctly reminded of those chocolate covered malt ball candies I liked as a kid. It still is not saying "barley wine" to me yet, but the nose is spectacular just the same.
The tongue is dead-on with the nose. Sugar-malt and foamy right away, caramel, some coffee-like on the finish. The alcohol (12+) is well hidden up front and just some heat on the finish that is not offensive in the least. Surprised at the bubbly feel with the silky-stickiness that I was expecting. Mouthfeel supersedes expectation.
Instantly one of my favorites, absolutely fantastic. Wish it were more available in my area. Though it was marked up over 4x from where I bought it, I would do it again if in the mood. This is a must-try. This is a classic BA beer. 1,024 charactersBonsall_Phil, Jun 16, 2014

Pours a muddy, dirty brown with floaties and a one finger beige head...and I like.
The smell is awesome. Bourbon, chocolate, booze soaked dark fruit, and caramel.
The taste totally caught me off-guard. I was thinking a standard BW flavor, but this hit me right from the tongue touch. Fruity, bourbon, molasses, plum and dates. Light spice burn down the throat and a warm tummy to follow. Unlike any BW I've had with the bigger fruit element.
Silky and creamy mouthfeel. 
Overall this was a fantastic beer. A different breed of BW and one not to be missed. Finding it can be tough, but the reward is worth the search....and the $6 price tag. 737 characterskaseydad, Jun 13, 2014

Appearance: Pours a dark raisin brown and leaves just a hint of off-white head that fades right away to nothing. Some floaties can be seen in the beer.
Smell: Big sugar coated raisins, sweet dark fruits, bourbon soaked figs, molasses, dark chocolate, oak, licorice. Delicious sweet dark fruits are the main players here.
Taste: Big sweet dark fruits, vanilla, oak, butterscotch, dark chocolate, toffee. Fantastic sweet flavors all meld together wonderfully. ABV is masked masterfully.
Mouth-feel: Low to medium carbonation with a medium to thick sticky body. Fits the style very well. Finishes smooth.
Overall: The perfect example of a well done BA barleywine. Big sweet flavors mask the alcohol, and the smell, taste and mouthfeel are superb. 830 charactersResuin, Jun 02, 2014

A: A dark brown with slightly reddish hues. Poured with a light brown/tan head.
S: Has an aroma containing fruity fig smells as well as caramel, whiskey, and some malts (chocolate).
T: A very complex and balanced flavor. Has a great balance and blend of fruity fig flavors and whiskey, along with cherry and chocolate.
M: Smooth, heavy, and thick without being overbearing or weighty.
O: An amazing beer and I look forward to having it again. 532 charactersRichardbcoffin, May 28, 2014

A-Served a deep mahogany color with a nice head.

T-Taste is a blend of dark fruit with the whiskey, malt and hint of chocolate. Mild bitterness and the finish is slightly sweet and sticky.

A. Pours an opaque, deep, blackstrap molasses brown. Sunburst tobacco edges in the light. A thin, tight khaki head that burns off to a consistent ring of tan on the sides with swirls of bubbles across the middle. Lacing is faint, but it's there. Oily legs leave a boozy-sweet coating along the rim. Darker than your average English BW, but gorgeous all the same.
S. Big toffee, raisin, dark cherry, caramel, and vanilla. Fresh brownie batter with dark chocolate crumbles speaks to the BCBS barrel aging here. Stronger than expected stone fruit present, including a bit of strawberry. Perhaps most surprising: orange zest, just a pinch. Lots of toasted marshmallow, coconut, and cashew in the bouquet as well. Infinitely complex, decadent, and inviting.
T. Very toffee, caramel, chocolate, and stone-fruit forward. BCBS influence is very heavy here, which isn't a bad thing, because the English BW base provides this wonderfully nutty, treacle-like backbone. The opening is vanilla, coconut, and chocolate, with the mid shifting more to caramel, roasted cashew, and slightly burned chocolate, and the finish resolving into a beautiful toasted coconut, marshmallow, chocolate tinged orange flavor. Wonderful.
M. Carbonation is moderate-low and the feel is hefty, thick, coating, and sweet. An excellent dessert beer, this would kill with some blue cheese and candied apricots. Full bodied to the teeth, this one is a meal in and of itself. Balance and complexity are top notch.
O. Had this alongside a King Henry and it held its own, though KH is starting to show its sherry-like oxidation notes, so it may not be an entirely fair comparison.The barrel on KH is certainly more "alive". It has more character and is surprisingly boozy after 2.5 years. BCBW is a bit better rounded, though. I guess that's a roundabout way of saying that BCBW is every ounce the beer that KH is. GI has become shockingly good at this game, and I hope they continue to play in this sandbox. BCBW isn't just one of the best releases of 2013, it's one of the best English BW's ever made. If you missed out on this in 2013, make sure you don't sleep on it this fall. Standing ovation. 2,206 characterssiege06nd, May 25, 2014

I'm a sucker for multi-use barrels for Barleywine, and this works on every level. The stout comes through nicely at every step of the tasting process. It truly elevates a very good barleywine base into a legendary beer.
Better than BCBS, IMO. 296 charactersrobear, May 24, 2014

Smells of bourbon, molasses, dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, red wine, bread, strong sweetness and booze; it’s very sweet with a mix of rum, bourbon and alcohol soaked fruit, similar to old almost rotting fruit or some really moist bread pudding soaked in rum and syrup. The booze is quite noticeable in a good way, and this is very complex and interesting to inhale. 
Tastes follows the nose and is very sweet overall, and yet very rich and flavorful. Like the aroma, it’s a mix of bourbon, molasses, dark fruits, caramel, brown sugar, chocolate, vanilla, red wine like an oaky Merlot, toasted bread or wet grains, dark rum, herbs, alcohol soaked fruit, syrup, and more bourbon or booze. The sweetness is almost cloying, but the booze kicks it into another gear with the oaky and vanilla notes making it really, really tasty and complicated, getting different flavors as it warms up. It is similar buy yet very different to the other Bourbon County Brand brews and the most dynamic flavored barleywine that I’ve ever had with so many taste variables that it’s too much to process. The ABV brings some heat, but it’s mild and works well overall considering it’s 12%. 
Mouthfeel is very thick and chewy, literally a meal in a bottle, with a creamy slickness as it slides over the tongue with very light carbonation and a slight bitterness that almost seems hoppy or like a burnt coffee that trails off very sweet like toffee and brown sugar sprinkled in bourbon, ending on a sweet fade that warms you up as it settles in. Each sip provides a new twist on the sweet combo of fruit and booze, making it different every time. 
Overall a damn fine beer, extremely tasty with an amazing array of sweet flavors that kept me guessing after every sip, which made this fun and very enjoyable to drink. It’s almost too sweet but manages to never cross the line and keep your palate preoccupied to notice the booze, and any fan of the Bourbon County Brand of beers would love this malty treat. Glad I was able to get my hands on a bottle as I really enjoyed it.
10/1/14-Had it on tap in NYC last night and it was very tasty, complex and quite enjoyable again. Looks were much nicer on tap with a head that actually stuck around for a while, leading to strong boozy complex nose and rich, sweet flavors that were so complicated that each sip was slightly different. The heat was ever present again, making for a real nice slow sipper.
05/18/17-Came across another bottle from 2013 (24SEP13 1717 listed) and the head and looks were even better...this beer gets better looking with age, which is moving the "Look" score up for me from 4 to 4.25 since the past few times I've had it have produced better heads that lasted and left decent spotty lacing. Smells and tastes basically the same as above but with zero alcohol burn, so it was actually smoother. "Overall" rating moved up from 4.75 to 5 as this aged beautifully. Rating of 4.62 moved up to 4.69, let's hope the Evil Giant ownership keeps making this a world class barleywine as I've got some 2016's aging now. 3,310 charactersCHickman, May 23, 2014

A: Dark, deep ruby brown? No real noticeable head or lacing.

M: Smooth, medium heavy.
O: A very good, very complex beer. Hides the alcohol very well. One I would love to sit on for a year or two and see what happens. A beer I could spend an hour or two sipping on and trying to get to know. Very well done. 575 charactersdid3376, May 17, 2014

4.54/5  rDev +1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I got a bottle of Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Barleywine Ale that I got in a trade, thanks a lot Kevin. I've been wanting to try this beer ever since I first heard about it and since it never showed up at any of my local beer stores I had to trade for it, I'm expecting great things, so lets see how it goes. 2013 Vintage. Poured from a brown 12oz bottle into a snifter.
A- The label looks nice, it's got a good clean and classy look to it. It poured a nice dark brown color that took on more of a caramel color when held to the light with just a thin ring of tan head that quickly faded to pretty much nothing and it didn't leave and lacing behind. This was a nice looking beer, I like the color, but the head and lacing were pretty much non existent.
S- The aroma starts off with a higher amount of sweetness that has a lighter brown sugar like aroma and it's followed by the bourbon barrels being the first to show up and they impart some really nice, bourbon, oaky, and vanilla like aromas that remind me of an expensive bottle of Bourbon. Up next comes the malts which impart a some great caramel, light toffee, slight roast, very light cocoa, sweet malts and caramel malt like aromas with some nice dark fruit aroma showing up in the background with raisins and figs seeming to stick out the most. Towards the end comes a little more sweetness along with a light pipe tobacco like aroma and there's a noticeable alcohol aroma, but it isn't too strong. I thought this beer had a very good aroma, it was on the sweet side but i really liked how the different aspects worked so well with each other.
T- The taste seems to be really similar to the aroma and it starts off with a higher amount of sweetness that still has a brown sugar like aspect to it and it's followed by the bourbon barrel still being the first to show up and it imparts all those great aspects that it did in the aroma and they are at just the right level. Up next comes the malts that impart the exact same malt aspect that I got in the aroma and this time it seems like the caramel flavors stick out just a little more and I like that. Up next comes the dark fruits with some nice raisin and fig flavors coming through along with a really light pipe tobacco flavor. Towards the end comes some noticeable alcohol that's not too boozy and it's a little warming. On the finish there's a little more brown sugar sweetness with pretty much no bitterness and it has a caramel, bourbon barrel and dark fruit like aftertaste. This was a great tasting beer, it's everything I would want in a bourbon barrel aged Barleywine.
M- Fairly smooth, rich, a little sticky, almost slightly cloying, on the slightly lighter side of being full bodied with a slightly lower amount of medium carbonation. The mouthfeel was really great and it worked really well with this beer.
Overall I thought this was a great beer and I thought it was a great example of the style, it had everything that I look for in the style plus a little more and it didn't leave me disappointed in the slightest. This beer had good drinkability, it was fairly smooth, rich, a little sticky, almost slightly cloying, a little filling and the taste did a great job at holding my attention, I could drink a bottle by myself with no problem and it tastes so good that I would be pretty tempted to drink a couple of these in a row and If I had a lot I might do that. I think it makes for a great fall and winter time beer, it feels like it would keep me warm in the cold weather. What I like the most about this beer was how good the taste and aroma were and the great mouthfeel helped take this beer to a whole new level. What I like the least about this beer was appearance, it wasn't bad and I liked the color, but the head, lacing and retention were disappointing. I would for sure buy this beer again if I ever saw it and I hope it shows up at some of my local beer stores next year. I would recommend this beer to just about anyone, it's just one of those beers that you just have to try. All in all I was very happy with this beer and I was also a little impressed, I was already expecting this beer to be great and it ended up exceeding my expectations. I am really happy I decided to seek this beer out, this Bourbon County series has all been great. This is now my favorite Bourbon Barrel Barleywine, it's that damn good and it's up there as one of the better goose Island beers I've had, I still think I liked the regular and the coffee version slightly more, but that doesn't take away how great of beer this is and as it stands it's pretty much my ideal Bourbon Barrel Barleywine. Goose Island is really bringing the heat when it comes to these limited releases. Awesome job guys, this was one great beer, keep up the great work.
Edit I got to try a few samples of the 2014 batch, it's very nice, but I still prefer 13. 4,870 charactersStoutHunter, May 15, 2014

Dessert: slow sipping, ain't for the faint of heart; third the way thru on empty stomach and it's a tidal wave of numbness; more of a liquer that should be half the amount (schooner glass).

Feel is extremely heavy, almost syrupy, with a very mild carbonation, mostly hidden in the background. Finish is almost sweet with a lingering very light bitterness and a mild burn.
Overall very deep and complex. A wonderful sipper that leaves behind a lingering warmth. 583 charactersJohnQVD, May 13, 2014

Bottle to BCS snifter
12oz
Thats to Lefty1216 & Mikereaser for this one
Thanks to KevanB for the glass
App- So very similar to KH. However, this is a smaller BW. How does one get his dark? I mean its not orange, yellow or gold. Its dark like a stout. A dark center with a small 1 finger head and no cling. A bit of a pond layer around the edges. No cling though.
Smell- Is it possible to have a smaller BCS? Bourbon and vanillla for days and then you add the malts and old fruit from a BW and BAM!!! Its Emeril for days!! This has a great nose and keeps going as it warms.
Taste- Okay so KH was in a class all its own. That beer was large and in charge like Scott Baio in the 90's. This was smooth, clean and clear that it wanted to be the little brother who stood alone. A good BW with a rich base with vanilla, fruit and bourbon for days. 
Mouth- Simple. A medium body with a semi medium carbonation. Bourbon and vanilla remain with a small amount of BCS on the finish.
Drink- Its a step below KH but you know on a random day, Id still crush a 4pk. I need more of this in in life. Thank you GI for making this!!! 1,140 charactersFosterJM, May 11, 2014

A finger of brown head develops on top of a dark brown body on a down the middle pour. Head falls fast. No lacing but plenty of leggy action. 
Vanilla and a little coconut from the barrel, sweet barleywine character with toffee and caramel, and cherry. This comes through with all the goodness I'm looking for in a barrel aged barleywine.
Lots of vanilla and big toffee and caramel malt. Coconut, cherry, raisin, alcohol heat, and I think the residual stout comes out a bit with some chocolate.
Fairly big bodied and a little sticky sweet. Soft carbonation makes this a smooth drink. 
Amazing barleywine here. 643 charactersMattSweatshirt, May 07, 2014

A- Poured to a tulip glass from the 12oz bottle with a dark brown body that appears pretty much black in the glass. Small light mocha tan head to about half a finger with a silky texture. Small ring leaves legs and only a few spots of lace stick behind.
S- Nose brings a mix of Bourbon whiskey barrels and a sweet, caramel Barleywine base. Hints of roast, toasted malts and oak wood. Vanilla sweetness from the barrel is high but there is also a slight soy sauce hint in the backdrop. Noticeable lack of alcohol (none at all) but also not the strongest aroma overall.
T- As the nose suggested, very smoothed out and it must have spend a considerable amount of time resting in the barrels. Major notes are caramel, raisin dark fruits, diluted whiskey (not in a bad way), vanilla sweetness and oak. Hints of coca-cola, soy sauce, oxidation, pepper, apple and something like banana (vanilla is a similar ester).
MF- Thick and oily/syrupy body. Texture is slick but somewhat creamy. Carbonation is perhaps a tiny bit high for me but not enough to disturb the flavor. Finishes with a moderate warmth.
Tons of credit to this beer for its super smooth flavor and lack of alcohol for 12%. One thing that I find a bit off-putting is the coca-cola/soy sauce hints that come and go. Great fresh whiskey and oak vanilla sweetness atop thick caramel and raisin. 1,560 characterscbutova, May 06, 2014

4.59/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours dark brown with a one finger tan head, which fades quickly to a small ring of foam, and leaves spotty lacing. The aroma has dark fruit, bourbon, brown sugar, and toffee. 
Tastes superb with dark fruit, bourbon, toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, coconut, and caramel. There is not bitterness to counter the sweetness of this beer, but who needs it. This is a fantastic version of an English Barleywine. The abv is 12.10 %, and you cannot taste booze. Yes the flavors of bourbon are there, but hot alcohol is not one of those flavors. Very nicely done.
Medium to full bodied with low carbonation, and a dark fruit with bourbon aftertaste. Just a phenomenal beer. 664 charactershardy008, May 05, 2014

Eng BW's used to be my favorite style. I can't drink many of them, anymore. This one drinks a lot like Pelican Pub's Mother of All Storms, for which I Paid $25 / 750 ml, last month. Meant to serve it as a dessert sipper, but none of us at the table could finish our 4-oz. pour. 354 charactersmartyl1000, May 04, 2014

Pours deep brown, slightly reddish-brown at the edges. Just a thin layer of yellowish-tan head, gone pretty quick, not much lacing. Not terrible, but exactly stunning.
Smell is bright, full of fruit and whiskey and sweetness. It's a bit two-toned, not as integrated as I'd like, with the barrel and the barleywine striking slightly different notes. Plums, figs, tobacco. Pretty darn nice, but lacking the pop of the best -bal barleywines.
Taste is, again, good but could be better. It's harsh, which is expected for such a high-ABV beer, but it's harsh in ways that it doesn't need to be. More barrel, more bourbon bite, than I'd like. Deeply fruity. The pieces don't quite fit together, and the sharpness knocks it down a few notches for me.
Feel is decent. The occasional sip feels flat, but the majority are carbonated enough. Medium-bodied, kinda heavy and chewy.
I feel like I'm trashing this beer by not giving it lights-out ratings. But it's not a lights-out beer. Not like Sucaba, or Arctic Devil, or King Henry, or MoAS. Biggest flaw is the imperfect integration of the base and the barrel. It's good, not great. 1,145 characterszeledonia, May 02, 2014

A - Very typical coca cola coloring, but a nicely frothy light tan head that lingers an reduces to a solid ring around the edges. Okay lacing and predominant legs.
S - Sugar cookie, dark cocoa, oak shavings, slight alcohol, prunes, slight char.
T - Slow arrival. Dates, luscious caramel, hint of vanilla meld in mid-palate. Further prune, oak barrel, and softer bitter notes in the finish. Very little residual alcohol.
M - Medium-heavy body, great carbonation level, reasonably long, dry finish.
D - It's not up to snuff with the other 2013 variants, but it's worthy of your time. The palate isn't hitting quite as heavily as I'd anticipated. I'd be lying if I said I didn't find this a bit boring compared to a staple like Sucaba. 813 charactersAuracom, Apr 28, 2014

4.17/5  rDev -7.1%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Bottle thanks to Tommy. Pours a dark muddy brown with low head, not particularly impressive. Very different from your standard barleywine. There is some old caramel-toffee (aroma) and candy (taste) that is commonly associated to barleywines but it ends there. The barrel presence is very strong with bourbon and vanilla, then mollasses and anise from the regular BCS. The final result reminds me of american strong ales or old ales with tobacco, figs and graham cracker. Obviously very sweet along but also bitter. Rich and low carbonation. A decadent american strong ale. 4.1-4.2 580 charactersLuk13, Apr 27, 2014

A: Pours a red-tinged near black with one finger of tan head.
S: Booze of course, caramel, molasses, a nuttiness, and alcohol.
T: Bourbon (as can be expected), incredibly boozy. Caramel, dark fruit, vanilla, and a peppery spiciness. 
M: Med-heavy body. Creamy and smooth, carbonation barely comes through. The alcohol provides a burn that travels up into the sinuses. 
O: Definitely not for the faint of heart. A perfect choice for when you're craving that big, boozy brew. Overall, quite good - other than the over-the-top booziness. 580 charactersd5001986, Apr 25, 2014

Liquid portion comes out a deep mahogany reddish/brown color. Slightly lighter highlights on the edges. Tan colored head pretty much all small bubbles, but it goes away pretty quickly, not much in the way of lacing. 
Smell is sweet, but really good. Caramel, vanilla, some butterscotch, molasses, and obviously some bourbon and wood. Meshes nicely together.
Not that I dislike the smell (cause it's awesome), but the taste is a step up. Can really taste a blend of the bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Back flavors of molasses, some dark dehydrated fruit, and some sticky caramel. Really good, everything meshes together really well.
Really good mouthfeel, probably the best part. Certainly full bodied with a strong lingering flavor that lasts. The alcohol has a nice warming effect but it's not too boozy and has a nice carbonation level. Silky smooth with a nice warming and slightly bitter finish. Nice drinkability and a slow sipper. Great beer, thanks BBG for sharing. You're the man and you'll always be the BBG on some level to me. 1,091 charactersAndyAvalanche, Apr 18, 2014

A-a dark chestnut with a thin layer of khaki head that quickly disappears to leave a bit of lace around the top
S-bourbon, vanilla, caramel malt, brown sugar, and sticky bourbon soaked dark fruits
T-taste is similar to the smell, a caramel/toffee malt backbone with brown sugar, vanilla, sweet fruits, and finishes with a bourbon kick. You would hardly know it is 12.1%.
M-incredibly smooth, rich full body, moderate carbonation, 
Overall this beer is dangerously drinkable with a smooth body, rich full flavors, and a nice bourbon warming to finish. 585 charactersksimons, Apr 11, 2014

A- pours a thick and viscous dark brown color with ruby hues around the edges of the glass, small foamy light tan head retains for a while, eventually reducing to a small layer floating on top, a ring of foam around the edges leaves some short lasting lace behind
S- the sweet caramel and molasses aromas literally jump out of the glass. Notes of butterscotch, dried fig, maple syrup, honey and toffee all play in to a big sweet malty aroma. Coffee and nutty chocolate fudge kick in. Oaky barrel aromas give notes of vanilla and bourbon on the finish
T- sweet and rich malty notes up front give flavors of dark fruit, caramel, black-strap molasses and coffee. A slightly savory meat-like flavor kicks in mid-palate, sweet notes similar to port wine kick in before moving into the barrel flavors of vanilla, red wine, oak and warming bourbon on the finish
M- Viscous body with low carbonation leads to a slightly foamy mouthfeel that coats the mouth, eventually finishing smooth and warming
O- I love English barleywines and this is one of the best beers that I've ever had. The complexity of the aromas and flavors can be pondered for a ling time over a 12 oz glass. Another winner from the Bourbon County series 1,253 charactersTreyliff, Apr 10, 2014

Pours opaque russet brown with barely a half finger of beige head yielded from a vigorous pour. The head fades to a hazy layer that leaves only the smallest ocassional spots of lace. 
Smells of toffee pudding, caramel, sweet bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit and brown sugar. Good stuff. 
The lucious, boozy, sweet blend of flavors follows the nose well. Toffee, bourbon, molasses, burnt caramel, vanilla, pralines, dark fruit, brown sugar, oak and a little chocolate, all with an appropriate alcohol presence drifting in and out. So many delicious layers that become even richer as it warms. 
Syrupy, fairly heavy body with mild-to-moderate carbonation. The sweetness really coates the tongue for a finish of bourbon, toffee and raisins. 
An outstanding drinking experience. The bourbon and subtle-yet-present imperial stout notes fill it with rich and flavorful layers. Certainly one of my favorite examples of a barrel aged English barleywine. 1,049 charactersThickNStout, Apr 07, 2014

3.4/5  rDev -24.3%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.25Points I have sought to prove in the past:
-English Barleywines aren't very good.
-Accordingly, it's good to barrel age them, so you taste the barrel whiskey instead of the cloyingly sweet syrupness that limeys apparently enjoy so much.
The best BAEBW's, then, would be the ones that take the barrel-agedness to the extreme. Which means that Goose Island's Bourbon County Brand Bidness should logically make an excellent BAEBW, since their barrel nodes are, to put it bluntly, intense.
Instead, nope. We get this. Big super sweet English Barleywine against aggressive vanilla nodes and a depressing lack of booziness or burn. NOTHING cuts into the sweetness. Nothing.
It's still not a *bad* example of its style. It's just that the style is bad. The beer's midwest hype and semi-rareness has inflated its score, no doubt, but seriously it's not worth whatever you're being asked to pay for it. 897 charactersmynie, Apr 04, 2014

Had this as soon as it was released, but very excited to try again. 
Look is super dark brown/reddish hints. Aroma is a spectacular barleywine mixed with bourbon and coconut and sweet candies berries, maybe cherry or blackberry. Taste is that of barleywine, coconut smoothness and bourbon. Quite an incredible combination and hopefully will be present next year as variant. 419 charactershops202, Mar 31, 2014
4.93/5  rDev +9.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The best barleywine that has ever touched my lips, the aroma off the nose screams barrel aged, with malt sweetness and the taste does not disappoint. The flavor is malt, caramel, chocolate, and vanilla sweetness, with the smooth finish that is indicative of a barrel aged beer. Mild carbonation in mouthfeel, with lingering resonance of flavor and texture.
Simply put, "I NEVER KNEW A BARLEYWINE COULD BE SO GOOD"

"Brewed and bottled by Goose Island Beer Company, Chicago, IL. Develops in the bottle for up to 5 years." I wish I had more than one bottle, but as it is, I have one, and I'm drinking it now. (Thanks to Brandon for the sample bottle.)
Strictly black. No head. Very still. Deep and mysterious.
Aroma: bourbon first, massive, thick, viscous, bourbon-y aromatics. Charcoal, vanilla, whiskey, chocolate-covered cherries….there's bound to be a barley-wine under there, too.
Taste: In the mouth, immense-ness, huge-osity, and mucho massive. I'll bring them back: thickness and viscosity. Giant. The bourbon covers everything in this, and I'm getting no flavors of the barley-wine below. Fullest of bodies here, long, long finish, stays forever in the mouth.
I do wish I'd have been able to taste the base beer in this one. Without that, I'm tasting tons of bourbon barrel effect over some kind of barley-wine that's not showing itself. What it is, though, is very tasty. It's the perfect beer for right now, my last of the night. Good way to go out. 1,171 charactersfeloniousmonk, Mar 30, 2014

Appearance - Hazy brown colour with a small size frothy beige coloured head. There is a low amount of carbonation showing and there is some fair lacing. The head lasted for around 2-3 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Malts, caramel/butterscotch, dark fruits, chocolate, bourbon
Taste & Mouth - There is a below average amount of carbonation and I can taste malts, caramel, chocolate, and dark fruits. There is also some vanilla, bourbon, and a woodiness.
Overall - If I had to fault this beer, it would be that it is a touch sweet. But it is not an every day beer, and it is a definite treat. This might be one one of the best tasting beers I've had. 701 charactersspinrsx, Mar 27, 2014

A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/4 inch dark tan head that retains a bit before soon becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and random specs of surface foam. Non-resilient lacing leaves a thick ring behind.
S- Very sweet smelling with tons of raisin, sherry and vanilla notes. A bit overbearing and boozy.
T- Flavor's definitely more balanced with the sweetness coming through but slowly transforming toward a roasty finish with the bourbon making its contribution the whole way through. Notes of more raisin, dark fruit, caramel, brown sugar, vanilla and figs. Alcohol is certainly well concealed making for a neat sort of controlled chaos, however there is a slightly boozy aftertaste.
M- Soft, silky and smooth with medium-low carbonation and a full body.
O- While the aroma is way too heavy on the raisin (maybe some more age would mellow that out?), the rest of the beer checks out just fine. A complex, aggressive yet very drinkable barleywine that belongs in the top rankings. 1,091 charactersImmortale25, Mar 26, 2014

4.77/5  rDev +6.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The Bourbon County line has become fashionable again. Heck, even the standard Bourbon County Stout has become popular among beer geeks and hoarders alike. So, what does one do when a barleywine is aged in barrels previously used for the stout? You sample it. I was lucky to spot a tap at Out of the Park Pizza, even if a 6 ounce pour would cost $12. Sometimes you just have to make the opportunity. On to the beer:
It's dark ruby brown and not topped with much of a head. Instead, it yields a few glossy legs around the glass (now we're being haute classe!). But that's nothing compared to the rest of this story. The aroma is very sweet, and in many ways resemble the classic Bourbon County Stout. There's no shortage of sweet bourbon, molasses, raisins, and toasted sugar, suck it all in.
Greatness is further achieved through a taste that few beers can match. Full flavored, but still balanced and sophisticated. The taste of raisins, brown sugar, bourbon, vanilla, sherry/oxidation make their mark and make the beer intriguing to keep you coming back to your glass for more. Although it's full bodied, the texture is very smooth, and to a great surprise the alcohol is hidden as well as any beer with a content this high (that's high praise right there!).
At the end of my glass, I felt like a relived my first moment with Bourbon County Stout. A thick, succulent big beer that I fear cannot get much better than it stands. At this stage, only Old Ruffian and J.W. Lee's Harvest Ale can compete with this monster of a barleywine. As a bonus, this becomes my favorite new beer of 2014. Amazing! 1,600 charactersDoubleJ, Mar 25, 2014

S - Jesus H. Bourbon, chocolate, figs, fudge, vanilla. Lots going on here. I can see why BW purists would be put off by this, but it really does smell awesome.
T - Again the bourbon is right up front, but there's too much going on for it to stick around too long. Everything flows through: Dates, figs, a touch of rum-soaked raisin, oak, coconut. A bit of alcohol warmth on the end to make sure you know it's there. As soon as you think you're done you get more chocolate and vanilla. Outstanding.
M - Thick, but velvety smooth. Coating. Sticky. The way a good barleywine should be.
O - again, I can see why BW lovers wouldn't like this as much as they should. I get it. At the end of the day though take it for what it is: A shining example of a BA barleywine that maybe found too much influence from the beer that was previously housed in the same barrels. 946 charactersBrick_Frog, Mar 23, 2014

4.59/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks for the bottle, angrybabboon! Poured out of a 12oz bottle into a tulip glass. Bottling date is listed at the back as "24/09/13." (Also, a European bottling date? Huh? Why?)
Pours nearly exactly like BCBS, with a few key differences - it's pretty much opaque and blackened at first, but when you hold it against some light it not only shows itself to be slightly translucent, but also contain some brief maroon/reddish streaks that confirms that this is indeed a barleywine. Due to the lower ABV of this beer, the head is a little larger at first (about 2 fingers high) with a tanned, off-kahki appearance before dissipating to a ring. Some bubbles show at the top, but no carbonation throughout. Extremely viscous, as you'd expect, and each swirl leaves behind a stained film at the sides of the glass. Pretty intense stuff!
Holy crap! I've always known all of these offerings to be rich and decadent in the past, but this probably takes the cake. I've never had King Henry, but I suppose this may be what's it smells like at this point (which is why I'm not really bothering to track it down). However, let's get to the beer at hand, which is extraordinary in its own regard. Huge dark fruits hit you at first, showing plums, figs, and raisins, with cherry pits and blackcurrant as well. Then, the bourbon starts to work its magic, melded with residue of the BCBS base - sweet toasted toffee, caramel, cinnamon, vanilla, molasses, and notes of roasted chocolate, fudge, anise, light leather, and cherry toasted tobacco. This is sweet at first, but the finish is an herbal, dried malty goodness that lasts for a while, and is quite a delight to dig your nose right into this. It's impressive how well the alcohol is hidden on this, but it's definitely no surprise given the high amount of residual sugars. This may be the most opulent effort yet from GI in their latest barrel program release.
While the aroma takes me to a bourbon malty fruit paradise, this doesn't taste as bright and refined - but, man, does it taste good. Absolutely world class in every respect of the term. The fruit character is still driven up front, displaying a good deal of raisins, plum, figs, and cherry pits (maybe even dried currants), with the roasted malt and bourbon flavors following in immensely well. At the middle of the palate, the chocolate and nutty flavors of BCBS explode, and are coated with a brief leather and tobacco. The finish is undeniably more bourbon forward, with strong notes of burnt toffee, caramel, vanilla, and cinnamon. Finishes very buttery and vanilla forward, and to be honest, this perhaps my favorite part of drinking this - cocoa butter notes in beer are extremely delightful and decadent, and this melds terrifically well with the fruit and roasted notes to the beer's advantage. Overall, this feels way better carbonated and balanced in body than BCBS, and therefore, far easier to revisit whenever I feel in the mood.
It's too bad that I don't have more of these - I'd love to see how this would develop over time and witness how the barrel character would probably shine through. The fruits are just at the right sweet spot at this point, although I'd imagine as they fade and taste drier that they will compliment the earthier barrel flavors even better as it ages. Nevertheless, in terms of something that I could have more often (of the recent GI releases), this is by far my favorite. Whether it will evolve over time as well as regular BCBS is up to others to decide, but it melds together what I love so much about English barleywines and bourbon aged beers and melds it intriguingly balanced and wonderful results. Don't pass this by just because it isn't regular BCBS - this is a genuinely beautiful beer. 3,744 charactersmagictacosinus, Mar 16, 2014

smells are pruney molasses with brown sugar. some oak/vanilla from the barrel, but too much malty brown sugar.
Damn, this is malty, sweet, and pruney. the other things I like are in the back. things like tobacco, leather, oak, coconut. But they're not driving the car. They're in the trunk. 
Too gooey on the mouthfeel. But that's how bourbon county rolls. When tobacco and leather and barrel juice cut the gooey-ness, it works. It doesn't work here. It's like the yeast gave up 1/2 way through fermentation, and the 3rd use barrels didn't have enough bite left to cut the residual sugars. 
I have one more bottle. I'll open it in 2017 and use it on my pancakes. 731 characterscaskstrength, Mar 10, 2014

Muddy brown in appearance. It smells boozy and raisiny, with hints of dusty chocolate and spice. 
It tastes amazing. Rich and deep, with fruits, molasses, and barely a trace of the anticipated alcohol. A light tartness keeps it from being too sweet or sticky. 
The mouthfeel is a bit thin, but I think that's better than being too thick or cloying.
Unfortunately, the chosen name inevitably conjures up the inimitable BCBS. This is good, but not enough so to share a name. 540 charactersAgentMunky, Mar 10, 2014

Poured into a Founders snifter
A - This pours a deep, dark brownish-red, very murky when held to the light, displays a khaki head, with little retention. slippery lacing that slides down the glass when swirled, light carbonation is seen around the edges.
S - Dark fruits, brown sugar, carmel, toffee...reminds me of my grandmothers butterscotch pie, vanilla from the barrels, molasses. Beautiful nose! I could smell this all night. 
T - Tastebud overload! Let me see if I can name most of what I'm getting from this massive barleywine. Everything mentioned above is present. The first flavors, for me, that hit the tongue is the bourbon barrel and brown sugar. I'm just going to list everything because there is so much going on: carmel, chocolate, faint alcohol, figs, candy sugar, molasses, toffee, coffee and vanilla. I'm sure there is a bunch I'm missing. 
M - Milk-like creaminess, medium-weight, frothy, medium-bodied, and a light carbonation feel. It supplies a long finish that leaves you tasting it for 45+ secs. 
O - I haven't been in the craft beer game very long (1.5 years) and I haven't had the chance to drink a lot of BW's, but this and Sucaba set the standard for all others. I find it hard to believe that there will be better BW's made in the future that will rival them. If anything comes a long, it will probably only equal it as you can't beat it. 1,398 charactersCubatobaco, Mar 09, 2014

Poured from the tap into a Goose Island sipping glass.
The color is a dark black with no highlights. There is a finger of foamy brownish head with no lacing left on the glass.
The smell is strong oak aroma with hints of vanilla. There is a smoky aroma that is from the char in the barrel. The aroma just fills the nose with character is a lingering, holding that oak barrel smell for a while. 
The taste is vanilla with a dark cherry and oak flavor. There is a deep boozy flavor that is very reminiscent of whiskey but has a nice malty finish. Hops are there but they give to the strong barrel flavor. There is a presence of dark fruit, blackberries and boysenberries are just hidden around the edges at this beer’s flavors continue after finishing eat sip. 
The feel of this beer is big as expected and feels like it needs to be handled with two hands. This beer is meant to sipped and not rushed through. There is some nice smooth feel to this beer but still heavy and is best enjoyed being sipped and savored. Character is the best name for this beer. It will stay with you for some time and you'll be enjoying it even after the beer is gone. 1,222 charactersDuhast500, Mar 08, 2014

Smells of sweet malt, dark fruits, vanilla and bourbon boozy.
Taste is dark caramel, toffee, dark fruits, vanilla from the bourbon barrels.  There's a slight alcohol burn, but not overbearing.
Very heavy mouthfeel that is made tolerable by the slight carbonation. 
Overall, great barleywine, with a lot of Flavors going on.  Have a couple more to age, be interesting to see where they go. 455 charactersBradC, Mar 06, 2014

Appearance: Deep brown with some lighter brown hues around the edges - pours with a medium-sized beige head that quickly fades to nothing - keeps a little collar, though, and leaves some specs of lacing - the lack of carbonation is quite acceptable though, given the style 
Smell: Rich, decadent malts and a variety of sweet aromas - big, chewy caramel malts and malt extract - a range of candy-like, sweet aromas including caramel syrup, brown sugar, molasses, toffee, and even some honey - definitely sweet and definitely smells young for a barleywine, although there is some light oxidation in the back - chocolate, dark fruits, and alcohol - bourbon is moderately strong, not overwhelming - vanilla and wood
Taste: Big, chewy malts, bourbon, and sugar, in some kind of balance - decadent caramel malts, malt extract syrup, lightly toasted grain - lots of sweet flavors, already mentioned above, particularly caramel syrup, molasses, honey, and milk chocolate - nice bourbon undertone with some vanilla and wood - some dark fruits, like figs, plums - some noticeable alcohol - some oxidation, but definitely tastes young, as some of the flavors haven't quite yet melded
Mouthfeel: Full body with some light carbonation that prevents it from becoming syrupy, very smooth, touch of alcohol heat in the finish
Overall: In a couple years this prince may become a king
This is the second time I've sampled this beer, and I can now confirm that the rest of these bottles are going deep in my cellar, for at least two years. It tastes too sweet, too young for a barleywine. But it tastes like potential. While I doubt it will somehow evolve into something akin to King Henry II, I think my scores will go up when I update this review in approximately 2018. 1,774 charactersangrybabboon, Mar 04, 2014

Appearance - Very dark red with a beige head. A thin+swirly cap and thick ring is left for most of the duration.
Smell - Decadent stuff. Caramel/chocolate/bourbon/dark fruit/butterscotch goodness without much booziness. Some earthy and spicy tones. Definitely some Bourbon County Stout flavors in there, great mixture of flavors between those and the barleywine.
Taste - Very sweet and bourbon forward. Lots of candy caramel, vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit. Light oak, some spiciness (perhaps from the bourbon), and some earthy hoppiness buried in there. The taste is missing most of the stout-ness from the scent but there is hints of some roasty chocolate.
Mouthfeel - I have in my notes: "like the Motley Crue song - 'sticky sweet'". Syrupy, lowish but ample carbonation, somewhat boozy as it should be.
Overall - Kinda undeniably tasty, the barrels previously containing Bourbon County Stout definitely made a difference/make this unique. Sweetness+booze is a little tolling, 6 oz. was a good serving size. 1,106 charactersChico1985, Mar 02, 2014

Dark deep ruby with a minimal head as expected.
Smells oh so sweet. Rich malts on the nose with some syrupy qualities. Very slight booze smell.
Wow. Such a sweet beer. Maple syrup s what I'm getting most here. Super sweet malts. Really no alcohol taste somehow. Just a fantastic barleywine, best I've ever had by far.
Mouth is surprisingly smooth. Little to no carbonation. Leaves a super slick and syrupy aftertaste that is so nice.
Such a great brew. Masks the abv so well, absolutely delicious. Definitely the best barleywine I've ever had. 624 charactersPeterParker, Mar 02, 2014

S-Malt, caramel, toffee, chocolate, brown sugar, some bourbon and oak but not that much.
T-Starts with a lot of malt, caramel, roasted malt and chocolate. slight vanilla. Bourbon is mild along with the oak.

The aroma on this beer is absolutely outstanding. Rich vanilla and coffee sweetness. Like milk chocolate covered coffee beans soaked in whiskey and formed into candy. Oak and bourdon notes permeate the aroma. Booze as well.
Incredibly sweet. Big vanilla flavors, rich robust oak, bourbon, light chocolate, warming booze.

A: A dark mocha colored head is bready in texture, slight in size sitting above a cola-coffee colored pour that showed burgundy highlights around the edges. Holding time (head retention) was rather generous per style and for such a beast of this abv% (12) magnitude showing a bit of surface disturbance from the carbonation within on the polished surface upon head dissipation. A dark and rich visualization dessert treat. 
S: Strong indications of whiskey (4 Roses) laced chocolate and wet, fresh vanilla bean coffee. A beautiful, gentle wet minerality bitterness with some scotchy oak barrel notes and vanilla on the go. 
T: Flavor was simply awe-inspiring from the first sip, taking no time to warm up to and wasting no time on first impressions. Sweet, rich, deep chocolate and vanilla coffee, caramelized sweetness, with a gentle help of whisky. Sweet mocha-caramel, figs that were sweet and syrupy, whiskey coffee and some toasted oak, molasses and toffee sweetness. 
M: Mouthful was milky thick, silky textured but chewy in substance of malt and oats. There is absolutely no room for improvement here, a perfect feel and mouthful. 
O: Overall words can merely describe the beautiful ,rich . sweet chocolate burbon beast that this is. Dangerously smooth, 12%abv?, hardly any indications that this is above 7-8% at any moment. So dangerously easy to drink, at $20 a liter this is worthy its weight in gold. Sharply fined toned, extremely polished in flavor with a beautiful flow of rich, dark sweet flavors that just pleasure the tongue into a state of ecstacy. The craftmenship of the brewing here is world class, from start to finish, an awe-insprining drink that the world needs more of. 1,744 charactersbeerthulhu, Feb 27, 2014

pours a very dark brown, almost black. thin tan head that fades immediately. definitely a boozy aroma, vanilla, toffee, bourbon notes. amazing smell. taste is dominated by rich malt, burnt caramel. slightly sweet, not too sharp. lingering aftertaste. soft carbonation, nice viscous mouthfeel.

Pours a small fizzy head that disappears almost instantly, typical for this high abv, with a super dark molasses brown colored beer with the faintest hint of light barely sneaking through.
Nose explodes out of the gate, tons of great malts, reddish candy malts mostly, at first... then big chewy caramel, molasses, then into toffee, even a little nutty cocoa, big sweet candy malts without being too candy like. Then barrel, plenty of nice barrel, some vanilla oak and a hint buttery oak, but lots and lots of bourbon barrel juice. It has the typical booze warmth aroma, but nothing too crazy.
Taste, anticipation... comes on rich, layered goodness with big sweet malts and bourbon, also bourbon and big sweet malts. the malts are the biggest layer, and varied layers of it, sweet candy and plenty of the candy malts, with lots and lots of caramel as well, varying darkness on the caramel, reddish malts too, and a mild nutty toffee. Booze comes in fairly hot too, with some warming almost tingly booze, but a clean booze. Next up is the bourbon, plnety of rich bourbon barrel juice, with the nice vanilla smoothed oak bourbon. Also in there is some candied raisins, brandy soaked like candied raisin and hint fig. Finish is smooth with a big butterscotch and toffee feel, little nutty, big candy like and tons of caramel lingering, a big caramel toffee butterscotch candy flavor lingering, with a bit more vanilla barrel, candied raisins, and bourbon. 
Mouth is big bodied, rich, smooth, but somehow not syrupy, very mild warming booze for the abv, decent carb that isn't as much as I probably want and maybe the only thing keeping it from a 5.
Overall very nice, delicious with great malts, great dark fruits, nice warming booze that fits well, great bourbon and barrel, great overall beer, but not quite as orgasmic as most people make it out to be. I really think it will age quite well though and I can't wait to try it in a couple years. 2,115 charactersjlindros, Feb 24, 2014

Poured into a wine glass with a dark roasted nut brown with barely any light able to filter through. It had a nice nose of toasted malts and barrel smells of oak and vanilla with a hint of bourbon. The taste is magnificent with roasted malts forward with some hop flavors following and a nice alcohol burn towards the end. It is a sweet taste of vanilla and oak from the barrel with a nuance of bourbon flavor on the finish.
God I love this beer and the daughter had one word "Yummy". I hope that I can score some more of this in the future. Thank you Goose Island for distributing to CA.
I will look for more of this where ever I go. 694 charactersRutgersEng, Feb 23, 2014

Smells like cherry cordials, vanilla, whisky, and oak. 
Incredible depth of flavor. Tastes ranging from chocolate covered bourbon soaked cherries, to raisins, figs, dates, vanilla, coffee, molasses, caramel, and smokey oak. Alcohol is present, but well hidden for it's high abv. 
Very light carbonation. Silky smooth and slick mouthfeel.

S: Chocolate, coffee, toffee, caramel, and hints of bourbon. Wow, the smell alone is worth getting your hands on this beer.
T: First you get chocolate and molasses, then the booze hits. However, it is so well hidden that you can barely notice it the 12 % ABV. Rich, Multi layered deliciousness.
When I'm on my death bed, if I can somehow get this pumped into my IV, that would be great.
M: The best part of this beer is the mouthfeel. Smooth, creamy, spreads out and coats the palate completely.
O: This goes without saying but Goose Island Bourbon County series is a can't miss. The Barleywine is a consistent .300 hitter that should be in the hall of fame! 792 charactersBSK_ONE, Feb 22, 2014

The taste is even better with supremely integrated flavors of whiskey and sweet malt, brown sugar and some light bitterness. great depth, and a long finish. Very nice indeed! I'll also say that this seems to improve a bit after at least a couple of months in the bottle. 588 charactersGeorgiabeer, Feb 19, 2014

Pours a murky deep deep amber capped by a two finger fluffy beige head. Excellent retention, splotchy lacing here and there. Boozy aroma of vanilla, light oak, and rich toffee. Opens with dates, dried black cherries and hints of prune joined by caramel, toffee, vanilla. Finishes with oak, light wisps of bourbon, and general booziness. Slick mouthfeel with some creaminess on the edges. Lighter side of fully bodied. Moderate carbonation, more than expected for a barrel-aged brew. An excellent BA English barleywine, but frankly lacks some depth of flavor displayed by other BA English barleywines that I've rated more highly. 762 characterschanokokoro, Feb 18, 2014

4.77/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours very dark for a Barleywine. Picks up a lot of color from the previous uses in the barrel. Body is deep mahogany brown that lets almost no light through except on the edges where you get some ruby red and licorice black. Head is about an inch of toasty biscuity brown.
Nose is just gorgeous with notes of Bourbon, port, Butter Rum and rich toffee. Really just a enticing and overall perfect aroma.
With first sip, I'd be hard pressed to categorize this as a Barleywine. I'd be hard pressed to categorize this as anything as it is so unique in flavor. This beer is hugely rich and quite sweet, but in a very good way. Rich carmel and toffee enter first with over ripe dark fruit following closely behind. A slight twinge on the back of the tongue yields some plum and raisin. My mouth aches with anticipation of each next sip. Marzipan is a player here as well.
Super thick mouthfeel that just doesn't let up. Many will find this to thick or to sweet but I find it to be lovely. Truely a perfect desert beer. If you enjoy port you will love this beer. A real gem. 1,070 charactersSPLITGRIN, Feb 14, 2014

4.53/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.52013. Served at a little cooler than room temp. Pours a very dark, purplish, ruby-brown color with a small, tan head. Scent is boozy, with sweet bourbon, vanilla, and oak. A whole lot of molasses too with black cherries and other dark fruits. Smells very sweet and delicious. Taste is immediately cherry-forward...almost like chocolate covered cherries. Very sweet and boozy. Tons of bourbon heat to it, but sweet vanilla and cherry balance. A chocolatey backbone with a hint of oak molasses. Pretty complex. Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated for this style...not too much...not too little. Drinkability is fairly high, although the heat could use some time to settle. Overall, world-class English-style Barleywine. IMO, drink this beer at room-temp. I had it straight out of the fridge about 2 months ago, and I got SO MUCH more aroma and flavor this time around. 861 charactersDovaliHops, Feb 13, 2014

A: A modest half finger of tanish head built in the snifter glass before quickly falling back and leaving a ring of small bubbles on the edge of the glass. Streaking alcohol legs pop out when given a little swirl in the glass. The beer is a dark brown leather looking color with a hue when held to a backlite that almost looks purple? Sure..
S: Heavy aroma in the way of prunes, raisins, over ripened plums and sweet caramel notes. The barrel character is more subdued as compared to BCBS but noticeable as vanilla, oak and charred toffee.
T: Where to start.. Dark stone fruit, plums, nectarines, raisins similar to the nose. The middle sweet malts are caramel like and brown sugar with molasses. Balance is on the malt side and coming off very sweet. I don't detect much in the way of hop flavor but the bitterness is moderate in the beginning combining with the bourbon flavor nicely. The barrel character, again, is fairly subdued in this beer by the sweetness, a slight bit of oakey flavor is coming through but its mostly a mouth feel.
M: The nice tingling tongue sensation after a few sips that I love with all of the bourbon county (and lots of other ba beers). Low levels of carbonation and a sticky sweet syrup film is left on the tongue with the tingling. Body is moderate to big but manages to be refreshing at cooler temps. Alcohol warming is present to remind you to slow down and enjoy.
O: A great beer in its own right. The base beer is a delicious example of a barley wine (english style im guessing) but I would have liked to get more of the barrel flavor out of it. Glad I got to try it, but I wouldn't raise hell to get another. 1,673 charactersguityler83, Feb 13, 2014

S- tons of bourbon, sweet Carmel, some vanilla, dark fruit, roasty malt, some chocolate.
T- sweet dark fruit up front, caramel flavors, plenty of nice bourbon flavors, vanilla, nice malt caricature
M- nice thickness, slightly syrupy as to be expected with the abv
O - the smell on this is definitely amazing, all of the flavors you would expect but balanced all so well. You get a lot of the sweetness that comes with a fresh bourbon county stout. you get a lot of black cherry, and plum flavors. I am not a big barley wine fan but I have to say that I really really enjoyed this.

Pours deep and dark, almost syrupy, with very little foam. A very small tan head that quickly dissipates to trace on the top and along the edge. Quite lovely.
The first smell is a hit of boozy bourbon along with roasted malt and char, maybe a hint of coffee, vanilla and chocolate.
The taste is amazing. A quick shot of bourbon then a rush of sweet caramel, then coffee and dark chocolate and a hint of vanilla. There is a lingering pleasant and slight bitterness and a touch of a dry, boozy bite. I was surprised by the sweetness of this beer.
The mouthfeel is very nice. A bit creamy with a slight stickiness.
Overall, just a great beer. The taste is about as good as it gets. The best barleywine I've had the pleasure of tasting. 781 charactersSD-Alefan, Feb 09, 2014

4.7/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into an Ikea snifter.
Appearance is simply gorgeous. It's a semi-transparent amber color as it streams out of the bottle, but by the time it's in the glass it's almost pitch-black with some beautiful reddish-amber hues when the light hits it a certain way. There's a surprisingly large light-brown head that pops up considering the ABV, even if it does fade to a film with a ring around the glass in less than a minute. As you agitate the beer, the film leaves a nice coat of tiny bubbles on the side of the glass that slowly slides back down into the liquid. Cannot wait to drink this.
The smell is even better than the appearance. Of course, oaky, vanilla-y bourbon is the main note of the aroma, with its requisite alcohol burn, but it's perfectly integrated with the sweet maltiness of the base barleywine. I get some chocolate in there too - maybe from the regular Bourbon County Stout that previously lived in these barrels? The aroma is so amazingly thick I feel like I can almost chew on it.
Flavor is really great as well. Follows the nose - lots of vanilla, caramel, and cinnamon - definitely a beer that can be dessert by itself! Like the regular BCBS, this one starts tasting a lot like hazelnuts to me as it warms.
Mouthfeel is thick, but a little lighter than I expected. There's relatively little carbonation, and the alcohol burns your tongue really nicely. Eventually it starts to leave a kind of syrupy feeling in my mouth that isn't entirely pleasant.
Overall, it's an incredible BA barleywine, although I do have to admit that I prefer the regular stout. This one is much, much sweeter - mostly in a good way. Thanks to Coirm for the bottle! 1,673 charactersMasterfulIdiot, Feb 09, 2014

We'll see how this one turns out. I love barleywines, and I love BA beers. Here we go. Splitting this one with my good friend, Eddy. Cheers!
A- Holy smokes, this looks like a porter or stout. Darkest barleywine I've yet seen. Almost as dark as the standard BCBS. Not much head. Not much lacing. Dark ruby color coming through on the fringes. This thing has some legs.
S- This smells awesome. Caramel, toffee, roast, some dark cherry aroma. Not really smelling hops. Bourbon is definitely there, but not nearly as much as there is with the standard BC, which is perfectly fine with me. Alcohol is there, but not overwhelming by any means. Slight chocolate aromas starts to come through as it warms. This has a great nose.
T- This is awesome. Hop bitterness that isn't as evident on the nose is definitely there on the flavor. Bourbon barrel has great presence, along with some woodiness. Caramel and toffee are also there. The same dark cherry aromas come through in the flavor. Just like the aroma, slight "chocolatiness" comes forth as it warms. Me likey. 12.1 % is not that obvious. Well done.
M- This is wonderfully smooth. Pretty heavy mouth feel for a barley wine. Heavier end of light carbonation. Delightful warming presence. Really smooth, especially considering the ABV and the style. 
O- This is a REALLY well done. Like, I really like this beer. So glad I have three more left in the basement. Probably gonna drink one more and age the other two. I really wanna see how this beer develops. Great stuff. 1,630 charactersjbwimer, Feb 09, 2014

They were sold out of the Bourbon County Stout and said that they instead had the Barleywine; since that was my preference anyway, I had some. Even though it was $15 for a pint (yikes!), it tasted like no other barleywine I've ever had. It was velvety, smooth and boozy (in a good way) all at the same time and when I looked at my glass 15 minutes after I got it; poof, it was gone. I just couldn't stop drinking it.
If available, you must try this. 548 charactersMdez, Feb 08, 2014
4.66/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from the bottle
A - a deep, rich brown almost black. Like the color of molasses. Pours cleanly with quickly dissipating bubbles resulting in no head or lacing but significant legs.
S - subtle notes of toffee, roasted malts, and caramel followed by the big, rich smell of bourbon and oak from the barrel aging. Very little aroma of alcohol
T - strong caramel richness with subtle tastes of sweet vanilla and oak. Followed by a wonderfully mellow bourbon flavor. It's a smooth and sweet beer that is almost likes a bourbon caramel sundae. Not the most complex of tastes, but thoroughly enjoyable. Flavors didn't seem to develop or change as the beer warmed, but were well defined from the start (served straight from cellar at ~55 degrees)
M - very smooth and moderately thick. Not a full bodied or sticky as most bourbon aged beers of this ABV. Coats the mouth and has a very slight burn of the alcohol. I expect it will age very nicely and mellow out even more
O - an amazing beer. Tastes that rival most barrel aged stouts. A bit of a "one note" (but what an amazing note it is) beer when compared to some barrel aged stouts. The first barrel aged barley wine (and one of the only regular barley wines) have had so I can't compare it to others of the style. A truly great and enjoyable beer to drink that is only slightly hampered by the heat from the alcohol/barrel 1,379 charactersBartos, Feb 08, 2014
4.42/5  rDev -1.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5worthy of all the high praise, this is a social barleywine with a great bourbon complexion and so much body it drinks like syrup. the looks are the only part that didn't really turn me on, dark mahogany in color with almost no head, and even a vigorous twirl of the glass can't arouse one. thick and dense and viscous. the nose is very sweet, tons of layers of grain and sugar, but also a great deep char and vanilla aspect from the barrel, not unnecessarily complex, but dynamic to say the least. i feared a sugar bomb that would be close to undrinkable, and almost immediately wished i had shared the bottle, but after the first sip it eased up a bit, temperature helped it unfold, and by the bottom of the glass i was wishing for more. a toffee style sweetness starts off a long flavor journey that bounces from toasted marshmallow to vanilla extract to charcoal and rum raisin cake. some spice to this, classic english ale yeast, a bunch of residual sugar, and not much hops at all. the finish is long and smooth, and while the alcohol is there, it adds a layer rather than distracts. more body than i thought possible, almost gelatinous, slippery and slick, but chewy too. mild carbonation is all it needs. i like this at least as much as the stout, if not more. its a world class beer that showcases the barrel very neatly. id like to have one with some age on it just to compare. 1,386 charactersStonedTrippin, Feb 08, 2014

I get quite a bit of the stout-like character in this brew. Less boozey than I remember from the first time I had it. Full, thick body and medium carbonation. 546 charactersmverity, Feb 07, 2014

Ok.im not going to tell you what has already been written. It's a great beer. An epic beer. 
It's better than the BC I stouts . 
To me, the bourbon notes just pairs better with barley wine style brewing. 
Don't age this stuff beyond a few months if you want to taste the bourbon overtones though. It really loses that taste after a year or two and starts to taste like a port. 
 Aging is for anal-ysts anyway. 561 charactersrankandfile, Feb 04, 2014

The nose captures prunes, raisins and dates with shades of caramel and toffee. Light maple mixes with chocolatey malts to finish a strong and inviting scent. 
The flavor captures more of the wine and distilled qualities. Much like a sherry or a port this holds an alcohol sweetness with a dried fruit tone. Prune, raisin, date and even fig flavors were noted. Huge bourbon tones settle in near the front but hold through mid palate. I tasted chocolate, toffee and maple to finish this out.
The feel is so velvety smooth and full that it is truly with noting. This had some warmth but no harshness and drank very easily.

4.9/5  rDev +9.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 512oz bottle into a red wine glass.
Appearance: Free pour yields a slight tan head that disappears almost immediately. Pours stout black. No lacing.
Smell: Ridiculous. Like the best vintages of Bourbon County Stout only a little bit sweeter and more complex. Bolstered by just enough boozy heat to set off all the maple-y, carmal-y, full-on-coconut and vanilla oaky, raisiny, bourbony, etc-y (this grocery list doesn't have an end) aromas. 
Have you ever smelled a barrel aged stout or barleywine with a truly world class nose? Where the aromas go on forever, they keep changing yet somehow you can tell it's the same beer, and each distinct note is as intoxicatingly decadent and pleasing and inviting as the last? That's this beer, only this one might be just a bit better.
Taste: Is it the boundless perfection promised by the nose? Not quite, but who cares: it's amazing. Tasting it immediately puts me in mind of 3 distinct things:
1) The molasses/almost-soy-sauce flavor that sticks out so strongly in the Bruery's Cuir, Alesmith's Speedway Stout, and Cigar City's Marshall Zhukov. What is this doing in a barleywine?? Making it taste even better is apparently the answer.
2) The caramel / mystery-richness that only Goose Island seems to know how to get from barrel aging. Many get the vanilla from American oak, some get well-integrated bourbon or even that (rarer) potent coconut without getting all the astringent "I'm drinking sawdust" from over-oaking, but Goose Island alone seems to be able to nail all that and add on a few "Where the fuck does THAT come from?" dimensions. 
3) The airy, raisiny oxidized flavor of aged J.W. Lees Harvest Ale, along with a few other of the red-wine-y, leathery/sweet flavors of J.W. Lees. 
Put it all together, and you've got *potent* usually-stout flavors, Goose Island Barrel Aging, and a souped up J.W. Lees Harvest Ale as the base beer. My reviews of Cuir, Speedway, MZ, BCBS, and J.W. Lees suggest that I would love the flavor of this beer. As it turns out, I do.
Really, this beer is just spectacular, top notch. I didn't want to throw out a 5, and it does smell a little bit better than it tastes... but "smells better than it tastes," with stuff like this is like saying the infinity of real numbers is larger than the infinity of natural numbers. Sure, that's true, but both infinities are incomprehensibly large.
Mouthfeel: Low/moderate carbonation. Full side of medium bodied. Touch of dryness at the end.
Overall: I've raved enough. This is a masterpiece beer, as well thought out as it is executed. If you like English barleywines or barrel aged beer, get your hands on some of this. The stout-ish twist is great, but it's only a 1 element in a beer with uncountably many virtues. 2,751 charactersPahn, Feb 02, 2014

4.3/5  rDev -4.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Deep brown, sort of a caramel colour, with a thin cap that settled quickly to a modest collar and wisps of fine bubbles on the surface of the beer. Sweet, malty aroma, notes of caramel and toffee, balanced by barrel character - woody and slightly boozy, not quite cheesy. Pretty nice overall. Sweetness, wood, and booze fight it out in the flavour too, but now there's a solid bitterness that plays counterpoint throughout. Sugary sweetness, bitterness mid-palate, alcohol warmth, woody astringency, toffee. Low carbonation, full (fairly heavy) body. There's a lot of character here from the barrel aging -- booze and tannins mostly -- balanced nicely by a solid barleywine. Definitely worth trying - more than once. 716 charactersDrJay, Feb 02, 2014

Smell: Caramel and Bourbon, with tones of sugar cake, dates, oak, coconut and vanilla
Taste: The closest thing to a Bourbon sundae I have come across, with Bourbon-infused caramel sauce topping vanilla ice cream; hints of oak, coconut, milk chocolate and dates; the finish is treacly, with some boozy ethanol
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with moderate carbonation; some warmth in the gullet
Overall: This is a very nice beer though a bit too sweet when first bottled; let it settle for a year or so and it will mature nicely 669 charactersbrentk56, Feb 01, 2014

I had this again on New Year's eve 2016-12-31 from the batch bottled on 2016-10-19 #1639.  The ratings didn't change from my initial review and the comments were minorly tweaked to reflect my most recent tasting.
The ratings from my original review from 2014-01-31 ratings were 3.5, 4.25, 4.5, 4.5, 4.25.  The following comments (and ratings) have been adjusted based on my most recent tasting.
A - Murky dark brown with almost no head or lacing. Plenty of alcohol legs.
S - Nice initial bourbon aroma then prunes, sweet coconut, milk chocolate, bready crumb cake topping. Very appealing. 
T - Bourbon-soaked prunes and raisins, fresh baked-then-toasted raisin bread, glazed with brown sugar. Quite sweet. Spicy with cinnamon, clove, pepper, a hint of anise and dark chocolate bitterness to round things out. All of these flavors continue nicely into the long-lasting aftertaste. 
M - Luxuriously thick body and light carbonation. Syrupy, substantial. Coats the mouth. 
O - Big smell, flavors and feel. Definitely a treat for the senses although I could do with a bit less residual sweetness.  It's not my favorite Barleywine; but it is close. 1,254 charactersTucquan, Jan 31, 2014

A: Pours thick and almost syrupy. Crystallization is evident on the mouth of the bottle upon removing cap. Incredibly black in color, very little to no head as would be expected... What does appear is mostly bubbles and a thin coating of beige which disappears within a minute or so.
S: Bourbon! Bourbon is the immediate smell, followed by a dense port wine scent behind. Tiny hint of chocolate behind.
T: Oh. My. God. Excuse me while I jump on the Bourbon County train.... This beer is phenomenal. Although the taste of bourbon is heavy and apparent throughout, chocolate, tannin, and even slight coffee and nutty hints all swirl together in the finish. Although its delicious immediately, the flavors blend even better after warming at room temp for a few minutes. 
M: This beer is thick and almost syrupy. Leaves the lips almost sticky after drinking; wow. Warming on the way down as I would expect. 
O: One more time... Wow. This beer is phenomenal. Although I want to drink the remaining three bottles, I plan to age them for a few months first as I expect it to become even better over time. *Highly* recommended! 1,231 charactersbluedaisyboo, Jan 29, 2014

A- Dark, deep reddish brown; viscous; ring of tiny bubbles; inviting
S- Raisins and sweet malt; almost port-like; wonderful
T- Sweet vanilla, raisiny vinous tones, sherry and a touch of apple cider. Then ethanol. The finish ends with a dry tannic barrel note and a long bourbon finish. Very sweet. 
M- Similar to other Bourbon County Brand beers, the mouthfeel is amazing. Viscous but not thick and perfectly carbed for a dark beer - effervescent.
O- I was afraid I would find it too sweet. It is very sweet - dessert like - Complex, well made and very enjoyable.
Update 7/5/14 - with 9 months of age the balance is even sweeter than I remember. Reducing the taste score to account for cloying sweetness as well as some soy sauce oxidation notes.
Update 4/28/15 based on 2015 release. Increasing score on this excellent beer big on complex sherry flavors. 889 charactersbrianmandell, Jan 29, 2014

Looks like maple syrup out of the bottle. Thick and gloopy. Rich, warm, and deep red-brown tones with a look of mahogany. Hard to drum up more than a sappy little ring. Swirling gathers up some beautiful sepia head.
Huge aroma. Rich milk caramel, marshmallow, mellowed bourbon, gooey maple, gooey toffee, vanilla, and a kiss of toasted coconut. Perhaps, a smidge of creamy Belgian chocolate. This is immense. Sweet and sappy and hunky. Outstanding.
Exactly what a barleywine should taste like. Massive bourbon vanilla and buttery caramel. Maple, mallow, toffee, chocolate, and thick-walled oak. Brandy heat sustains, but wheeled out over the whole palate. Manageable booze, in other words. This is sick.
Full-bodied, almost syrupy. Borders on cloying sweetness. Just holds back a little bit. Perfect heat, in my opinion. To the masses? At least it's amazing. Carbonation offers good middle and a great spicy tickle in the finish.
Having never had King Henry, I'd be hard-pressed to find a better barleywine, in general. So sick. So good. I found another great beer. Raising my glass to you, BA! 1,158 charactersthecheapies, Jan 27, 2014

Deep caramel sweet, date bread, light hints of bourbon and vanilla in there as it warms. It's a medium strength aroma, but one of the finest I can remember enjoying.
Luscious, rich combination of all the aromas, plus some nice malty fruitiness that just puts this on its own level tastewise. It is near to King Henry, with that lightest clean bitter in the finish, that super clean ending of the sip. 
Very low carb., highly viscous, extremely easy drinking, somehow (think KH), with a finish that is a c-hair short of some others in this league. Extra points+ for the lack of alc. presence in taste profile
Nitpicking, I found some traits that keeps this from being the best one I've tasted, but as near to perfection as a BW can be out of the gate. Staggeringly good 901 characterscavedave, Jan 27, 2014

Bottled on: 17 Sept 13
A: Pours a very dark brown, almost black. Less than half a fingers width of dark tan head builds then fades away quickly. Leaves no appreciable lacing but some alcohol legs. 
S: Candied sugar, caramel, toffee, lots of dark fruits. Bourbon characters are not as strong as I anticipated, but are there with oaky-vanilla and sweet bourbon aromas. A noticeable boozy alcohol component as well. Excellent. 
T: Wow. A huge sweetness, with tons of caramel/toffee up front, accompanied by notes of rich dark fruits like dates. I also get big candied sugar and subtle cocoa on the finish. Like the nose, the bourbon notes are present but they arent particularly strong. 
M/D: Full bodied, silky smooth, carbonation very low which is appropriate, ABV is noticeable but not in a bad way, drinkability is very good. 
O: Fantastic. No doubt about it. Up there with my favorite barleywines of all time (its my highest rated, but my other top ones I rated before the 0.25 increment rating scales so its not fair to compare that way). A must try for anyone who's a fan of the style. 1,121 characterszac16125, Jan 27, 2014

Served chilled in a wine glass. 
A massive thanks to jefeld for this bottle. 
Appearance: Wow, BCBBW is really dark for a barleywine - appearing a very dark brown (almost black) in the glass. A backlight however shows a beautiful deep ruby colour and bright amber edges. A rough pour yields a small yellowish-tan coloured head that lasts well for a Bourbon County beer but doesn't leave anything in the way of lacing. Swirling the beer leaves thick sticky alcohol legs clinging to the glass. 
Smell: The barrel character doesn't dominate the nose like it does in BCBS and this allows fantastic notes of caramel, sticky brown sugar, molasses and dark fruits to come through and dominate the nose. While the barrel character is light, it is not absent and offers light notes of bourbon, a little booze and a fair amount of oak. Other notes include: Raisins, treacle, a touch of leather, dates and a slight umami character. 
Taste: As the nose suggested, this is just delicious and surprisingly balanced. Notes include: A light bourbon character, a touch of vanilla, oak, a solid sweetness (but not cloying), caramel, brown sugar, molasses, raisins, a touch of cherry, treacle and a little leather. There is some booze present, but it is quite mellow and adds a certain richness to the taste. 
Mouthfeel: Initially the beer is well overcarbonated (high level) and nowhere near as smooth as it should be. Thankfully it does settle down and with a few swirls is at the right level and far more drinkable. The body is pretty much perfect - full, chewy and fantastically sticky. 
Overall: BCBBW is a really fantastic barrel-aged barleywine and really blew my expectations out of the water. I was planning on trying to score some more KH in the near future, but after this bottle I think I will just get a case of this stuff! 1,848 charactersThehuntmaster, Jan 26, 2014

s: Vinous fruits, sugary caramel, dark chocolate (this part is reminiscent of a stout), boozy vanilla, and touch of bourbon. 
t: Very sweet which is usually a turnoff for me. This one comes together well though. Tons of caramel and vanilla sweetness is tempered by a sharply boozy chocolate, some vinous dark fruits, and a long, deliciously hot, bourbon finish. I appreciate that the bourbon notes are a well incorporated part of this instead of an overwhelming single element. I suppose third use barrels are to thank for that.
m: Gently carbonated with a smooth, oily body.
o: I love this beer and I'm both happy and relieved that I got some. So this barleywine has some pronounced stout characteristics which makes me wonder to what extent this is thanks to the BCBS previously in these barrels and how much is thanks to the base barleywine's recipie. It would be inteteresting to know how "stouty" this was before the barrel. How significant could BCBS's flavor contribution be after a relatively short time in the barrel? No matter, the beer is stellar. 1,141 charactersDIM, Jan 26, 2014

4.14/5  rDev -7.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours a turbid dark brown, zero head, zero lacing, leggy but no stained glass left behind. Meh. Smell: bourbon, unripe nectarine, vinous, slightly doughy yeast wonk. Taste: booze soaked peaches in a ton of brown sugar, fleetingly nutty, caramel and toasted brown bread, then earthy with a respite from the sweet, hit with twin splashes of bourbon and vanilla, and finally drying out into a sticky peach and date filled finish. Drinking this fairly warm and the nose is really not doing much. But it's extremely tasty. It's not in stout territory as I've heard suggested. Nice fruit + sweet forward barleywine. 2013. 615 charactersbabaracas, Jan 25, 2014

A - The closest you can get to pitch black without being pitch black. The deepest brown if I may. Thin dissipating head and zero lacing.
S - Semi sweet chocolate, toffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak, just a touch of nuttiness. Huge bouque, super complex and amazing.
T - Caramel bomb, still an impressive amount of bourbon considering these are third use barrels. I've seen other beers in third use barrels not hold this much flavor. Very little alcohol. Touch of roast and chocolate, I assume could be residual from BCBS.
M - Straight Victoria's Secret silk nightie.
O - I hate to love this beer. But I do indeed love it. 730 charactersZach136, Jan 23, 2014

You can glorify it all you want, but let's get real, it's the original bourbon county that is slightly more sweet. The end. 
On a side note, I basically reviewed this as a stout and not a barleywine. I'm not sure why they throw barleywine into the title when clearly, this is NOT a representation of a barleywine whatsoever. As a beer in general, this is out of this fucking world. As for a barleywine, why call it that? It's like trying to say a woman's anus is different from a man's. No, it's not. 560 charactersbball208, Jan 22, 2014

4.85/5  rDev +8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Served in an oversized wine glass (chalice). 
Appearance: Deep dark mahogany with light sediments on the body. Slight tan but off-white head maybe one quarter of an inch with hard pour. 
Smell: Toffee like flavor that comes off complex and really just hovers the nostrils. 
Taste: Sweet almost toffee like. has a vanilla bean feel to it offset with a dark fruit feel that resembles red wine itself. Makes you think of a malbec maybe with the right hit of bitter barley. Mmmm.
Mouth: Medium bodied carbonation that feel a notch light with a ultra sticky "sweet" after-taste. Might feel a bit dry, just a bit...but you have to think about it, how does something this good last this long. Paired with food the after taste is forever. 
Overall: This brew is King Henry reborn for those of you who have never had it. This is by far the closest thing you will find that bears a resemblence. An absolute gem and to downgrade it is an absolute insult. grab a glass and do not share...Salud! 988 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Jan 22, 2014

The taste was actually too much for me. I've beginning to enjoy barely wines, but I felt that this one hit you too much. There was a definite alcohol taste this this from the beginning to the end.
I think that the high abv in this one came out stronger than the actual percentage! I felt like I was drinking something in the 17 to 20% range.
Because of this, I could not give this a higher rating. 599 charactersrdilauro, Jan 19, 2014

A: Looks more like a Stout than a typical Barleywine, with a black body topped by a finger of fine tan head that settles into a persistent ring. Clear, bright chestnut highlights do distinguish it from the appearance of regular BCBS when held up to light, but it's still remarkably dark for the style. Very impressive head retention for its strength, though.
S: Decadence. Huge, sweet, and complex, with lots of molasses, toffee, candied fruit, marshmallow, coconut, caramel, and oaky vanilla. A touch of leather and chocolate, too. Wow.
T: More purely sweet here, with caramel up front, molasses and vanilla midway through, and dark fruits filling in toward the finish. Long, bittersweet, heavily oaky and mildly warming aftertaste. Delicious, but not quite as outstanding as the aroma.
M: Thick, sticky, and lusciously carbonated. One of the stickiest beers I've ever had - my lips are literally fused together right now. While it certainly suits the beer, I can't say I find this aspect of it particularly appealing. Just OK.
O: I was really in love with this beer when I just had a couple ounces of it last week, but now that I'm nearly done with a whole bottle I'm finding the sticky sweetness a bit much, even for a barrel-aged English Barleywine. So many of the beautiful nuances of the aroma are just drowned out in the caramel gooeyness that I'm left strangely unsatisfied. Or perhaps oversatisfied. I can't quite tell.

M: Semi-full body, semi-medium carbonation. Finishes sweet caramel, roast and darkly fruited.

A: As I was (vigorously) pouring this, I wondered, "hmm, no carbonation at all?" Yes, it was that thick. Only at the very end did a small wispy head cover the top of the beer, and it *poof* disappeared quickly, only leaving a thin beige ring around the edge of the glass. A beautifully murky cola in color, it looks like root beer.
S: Wow, amazeballs. Loads upon loads of toffee, caramel, brown sugar-covered raisin bread. Like a diabetes-inducing sugary dessert. Yum. Where's the bourbon though? I don't detect it at all, at least not within 30 minutes of popping it.
T/M: Initial burst of sweetness right out of the gate, but still, the alcohol is insanely well-hidden. Definitely melted toffee & caramel are very prevalent, some vanilla from the barrel-aging. Bit of hop balance toward the back end. This is an insanely delicious beer. It's a 12%+ barleywine, so yeah, the mouthfeel is somewhat syrupy but not in the least bit cloying. Just the right amount of carbonation.
O: I'm not even a huge barleywine fan, but more beers like this would change that. Certainly not something you'd drink multiples of in a sitting, but when you feel like splurging - and have a designated driver or are on your own couch - you can't go wrong here. Wonderful beer. 1,375 charactersmarkgugs, Jan 16, 2014

4.47/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This elusive brew was poured from the tap at the Renshaw Lounge in Clawson, Michigan. Huge thanks to Ashley P. for the heads up!! It arrived in a generic half sized snifter, showing a ruddy, rusty deep chocolate brown coloring, letting up more ruby hues of light towards the stem of the glass. It held a half finger tall head of coco colored cream, showing decent retention into a film across the top of the liquid and archipelago lacing across the glass. Carbonation appeared to be light and slow to rise, with no haze or sediment otherwise appreciated. The aroma was warming and delicious, giving notes of soy sauce and hot boozy bourbon fresh off the top, with a background symphony of raw molasses, licorice, salted biscuits, heavy oak, crushing buttery diacetyls, phenolic clove and medicinals, thick grainy bite of rye and caramel roast, and softer coffee malt chalkiness. With warmth came frank brandy and maraschino cherry fruitiness. Our first impression was in line with the nose in that the base flavoring fit comfortably into the bourbon county family, showing untouched barreling and a slightly sweeter and less sticky swill than the traditional stout or the likes of King Henry. As we sipped, the taste began with sticky plum sugars and roasted pudding, darkly cooked coffee, chocolate, and caramel maltiness, huge buttery diacetyls, sweet butterscotch, black pepper, and permanent marker phenols. The beer’s sweetness came to peak through the center of the swallow, with sweet honey, sugary candied coconut, olive oil meatiness, dark chocolate syrups, burnt toffee, dried brown grassiness, and ancient, dried and cracked oak barrels, with rusted copper around its edges. The end washed through with stark green apple acetaldehyde bite, gingerbread crumbles, cooled vanilla coffee, vinyl plastics, burnt rubbers, smoky leathers, fusel brandy and bourbon booziness, pear, plum, and cherry syrups, and the heaviest grit of caramel and bittered rye graininess. The aftertaste breathed of medicinals, oaked woodiness, fusel bourbon, darkly roasted coffee, caramel, and rye grain, black pepper, dirty licorice buttons, cheesy musk, diacetyls, toasted coconut, sour and soapy hoppiness, tobacco smokiness, chalked oak chips, cedar mulch, maple and honey sugars, and a base wheat breadiness. The body was thick and full through and through, while the carbonation was surprisingly medium to high. Each sip was silky smooth and heavily syrupy, giving wonderful slurp, smack, cream, froth, pull, and pop. The lips were left sweet and nearly granular with residual sugar, while the mouth was coated from end to end. This feeling dragged forever before slowly, slowly slipping away to leave a fleeting burn and prickle to the tongue, and a quiver to the cheek. The abv was appropriate, and the beer drank excellently as a sipper.
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its taste. Everything about this guy is just so, so rich and complex, with layers upon layers upon layers, as you would expect from the BC brand. The first big noticeable difference stylistically is how damn dark it is. It’s like black barleywine status, a la the Sierra Nevada black barleywine from a few years back. While each sip begins and peaks with bright sweetness, much like the standard bourbon county stout, it is through the end and aftertaste of the sip where this beer really begins to take its own unique form. The malts sweeten up with warmth, helping to create some cracks in the darkness of themselves, allowing for the fruit and inherent bitterness of booze and wood to shine through. This is where the true complexity of the beer lies, once it all begins to fall into place. The aroma, while intensely rich, roasty, and robust, and hinting at the darkness of the beer, doesn’t quite come to that same level of glory as the flavoring. Again, this is just a treat all around, and although it isn’t quite as sticky, dank, and “forever” as King Henry, we are extremely happy to have been able to track down and consume this beer, especially since we thought it was gone forever. 4,088 charactersTheBrewo, Jan 15, 2014
4.45/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours a nice firm tan head, ~1 finger, with excellent retention. Brew is a very dark brown, almost solid black in the glass.
Aroma of sweet bourbon drifts across from the opening of the bottle, and is the overwhelming note from the glass. Milky dark malts round out the nose. Despite the strength, the bourbon comes across very smooth.
Flavor follows the nose fairly closely, focusing on bourbon, with a milky, almost cocoa taste to the body. A sharper hop and malt balance rounds out the aftertaste, once everything else has faded enough to let it through.
Feel is full, thick, and chewy. Heck of a beer. It's lively without much sting, although there's a very noticeable alcohol burn. The bourbon provides the necessary balance and punch.
This is an outstanding beer, but I think the bourbon dominates vice compliments the character. To me, it doesn't taste much like a barleywine; those qualities mostly show up right at the end. That said, it's a very tasty strong ale with a focus on dark malts and bourbon, and it's absolutely delicious.
2013 vintage. I'm looking forward to aging the rest. 1,101 charactersRoguer, Jan 15, 2014

4.47/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from bottle into a snifter
Appearance – The beer pours a murky mahogany/brown color with tons of particulates seen floating about. Upon pouring there is a tiny bit of fizzy foam that forms atop the brew. This fades almost instantly leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass. Upon swirling the beer in the glass some fingers of thick beer stick to the sides of the glass slowly fading back to the base of the snifter and again leaving almost no lace on the sides of the glass.
Smell – The aroma of the beer is heaviest of sweeter smells with tons of caramel and toffee. Along with these smells are some aromas of roasted malt nature with some chocolate and darker bread as well as some other more fruit like aromas of orange, fig, and raisin. Along with these aromas are some big smells of oak with a good dose of boozy bourbon as well. Some smells of a more earthy and grassy nature are there as well, mixing with the rest to produce and overall sweet and oaky barleywine smell.
Taste – The taste follows the nose rather nicely. It begins with tons of sweetness of caramel and toffee. The caramel starts out stronger in the taste, but as the taste moves on, the toffee really takes over, giving a more buttery flavor to the beer. Along with the sweet, are some chocolate and oaky flavors upfront, which while they start out lighter, get quite potent toward the end. Notes of hop come to the tongue more toward the middle of the taste. They begin mostly of an herbal nature with some earthy tastes coming later on. A moderate amount of a tobacco taste develop from the beginning to the end combining with the herbal and earthy tastes to give a bit of a green flavor to the brew. Toward the end the oaky flavors get rather potent and are combined with some darker fruits of raisin and fig as well as some nice bourbon flavors that develop more toward the middle and the end of the taste. The combination of flavors that is left, with all the transitions of the oaky, sweet, and hop flavors of the brew, end up leaving an oaky bourbon, sweet, and lightly hopped boozy flavor to linger on the tongue.
Mouthfeel – The body of the beer is on the thicker and creamier side with a carbonation level that is on the lower side. Both are quite fantastic for the big, sweet, bourbon and oaky flavors of the brew and make this beer a nice slow sipper just as it is intended to be.
Overall – A nice sweeter, slow sipping, barleywine with plenty of nice bourbon and oaky flavors. This is one to sit down with on a cold evening night in front of a fire slowly sip away while reading the paper or a nice book. 2,621 charactersDarkmagus82, Jan 13, 2014
3.94/5  rDev -12.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75I previously rated this with a 4.75 but I feel the need to bring it down. This is my least favorite among the Bourbon County series. Extremely sweet and heavy, just seeing it on a menu makes me full and achy. 
So sticky there is residue on the rim of the glass. The taste is rich, with expensive Brazilian wood, sap, molasses, praline, Hershey's chocolate syrup and smoke.
It finishes hot and a tad spicy, with a tingle. An eight-ounce pour is expensive but bearable. Any more than that becomes a chore. 505 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Jan 13, 2014

On tap in glass in Chicago
Appearance: 4
Dark red black body with thin head.
Smell: 4 
Strong bourbon aroma dominates with notes of raisin, dark fruit, molasses sweetness typical of barleywine. Very intense aromatics, much more barrel presence than I have had with BCBS
Taste 4.25
Initially, bourbon presence leads the way with detectable, but smooth alcohol warmth. Barelywine sweetness and dark fruit dominates at first. Later mid taste, get more roasty notes coming through. Also bitterness of hops become more prominent near the end.
Mouthfeel: 4
Moderate thickness with mild carbonation. Slightly vicosity is balanced by astringency of hops.
Overall: 4.25
Very barrel forward with strong presence of bourbon. Still has reasonable balance with malt aspect of the barleywine base. Detectable hops presence offer contrast to other flavours. Not sure if truly lives up to hype, but still enjoyable offering. I imagine some age in the bottle version would improve the overall experience. 1,007 charactersEnemyWithin, Jan 12, 2014

This ruby, fig, purple, brown Barleywine has a brown sugar foam head that fades quickly and slides away into the abyss. Not a hint of carbonation which is how I like my BBA English BW's. Insane, sticky and drippy legs as it swirls around the glass. Dried figs, raisins, vanilla beans, bourbon, caramel covered cherries, mulled winter spices and honey. Picking up lovely stout notes and hints of banana. Deep, dark, naughty fruit! Uplifting vanilla and honey sweetness. Sweet bourbon, charred malt, and a hint of tangerine/nectarine citrus. Tastes of cherries, figs, and vanilla beans dredged in caramel covered semi-sweet chocolate. Subtle notes of tangy citrus peel, oak, cocoa, coffee and even more dried fruit. The bourbon pokes in and out between each sip and the finish. Sticky honey sweet! It runs down, and coats your throat with each sip. So thick and delicious!!! GI has definately perfected the English Barleywine!!! It's may not be KH, but it's one hell of an attempt!!! Damn near perfection!!! 1,048 charactersThickfreakness, Jan 12, 2014

Poured into BCBS snifter
Appearance - Very similar to classic Coca Cola. 
Smell - Big booze, some oak, underlying chocolate and cherries.
Taste - The classic BCBS flavor really shines through and makes this one unique. The barrel comes through up front, then a lot of that BCBS chocolate, finished off by some light fruit. 
Mouthfeel - Med/heavy body, low carb, sticky & dry finish. 
Overall - Solid brew, but honestly, it left me wanting regular BCBS or one of the stout variants. One of my least favorite variants, yet still good enough to warrant a solid 4/5. 583 characterssbxx, Jan 12, 2014

4.15/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25The beer pours a deep dark brown with an inch of foamy tan head that sticks around through drinking in the form of a thin halo settling neatly around the perimeter. I'm impressed by the depth of color, head retention, and near-oily lacing. The nose is a prominent boozy brown sugar/caramel vanilla bourbon woodiness. The taste brings the same notes/flavors full force, moving towards a nice balance between sugary sweetness and booze as it warms. I notice a bit of pruney dark fruit and chocolate in the taste compared to the nose. The mouthfeel is big, full bodied as expected with a great sweetness tamed only by the biting booze and the slightly tannic bitterness. I'd say this beer is worth a try, which is profound considering how I generally feel about the style and the steep $/oz ratio. However, I'll probably pass on it in the future. 843 charactersThePorterSorter, Jan 11, 2014

A - Very rich and dark amber body that produces a tan head that dissipates into a nice little slick on top. 
S - Surprisingly mellow given the ABV and the barrel aging. Don't pick up too much alcohol or burn and instead find a plethora of heavy malted notes reminiscent of a fresh bakery or mill. Slight wafts of some cocoa and smoke malts. 
T - A bit underwhelming for this expectation. Doesn't quite have that robust caramel flavor often found in BA barley wines. Instead, this beer has a huge malt body comparable to overly sweet southern black tea. A bit tannic and smokey at times, the beer opens up as it warms to reveal it's traditional English profile. No real hop presence that is likely dominated by the malt. The barrel aged flavor also remains very muted and mellow. 
M - Like other members of the bourbon county family, barleywine has a rather thinner pallet. Very light carbonated body that makes drinking rather easy for this higher gravity beer. 
O - The beer is a solid offering but nowhere near a home run. The third use barrels don't quite give it the hotness or booziness fans of big bourbon barrel barley wines will be used to. While this isn't' by any means a deal breaker, it does introduce an interesting flavor profile that is satisfying. 1,313 characterskylelenk, Jan 09, 2014

S: It smelled like rich dark chocolate and sweet vanilla and coconut, with some nutty toffee and oak and a little nutmeg and dried dark fruit and honey wheat bread.
T: It tasted like dried dark fruit and rich dark chocolate and sweet vanilla, with some nutty toffee and honey wheat bread and coconut and oak. It had a rich and clean and surprisingly mellow aftertaste.
M: It was super thick and chewy with some carbonation. Awesome huge body.
D: This was simply delicious. The scent and taste were complex but well integrated. The body was fantastic, and the alcohol was hidden amazingly well. It had a crazy smooth finish too, so it was easy to drink even though it must be sipped. Would age forever, but doesn't need it. Meets the hype, as a top notch brew. 819 charactersPencible, Jan 09, 2014

S - 4.5 - Malty, baked goods-y, chocolatey, caramelly, slight sherry-y, boozy. It's that characteristic barleywine smell you're familiar but with a chocolatey caramelly addition. Smells really lovely.
T - 4.5 - Brownies, but less sweet, more grown up, and more complex. A malty, chocolatey, baked goods thing happening. The first sip gave all that around the edges, but an empty hole in mid palate where almost nothing was happening but something just shy of metal. Never got all the way there though, and the hole got filled after that. There was a slight tartness leftover after the first sip but it got buried after that. Top notch.
M - 4.25 - Substantial weight but lighter than expected. Medium-heavy. Silky smooth. Slight tongue abrasion after a while. Surprisingly there was very little in the way of warm fumes wafting up the throat or warming the belly.
O - 4.5 - Sometimes a barleywine starts off fine but then hangs a turn in my mouth and goes somewhere I don't want, either flat and dead, or too sherry, or bitter in an unpleasant way. This one doesn't. It stays on track. There's some activity, and it gets right to the edge of where it would veer off, but it keeps on track. That's very nice and welcome, and tantalizing at the same time. It's hard to even really compare this with other barleywines because it seems like such a different animal. I like it much better. 1,508 charactersBrownNut, Jan 08, 2014

4.26/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25The beer pours a dark, ruby-brown with a fluffy off-white/nearly tan head of large, soda-like bubbles. The head is surprisingly large, but quickly fizzles away to a nice fat scrim that is continuously fed by carbonation from the bottom of the glass. In the glass, the beer looks pretty much like a stout or imperial porter, the light reddish hue is the only thing that really sets it apart. In body the beer is a very deep, clear ruby that is a few touches away from being opaque. On the nose, the beer is rich and decadent. Spicy bourbon, rich oak tannin, vanilla, coconut, and then thick fudge, molasses bread, plum pudding, and toffee play across the nose. The barrel is strong, but not the overriding character in the nose, which I quite like. With a bit of age the nose of this beer alone could really develop into something quite amazing. As is, the nose is intriguing, boozy, and rich. On the tongue, the beer tastes decadently sweet with a touch of acidity that gives a pop. The finish is rich alcohol that becomes only a touch hot and solvent-like in closing, but does dry out. Very soft bitterness from both tannins and herbal hops can be felt in the middle and finish of the sip some of the sweetness. In flavor, the beer begins as spicy wood, blooming into rich bourbon soaked molasses bread, brown sugar, fudge with bits of toffee in it, and plum pudding. Touches of dry raisins float across the palate and the bourbon flavors definitely suggest soft vanilla, as well. The finish bring rich dark fruits, a touch of banana, and fudge beside spicy alcohol and just a touch of solvent. The beer is decadent, boozy, and delicious. I wish there was a little less booze, but I think age would definitely help with that problem. In the mouth, the beer feels full, and oozingly smooth. Little to no carbonation can be sensed, and the mouth is left tingly with booze but still wet in the cheeks, though the tongue feels a bit dry. Overall, I am quite surprised by this beer. I like bourbon barrel aged barleywines, but they aren’t really my favorite thing. This one, however, is rich and full of malt character that I really enjoy. The bourbon flavors are light and perfectly complement the other flavors. With a little more age, this beer will be delicious. This beer is worthy of a try for sure. 2,303 charactersMaxwell, Jan 08, 2014

4.65/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 12 oz brown bottle into a clear glass snifter. Bottled on 24SEP13 on back of label. Purchased at Wine Warehouse (Charlottesville, VA).
A: Tawny dark brown with 1/2-finger beige foamy head with decent retention for the style and ABV but no real lacing but plenty of alcohol legs.
S: Coconut and vanilla fly out first with caramel and candied dates next. Raisins and sweet bourbon character follow with more toffeeish burnt caramel. Even some chocolate notes come through with warming.
T: Out of sight flavor with marshmallow and vanilla coconut blending with toffee and cooked caramel followed by date, raisin, and cookie breadiness. The bourbon character is less than you'd imagine in the nose, but accents the malt flavors well. The same medium-dark chocolate note joins with a mocha like aftertaste. Alcohol character is very low to none. No yeast or hops character but there shouldn't be. Bourbon County Barleywine is a fine, complex, sweet but balanced representation with exceptional use of barrel characteristics.
M: Silky, low carbonation, lush and sumptuous with a definite full-body that misses syrupy by just the right amount. 
O: A true pleasure to drink in every facet. I had Bourbon County Coffee Stout a few nights ago and I enjoy this one a lot more -- incredibly complex and, while sweet, provides so many wonderful nuances with the barrel character that prevents it from crossing over into over-sweet. Fantastic beer and worth effort to obtain. 1,480 charactersargock, Jan 05, 2014

Dark brown-amber elixir poured into Hoppin' Frog snifter. 1/2 inch of vigorous foam settles to thin tan rim. Few wisps of lacing, legs all around.
The BC barrel aroma comes immediately wafting through, mingling with a complex amalgam of dark fruits, vanilla and molasses. 
This is one awesome barleywine right out of the gate. The bourbon and barrel flavors are well balanced with the sweetness of the dark fruit and vanilla.
Medium to full body, nicely carbonated, smooth, slick a touch of heat at the end.
Really impressed with this brew and wonder how or if age will change it's almost flawless composition. This brew will convert the uninitiated to barleywines. Cheers! 822 charactersCaptCleveland, Jan 05, 2014

A: This is a very dark Barleywine. Very deep brown, but still slightly transluscent. Amber hues are evident when the light passes through. A thin tan head forms and dies away within a minute. Light lacing. 
S: A very aromatic beer. With malt, caramel, molasses, raison, vanilla, and bourbon alcohol. 
T: Boom - sweet caramel, toffee maltiness. Dark fruit flavors linger, sweet figs and raison. After the initial sweet bomb, the alcohol heat seems to burn these flairs into your tongue. It has quite a warm, long lasting finish. Some light chocolate, coffee and bitterness in the finish.
M: Medium bodied mouthfeel, really creamy and smooth. The carbonation is a little course for an English style barley wine. Not as heavy as some English Barleywines (Thomas Hardy is my standard for the stye), but a great mouthfeel. 
O: I am a big fan of English Barleywines. Most of them I like to age for a few years before I drink them, but this GI Barleywine is certainly very enjoyable right out of the gate. Still, it is a tad sweet for my tastes and I am looking forward to see what a year or two in the cellar will do for these. I will come back to amend this review in one year. 1,182 charactersimscotty, Jan 05, 2014

A disappointment for me. Glad I didn’t run all over town to find this beer. 3.5
A - Dark, opaque, with a one-finger head, alcohol legs. - 4.25
S – Whiskey and sweet maltiness . Dark fruit. Raisins more than any beer I have ever had. This beer also had an odd faint (but definitely there) soapy smell. I asked the bartender to throw away the first glass and give me another (which he gladly agree to do). He rinsed the glass an extra long time but I still had that faint soapy odor. Bartender could not smell it. - 2.5
T – Sweet, malty, dark fruit, not enough bitterness, bourbon (not overwhelming) and a tinge of tobacco 3.5
MF – Syrupy, smooth, slick, full bodied. 3.75 718 charactersSludgeman, Jan 04, 2014
4.57/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Was really worried about this one since BCBS is way too boozy for me but I heard great things. Thanks to cleg for the bottle. 
Appearance: Pours a typical barleywine color. Almost no head at all. Minimal carbonation.
Smell: Smells of toffee, bourbon, dark fruits, vanilla, cocoa. 
Taste - This is where it sticks out from the pack. Taste mirrors the nose but with more cocoa on the swallow - weird but super interesting. Can definitely tell there was BCBS in the barrel before - chocolatey. 
Mouthfeel: Almost no booze! Very well hidden.
Overall: Really interesting and one of my favorite barleywines. Love it. 615 charactersGameFreac, Jan 04, 2014

Appearance: wow, looked like prune juice while pouring. Very thick, opaque, and as if prunes, raisins, etc. were lending the dark color. Very minimal foam built up and quickly dissipated; just shiny at the surface. Little bit of sediment floating around in the glass. Very opaque and intense dark brown. As I recall, it resembles BB4D. 
Smell: tons and tons of dark fruits with plenty of bourbon and a bit of chocolate. To me its almost like an old ale. A sweet malty complex mess. I love it. 
Taste: Very sweet with tons of dark fruits, brown sugar and some vanilla. This beer is amazingly complex. It starts sweet, becomes tart and finishes with a nice warmth from the alcohol. Still tasting the fruits/brown sugar after a sip. It's awesome. 
Mouthfeel: smooth and velvety with minimal carbonation. Also plenty of warmth around the mouth, very inviting. 
Overall: wow, just wow. This is the best barrel-aged barleywine I tasted. I was unsure about this until I actually tasted this for the first time. 1,036 charactersBenish, Jan 04, 2014

4.12/5  rDev -8.2%look: 2 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25$5.99 for a 12 oz bottle @ BevCo. Brewed with Pale, Crystal, Caramel, Dark Chocolate malts. Hopped with Pilgrim, Styrian. "Aged in the third-use barrels that were once home to Kentucky bourbon and then our renowned Bourbon County Stout, this traditional English-style barleywine possesses the subtlety of flavor that only comes from a barrel that’s gone through many seasons of ritual care."
12.1% ABV, 60 IBU.
Pours out to a cloudy deep walnut. Little bits of sediment floating around. Barely manages to eek out a limpid head which quickly recedes. No head retention. Carbonation is mild, about 1.5 carbs or so. The aroma at an arms length overwhelms with soy sauce and prune juice. A little bit of black walnut and carob are in there as well when swirled. Mouthfeel is dense and syrupy with a sticky sweet finish. The taste is a recap of the aroma. Intense soy sauce and prune juice with black walnuts, light molasses. Bitterness is quite mild and overall, quite sweet. Finish of moist pipe tobacco and port. A little bit of sweet cocoa in the finish. Not hot or boozy but I definitely feel the alcohol. I don't get much bourbon, but that's probably because I drink bourbon frequently...And bourbon is not subtle. Some minor roast character in the finish as well, which is peculiar for a barleywine. Of note, they call this an English Style Barleywine, but I don't get an English Yeast character.
Hrmm. This is a very good beer, but at $5.99/12oz, not something I would feel compelled to buy again. It reminds me very much of Sam Adams Triple Bock. One bottle is enough to last a while. If you like this beer, try Jewbelation which is at a better price point. 1,665 charactersMitchster, Jan 04, 2014

4.56/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Its with incredible resplendence that Goose Island even dares to follow up their King Henry that shared elements of both their famed Bourbon County Stout and their second-use Pappy 23 barrels. Yet, there's more life to the ale as Bourbon Barrel Brand Barleywine is borne.
Its pour would be easily mistaken for stout because of its black and ominous body, except for its tawny low-lights around the edges. As its initial pour yeilds a rich mocha-laden blanket of foam, the eventual collapse leaves the ale with an appetizing brandy-like appearance, equipped with streaming legging and all.
Its aromas are a culmination of all things both sweet and savory- black-strap molasses, toffee, maple, honey and sorghum all play a part in the beer's malty scent. Light coffee, nutty aromas, and a rich "umami" tone of something soy sauce and fudge wrapping around the sweetness. A trailing fruit liqueur note, similar of brandy, rum and bourbon all contribute to the beer's character and rich scent.
Its lavish taste is sultry, decadent and seductive with its very first scent as its booze-infused flavors of maple syrup, molasses, chocolate and coffee play equal parts in the beer's early complexity. After that, the taste really opens up to share savory port wine and aged sherry tones as the rich and "meaty" taste takes hold. Adding a sprinkle of salt to amplifiy its taste, a flavor of soy sauces joins with the judge-like richness for a taste that's spot on with the aroma. A trailing bitterness in lightly coffee-like and timidly signals its closure.
Silky smooth and lightly peppery, the ale's texture opens with a creamy film that coats the palate with a cling of sweetness. Its middle retains much of its richness while the mild acidity of seemingly wine lightens the body as the carbonation recedes. Finishing like port, its long linger of boozy sweetness is satisfying and rewarding to the palate like fine dessert or cognac.
The ale is alive with a tremendous amount of savory sweet notes- appealing to all that is sweet, earthy, boozy and salty all at once. Beers like this might as well be like catnip to a savory fiend like me. 2,138 charactersBEERchitect, Jan 03, 2014

Looks like a lightly colored stout, but with hints of gold shining through. Very unique for a barleywine and you can see the impact of the barrel aging. Not a lot of head or lacing, but I wasn't expecting much.
Aroma is a combination of roasted malts, chocolate, butter toffee and raisins.
Wow. The flavors are tremendous. The roasted malts of a stout complementing the sweetness of the barley wine. Amazing! Vanilla, brown sugar, toffee, roasted malts, raisins and a slightly-sweet chocolate flavor round out this beauty. Maybe one of the most unique flavors I have had in a beer.
Succulent, velvety and light all at the same time. Rich and creamy and leaves one wanting more.
I am so glad I picked this up when it was available. I paid $22 for a four pack, but when you compare this beer to those bombers selling for $15-20 each, this is a steal. Don't pass it up if you see it! 920 charactersdoppelmeup, Jan 02, 2014

Pours a hazy deep tawny brown color with a smallish off white head that shows little retention. Sweet bourbon with a soft woodsy aroma atop the caramel brown sugar and vanilla contained within. Light plum and cherry fruits with a hint of earth and ethanol round out the nose. The flavor is brown sugar toffee and caramel maltiness upfront before the sweet bourbon and a twinge of ethanol remind you this is one serious brew. Light vanilla and hints of pitted fruits round out the flavor nicely. Medium to thick body with a light level of carbonation and a sweet sticky mouthfeel. That is a really nice barleywine right there! 673 charactersjohnnnniee, Jan 01, 2014

12/12/13 – Served in a GI taster glass
A: Pours a rusted brown color with a very minimal khaki tan head. Just a quick flash in the glass that leaves behind a fizzy swirl on top. Carb is evident with some large bubbles clinging to the glass. Pretty clean and otherwise motionless with no streaks or sticky leftovers. 
S: Smells of caramel toffee nougat with vanilla biscuit and hints of sweet bourbon. Earthy oak meets dried dark fruits and some lesser aromas of milk chocolate. There is some modest alcohol present as well. Really nice nose with toffee at the forefront and some fine bourbon character to it. 
T: Toffee with caramel nougat and sweetened biscuit meets dark berries, Bourbon, vanilla crème, and dried fig/dates. The barrel notes are pretty tame but work so nicely here. Not overbearing or harsh in anyway shape or form. Add in a dash of nutty chocolates with some toasted bread and brown sugars. Alcohol is present however delicately manageable and there is a moderately low amount of perceived bitterness to the beer. Soft earthy minerals towards the finish. Delicious with some really refined flavors.
M: Fairly heavy and thick but not syrupy. Lower carbonation but with just enough drying in the finish to counter. Touch of alcohol heat. Light sticky residuals although fairly clean overall.
D: Hands down one of the best Barley Wines I have had to date. Rich and incredibly complex with the Bourbon notes incorporated so nicely. Loads of toffee, vanilla, and dark berry. Stoked to have tried this. Closest I will probably ever get to King Henry. 1,606 charactersNugganooch, Dec 30, 2013

Poured a beautiful syrupy brown color with a half-finger mocha colored head. Had some reddish tints to it when held to the light. Left a syrupy resin on the sides of the glass.
Immediately upon pouring I was hit with intense smells of brown sugar, butterscotch, toffee and marshmallow. Very sweet smelling. Bourbon was detected on the nose but not nearly as strong as I anticipated. Also mixed in were some dark fruit smells such as plum and cherry.
Taste was absolutely phenomenal. Yes, this is a sweet beer - one to be sipped on over an hour or so, but wow, behind the sweetness is a complexity that rivals any beer I have had. Definite butterscotch flavors backed by dark fruits and light vanilla. Bourbon is mixed in quite well.
Mouth-feel was thick and syrupy, with a perfect amount of bourbon "burn" to warm you up.
Overall this is an INCREDIBLE beer. I am glad I have three more to see what some age does to them (though it is going to be hard to resist). I actually prefer this to BCBS which says a lot. 1,071 charactersTWStandley, Dec 30, 2013

A- A deep, extremely murky dark brown, light actually doesn't penetrate it! A think khaki head dissipates very quickly.
S- Big notes of caramelized sugar, molasses, vanilla, toffee, with a touch of bourbon character.
T- Follows the nose. Taste just explodes on the palette. If this had just a touch more dark fruit and barrel character, it would be perfect, but it's mighty fine as is. Ends very sticky sweet. Where in the world is the 12.1%??
M- You can almost anticipate the mouthfeel looking at the pour. Viscous. Coats the mouth. Full bodied.
O- Quite good. I'd certainly have it again.
12/30/2014-  updated the "taste" rating, as I sampled a bottle I aged for 1 year, the bourbon character is absolutely fantastic with some aging.  The sweetness falls back just enough to let the barrel through. 842 charactersJWU, Dec 30, 2013

I enjoyed a few of these bottles over the holiday break at Duckworths (Ballantyne). This is a very large and rich BW that lands very heavy on the barrel side and finishes sticky-sweet. The finish was actually very similar to the Coffee varietal - just entirely too sweet in my opinion. There aren't many other bad things to say about this beer - smooth and a pretty optimal booziness, rich caramel malt, sticky caramelized brown sugar. Very good stuff, but my first reaction was that there are plenty of peers in this class, with Central Waters BBBW remaining the breadwinner in my opinion (and at half the price). 625 charactersdirtylou, Dec 29, 2013

I love bourbon county stout so I was really excited for this beer. I poured the beer do find a dark brown beer with little head that faded quickly, the beer was slightly hazy as well. The aroma was subtle, malty, some vanilla and dark fruits. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary for a barrel aged beer so far. This beer tasted plain. It was syrupy and strong but really lacked complexity. Over all I would have to say this was a disappointing beer. I am not sure if I had to high of expectations or if it really is just meh, but I can say there are several much better barrel aged beers out there. 654 charactersbr3wmeister, Dec 29, 2013

Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a Nonic, served at cellar temp.
Appearance: Lignite Brown with a thick mocha head that recedes to a thin film.
Aroma: Perhaps the best beer I have ever smelled; rich, luscious caramel, butterscotch, some alcohol esthers.

4.48/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5I really did not want to like this, as I am not a big fan of barleywine ale to begin with, but...I have to admit that (could not help it) I liked this very much. Deep dark pour into chilled pint glass. Thin light brown head, which dissipates quickly. Lacing is good and even/consistent, with a zillion tiny bubbles which do not cling to glass for long. On the nose, the scent is very similar to the regular BCBS, with prevalent coffee, vanilla, chocolate, and caramel/toffee, but that's where the similarities start to part ways. On the palate, the heavy malt and alcohol of the barley wine style emerge, which I thought at first would lead me to dislike this gem, but with each sip, I found myself more and more mesmerized by the balance of competing flavors. A veritable tastebud orgasm of sorts, as I moved from one pleasurable hint to another (coffee, YES...chocolate, YES...toffee, YES...vanilla, YES...YES, YES, YES!!!). Mouthfeel was full and ample throughout, leaving a nice burn on the back of the palate. In the future, I'll probably still choose BCBS and/or BCBCS over BCBBW every time, but the divide is not as great as I had previously surmised. This is good shit, indeed.
Had this again on 2/7/14, from tap at Roast House pub in Frederick, MD (after visiting Flying Dog brewery for BA Gonzo release), and I do hereby reaffirm all dat shit I said herein above. BCBBW is da bomb! 1,392 charactersJohnParadee, Dec 29, 2013

4.79/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured dark brown into oversized snifter. Not enough head to even cover the top. Very opaque, where there is potential for lacing, its there.
Boozy smell, dried fruit, coffee grinds and a little oak. Sweet caramel vanilla lingers.
Sweet fruity alcohol taste. Coffee and a little chocolate on the back end. Also oak, plum and dark fruit. A little bitter.
An initial burn from the alcohol, first in the mouth and then the throat. Nott too much though. Very chewy and a sweet, lip-licking sweet finish.
Overall it is very intriguing. Not nearly the bourbon barrel character of BCBS, but I think I get equal amounts of the barrel and base beer of BCBS in this one. I also noticed the alcohol in this one seems smoother at first, but lingers longer than BCBS. Barleywines aren't my favorite, but I don't see how this could be a better one. The lingering sweetness truly makes it, as it works so well. 899 charactersMrBoh, Dec 28, 2013

Poured into a Duvel glass
Appearance: (4.5)
Pours a deep, dark brownish amber that verges on black. A creamy, thick finger tall tan head forms gradually and has some very nice retention considering the beer's ABV. The head slowly dies down to a short half finger crown leaving some minute lacing behind. 
Aroma: (4.5)
Huge notes of sweet dark fruits waft up to your nostrils as soon as you raise the tulip to your nose; mostly plums, figs and cherries. Right alongside these aromas are notes of sweet breads, toffee leather and molasses, as well as an intriguing, creamy chocolate trait. This chocolate nuance I assume is from the fact that this beer was aged in a bourbon barrel that previously held Bourbon County Brand Stout. As the beer warms, some familiar barrel characteristics start to reveal themselves; vanilla, coconut and toasted almond. At 12% there are some alcohol fussels to be noted. 
Taste: (4.5)
As soon as the beer enters your mouth, sweet fruit tones coat your palate entirely; more of the plum, fig and dark cherry that was so evident in those. Accompanying these notes is a sizable, toffee forward, bready malt backbone. Just before the beer becomes too cloying, a tiny bite of alcohol comes in to dry things out a tad. The beer finishes off dry and lighly bitter with long, lingering notes of dark fruits, rich chocolate, toffee, sweet bread as some faint roasted coffee notes. As the beer warms, lush toasted coconut and vanilla and the barrel become more obvious. At 12%, there is some definite warming as you imbibe. 
Mouthfeel(4.75)
Creamy, full body with medium carbonation. The texture is very velvety. 
Overall: (4.5)
A positively outstanding example of a bourbon barrel aged English styled barleywine. Goose Island using previously used Bourbon County Brand Stout barrels was a fabulous idea because this barleywine really picked up on some of the rich, chocolatey and coffee notes of the stout. I dont think I've as of yet had a barleywine with such a creamy mouthfeel. Highly, highly recommended. 2,048 charactersflayedandskinned, Dec 28, 2013

A - Pours with a slightly muddy body that is somewhat translucent. Medium brown in color with some mahogany highlights. A small cap of foam falls quickly leaving behind just a collar of tan foam and some small islands floating in the body of the beer.
S - Big boozy notes up front. Big brown sugar and toffee sweetness, buttery, notes of vanilla, dark fruits/prunes.
T - Similar to the nose. Bourbon up front with some noticeable alcohol warmth. Mildly tart with a slight cherry-ish fruitiness. Plenty of brown sugar, light caramel, and burnt sugary sweet character. Bourbon and just enough hop presence balance this out quite well. Vanilla smooths out the flavors and brings everything together.
M - Surprisingly smooth...big bourbon character but is kept well under control. Sweet, dessert like sugary presence helps promote the smooth character. Enough bitterness to even things out overall. Body is medium...could be a touch thicker. Carbonation is low and works well here.
O - Very good BA barleywine. A bit of a slow sipper, but not at all overbearing. Alcohol, although definitely noticeable, does not overpower. Bourbon barrel definitely enhances the beer. Without the bite of the bourbon, this might come across as too sweet and sugary. Still this is very smooth and a great after dinner/dessert beer. 1,377 charactersportia99, Dec 28, 2013

Pours a ruby deep brown with zero head...not expecting and major carbonation cuse of the abv but its a syrup looking pour. Smell is nice caramel toffe malt reduction...classic barleywine with dried fruit and woody bourbon vanilla notes. Taste is super sweet toffee and vanilla bourbon. Its very sweet but works well. Its a high abv and it shows..the yeast still has a lot to clean up here...its very sweet. Don't get me wrong, its delicious but it needs to be dialed back a tad. Not the most amazing bw I've had but it is quite tasty.
Sometimes I feel price dictates ratings...in this case it kinda does. Its a pricey hyped 12oz bottle. While it is good, there is no doubting that, I feel people may rate this higher cuse of the cost, or lack of tasting other barleywines... 863 charactersDrinkSlurm, Dec 27, 2013

I've never seen a Barleywine this color before. Looks more like a stout. Get the bourbon booze, some sherry, maybe cherries on the nose. Strong taste. Hits with warm alcohol, sweet like chocolate covered cherries (kind of). Mouthfeel very thick, very little carbonation. Honestly, I'm sure I'll dig this one by the time I'm done with it, but this is not my favorite Barleywine by a long stretch. In my opinion, this type of beer works much better as a stout. The BCBS is a lot better. Well, I'm saving another of these to age.

5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Pours a dark, cloudy brown with minimal head. Not much lacing.
S - Bourbon, caramel, and roasted malts dominate with some vanilla notes mixed in as well.
T - The taste follows the nose, but is much deeper and more balanced. Quite a lot of vanilla, wood, bourbon, caramel, roasted malts, candied and dried fruit. The flavors are oddly muddled yet retain the nuance you look for in the combination of delicious flavors.
M - Slight bit of carbonation, perfect amount of fullness in the body. Spot on!
O - This beer is outstanding! I prefer this slightly over the Bourbon County Brand Stout! A must try for anyone! 618 charactersBigOldOaf, Dec 26, 2013

Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a CBS snifter. Served a cellar temperature. 
A) It is a dark coffee bean brown colored brew. A small light tan head was generated, quickly settling to a collar, and then it was gone.
S) For the most part I found this to have a wonderful aroma of brown sugar, vanilla, and just a hint of bourbon. It is sweet and very pleasing to my sense of smell.
T) The flavor is very near the nose, with the exception of some delicious dark fruits. The bourbon is very subdued, and while this is certainly for sipping, it goes down so smooth.
M) Full bodied with light carbonation. Smooth and coating... Fantastic aftertaste.
O) Enjoyed this on tap, and now bottled. Best barrel aged Barleywine I've had the pleasure of drinking. Much respect to Insanity and Central Waters, but this is a notch better. Seek this one out.... Cheers! 899 charactersRoamingGnome, Dec 25, 2013

Pours a dark reddish brown with a head that comes up after you finish pouring...Nice looking pour. The smell is big on vanilla and dark fruits and candy sugar...honestly not much bourbon on the aroma but its quite appealing. The taste is almost an exact mirror image as the bourbon is muted and the sweet candied sugar and dark fruits really shine through. However this isnt overly sweet by any means. Extremely full bodied beer ... definitely impressive for a barleywine. Carbonation is right where it needs to be.
Overall terrific. This is 100% a barleywine and not just a stout with added dark fruits. Its terrific ! 658 charactersAxnjxn, Dec 25, 2013

Dark mahogany pour with a beige one finger head that quickly fades but with really nice lacing. The nose is heavenly for a Barleywine lover like myself Lots of dark fruits, bourbon, and oak along with hints of figs, toffee, raisins, and sweet brown bread. The taste is just as amazing and mirrors the nose. Oak, dark fruits, vanilla, molasses, black cherries, maple, toffee, with some subtle chocolate and licorice notes. The mouthfeel is thick and syrupy and velvety smooth with a nice subtle warming finish. It's amazingly not hot or boozy for a 12% ABV beer, but I'm still going to cellar a couple of these and see what happens. Overall, this may not be quite in the same league as King Henry, but it's pretty damn close and way more available. Another classic offering from Goose Island! 843 charactersbeerdrifter, Dec 24, 2013

Immediate fizz sound when I opended the bottle then an overwhelming toffee aroma. 
A: pretty standard barleywine. Poured aggressive with little head. Dark reddish brown color. 
S: toffee. Bourbon. Dark fruits. Whiskey raisins. 
T: heavy bourbon followed by dark fruits. Carmel sweetness. 
M: very clean. More carbonated then I was expecting for the style and being barrel aged. 
O: solid barrel aged barleywine. Unfortunately, I didn't get a ton of barrel characteristics from this brew. No oak or vanilla was present. Not sure if using barrels three times is a good idea. I enjoy higher alcohol beers but this needs some time IMO. Drinking very hot right now. Would drink again but wouldn't seek out in a trade.
Bottle rating: 4.25
Edit:
On draft at local bottle shop. Poured into 8oz snifter.
A: I asked for the BCBBW and I thought they brought me BCBS accidently. Black coffee like appearance, thin pale head. Very similar to BCBS but head is not as dark.
S: Vanilla, coconut, bourbon, and sweetness. All the barrel character i was missing from the bottle.
T: Thick bourbon and chocolate followed by a nice sweetness.
M: Full. coats the mouth well.
O: outstanding on draft. Compared to the bottle, this is night and day. an A+ barleywine. If any bars advertise having this on draft, absolutely check it out. 1,362 charactersSarge3130, Dec 24, 2013

A: Pours a menacing dark brown. Tall, fizzy and very dark brown head. Head fizzes out pretty fast. Decent retention at least. No lacing.
S: Huge and sweet caramel and toffee notes. Dark, heavy bread and some light chocolate. Toasted sugars in there. Decadent and sweet for sure.
T: Again, overloaded with sweet toasted sugar and caramel. Less so toffee. Quite a bit of dark fruits show up here, lots of raisin, dates and prunes. Even plums maybe? Some oak in the finish with a little vanilla. More heavy caramel in the finish and aftertaste. Lots of chocolate comes out to play once fully up to room temperature. 
M: Low carbonation, heavy and sweet. Borderline cloying but the bourbon cuts it just enough.
O: Well, if you're looking for a top-of-the-line barrel-aged english barleywine, this pretty much stands at the top along with Sucaba. Thick, heavy, viscous, and super sweet. Bourbon cuts it just enough to help the drinkability, but doesn't overpower the great maltiness. Drink this one warm. 1,042 charactersDope, Dec 24, 2013
4.29/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25I was very excited to try this beer since Bourbon County Stout and Bourbon County Coffee are my top two favorite beers. This one unfortunately fell short of my expectations.
This was thicker and darker in the glass than any barleywine I have ever seen. It was had a very heavy bourbon nose to it, very similar to the stouts in this series. So it was definitely off to a promising start. 
The taste was very sweet and was a mix of dark fruits and candy. Surprisingly the bourbon taste was very muted and almost non-existent. This was where I started to be disappointed in this beer as I expected a more bourbon-forward flavor. I will say that the sweetness follows suite with what I expect from an English Barleywine since so many barleywines seem to blur the lines between what the American and English versions are supposed to be. 
After the aforementioned BCBS and BCBCS, Bourbon Barrel Barleywine by Central Waters is my next highest rated beer. This beer fell short when compared to what I think is the gold standard in barrel aged barleywines.
This beer was really good if not great. I will certainly buy it again if Goose Island makes it again. It just fell short of the high expectations they have set from their other Bourbon County offerings. 1,255 charactersmjpolzin, Dec 24, 2013

Molasses, vanilla, sweet spice, bourbon, red licorice, dark fruits, burnt brown sugar and caramel. 
Flavors are similar as well; it's sweet, but not overwhelmingly so. Definitely hot on the booze, more prominent here than in the smell.
Mouthfeel is smooth and slightly carbonated. 
Overall this is a unique and special rendition of a barleywine, and one that I believe would benefit from some aging. Luckily I have a second bottle to sit on for awhile. 637 charactersrodlavers, Dec 23, 2013

Pours a chocolate brown color with half a finger of head that dissipated very quickly. The nose is distinctly bourbon-like. The flavor profile is hearty and malty with bourbon notes present throughout. A hint of maple syrup is present. The bourbon remains a complimentary flavor that never becomes overwhelming. The finish is sweet with a touch of alcohol burn (but nothing unpleasant). The mouthfeel is sticky.
This might be a perfect example of the barleywine style. 613 characters57md, Dec 23, 2013

Had aromas of various dark fruits, mainly dates and somewhat plumbs, caramel, butterscotch, vanilla, light wood and even lighter alcohol. Taste is very sweet and the mouthfeel is thick, this drinks like melted butterscotch candies. While this may be very thick, it has a low amount of carbonation and it goes down very smooth. The lingering aftertaste of butterscotch and vanilla feel like they are coating my mouth, and they linger for eternity.
Overall: I love it! I think Goose Island has done quite a good job with their bourbon barrel aging. I like the vanilla and caramel flavors that come out of the barrel, but I don't like straight bourbon flavors. This brew is a great example of that. 806 charactersoffthelevel_bytheplumb, Dec 23, 2013

Appearance: Pours a thick opaque brown. Minimal head that quickly fades away, leaving a deep black body. 
Smell: It smells really really pleasant, though maybe not as complex as I was expecting. The prominent notes are bourbon and booze. Also there are wood, sugary grain, and and some fruit, almost like a sweet cake with whiskey sauce. 
Taste: Smooth and sweet. The first sips are dominates by bourbon, molasses, wood, and alcohol. The hop profile is fairly minimal. Lingering in the background there is a lot of fruit: dates and maybe even sugar plums? As it warms, it starts to resemble a fine cognac: sweet, chewy, and warm. 
Mouthfeel: Very nice carbonation and a thick, chewy, oily body. The beer coats your tongue and the finish goes on forever. 
Overall: A very excellent and well balance barrel-aged barley wine. It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but it delivers what it promises. Definitely one to sit with over the course of the weekend. 1,010 charactersweltywm, Dec 23, 2013

Appeared supremely dark brown with shades of plum and a short mocha head that dissipated quickly. This could be easily confused for a big, imperial stout and I actually checked with the waitress to make sure I wasn't served BCBS, which was also on tap.
The nose is sweet and concentrated, delivering whiffs of licorice, molasses and chocolate.
The palate abounds with rich complexity, including big notes of golden raisin, plum, apple, vanilla, chocolate and licorice. Shares a lot of Belgian quad flavors and characteristics, minus the Belgian yeast of course. Some faint char/smoke is also detectable, along with a touch of bourbon. Cool hops and alcohol at the edges of the big, sweet center. Chocolate lingers in a way you wouldn't expect from a barleywine, but then again this isn't your everyday barleywine.
Huge mouthfeel for a barleywine. Again, bordering on an imperial stout, but sticky and slick with alcohol. Very round mouthfeel, like bouyantly round.
Overall - It's very sweet, and I'm typically not a fan of overly sweet beers, but this one brings enough rich complexity to keep things very interesting. Alcohol is barely perceived, and when it is, it's a nice cool flavor element. Absolutely delicious. 1,313 charactersMongrel, Dec 21, 2013

Pours a very rich brownish-black with slightly translucent brown edges. Aggressive pours yields half-finger head that immediately dissipates to a very thin ring around the edge of the glass.
Aroma: Rich, old, candied fruit notes, woodiness, vanilla, bourbon.
Taste: All the notes from the nose are present, but blend into each other exquisitely. Bourbon character is more noticeable, alcohol is perceptible. Faint note of chocolate in there somewhere. Finishes long, with wood and old fruit flavors.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, light carbonation. Very smooth.
Overall: Outstanding. Bourbon character perfectly complements this barleywine. Beautiful, complex, amazingly smooth. 723 charactersjhawth, Dec 21, 2013

Is this for real right now?  Poured a beautiful burgundy color, the smells of BCBS hit first, followed by dates, figs, vanilla, soft oak, brown sugar, and molasses waft through the glass.  First sip is a carnival of flavors, so many crazy things going on, yet somehow all seemingly in place and doing exactly what they should.  The initial sip introduces the slightest hint of the bourbon county stout, followed by an sweetness of dried fruits and toffee.  Continuing down the road as the beer warmed up, I found the oak and vanilla to come forward, with some fig preserves and brown sugar coming through as well.  For the price of 5 bucks for a 12 ouncer, I can say I’d buy a case of it easy.  13% is well hidden, so well in fact that I didn’t detect any alcohol.  This is certainly a sweet rich beer, and I’m excited to see what a few years of age will do. 875 characterstaylor714914, Dec 20, 2013

A- Pours dark burnt orange. Turns black in the glass. A small quickly dissipating head. Strong alcohol legs.
S- A big roasted malt and a good balance of bourbon. Sweet coffee, burnt sugar.
T- A big roasted malt off the bat. A charred oak flavor as well as burnt sugar. A noticeable alcohol flavor which actually helps balance the massive flavors. The bourbon is fairly strong for second use barrels. There is a lot of the boubon county stout left over in this beer; roasted malt, chocolate and char. 
M- Thick and gives a sticky mouth feel. Bourbon aftertaste. Strong alcohol presence.
O- An awesome addition to the line up. A very similar taste to the regular stout from the barrels and the barley wine base is a great one to build off of. 780 charactersTwelveOunces, Dec 20, 2013

Taste isn't nearly as sweet as the nose, which is pleasing to my palate. Some vanilla oakiness upfront into a bit of bourbon and dark fruits, with a dry / leathery / tobacco finish which lingers on the tongue. Creamy mouthfeel, light carbonation. Definitely drinkable, alcohol is fairly well hidden considering the ABV.
I am not a fan of barleywines, rarely like what I try (even those well regarded). I do like this quite a bit, as the characteristics I tend to hate about BW's aren't present (overly sweet, caramel / butterscotch, abundance of hops). I could drink this on occasion, and glad I was able to try it! 809 charactersprdstmnky, Dec 20, 2013

Appearance: Pours thick, almost syrupy into my new belgium globe glass. Half finger of dark tan head forms. Beer is almost black with just some hint of maroon. Head is sticking around longer than expected with the high abv. Not much lacing.
Smell: Bourbon, chocolate, raisins, figs, sweet. Smells like a hybrid between a stout and a barleywine to me with no aspect overpowering any of the others.
Taste: Sweet dark fruits slowly meld into a ever so slight tart raspberry flavor that lingers on the palate. Lots going on here with many flavors slowly working across your palate with each sip. Toffee, vanilla, bite of alcohol, cocoa, raisins.
Mouthfeel: excellent, thick, sticky has a tendency to kind of foam in your mouth in a good way. really brings all the flavors across nicely.
Overall, the best barleywine I have ever tried. Quite delicious but to me also seems really similar to a quality quad, at least right now in the early going. 986 charactersbennett_loves_good_beer, Dec 20, 2013

Served in a snifter. Deep, dark brown color, a short, stout head of tan receded to a thick ringlet, leaving maybe just a few oily spots of lacing on the glass. Aroma was expectedly malt-heavy, caramel and brown sugar, more burnt and less smooth than I expected, based on my experiences with King Henry. In the taste, burnt caramel, bourbon, heavy with earthy oak, dark fruits, and a strange herbal bitterness that lasted right through to the end, somewhat detracting from the sweet smoothness that I like in the "big boy" barleywines. Hmm. There was a tiny reprise of sweetness giving a slick finish. Body on the heavier side of medium, but not as fleshed out as I would have liked. Came off kind of messy and immature, so maybe it just still needs some time. Disappointing in the end, but I'll let my bottles sit for a while and revisit them in several months.
*Note: this DOES significantly improve with time. About 4.25 rating after 8-12 months aging. 1,006 charactersRifugium, Dec 19, 2013

Pour is all sort of fresh-churned clay riverbank, carbonation is fairly low, as expected. For third-use bourbon barrels, this brew has all kinds of nose on it: thick bourbon & vanilla, ticklings of heat, molasses, toffee, caramel, heavy hand of sherry. You name a (positive) barleywine trait, it's lurking in here someplace. 
Bourbon County Brand Barleywine lives up to the hype & then does a triple-axel right over it. Gorgeous dose of bourbon & vanilla right up front sets a kick-ass tone, & there's so much sherry it has to be a kissing cousin. Mid-palate, just like the nose, is littered with minor triumps: toffee/caramel, mild alcohol nip, brown sugar mixed in with the molasses, plums, & I'm pretty sure I glimpsed a Grammy Award in there somewhere. Finishes with a tumbled impression of complexity that defies an easy summation. Thick enough to stick an upright spoon into, & drinks like it, though I'm hammering this like it's 4PM session-time. 
I was prepared to be let down & now I'm all grinny. Not a chink in its armor, this is a masterpiece. If I'd have known, I'd have been hunting this one down with an elephant gun. Wow. Off to enjoy. 1,348 charactersmaximum12, Dec 19, 2013
4.78/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a bottle into a Lost Abbey Teku. The pour is very dark, but not opaque. It's a clear ruby-tinted mahogany and, when held to the light, you can see through it. It sports a very thin tan head that doesn't last long. This beer has a fantastic nose. I get dark fruit, figs and raisins primarily, but I also get lots of sweet toffee, vanilla, a hint of chocolate, and some bourbon. It's not as strong as I expected it to be, but what it lacks in strength it makes up for in sheer complexity and delight. The nose has the complexity of a top-shelf quad.
Full body, slick, oily feel, and an incredibly intense, sweet flavor. It is not as bourbon-forward as I thought it would be. Instead, the focus is on the malt and the bourbon is simply cast in a supporting role, allowing the beer to remain incredibly smooth and drinkable. Toffee-like notes up front coat your tongue with a layer of caramel-like sweetness. Then, that bourbon starts to flare up a bit, but it doesn't get hot and boozy at all and, again, the bourbon doesn't really seem to dominate (at least, to me it doesn't). It stimulates the palate and adds spice, oak, vanilla, and a rich, creamy complexity to that foundation of intense sweetness. The flavors continue to develop towards the back of the palate, as sarsaparilla, molasses, and candied fruit join in. The finish is warm, sweet, and lingering. Hats off to Goose Island for putting this in 12oz bottles too. It's so rich and flavorful, it might take one person 2 or 3 days to drink a bomber. This is a sipper of the highest order. A little goes a long way.
I am a big fan of bourbon-barrel-aged English barleywines. In fact, I might even like them more than bourbon-barrel-aged imperial stouts. The combination of sweet, toffee-like malt and rich bourbon is hard to beat. Unfortunately, very few breweries that I have access to produce them so I've only had a couple of them. The bottom line is that they do not compare to this one. This is one of those beers where you think to yourself ``I wish Michael Jackson, the beer hunter, could have tried this. What would he think of it?'' I think I know what he'd say - that this is simply a masterpiece of the brewer's art. 2,199 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Dec 19, 2013

S: Bourbon, roast, chocolate, boozy, some dark fruits in there too. 
T: The biggest difference in the taste comparing this to the regular BCBS is the after taste. Up front it is very similar with loads of bourbon and chocolate, but later it lingers with the darker fruits I pick up in the aroma. Very delicious. 
M: Thick, low carb.
O: While I love every beer I've had in the BCBS line, this is at the bottom of the list. That being said, I guessed this would be the case just due to the nature of barleywines. Delicious, yet I'm comparing it to the original. 684 charactersroger617, Dec 19, 2013

S: Toasted coconut, a slight berry note, burnt caramel, toffee, slight earthy hop note and bourbon. 
T: Heavy sticky caramel right off the bat. Milk chocolate, burnt raisin, charred wood, toasted coconut. Finish of bourbon, burnt brown sugar and oak. A very good barleywine, but I don't think it's in the same class as Sucaba or Mother of All Storms. 421 charactersnotchucknorris, Dec 18, 2013

Bottled 9/24/13.
Pours a clear dark orange-brown with a foamy khaki head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of malt, caramel, toffee, brown sugar, bourbon, and alcohol aromas. Taste is much the same with vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, and bourbon flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of woody bitterness and an alcohol kick on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a great bourbon presence even though the barrels were third use for the barrel aging process. 738 charactersUCLABrewN84, Dec 18, 2013

Pours a dark, almost stout-like brown. No much head or visible carbonation.
Smells boozy and very sweet. Brown sugar, caramel and toffee also dominate.
Incredible array of tastes. Brown sugar, burnt caramelized sugar, toffee, chocolate, intense malty sweetness, coconut, bourbon and medicinal alcohol. The alcohol is very present, and along with the intense malt sweetness, makes it hard to do much more than lightly sip this beer. You'll be happier to take your time though.
Sticky, resinous viscous mouthfeel- feels like Bourbon County Brand Stout's mouthfeel for sure. Makes sense because this beer is aged in third use barrels that once held BCBS.
An excellent barleywine that is intensely and syrupy sweet. Not for everybody, but for those who like thick barleywines as meals, you'll love it. 843 charactersGreesyFizeek, Dec 18, 2013

Very similar to the original - chocolate malt, bourbon and vanilla, some oak, packing heat.
Ink/ Jet/ Asphalt/ Ebony/ Midnight/ Coal/ Sable black.
The difference here is the Barleywine brings more sweet. More chocolate malt, brown sugar. Think 80% BCBS/ 20% Lagunitas Brown Sugga. Still has the signature bourbon-vanilla taste that is synonymous with the Bourbon County Brand.
Mouthfeel is similar to BCBS - thick, silky, syrupy but sweeter. More honey sweet. Not as smooth as the Coffee or even probably the original. Maybe slightly lighter than the original as well. Limited carbonation.
Excellent Barleywine. Excellent variant. One of the better variants, but not as good as the coffee.
I wish had a case more of this stuff. 793 charactersSlothB77, Dec 17, 2013

A - Pours a very deep brown fading into black. Could see flecks of a dark red on the initial pour. Slightly lighter than standard BC varieties but could pass as a stout on a quick glance. Decent bit more head than BCBS, still dissipates quite quickly.
S - Licorice, burnt caramel, toffee. Quite pleasant and fairly strong. 
T - Definitely a pronounced sweetness, but not cloying. There is a hint of anise, fading into a slight orange zest and finishing with a smooth caramel. 
M - A bit sticky, not quite as smooth as the stout. Seems a bit more carbed as well. Appropriate for the style.
O - A great entry into the BC family. Doesn't present the barrel as much as the other variants, but remains a pinnacle of the style and supremely drinkable over a nice drawn out period. As with most of the series, drinking it over time really is the way to enjoy its complexities as the glass warms. I think my personal tastes still prefer the stout, but this is equal in terms of execution. 1,007 charactersBKBassist, Dec 17, 2013

A: Deep chestnut brown. The tan head is knocked out almost as soon as the pour ends. Small, spotty lacing.
S: Dark caramel, molasses, malt syrup, tootsie rolls. Wildberry and sweet cherry esters. Whiff of bourbon and faint wood.
T: Wave of chewy dark caramel. Fudgey tootsie roll tastes. Over the top sweetness. Blackstrap molasses. Brown sugar. Berry esters. Bourbon and faint wood build toward the back end, but are still no match for the malt sweetness. Blackstrap molasses and faint bourbon on the finish.
M: Huge syrupy malt body. Thick, round, and smooth in a slick sort of way. Warming alcohol. Little to no carbonation.
O: I may be in the minority here, but this was just too much for me. As with everything in the Bourbon County series, this beer has a massive malt body. However, there is no attempt at balance, and the malt sweetness is allowed to run amok. It builds to near sickly, cloying levels. At times it feels as though I'm drinking straight molasses. Even a bourbon barrel is no match, and it slowly drowns in all the sweetness. I was ready to be done halfway through the bottle. Not worth the hype or the price tag at all. 1,189 charactersryan1788a5, Dec 17, 2013

A: Same as before. Black with tinges of mahogany in the light
S: Deep and complex. Dark fruits, chocolate, musty, some port type aromas
T: Lots of sweet toffee with some dark fruits playing around, vanilla on the back some. so well blended and the added age prevents you from ever knowing that this ever spent time in bourbon barrels. No booze, not distinct bourbon taste or smell
F: Excellent. Thick. Coating
O: Nearly 4 years in and this is an excellent beer. Idk if I will be able to wait the full 5 yrs. Not sure if it will be worth it. This is an excellent beer with lots of toffee and some dark cherry playing in the back. Totally different than fresh. 766 characterstigerbeer90, Dec 16, 2013

Pours a very dark muddy brown, nearly black. You can see the yeast sediment floating around when looking closely, but impossible to see through the other side of the glass, even when held up to the sun. Almost no head, just a bit of foam that has moved to a thin ring on the sides of the glass, moderate carbonation and good lacing 
Smells of strong bourbon, oak, toffee, toasted brown sugar and molasses, caramel and hints of vanilla and chocolate, finishes with a nice splash of alcohol. Very complex and sweet, reminds me a lot of sucaba
Taste of oak and dark chocolate chocolate, bourbon, roast toffee and butterscotch, molasses and vanilla, with a boozy caramel finish. Deviates from the nose a bit but tastes pretty much just as good
Feel is a very thick heavy body, very sticky and syrupy. Alcohol is hidden pretty well but still drinks a little warm. Perfect for the winter
Overall a near flawless representation of a BBA English barley wine. Can't wait to open the rest a few years down the road, here's to hoping this becomes a regular in the bcb line up! 1,115 characterslordofstarside, Dec 15, 2013

A - Very dark and murky with deep amber highlights around the edge. The slightest cap forms and leaves a ring around the edge of the glass. Small beads of lacing fade away after a bit.
S - Wonderful blend of sweet malts, dark fruit, bourbon, and vanilla. Molasses, maple and brown sugar covered figs. Intoxicating aroma. 
T - Oh so tasty. Sweet vanilla bourbon and malty sweetness. Figs drizzled in maple, brown sugar and molasses. Caramel and faint chocolate notes are hidden in the back. 
M - Very, very smooth with a soft mouthfeel. Heavier body, but lacking in carbonation. Creates a velvety presence in the mouth. 
O - An amazing barrel aged barleywine. Hopefully it won't ruin others that I try. 755 charactersRi0, Dec 15, 2013

Expectations are sky-high given its current 100 rating and my past experiences with Bourbon County Brand Stout. 12.1% ABV confirmed. Bottled 17 Sep 13. 
Served chilled and allowed to come to room temperature. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. 
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured. 
Pours a half finger head of khaki colour which recedes fully inside of ten seconds. That's a bit disappointing. Based on its brief appearance, the head was fairly creamy and nicely thick. No lacing, but it does leave a cognac-esque clear streak on the sides of the glass when you tilt it. I've seen that before in boozy beers like Utopias, and it's an effect I quite like. 
Body colour is a dark murky opaque brown. Not real vibrant or open, but certainly distinguished. No floating yeast particles are visible. I'm looking forward to trying it. Not unique, but the boozy legs make it special to me. There are no egregious flaws here. 
Sm: English oak, bourbon-derived vanilla, soaked wood barrel notes, dark malts, and some pleasant boozy notes that evoke a fine liquor. Sherry wine, maybe prunes or dates, some type of leather, and English brown malts. 
I do worry that the barrel is overwhelming the base beer. It's not unique or special, and I did expect better, but I'm optimistic. 
No yeast character or hop character is detectable. 
T: The duration of flavour is quite brief, with average depth and intensity of flavour for the style. Tobacco, rich raisin, prunes/dates, a leathery note, sherry wine, well-integrated oak, faint vanilla, and soaked wood. Marshmallow. Caramel. Some faint wet cardboard notes are present - indicative almost of oxidation. The bourbon isn't as fully developed or complementary here as it is in bourbon county brand stout. Certainly on the sweeter side. 
Pretty well balanced for what it is. The build is nowhere near as complex or subtle as I expected given it's a bourbon county brew. 
Constructively, it seems like the base beer wasn't all that great to begin with, and the beer relies on the bourbon barrel as a crutch rather than a means of accentuating already present characteristics. Additionally, amplitude is quite low - the flavours don't blend together seamlessly but rather feel distinct and separate. The whole is not more than the sum of its parts. 
Mf: Coarser and more dry than anticipated. Rough; it drags on the palate. Very chewy. Thick and full-bodied. A biteen syrupy. It's got what I'd call a pleasant boozy warmth. Well-carbonated. 
Not oily, gushed, or astringent. 
Dr: She's a sipper, alright. It demands to be appreciated with care. It's an armchair beer. I'm glad I have a few more bottles, but this isn't amongst the best in the style. A solid barleywine across the board, but I'm not sure I'll buy it again. I was ready to love this when I opened it, but unfortunately the execution wasn't quite up to par with Goose Island's best offerings.

T: Dark fruit, sweet malt, some hops and hints of bourbon and alcohol. As it warms, I actually get some chocolate as well, quite well done.
M: Medium to full bodied with low carbonation and insane drinkability for its size. The alcohol comes through but does not deter, this is way too easy drinking at 12%.

I controlled myself. 32oz for $23? You're damn right if if an take home on draft. Poured 5oz at a time into a mini pinnochio's beer garden snifter. I can't be the only who enjoys small (albeit frequent) pours, can I? Sorry, this isn't a forum! 
Appearance is the darkest brown in the history of dark browns. Almost black, but a brownie colored glint when it hits the light. Getting excited.
Smell is like a boozier BCBS, with big bourbon, definite underlying pit fruit sweetness. Little concerned about the heat....
Taste is spectacular! Soooo smooth. None of the heat from the nose at all. Wow. 12+% done proper! Big bourbon followed by the dark fruit. No lingering alcohol presence. 
Mouthfeel, along the lines of the taste- smooth, big dark fruit. 
Overall, this is a stellar beer. Thrilled to have 6 bottles down in my "cellar" (aka, the 16 sealed cardboard boxes in the unfinished section of my basement!) because this will be an absolute treasure in a year or two. 1,069 charactersnuggetlover, Dec 15, 2013

4.36/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.512oz bottle with a Bottled On date of 24Sep13. Pours a murky dark brownish color with no head. The aroma is a big whiff of bourbon with some dark fruits, earth, dark cherries, and maybe a hint of vanilla. The taste is bourbon upfront that mellows a bit and gives way to the dark cherries and earth. Plums, raisins and malts. Almost has a faint cola taste in the background, maybe even Cherry Coke. Warming alcohol with earth and dark cherries at the end. This one wasn't as boozey as I expected it to be, but there is certainly a big alcohol presence. Slick but heavy mouthfeel. When I heard there was going to be a Bourbon County Barleywine I was pumped. It did not disappoint. Overall, amazing. 696 charactersPicoPapa, Dec 15, 2013

S- Boozey right off the bat, but incredibly complex. Dark fruits, oak, vanilla, dark malts, darker stout malts, and a little char. Layer upon layer of scents here. Both the barrel's characteristics and the flavors left behind from the stout aged prior are noticeable and dominant.
T- Starts off with a bang of dark fruits and dark barleywine malts then moves immediately into showing off its barrel aging. Lots of charred oak, giving a somewhat smokey flavor profile, along with some sweet vanilla. The stout flavors start to kick in a little more after that, and the beer briefly tastes very much like its older brother. Some brown sugar sweetness on the end lingers with some bitter alcohol.
M- Thick and smooth with some burn on the end. Moderate to relatively high level of carbonation. This is a sipper because of both its heavy flavor profile and the alcohol. Definitely a warming sensation on the way down.
Overall, this is a terrifically complex beer. Really a hybrid beer here with all of the stout characteristics. A very interesting and well done beer. 1,268 charactersboilermakerbrew, Dec 15, 2013

Smells is bourbon and oak, with vanilla, toffee, caramel, dark fruits, very nice.
Taste is akin to the nose with bourbon barrel character present but not overly bourbon-y. Nice barrel notes of vanilla, toffee, caramel, and oak. Balanced and drinkable.
Mouthfeel is medium, low-medium carbonation, smooth, sticky.
Overall this is a great bourbon barrel aged barleywine, I'll be enjoying this again soon for sure. 479 charactersMCain04, Dec 14, 2013

Aroma, Sherry, vanilla, caramel. Toasted malt, raisin, some oaky wood.
Taste, The malty toffee, oak and vanilla are huge. Yellow raisin and big sherry notes, big bourbon barrel notes. The alcohol is really well managed here.
Mouth coating near full body. A fine carbonation is very present, though you could barely tell from the pour. Drinks ridiculously easy for the size.
Big in all aspects. Tough to do much better than this. Up there with Arctic Devil for best I've had. Have not had any of the more recent "best of the best" however.
Those calling this too sweet are stuck thinking American is the only barleywine type. This is as it should be. 737 charactersBung, Dec 14, 2013

4.99/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a Bourbon County snifter from a 12oz bottle.
Pours a nice murky dark mahogany brown. There is a nice light tan cream colored head that forms that is pretty dense but recedes fairly quickly. Very little lacing is left around the glass.
Aroma is delicious. Strong notes of figs and dates amongst other rich and sweet dark fruits. Notes of boozy bourbon are present. Sweet caramel notes slight rich tobacco notes can also be perceived int eh notes. Juicy jam notes are present, blackberry and grape jam notes in my mind. There is some underlying notes of wood that bring in some vanilla notes and some nice slight spice.
Flavor is slightly different than the nose would indicate. Its less jammy. There is some nice notes of deep dark and rich caramel with intense dark fruit notes. The sweetness is so big and intense and soooo rich yet it does not overwhelm and keeps you coming back fro more. The middle of the brew yields some more notes of boozy sweetness and that transitions into some nice vanilla and woody notes. The flavor profile of this brew is magnificent. The flavors are some well blended together and ply off each other so well. The body is magnificently rich and mouth coating.
Overall GI always impresses with these brews. The BCBS series is popular for a reason. This iteration is delicious. Flavors are so well crafted and work so well together in a seamless concoction of delicious sweet rich caramel and dark fruit notes. (slow cap) 1,466 charactersJoEBoBpr, Dec 14, 2013

4.45/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5I purchased this particular bottle in a four pack $6 per 12oz at wegmans, enjoyed cellar temp in stemmed glass.
The color is the deepest shade of tobacco brown with mostly opaque clarity, cascade when poured with thick crema type head which recedes to a ring of ultra fine beads with carbonation visibly rising toward the surface. The smell is rich with malt aromas - toffee and sherry-like scents meld with bourbon, vanilla and light cocoa and the woody ester blends with the dark caramel but the alcohol is very mild, actually it is almost not apparent at all. This barleywine is dense with malt and sweet but not cloying with light fruity yeast elements like fig -chewy bot still moderately dry with mild carbonation and woody tannin in the finish.
 This is seriously complex! whew, I knew it wood be good -har har, but the rich toffee flavor with some vanilla notes of the barrel combine to bring a really delicious full flavor which leads to a tangy yeast fruitiness again bringing a fig-like richness to mind with a toasted oak goodness rounding out the taste with slight cocoa with gentle nutty creaminess toward the end. There is a slight alcohol taste but nowhere near 12%, it is hidden very well and halfway in it is not showing any heat or bourbon taste, yet the barrel influence is apparent. Overall I was not sure what to expect except the stout that previously resided in the barrels may have added to the flavor. I recommend this to anyone who considers themselves a fan of the style...I only wish I had purchased more - Kudos on a phenomenal beer that exceeded my expectations Goose Island! 1,608 charactersSlatetank, Dec 13, 2013

Smells of bourbon notes along with some sweet caramel notes.
Tastes of the sweet caramel notes with bourbon on top. Malts lead off with caramel, brown sugar, toffee, and vanilla. Dark fruit notes come through with figs and raisins adding to the mix. This is then backed up by bourbon notes with oak and vanilla. Fairly boozy, but it adds to the bourbon feel. Ends with a bit of earthy and herbal hops.
Mouthfeel is full with a smooth amount of carbonation.
Overall, this is great and I am glad I finally got to try it. 613 charactersocelot2500, Dec 13, 2013

A- Pours a beautiful 2 finger mocha brown head, dissipates to a nice thick ring around the glass. Nice lacing that sticks to the sides. The color is dark dark brown. Almost black. No light is shining through this one. 
S- You get your typical barley wine characteristics, carmel, brown sugar, malt, slight dark fruit notes, plum, raisin. The bourbon comes in nicely but does not overpower the aroma. 
T- The taste is very nice. The bourbon is more upfront then in the nose. Yum, i just want to keep sipping at this one. Buttery bourbon right away, sweet dark fruit as well, raisin and plum, brown sugar, molasses. This is a perfect winter beer. The alcohol is very hidden for being 12%, wow is this easy to drink, which equals very dangerous.
M- Big mouthfeel, full beer, rich as well, coats the palate. Goes down very smooth. 
O- Very impressed. Goose Island does no wrong in my eyes when it comes to their bourbon barrel aged beers. I never tried King Henry so cannot compare to that one. I love this beer, glad i have a couple more to age and compare later on. 1,110 charactersChriscrundwell12, Dec 12, 2013

Appearance - So, I wasn't aware of the third-use bourbon barrels, so when it came out almost black, I was surprised. For a second, I wondered if they had just labeled the tap incorrectly. At any rate, it was a dark rum and walnut black with the slightest dark brown hints at the very edges of the glass. Head is minimal--a three-quarters finger of creamy tan head that dissipates quickly, leaving nothing but a thin rim of fine foam around the edge.
Smell - Quickly erases any doubt (from the color) that this is a barleywine. An intoxicating blend of molasses, fresh barley and rye, vanilla and a maple woodiness and bourbon underlying all of it.
Taste - Again, the barleywine aspect comes through strong, maple syrup, malty sweetness, brown sugar and molasses, bourbon glaze, and some esters and tannins to cut the thickness More bitter elements like roasted malt, faint baker's chocolate, burnt caramel also cut the sweetness and even some dark fruit elements figs and dates provide yet more complexity. It's tasty at the chilled temperature they served it at, but only gets more enticing and deep as it warms. I know it's a little bit out there for the style, but this might be the best barleywine I've ever had.
Mouthfeel - It's cloying and clings to the inside of the mouth like cough syrup, but with 12% alcohol, you're better off sipping one of these over a few minutes anyway. As long as you come in expecting a night cap or dessert style beer, it's not a problem. However, I certainly wouldn't be drinking this chewy masterpiece out by the pool or on a float trip.
Overall, I'm just blown away by this beer. I've had the standard BCBS before, but never any of the variants. The third-use bourbon barrels impart some characteristics of the stout and really bring a fascinating and wonderful dimension to this beer. It's one of those that you try and are so blown away by the experience that can't wait to share the details. Would be ecstatic to somehow get my hands on a bottle of this. 2,205 charactersLambicPentameter, Dec 12, 2013

S: The smell is that of thick layers of malt and oak with the malt bring caramel, toffee, some bready notes and a moderate level chocolate while the moderately strong oak brings cinnamon and bourbon barrel character to the party. There are some fruit esters of raisins and a little orange. A floral, moderate alcohol sweetness noted.
T: The alcohol and malt dominate but are closely followed by the oak barrel notes and some chocolate flavors. The malt brings a medium sweetness with toffee character set against a medium-low hops bitterness giving a balance that is somewhat sweet. There are also coffee, raisin and light citrus flavors in there. The finish is sweet with a chocolate, oak and coffee aftertaste.
A full bodied beer with a moderately-low level of carbonation and a fair amount of warmth.
O: My first impression was if the beer taste half as good as it smells it's going to be pretty awesome and it is. Hovering somewhere in that land between Barleywine and stout the dark malt brings a nice chocolate character to the beer. It's a sweet beer but not enough to keep me from enjoying two in an sitting; the abv will do that for me. 1,357 charactersMadScientist, Dec 10, 2013

4.5/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Bottle off the shelves of Gator Beverage. Didn’t think I had a chance to find it in stores after I missed Black Friday. Pours a dark murky brown with a ring of yellow brown head. Aroma of big chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, broen sugar, oak, some figs. Wow, maybe the best smelling of the style I have encountered. The stout influence is present with big chocolate notes up front. Flavor is a medley of chocolate covered figs up front with plenty of bourbon, but the booze is much more subdued than the stout. A second wave of flavor comes with a nutty vanilla caramel that coats the palate. Incredible lingering flavor. The booze is there and warming but this drinks pretty easy. Low carbonation with a very full body a bit short of viscous. Sweet but very balanced and not cloying at all. As I sip more, the fruit character begins to come out with nutty raisins and fig with a good bit of brown sugar and molasses. So glad I have a few more of these on the way! Lived up to my expectations. This would be perfect for my tastes if it had a bit more of the caramel and vanilla that hung around and less of the fruit character, but that is seriously nitpicking. (4.81)
2014 bottle poured on day on purchase Black Friday. Look and smell is similar, but this does not seem to have the rich chocolateyness of last year. Still a nice BA Barleywine, but the thing that really distinguished this before was the clear chocolatey stout influence from the third use barrels. Much less present here and more on the figs and brown sugar side, with a dryness and thinner feeling that I generally am not a huge fan of in barleywines (similar to what I get from Backwoods Bastard). This is totally different. Still yummy, but a shell of the amazing beer it was in 2013. (4.09)
2015 bottle reminiscent of the 2014 version, just not quite living up to that original 2013 decadence. Still nice. (4.15)
Another bottle of the 2015 and this one is full on sour. Too bad. Won't downgrade because normally a really nice brew. Hopefully doesn't happen next year. (2.25)
Official rating splits the middle of my non-sour ones. 2,103 charactersBMMillsy, Dec 10, 2013

5/5  rDev +11.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I didn't expect to get any of this beer. My schedule didn't allow for much truck chasing and even though I've greatly enjoyed the Bourbon Counties, maybe I didn't love them enough to fight the GI Zombies and alter my life. Providence brought me and this beer together. After getting to Lansing, instead of going to the office, I thought "what the heck, let's see if Big Ten Oades has any Black Friday leftovers". And what do you know, thanks to a cancellation, a mix four-pack was all mine. 
And what a break that turned out to be! While it might be too sweet for some, sweet is AOK with me. Combined with the typical Appalaichan-holler amount of bourbon GI provides, it's a sweet, brawling, suckerpunching shot of perfection. 
Pitch perfect this shit is. The best beer I've had, and the first 5 I've ever issued (although Heady would have got one if it wasn't so ugly). I've heard GI Zombies say "yeah, it's good, but it's no King Henry". Not sure how King Henry could improve much on this....but the possibility that it does sure is appealing. 1,047 characterslurpy1, Dec 09, 2013
4.47/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 12 oz. bottle from the initial release. Chilled and poured into my Cigar City tulip glass and enjoyed over about half an hour. Big thanks to Centennial for the hookup.
Appearance: Dark cola brown in color without much retention. Plenty of carbonation but the head is almost nonexistent.
Aroma: Caramel, toffee with a nice bourbon presence throughout. Lots of marshmallow and vanilla really add another layer to the base. Really nice balance throughout as the bourbon is really subdued.
Taste: Dark fruits, caramel and toffee make a nice base beer, but the barrel notes still come through and dominate. Some vanilla, marshmallow and oak tones come through from the barrel as well. A light, bitter dry cocoa powder finish on the end that's a bit reminiscent of the original Bourbon County. Definitely a product of the third use barrels.
Mouthfeel: A bit on the thin side for this type of barleywine, but still has some body. Plenty of carbonation.
Overall, a really tasty bourbon barrel barleywine. The barrel presence is strong but there is also a bit of a stout finish. The barrel flavors are great, but the base beer is a bit thin and feels like it could use more body and substance, but that's only nitpicking. This is pretty spot on. 1,255 charactersGosox8787, Dec 09, 2013

A - It pours a solid burnished russet. Alcohol meansvirtually no head, only a tan halo. 
S - Good lord! Everything awesome in the world is in this nose. Vanilla, honeysuckle, dates, toffee, smoke tobacco, licorice, blackberry and boot leather. Musty and sweet, this is a baroque compilation.
T -The bourbon bomb one expects from this series, but this isn’t the razor-sheer of booze you get with the stout. This is smooth and lovingly integrated with the dried fruit and baking chocolate. There’s even some coffee hanging around in the back, and the aftertaste is caramel and stewed plum.
M - Sticky and chewy. Naturally, its thinner than BCBS, but not by much.
O - Lighter and fruitier than the stout, this is a monster beer but not stupefying. Might be my favorite of the Goose Island Bourbon County beers. Definitely my favorite European style barleywine by a mile. 984 charactersTheCuriograph, Dec 09, 2013

Smell: bourbon and alcohol. good amount of sweetness, from vanilla and toffee. a distinct hop kick in it. 
Taste: huge bourbon with very astringent alcohol. strong oak flavor. sometimes a grainy barley comes through. lots of vanilla throughout. resiny hops come in the back. a very complex beer i really like the barley taste coming through all the other layers
Mouthfeel: thick and syrupy. very sticky and huge alcohol warmth
Overall: this is a good and complex beer. i like the use of older barrels to give the barleywine some room to shine. overall i'd say the alcohol is a bit too strong and it takes away from the beer.

What a beautiful beer. Dark murky brown verging on black. Dark red notes where the beer hits the side of the glass. No head to speak of. Just some light khaki lacing around the ring of the glass. Smells of big caramel and toffee notes with some bourbon vanilla mixed in. Some dark fruit notes as well, i'm picking up fig. Taste follows the scent perfectly. Big toffee and caramel up front. Equally as present is the bourbon vanilla that is only this present when aged for quite some time in some potent barrels. Very sweet. Its funny, GI claims this beer is 12% abv, but I would have guessed that it was closer to 8%. Sticky and coating the mouth as you drink it. Light carbonation and full bodied, makes it a pleasure to drink.
Pick as much up as you can if you find it. It is worth a premium and competes with FW Sucaba for BBBWs. 869 charactersTitans77, Dec 09, 2013

S - Whoa. Fresh pumpernickel bread soaked in sweet honey, vanilla, and Scotch. Caramel, brown sugar, toasted almonds, cinnamon and cream center. Dried dark fruits, nutmeg, pecan, and oak on the backed.
T - Soft milk chocolate candy, caramel, molasses, brown sugar, and gingerbread load onto your palate right off the bat. The front is thick, but makes a lighter turn through the center with booze, caramel, and toast before a long buckwheat honey and bread crust finish. 
M - Nice warm, smooth body. Full frame.
O - World class nose with an outstandingly complex flavor profile. At this level of quality the less significant (nitpicky) aspects of the brew start coming into play, and the BCB Barelywine comes up a little short of perfect. There's a distracting, abrupt transition early in the flavor profile that I'd prefer to have smoothed out, and on net the sweetness is just a shade past ideal. That said the flavor is still outstanding, and the mouthfeel is outrageous, particularly for the ABV. 1,101 charactersvfgccp, Dec 08, 2013

Bottled 09/24/2013, about three months before the date of this tasting.
A: Dark maroon, pouring thick with just about no head. After twirling the glass, a sandy brown dusting of retention momentarily appears around the perimeter, then dissipates almost immediately.
S: Pouring the beer fills the room with a noticeable raisin and brandy aroma. Putting your nose in the glass provides a wave of deep, fruity, boozy sensation: dark chocolate, molasses, and port wine drenched in rich caramel. Intense and markedly complex. Barrel notes of toasted coconut, oak, and a touch of ashy oxidation.
T: A warm, cozy palate with dominant tones of sweet, brandy-like booze, plum, brown sugar, and earthy fig. Everything seems to be in balance – no overwhelming booze or barrel – which makes it easy to pick out the more subtle flavors of molasses, cherry cordial, chestnut, and toasted oak; it’s palatable and nuanced, which is extraordinary for such a big beer. Slight smoke and syrupy sweetness to the aftertaste, leaving the final impression fruity and satisfying.
M: Though the carbonation is certainly low, the relative lightness of the body and lack of burning alcohol keeps this drinkable. In fact, as far as barleywines go, this might be one of the most quaffable ones I’ve had in recent memory.
O: I’m impressed with this beer more than I’ve been with BCBS recently, especially because the aroma of dark, fruity sugars that instantly started emanated from the glass reminded me of one of my all-time favorites: DFH’s Raison D’Extra. Hope they continue this one for many years – and hey, how about a chocolate/coffee variant next year? A man can dream… 1,816 charactersBarryMFBurton, Dec 08, 2013
4.87/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a murky dark brown with small, quickly fading head. Not much lacing. This is the darkest barleywine I've ever seen. The best word to describe the aroma is wow! Raisin, molasses, bourbon, licorice, with a hint of chocolate and tobacco. This smells amazing. This is one sweet barleywine. Raisins and molasses hit the palate first giving way to bourbon notes with a sweet chocolate finish. The sweetness mutes the 12% ABV, this beer is definitely a sipper! Full bodied with moderate carbonation. Overall, this is a very well crafted English Barleywine. Great job Goose Island. Very well worth chasing down. 609 charactersJohnG190, Dec 08, 2013

T: Very rich and sweet carmel and toffee. Vanilla, oak and sweetness from the bourbon. Surprised by how much bourbon flavor is still left after these barrels already had BCBS in them.
M: Thicker body, lower carbonation. Nice and smooth feeling
O: Though this is a really good barleywine I still prefer normal BCBS. I think I was expecting this to be a bit better since I love BC and it did not live quite up to my expectations.

Pours the color and clarity of cola with a consistent, half-inch, tan-colored head that sizzles and dissipates towards the shoulders forming a creamy ring. Some lacing present, but no retention. Nose expresses vanilla, butterscotch and ethanol. Taste consistent with nose; however, a bit more sugary and flavorful than suggested by the aromas in the nose. Mouthfeel is medium-light in body, but comes off a little thin for the style. Texture is slightly oily and carbonation, while light and even, could be a little less assertive. Overall, a very good English Barleywine; however, I'm not sure it warrants a 100 rating (as of this review). That said, I'll throw a bottle in the cellar to see how it develops. 756 charactersJwale73, Dec 08, 2013

Pours a dark, opaque near black with a thick but quickly fading dark yellow/khaki head; not much lace or retention. Balanced, restrained nose of oak, burnt sugar, caramel, toffee and molasses. Flavor is overly sweet; barrel heavy with vanilla, brown sugar and syrupy caramel combining with a sticky, malty English BW base. On its own this was interesting but next to a well aged King Henry seemed comically simple and boring. Body is pleasantly viscous and slick with minimal heat in the finish. Not sure this needs much age, but hopefully some time will rejigger these flavors into a more interesting combination. For price and difficulty in obtaining bottles, just go blow your money of BB4D or Central Waters or something. 768 charactersyourefragile, Dec 08, 2013

Tons of grape, brown sugar, vanilla, bourbon. Not much burn. One of the very few beers you can smell though your mouth. 
Amazing blend of flavors. Grape, vanilla, oak, smooth tanic bourbon, plum, wheat, grassy, very moist flavors... Carbonation is spot on medium-high, bitter bite is more of a sweet syrup attack without coming close to being overcome with sugar to create a bomb. No heat bite, but presence of alcohol is detected, just very well masked. 
An extremely well thought out beer; nicely blended. This is nearly the benchmark for all Bwine. Not surprisingly, just a small step behind King Henry. Highly recommended, especially @ $5.50/12oz. This should be considered a must find. Highly drinkable. 864 characterschugalug06, Dec 08, 2013

12oz bottle poured into a snifter. 24 SEP13
Really nice pour, I really liked the looks of this one. A deep brown caramel color with ruby highlights. Not much head which is expected of course but keeps a nice light brown color ring. Nice alcohol legs and some lacing as well. 
Lots of sweetness, mostly caramel, oaky wood, touch of vanilla, big time boozey bourbon. 
Follows the aroma but with even more complexity. Again big on the bourbon, very nice. Also big on the sweet caramel, toffee, maybe even some burnt, caramalized sugars. Hints of dark fruits and seaweed. 
Thick, sticky, sweet. 
What a beer. It's amazing how much bourbon is in this beer considering its a third use barrel. When i say this beer is alcoholic or boozey, I mean that in the best way possible. Just as good as king Henry. I kind of fail to find any bourbon county flavors (as I did with king Henry) other than the bourbon, but I'm sure it's just adding to the overall complexity. 994 charactersdogfishandi, Dec 07, 2013

Pours a light layer of tan head. Color is a copper hued brown.
Flavor profile: It tastes like a barleywine but I noticed it has stout-like flavors. Starts out with vanilla, toffee, caramel, and oak. Then chocolate and bourbon hit. A lot of malt flavors and some cherries. A bit of molasses and raisin flavors. A touch of heat shows in the finish. Some light tobacco flavors mixed in.
Mouthfeel: RIch and chewy. Full bodied. Right amount of carbonation. Ends with a bit of sticky molasses flavor... syrupy. 
Overall, this is a really well done beer. Very complex. Only flaw is the finish. It ends a bit too syrupy. Otherwise, I really enjoy this beer.
2016 aged in fresh bourbon barrels and not the used BCBS barrels due to the infection.
Copper color with a beige head.
This one is more ba bwine and less notes of bcs than the prior years. It is still a great bwine. Thick and rich. Deep toffee and caramel notes. Big oak, bourbon, and vanilla notes. This one is thick. I am surprised by how much I like this as I was expecting a let down. I think GI did a great job executing this beer in a tough situation. Well done. 1,139 charactersmothman, Dec 07, 2013

A finger of light tan color loose foam head formed on the pour but quickly dissipated. Some carbonation visible at the edge of the glass, but not too much.
Nose is cherry, plum, toffee, caramel, tobacco, cinnamon, oak, coconut, and vanilla. Smells nice. 
Taste follows the nose, the cherry and plum mixed with toffee, along with some tobacco and leather. More barrel character comes out on the finish, spice, oak, coconut, and vanilla. Medium finish with some lingering cherry, toffee, and oak.
Fully body and syrupy, with very mild carbonation. Very sticky but not cloyingly sweet. 695 charactersnataku00, Dec 07, 2013

Smell is very sweet....bourbon and vanilla notes abound. Makes me think a lot of Backwoods Bastard. A pleasant smell for sure but it didn't really blow me away per se. 
Taste is toffee, caramel, vanilla, bourbon, and dark fruit. Very sweet in the finish. No hop presence to speak of. No real overt bitterness. A great taste for a dessert beer and, despite my description, not cloyingly sweet.
Mouthfeel is the high point. Super smooth and easy to drink despite the heft. Probably the best mouthfeel i've had in a barleywine.
Overall this is a great dessert beer. Not as harsh fresh as normal BCBS. Great depth of flavor and well integrated bourbon notes that aren't overpowering. Get it if you have the chance.. 907 charactersmechamifune, Dec 07, 2013

4.73/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I don't review on here often, but my God this beer warrants a review.
A: Pours a very dark mahogany, bordering on black. Can only really see the red notes on the beer when held up to a light, and at that they're only visible on the edges of the glass. Small, maybe 1 finger head that dissipates very quickly as expected.
S: I'm already in heaven. This honestly smells like some sort of bourbon soaked fruitcake. Vanilla and oak right off the back, a nice sticky sweet caramel note, maybe a touch of chocolate, and heaps of dark fruit. This smell is a holiday dessert in a glass. 
T: WOW. First thought on the sip is "this is the best barleywine I've ever tasted." Granted I haven't had a ton, but this blows what I have had out of the water (including Succaba). As with the aroma, the bourbon notes come through first. For me this means a strong vanilla note, followed up with the almost dry sort of flavor from the oak. Slight char as well, maybe toasted coconut would be the best way to put it. The palate then shifts to immense dark fruits and caramel/toffee. Plums, raisins, and prunes. Slight alcohol burn on the back end, but less than expected for a style that can come across as hot with barrel aging on top of that.
M: The mouthfeel is what really brings the whole package together for me. Very full bodied (obviously), and silky smooth. Coats the mouth beautifully and goes down very easily.
O: What an accomplishment Goose Island has here. I've loved every variant of Bourbon County that I've had the privilege of trying, but I think this may be my favorite. Curse you Goose Island, I need to hunt a King Henry down now. 1,636 characterseandersen, Dec 07, 2013
4.49/5  rDev 0%look: 2 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.7512 oz bottle into a tulip.
A: Pours a murky dark brown color. Practically no head is formed - there isn't even much of a collar. The 'head' is off-white color, I guess. It doesn't look like much at all, but given what this beer is, it's a moot point.
S: And guess what, sweet bourbon character hits the nostrils immediately. Vanilla, coconut, oak; you name it, it's here. Even better, it's backed by a wonderful dark fruit aroma and (slightly) lesser chocolate notes. This smells like it will be one of the best dessert beers ever.
T: Holy frig. The opening flavors are heavy in vanilla, coconut, and bourbon. But that finish...dear lord, dat finish - what a vibrant explosion of dark fruit goodness. The finish becomes more caramel-forward as it gradually opens up. There's a slight booze note post-swallow and it's hardly a distraction. Some slight barrel comes through here, too. This brew has a lot to offer in terms of complexity and flavor, with everything easily distinct yet harmonious and well balanced (if rather sweet - hey, it's a barleywine). In many ways, it's even better than regular BCBS.
M: The secret here is how much smoother it is than most in the style. Even with a faint alcoholic bite, it's wonderfully soft yet with a cake-like density. It goes down as easily as a 12% barrel-aged monster can go down. 
O: I've had a few barrel-aged barleywines before (Sucaba and Insanity spring to mind), but this is so far above those two it's not even funny. Everything here is brilliantly defined without being moronic. Best barleywine I've ever had? More like one of the best beers I've ever had.
Curse you, InBev. 1,634 charactersThisWangsChung, Dec 07, 2013

A- Pours a murky dark brownish red body with just a ring of tan foam for a head.
S- The nose is just great. Oak, toffee, molasses, even some dark fruit. A little alcohol is there too.
T- The dark fruits jump out to me immediately. Much different than I expected. Definite alcohol burn in the back of the throat. A bit of hop bitterness may be multiplying this feeling, but I'm not sure. Overall it is quite sweet and oakey and is very molasses-like. Very complex beer.
M- This thing is thick, chewy, and a bit hot.
O- Just a wonderful example of the style. I'm no barleywine fan by any means, but this easily the best one I've had. 698 characterstviz33, Dec 06, 2013

A: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a short brown head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains roasted malts, bourbon, chocolate, some fruit and some hops.
T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of chocolate, bourbon and dark fruit. Then a hearty roasted malt character comes in. There is a notable alcohol sting. The hops presence is mild but complementary and brings a good balance for a big beer like this. The after-taste is slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium-to-heavy body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, very strong kick, slightly filling, good representation of style, this is a very good high-ABV beer to sip on for a long time. 836 charactersTheManiacalOne, Dec 06, 2013

Stunning aroma and taste with beautiful balance. The aroma on this beer is a masterpiece. The only flaw I can personally find in this beautifully complex ale is the heaviness of the body. Not all barleywines drink like a dessert, and I think this one could benefit from losing a little bit of body. Overall though, this is world class stuff. 677 charactershoptualBrew, Dec 06, 2013

Pinocchio's snifter
A: Pours a deep rich reddish brown color. Seems to have lively carbonation right now, streaming bubbles. No real head, just a collar. Medium tan.
S: Delicious from the nose. Butterscotch. Caramel. Toffee. Burnt sugar. Vanilla. Booze heat. Some dark fruit character.
T: Smoother than I was expecting. Getting touch of bitterness on tip of tongue, maybe dark chocolate more than hops. Butterscotch. Toffee. Tobacco. Burnt sugar. Booze is actually milder than expected. Maybe the 3rd used barrels really helped tone that down. Again, getting some dark fruit flavors here, raisin and prune.

Starts with notes of bourbon soaked raisins, figs, heavy caramel, and notes of BCS peaking through which brings some fudge to the party. Taste starts with caramel and large BCS influence. The bourbon melds vary nicely with the base beer. Tons of complexity in the way of dark fruits, caramel, and chocolate. The finish leans towards the sweet side and has a nice bitter cocoa note on the end. Mouthfeel is big, viscous, and mildly carbonated. Overall, this is right there with King Henry. Granted, it has been a while since my last taste of King Henry, but I enjoy this as much as I remember enjoying King Henry. It's nice to see that Goose brought back the King in a way, I must say that I am well satisfied. I'm also a big fan of this being in 12 oz bottles. It's not everyday that I want to go crack a bomber of a 12% barleywine, but 12 ounces is way more manageable. Delicious! 996 charactershomebrew311, Dec 05, 2013

4.73/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75This is a seriously amazing barleywine. A huge beer with tons and tons of flavor. Pours a very deep mahogany; dark brown with some reddish tinge. Thin khaki color head with little retention. Huge aroma of bourbon, molasses, red oak, caramel, tobacco, cocoa and wine just to name a few. As the beer warms it goes through several phases with different detectable aromas. Taste is wonderful! Sweet bourbon and oak upfront, vanilla, cherries, banana, and the aftertaste reminds me of a fortified port and sherry. Wonderfully complex. Mouthfeel is heavy and rich. Some moderate carbonation brings some of the lighter flavors to life. Not much booze on the palette but you can feel it in your nose and stomach. Very warming on a winter night! Overall, this might be my new favorite barleywine, but I'd have to compare this and Firestone's Stickee Monkey side-by-side. Superb brew! 874 charactersSamuel906, Dec 05, 2013

Poured from the 12 oz. bottle into a stemmed tulip glass.
a: Black with ruby clarity in spots when held to light. Half finger thick tan head receded quickly to a thin foam ring.
s: Smoky dark fruit.
t: Pleasing combination of dark ripe fruit and smoky ash. High ABV not evident at first until swallowed, when there is some throat burn. Slight smoky aftertaste becomes more dark fruity, not to say boozy, as drinking proceeds. 
m: Moderate with great body, 
o; Takes barleywine to a new level with added flavor and at first at least particularly well-covered high ABV. Curious that, unlike the BCB Stout, there is not much in the way of bourbon aroma or flavor considering this was aged in bourbon barrels. Perhaps it's because the barrels are "third use" with BCBS having already absorbed much of the bourbon in the wood. 850 charactersscotorum, Dec 05, 2013

A - Poured into my Duvel tulip a nice dark brown almost chestnut hue with a thin quarter inch head that fades to leave thin light tan wisps and a slight halo.
S - Nice aromas of smooth bourbon, big sweet malts, nice dark fruits, some light vanilla. The booze is there but is not distracting. Nice brown sugar notes. I was expecting this to be much more of a nasal assault. 
T - Taste is quite nice. Definitely flashes of the BCBS in this with some tasty chocolate and vanilla bourbon notes along with wood. Very light flashes of coconut from the barrel. Very nice dark fruits and brown sugar sweet notes. Quite delicious. Alcohol is not even remotely noticeably on the pallet, which is crazy. I like how someone else described this as beer concentrate. 
M - Mouthfeel is excellent. Smooth, not much carbonation but that works as it lends a nice heavy feel. Alcohol is hidden wonderfully. 
O - Overall, this is a delicious beer, I just wish the nose was as rich as the flavour. I bet age is going to make this wonderful. Not overly sweet this has so much going for it. Tons of upside here. 1,181 charactersrudzud, Dec 05, 2013

Very dark reddish-brown pushing black, could probably be classified as a stout based on appearance alone. Decent head that recedes very fast and leaves a tiny light brown circle at the top. Not much for lacing or legs.
Incredibly complex aroma and quite sweet. First comes bourbon then big malts, dark fruit, sugar, and those vanilla-oak tones.
The taste is very dynamic. Big bourbon flavor is followed by some chocolate, figs, raisins, grape juice, vanilla, and wood. Extremely difficult to try to explain because there is too much going on. I was hoping for a bit more of a warming bourbon taste on the finish.
Thick, lightly carbonated, and definitely a sipper that should be a prime candidate for any cellar. 856 charactersmnphish, Dec 05, 2013
4.38/5  rDev -2.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served on-tap at Al's of Hampden.
A - Pours pitch black with a one finger tall tan head, dissipating down to next to nothing, leaving no lace at all down the glass. 
S - Smell of mild bourbon, caramelized brown sugar, vanilla, fresh baked toffee, dark fruits and some mild booziness. Smells great, just gets a little too boozy at the end, some more time should help that out.
T - Starts off with the combo of sweets - Mainly the vanilla, brown sugar and toffee - quickly giving way to a mix of dark fruits, oak and warming bourbon. Finish is still pretty sweet with a smooth hit of warming booze, lingering on the palate long after the finish. The flavors are well integrated and the bourbon isn't over the top which is nice.
M - Heavy body with moderate carbonation. Smooth, sweet feel with less alcohol than I was expecting which is always a plus.
O - It is no KH so people can stop with that, it is however a really nice BA barleywine. It has everything I love in a BA Barleywine and it was still fairly easy to finish. I am going to need to get a few bottles of this before its all gone. 1,096 charactersorangesol, Dec 05, 2013

Pours dark chestnut with a thin 1/8" of khaki head, settling to the thinnest of rings. I know this bad boy means business. 
Smells of dark fruits, raisins, bourbon, sweet malt. Quite pleasant
Taste is wonderful. More dark fruits and toffee rolled around in a barrel. Sweet but not cloying. Nice amount of oak on the back end to balance some of the sweetness. 
Nice prickly carbonation but goes down smooth. Just a hit of heat, but this is 12%. 
GI knocked it out of the park again. Wish I could've landed more. Hopefully I can trade for some without sacrificing children or appendages. 683 charactersCruisaC, Dec 05, 2013

Just enough brown and amber in the body to make it look somewhat brown, but this one is very dark. Bubbly mocha colored head that lingers around as a ring of bubbles.
S- Tons of oaky bourbon with lots of toffee aroma. Rich caramel comes through, along with vanilla, cocoa powder, burnt sugar and some roasty aromas.
T- Very sweet and extremely rich in flavor. Tons of sugary-sweet bourbon, roasted oak, roasty malts, caramel, toffee, vanilla. Surprised by the amount of stout flavors that come through just from the barrel. The depth of the flavors is just crazy, it is almost like it is beer concentrate.
M- Incredibly thick, very smooth, medium-low carbonation, but more than I expected. A sipper for sure, but a real pleasure to drink.
O- Just an intense beer. An extremely enjoyable experience to drink. The aroma, flavor and feel are just incredible. Really different than anything I have had. Hard to compare it to the great barleywines out there since this one drinks somewhat like a stout. Extremely well done. 1,101 charactersstephenjmoore, Dec 05, 2013

Finally! Have waited for this beer for what seems like forever.
Appearance: Dark brown with a slight red element, there's tons of floaties everywhere. A small beige head quickly recedes to the rim.
Smell: Vanilla, coconut, caramel, brown sugar, the ripest of dark fruit. Trying not to overreact, but this smells nothing short of incredible.
Taste: BIG vanilla, coconut and sweet sugary malts up front. There is a slight hop presence in the middle with a touch of heat(but smooth for a fresh beer). The end is a tad dry with lingering roasted malt and slight lingering sweet, delicious, baked goods elements with a touch of baker's chocolate. It finishes so right, with a pleasant aftertaste that is nicely restrained but lets the perfect amount of sweetness stick around on the palate.
Mouthfeel: Big, viscous, and not much carbonation; as expected. It is just velvety, silky smooth. For an EBW, it doesn't get much better than this. 
Overall: I haven't had King Henry in a while, but this is very similar, imo. I can see this getting even better with a year on it, but that doesn't mean you should wait...this is drinking BALLS DEEP AMAZING right now! This was just as good as I'd hoped it would be, can't say I'm disappointed at all, except for the fact that I don't have more. Cheers! 1,306 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Dec 04, 2013

There is a slight light khaki colored head and collar which shows limited retention and quickly fades away... Light carbonation... 
S - The nose is slightly subdue, but the aroma really starts to open up a little bit and display more depth and complexity as it warms a tiny bit... An undeniable malt bomb... Caramel... Toffee... Brown sugar... Uncooked brownie batter... Sweet dark fruits....
T - Sweet, but never cloying... Loads of caramel... Toffee... Brown sugar... Hints of vanilla... There are some slightly sweet dark fruit notes that linger beneath the surface... Raisins... Fig... Plum... Lots of depth and complexity... 
M - Medium bodied... Exceedingly smooth... A rich velvety texture... Very sleek... Incredible balance and consistency... Regal... Delectable... Limited carbonation... 
D - A beer that is surprisingly tame (and I mean this in a very good way) given it's high ABV and bourbon barrel aging... Near perfect in all facets... A bit more impressive appearance and a bit more of potent nose could make this a "perfect 5" across the board... I can't recommend highly enough as a limited release, English Barleywine, or bourbon barrel aged offering...

4.59/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A - Pours a dark raisin color with a thin, but frothy lacing ring around the top of the glass.
S - Bourbon, brown sugar, molasses, and dark fruit. For a beer of this magnitude while the nose is inviting, it's not as strong as I expected.
T - Follows the nose with the addition of some oak presence. Flavors are even throughout with brown sugar and molasses, figs, rum raisin, bourbon, vanilla, and ends with a sticky, boozy, dark fruit finish with a slight hint of bitter chocolate on the very end.
M - Rich texture, full bodied, viscous, sticky, and to be expected: alcohol warming on the way down the hatch.
O - the Bourbon County series sometimes gets a tad overhyped but I must say, this one is superbly blended. The only criticism is perhaps a little too thick and frothy but overall, well done. 804 charactersjzeilinger, Dec 04, 2013

4.84/5  rDev +7.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer comes in a dark brown/black color with some mahogany in the light, a light off ring of head at the rim.
The aroma is wonderful of caramel, toffee, molasses, vanilla. Then oak, dark fruit, figs, cherries, a bit of alcohol. A chocolate stout note in there as well.
The flavor follows with those sweet toffee, brown sugar, vanilla, molasses notes. It's sticky and sweet with some dark fruit, rum soaked raisins and plums that melds with a chocolatey stout flavor. It then pops of oak and bourbon and then moves onto a brown sugar flavor that cleans off so well. There tiny bubbled carbonation and alcohol compliment the beer well as it moves the sweetness through onto a finish that asks for more sips. Very complex, very easy drinking. 
A wonderful addition to the Bourbon County line. One of the best barrel aged barleywines. 836 charactersdar482, Dec 04, 2013

Appearance: Extremely dark for a Barleywine. A very dark reddish-brown with foamy, sustained head.
Smell: Lots of Bourbon, with coconut, oak and vanilla. Toffee, caramel, chocolate and molasses as well. Rich and decadent, and smells like a mix of Bourbon, Stout and Barleywine.
Taste: Complex mix of oak, coconut, chocolate, molasses, licorice, vanilla, toffee, cherry and caramel. All of the flavors are really well melded, and hard to pinpoint flavors. Truly delicious, but just a hair too sweet for me.
Feel: Very thick, but extremely creamy and smooth. Low carbonation with a lot of warmth, but not overly boozy. Starts coating the mouth after a few sips.
Overall: Nothing like any other Barleywine I have had, as aging it in barrels that once held Bourbon County Stout (that of course held Bourbon before that) as done sublime things to the base beer. Extraordinary, and I will likely never have it again. 961 charactersbsp77, Dec 03, 2013

A-brown/black cola like appearance, some ruby like hues to the outside and a thin tan head that disappears rather quickly, has some legs to it, looks big and sticky
S- a cornucopia of decadence; oak, cocoa powder, toffee, vanilla, leather, more oak, some dark fruit/plum/prune, bit of fudge. 
T- Initially i get a rich toffee, caramel sweetness that then fades into some cocoa powder/slight fudge tones and then into the vanilla kick with the dark fruit on the finish and the oak laying in the background while all this is happening. There is still some heat on this and I'd like the sweetness to mellow out a bit as well, if time can do that to this beer, it'll be perfect.
M- Just enough carbonation to keep the 12oz from feeling like a chore, but still maintains a fairly sticky, big body. 
O- This is great, lots of decadence, lots of flavor that you can really sit on for a bit and may still not have a full read on all this brew has to offer. Look forward to seeing how it ages 1,012 charactersGonzoHomebrewer, Dec 03, 2013

(A)- Pours a very deep burnt sienna/umber color. Some solid tan froth that dissipated quickly.
(S)- A big bourbon barrel nose meets a sugary sweet caramel and cocoa/raisin nose. Bits of a coffee-like roast in there.
(T)- A big boozy caramel bourbon flavor meets subtle cocoa and raisin. Ever so slight hint of toffee on the finish. Just a kiss of a dark coffee-like roast element.
(M)- Its big and boozy with a smooth and mellow carbonation level. It is a great combo of a sweet barleywine meets a subtle blend of the stout left over in the barrel.
(O)- Absolutely superb. It is literally King Henry Jr. A superb barleywine with superb barrel aging. King Henry is still better, but this is an excellent replacement. 795 characterssweemzander, Dec 03, 2013

Murky dark, dark brown with burgundy highlights with a small head that dissipates quickly. Plenty of legs on this as it is swirled around.
Toffee, figs, raisins, and a faint booziness similar to dark rum on the nose at first. A touch of cocoa. A little bit of grape and other brandy-like aromas poke their head in as well. Decadent stuff, rather complex.
Opens up with similar flavors. Fruit cake and rum, toffee, and dark pitted fruits all in balance. Cocoa and a touch of brandy.
Heavy body with lower carbonation. Sticky but not cloying.
Wonderful dessert like flavors mixed with a subtle, sweet boozey character. Great example of a barrel aged English barleywine. Glad I got a bit of this to age, I only see it improving. 756 charactersauroracrisis, Dec 03, 2013

Looks like a stout really. Pours a dark brown, nearly black and very opaque, body with a solid but small mocha head that dissipates very quickly. Retention nothing special but looks a lot like King Henry did... just not as viscous.
Smells great. So much caramel sweetness mixed in with some of that trademark Bourbon County nose. Molasses, some dark fruits. Its not quite like King Henry's rich umami + caramel chocolate nose, but this is quite nice. Its intensely sweet with a couple dashes of bourbon.
Very sweet barleywine that brings an unique character to the palate compared to Sucaba or Arctic Devil. Its very caramelly, toffee-forward but with a nice sweet bourbon character and some barrel in it.. there's a bit of dark fruits in it but its dominated by the caramel, toffee and bourbon. It is drinking really well from the get go. It doesn't have that slick chocolatey umami flavour of King henry, but it's delicious on its own merits.
No booziness in here at all. Drinking really well- full bodied, silky and thick body with decent carbonation. Its really preposterous how great this barleywine is drinking. 
Nice job, Goose Island/ABI. This is a beer that is worth fighting in line over on Black Friday, although I wasn't in a place where they did the Black Friday release. Marvelous barleywine that I really enjoyed. Nowhere near King Henry level- no other barleywine is ever going to match that- but this is still pretty good. I don't see any point in aging this- this beer is ready to drink fresh. 1,646 charactersStevedore, Dec 03, 2013

Not much of a head made, faint mocha brown that settles to a nice even collar with some nice legs and a whispy top. Body color is really nice. Caramel brown and deep red body color with a nice glow and some legs that coat the glass with some tips of the glass.
Classic molasses smell and crystallized sugars. Lots of dark fruit that bursts off this, fig and raisin like a Belgian dark, but hints of deep cherry as well. Sticky toffee. Not so much caramel or hints of vanilla though, but more stout smelling than barleywine, sort of a hybrid that's really nice. 
Palate is interesting if a little different surprisingly. Milky and creamy palate almost hinting lactose character. A little touch of prickly carbonation on the tip of the tongue that dissolves instantly. Molasses and dark fruits to match the nose with controlled sweetness. Hints of Belgian Dark Ale without the sucrose large rush. Figs. Raisins. Dark burnt cherry. Some vanilla hits with milky character and sweetness and some caramel, however it's a bit subdued as is the oaky character with the exception of the mouthfeel. No boozy character to this either it drinks real easily.
Overall a real unique tasting barleywine that hints almost into large dark fruit territory, but is sort of not what I expected or look for in this style. It is however a very unique tasting brew and memorable, a mix of classic Goose Island Stout barrel aging and Fruit Barleywine character, not unlike King Henry. 1,514 characterssmakawhat, Dec 03, 2013

Pours a thin, light cream colored head with poor retention. Beer is a clear, dark, almost opaque mahogany. Lacing is minimal. Spotty with little stick. Thick, oily legs that really hang out. A big beer for sure.
Nose is bourbon, raisin, brown sugar, molasses, caramel, leather and other dark fruit. Again, a huge beer with an intense presence.
Opens raisin, prune, leather, and anise. Very sweet and super boozy. Leather, oak, chocolate, fudge, and molasses in the middle. Very complex with layers and layers of flavor. End is more molasses, wood and booze with a sweet chocolate and dark fruit finish and aftertaste. Really good.
Full bodied with low carbonation. Chewy, thick and oily in the mouth and goes down hot and rich. Messy finish with a slick, sticky aftertaste. Excellent for the style.
Certainly deserving of the Bourbon County brand, this barleywine rivals its imperial stout sibling. Definitely worth seeking out 995 charactersSpeedwayJim, Dec 03, 2013

O - This is probably the 3rd best barleywine I've had. The K13 and then Aged KH second. Want infinitely more of this. 750 charactersnrs207, Dec 03, 2013

Aroma is a bit light with notes if dark fruit, caramel, some coffee and the bourbon but mild. Flavor follows with more dark fruit mostly raisin, dark grapes and strawberry follows buy caramel malts coffee and brown sugar rounded off at the end by the bourbon finish. This one is unapologetically boozy. Medium to full body and light carbonation. Although I have had better barleywines, few compare to this one. 499 characterskylehay2004, Dec 02, 2013

a - Pours a deep mahogany brown color with one inhc of light tan head and low to moderate carbonation.
s - Smells of sweet bourbon, dark fruits, raisins, molasses, oak, toffee, toasted malts, and caramel malts. The nose is awesome. Lots of bourbon and sweet dark fruits, with caramel on the back end of it.
t - Tastes of sweet bourbon, caramel malts, toffee, sweet dark fruits, raisins, figs, vanilla, cream, sugar, oak, toasted malts, bread, roasted malts, and molasses/syrup. Taste has a little more caramel and vanilla than the nose had which steps it up a little bit in my eyes, and still has a lot of fruit and bourbon. Awesome and complex.
m - Medium body and low carbonation. Really no heat for the ABV and pretty smooth and creamy.
o - Overall I thought this was awesome; exactly what I was hoping for. Tons of delicious bourbon, fruits, and caramel to it, and there it is not too hot. Love that it is coming in 12 oz. bottles too. Reminds me a bit of King Henry, though a bit more dark fruits. Well worth it, glad to have a few bottles and really hope they make this year round. 1,217 charactersmdfb79, Dec 02, 2013

Poured into a matching bourbon county snifter the brew appears dark brown in color with a fine ring of clarity around the edges. A tan finger is quick to collapse holding with a fine line around the perimeter.
The aroma is sweet of caramelized sugars: toffee, molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, creme brûlée, oak, raisins and prunes. Quite dark and fruity smelling with alcohol ever-present but integrated nicely.
Based off the aroma alone, one would think this is gonna be a sticky sweet brew. Luckily the residual sugars are tempered by the alcohol and a bit of hoppy bitterness. Flavors of raw oak blend into raisons, dates, figs, prunes...a whole gauntlet of dark fruity alcohol. Molasses, toffee, caramel, vanilla, slightly dusty wood and earthen to herbal bitter hops round the flavor profile out.
This is a medium to fuller bodied brew with a moderate amount of carbonation. A boozy sipper that is quite complex and certainly worth seeking out. Considering the amount of bourbon county stout that was/is made, I hope this means this brew will see greater volume/distribution in the future. This offering comes out with the bar set unreasonably high falling in the wake of King Henry...I wont draw any comparisons to that brew but wow is this good and everything I hoped it would be. Damn, I would like more of this. 1,378 charactersstakem, Dec 02, 2013

I do not have much exposure to barley wines. 
This smells sweet, nutty, creamy. I pick up banana, cream, citrus, nuts, nutmeg, molasses, chocolate, coffee, bourbon, tobacco, vanilla. 
Very very complex drink. 
Sweet to rich and complex from the smell to the after taste. Aftertaste- It's almost a full circle back to the sweetness you pick up in the smell. There is an alcohol taste in there, I've picked up with a couple barley wines I've had before(again, limited experience with these)
I'm wishing I could pick up more of the bourbon I had been promised, but maybe that's the other flavor since taste but separated . Wow.

4.24/5  rDev -5.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4APPEARANCE: From the instant it leaves the bottle this beer looks viscous and rich. The color is a deep, deep murky mahogany. Unlike other variations of BCBS, this one actually had a head for about ten seconds. It swelled up quickly, but immediately fell and one, long, lonely wisp ended up connecting one side of my glass to the other across the surface. No lacing.
SMELL: Enormous aroma. I can smell it as it pours from two feet away. Vanilla, oak, chocolate, brown sugar, but not as much banana or clove as I expected.
TASTE: Wow. A lot more wood on this one than the nose indicated. The oak punches the palate up front as some more nuanced flavors creep in on the edges of the tongue; chocolate first, then followed by a little vanilla and brown sugar. Somewhat surprisingly, the hops come through pretty strong. As the beer warms it brings out a lot more vanilla as the wood remains strong, but gives way to more traditional Barleywine flavors such as that banana and clove that seemed to be missing from the nose.
MOUTHFEEL: For a 12%+ barrel-aged Barleywine there is a fair amount of sparkle here. Big, rich and a little sticky, the BCBBA provides a dryer start than most Barleywines along with a pleasant semi-sweet finish.
OVERALL: I suppose I should have expected the unexpected from a beer aged in barrels that had previously aged BCBS that had originally been Bourbon barrels. That said, I was surprised by quite a few aspects of this beer. This is quite a tasty treat, but I will be looking forward to seeing how it does in a year or two. 1,555 charactersStoneTSR, Dec 02, 2013

Appearance: Pours a dark brown with hints of dark amber. Less than a finger of a light tan head dissipates to a thin coating and collar. Body is opaque.
Smell: Super malty. Toffee, raisin, vanilla, bourbon, oak, hint of roast. 
Taste: Follows the nose pretty closely with notes of caramel, toffee, dark fruit, butterscotch and slight bit of tobacco. The BCBS influence on the barrels is really evident in the finish and aftertaste with a fair amount of roasted malt that lingers after the finish.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, viscous mouthfeel. Low-ish levels of gentle fine carbonation. Booze hidden extremely well. Silky smooth and highly drinkable. 
Overall: Well this didn't disappoint. Super complex and flavorful and goes down smooth as hell. This is absolutely worthy of the Bourbon County label. 851 charactersJonada, Dec 02, 2013

A- pours pretty thick, dark brown, once in glass looks almost black. not much head to speak of, maybe a little around the edges.
S- lots of toffee, carmel, brown sugar sweetness, you do get the bourbon county stout smell in there as well just kinda on the backend.
T- very sugary and sweet, lots of bourbon, vanilla, booze soaked dark fruits, not very hoppy or bitter, lots of malts, this is one complex beer!
M- very thick and viscous, coats your mouth. not much carbonation but who cares!

Appearance - Dark reddish brown body. Very dark in the glass. Not much of a head. Just a thin khaki collar. 
Smell - Very boozy. Brown sugar. A little fruity. Some bourbon, but it isn't too strong.

Mouthfeel - Sweet and boozy. Neither is too much, though. Low carbonation. 
Overall - The comparisons to King Henry don't do King Henry justice. The bourbon character just isn't as incredible. A tasty barleywine nonetheless. 578 charactersAlieniloquium, Dec 02, 2013

I was lucky enough to acquire a single bottle of this through a friend who had to stand in line for over an hour to get at it. Exponentially stoked and excited to have this beer.
Poured into a clear balloon snifter.
A - Pours a thick muddy chestnut / caramel colored body. Opaque in the glass. No conjuration of any head aside from some thin tan bubbles. Some lacing sticks to the glass and then falls. Looks very nice.
S - Smell is of beautiful creamy vanilla, bourbon alcohol heat, wood, toasted caramel, raisins, dates, figs. Phenomenal smelling.
T - Taste follows the nose: creamy vanilla, sweet sticky caramel, mild alcohol heat, dates, raisins, figs, & some subtle creamy chocolate nuances imparted from the original Bourbon County Brand Stout.
M - Feel is silky smooth and creamy, with a bit of sticky caramel and some alcohol warmth lingering.
Overall, a truly delicious and decadent bourbon barrel aged barleywine. Not quite as amazing as the original beer, but still an extraordinary beer. Probably the best barleywine I've tried as of yet. Very grateful to have gotten to try this probably once in a lifetime opportunity beer. Highly recommended.

4.69/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Purchased in North Providence, RI. Bottled the 23rd of September 2013. 
Appearance- Pours a deep mahogany/deep brown, opaque body with cherry and amber highlights when held up to the light. The head is small and light brown in color, reducing quickly but leaving a ring of foam around the rim. 
Smell- Sweet vanilla beans, bourbon, caramel, oak, toffee, fresh pecan pie, nutty, butterscotch. Smells absolutely delicious & inviting. Aromas really open up as this beer warms up to a little less than room temperature. One of the best beers I've ever smelled and one of the 2 I've ever given a 5 in this category.
Taste- Starts off intensely rich and sweet, vanilla-caramel notes, toffee and butterscotch, peanut brittle, candied sugar, the finish is roasty, bourbon soaked coffee beans, with a lingering char on the aftertaste. Slight warming booze. As far as barleywines go, this one tastes perfect. I couldn't think of any way this beer could be improved in this category. 
Mouthfeel- Heavy, syrupy body but surprisingly easy to drink. Low carbonation.
I was extremely impressed with this offering - it brings this style to a whole new level, a definite one-up from other barrel aged barleywines I've tried. Complex, packed full of flavor, and best of all: available in 4 packs, so you can enjoy one without sacrificing an expensive bomber every time you're craving one. 1,418 charactersgcamparone, Dec 02, 2013

Thick, caramel flavors with a nice highlight of bourbon. Oak and vanilla, somewhat of a sherry tinge. The bourbon tends to linger on the palate. Smooth and sticky mouthfeel with a slight booziness. Just a great beer all in. Really was afraid the bourbon would be too much but it all is balanced exceptionally well. And I thought the stout would be hard to top-this almost comes close. 675 characterslackenhauser, Dec 01, 2013

Appearance: BCBBW pours out a deep, dark brown, that shows some ruby around the edges. A hard pour resulted in about an eighth of an inch of tan foam. What little of a foam cap was there hung around for a few sips. Very little lace left behind. Really a nice presentation. 
Smell: Pretty intense nose. BCBS peeks in. Gently, not overpowering. Subtle notes of leather and tobacco pair nicely with the bourbon aromas. Just a bit of char. Wood is in there, along with some dried dark fruit, and a touch of vanilla. Boozy! 
Taste: Wow again! There is a ton of things going on here. Big booze up front, but really opens up into something more. Definite barrel flavor, just a hint at a bourbon barrel aged stout. More fruit is noticed as well as vanilla. Fine pipe tobacco makes it's way in and cuts the sweetness. Warms all the way down. Really nice!
Mouthfeel: Almost silky smooth. Thick, coats the mouth. Just the faintest carbonation. Nearly perfect. 
Overall: Pretty impressive. Strong and full of flavor. This may have the Bourbon County Brand name on it, but it truly is it's own beer. Can't wait to see what a little time will do. 1,303 charactersjaxon53, Dec 01, 2013

A - pours an extremely dark brown/ burnt ruby color, with some light penetrating the edges of the glass. Minimal tan head that dissipates quickly. 
S - Potent for sure... I could smell it as soon as I cracked the cap off. Smooth bourbon, brown sugar, toffee, fig, rasin, vanilla, and oaky tannins. Smells fantastic. 
T - Wow, just a plethora of flavors happening, tons of depth and complexity. Earthy, sweet dark fruits (fig, prunes, raisin) tangle with brown sugar and caramel before the bourbon hits middle of the mouth, and bringing along lots of leather, sweet pipe tobacco, toasted coconut and vanilla with it. Chewy molasses and burnt sugar. The finish brings toasted oak and a fair amount of spicy, astringent alcohol that actually helps to cut some of the malty sweetness. There's also a nice hit of vanilla, and some slight bitterness but I can't seem to pinpoint where exactly it's coming from (maybe picked up some of the stout character from being aged in barrels that previously held BCBS?). 
M - Super easy drinking and smooth for being this fresh. A fair amount of warming alcohol in the finish, but it's not overbearing at all. Coats the mouth with flavors. 
O - This is a damn impressive beer. Just so smooth right out of the gate and layer upon layer of complexity. Really wish I had more than one bottle left. 1,397 characterscjoc83, Dec 01, 2013

The beer pours a deep burgundy color, nearly black but with obvious hues of caramel and dark amber when held to the light. A small, 1 finger, khaki head appears, albeit briefly with poor retention and no lace present, although a fine film appears around the rim of the glass. The aroma is really nice, lots of soft toffee, rich grain, light bourbon, dark chocolate, caramel, plum, fig, and a really impressive raisin character. Vanilla and oak come across softly, but the fruit qualities are really nice and the residual stout character is subtle, but effective. On the tongue, fruit is again king. Raisin, plum, fig and dark cherry are really prominent, rich grain, brown sugar and caramel show well and the barrel character, toffee, oak, vanilla and bourbon are more of a subtlety at the finish with some dark chocolate left over from the BCBS, but the base barleywine really shines. The body is great, rich, smooth, thick, but with a bit of a crisp zip from the carbonation, which is slightly higher than anticipated. The finish is great, smooth, creamy and lightly warming. 
Verdict: A knockout barleywine from Goose Island. It's not quite as rounded and balanced as King Henry, but it's wonderful and showcases the barleywine qualities nicely. The old stout is expressed well, but doesn't dominate, and the raisin quality is really pleasant. No surprises here, just artfully crafter beer. 1,454 characterskevanb, Dec 01, 2013

4.42/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Extremely dark and viscous, almost resembling bcbs but for the mohagany edges and hues picked up in direct light. Very little carbonation and no head at all. 
I'm digging the depth in the aroma. Raisins and dates. Overripe plum. Toffee and vanilla. Butterscotch. Leather. 
Tastes are vanilla, toffee, caramel, then come the dark sweet fruits. Light woody finish with butterscotch. 
Mouthfeel is thick and sweet, almost syrupy but has enough carbonation to hedge that. 
Outstanding. Another impressive notch in the belt of GIs barrel aged portfolio. 552 charactersVonerichs, Dec 01, 2013

A- Pretty dang dark...looks like a BCBS. However, when I hold it directly into the light, you can see some dark brown edges. Pretty vigorous pour yielded a one finger light tan head. It dissipated pretty quick into a thin ring. Looks okay.
S- Bourbon and dark fruits dominate the nose. Hints of chocolate, vanilla, wood, bourbon, plum, raisin, alcohol, and oak. Smells like a regular BCBS, but a bit more fruit coming off of it. 
T- The bourbon isn't super-strong in the flavor. Lots of leather, molasses, dark fruit, vanilla, and oak. You do get a bit of bourbon and alcohol in the middle, but not too much. Ends pretty fruity as well...tiny bit of burn on the back end. Slightly sweet, but isn't overboard. 
M- Smooth as silk. Very little alcohol burn. However, this is still a sipper. Medium-thick body, low carbonation. 
O- Pretty decent. I think it picks up too much of the BCBS, though. Don't get me wrong, I love BCBS, but it sort of makes this beer not it's own. Not enough bourbon for my liking, either. It would be interesting to see this in second use barrels that didn't have BCBS in before it..
However, this is still an insanely complex barrel aged barleywine. There so much going on that it's hard to pick out everything. Ehh....not quite worth the hype here, but still pretty damn good. 1,407 charactersTTAmod, Dec 01, 2013

A- Pours a deep deep garnet almost black, can just see some light coming through on the edges. A small medium tan head formed and quickly dissipated to nothing. 
S- Chocolate covered raisins! Molasses, some oak and vanilla. 
T- Lots of dried dark fruits, more oak than the nose and slight olive oil? 
M- Nice high level of thickness not too heavy, which is part of my problem with BCBS. Alcohol is there but remarkably subdued. 
O- A great beer, I'm just sad I could only find one bottle of the stuff. Next year will be a different story though you can bet on that. Old Ales/Barleywines are easily my favorite style and this one reminded me of Bell's Third Coast Old Reserve which is aged in spent Black Note barrels, similar to this beer. Would really love to try the base beer of this sometime. 867 charactersPaulyB83, Nov 30, 2013

For some reason the price here is jacked up about 6$ a 4 pack. Disgusting. Deciccos grocery may be the most sad price gouging beer shop that I am aware of. Done shopping there as well. Clown bartenders that appear half drunk and zero personality. Hey boss I can tell you are drunk!
A: Pours a dark hazy mess of chestnut brown with tons of sediment floating around in the bottle and a dark mocha ring around the edges.
S: Aroma of dark fruity black cherry , caramel , toffee and vanilla
T: flavors of tons of dark fruit here, berry and black cherries along with caramelized sugar, cotton candy, toffee and creamy milky caramel with vanilla infusions. Tons of extra sugars unfrequented and sweetening this one up. It is overly sweet but a flavor I am a fan of in barley wines. 
M: thick viscous composition almost corn syrupy and thick. Some clearly visible particulate matter at the bottom of the glass, in the middle of the glass and pretty much floating around once you swirl the glass. There is a ton of particulate matter of large particles.
O: overall this is a very tasty beer but I am so turned off by the prices some of these breweries charge now for a brewery that is focused on efficiency and was just bought by InBev that this will be the last time that I try to seek this out. They will have tons of this stuff left over once InBev gets their hands around the brewers throats and I just won't pay that much for a four pack. What a joke to see shops holding back on selling a 4 pack to someone based on their familiarity with the shopper. Craft beer is dying and I'm tired of this hipster selling practice. 1,695 charactersalpinebryant, Nov 30, 2013

Smell- Bittersweet chocolate and toffee at first followed by a bit of caramel. Background has some fruit notes, maybe cherry and fig. Nice smell that isn't overpowering.
Taste- Chocolate and dark fruits, again with some caramel and toffee. Very nice flavor. Very little bitterness except a slight kick when swallowing, almost no heat coming from the alcohol. Nicely balanced.
Mouthfeel- Slick and creamy with good carbonation for the style. Not harsh or drying
Overall- Very good barleywine, great balance. Dangerously drinkable. 626 charactersIPAdams, Nov 30, 2013

S: Sharp bourbon, deep vanilla, caramel and toffee, with just a hint of cocoa powder.
T: Bourbon on the front of the tongue, mellowing to deep vanilla accompanied by sweet caramel. There is a long, chocolate finish on this one--cocoa powder and even milk chocolate. The BCBS that occupied these barrels before has left a gift to the barley wine in my glass and, by extension, to me.
M: Velvety, rich, creamy, luscious...am I gushing?
O: Before BCBBW, I thought Wulver was the pinnacle of what (bourbon) barrel-aging could do for a beer. I've now had the two side by side, and I really can't decide which I like better. This is a truly marvelous beer, and the chocolate flavors really take this English-style barley wine to a new level. 898 charactersCraigory, Nov 30, 2013

The mouthfeel is medium full, perfect. Leaves you wanting more, but has a great aftertaste. His is quite possibly the perfect Barleywine. 453 charactersKVNBGRY, Nov 30, 2013

Smell is phenomenal! Rich, smooth, malt overload, bourbon, currants, raisins, a light, peppery spice note. Excellent balance and hugely complex. 
Taste is just as good. Uber smooth, bourbon, roast malt, dark fruits (currants, raisins, figs), a hint of pepper. Fan-freaking-tastic.
Rich like Warren Buffett, smooth as Lou Rawls' voice. Full bodied, minimal effervescence. A sipping beer for sure. This reminds me of the Sam Adams Triple Bock I had in 1999, thick, boozy, warming, delicious. Better warm (room temperature for this one). A bit syrupy at the swallow is the only knock against it. If you can, you better or you'll hate yourself later. I'm glad I have a 4 pack sitting at home. 834 charactersPorterLambic, Nov 30, 2013

Smells of tons of toffee and carmel, some chocolate, hint of coffee, oak, some vanilla, molasses, bourbon goodness, slight dark fruit. Very complex aroma. Taste is just as complex. Starts with the typical toffee/carmel, as well as dark fruit and molasses. The middle then brings in the outstanding barrel qualities. Oak, vanilla, and bourbon meld into the toffee, carmel, molasses, and dark fruits. The finish is heavenly. Big sweetness from the carmel, toffee, and molasses, along with dark fruits like raisins, vanilla, bittering hops, oak, and a good amount of bourbon. Getting a butterscotch note in there too. Also get bcbs qualities from the barrel, which stands this beer out in terms of ba barleywines. Get some chocolate and roastiness that go really well with all the other sweet flavors. Warming sensation going down, but not really "hot." Full body with a creamy and sticky feel to it. Just the right amount of carbonation. I did not think it would, but this definitely lived up to the hype. Glad I was able to pick up a lot of this. An extremely complex and outstanding beer. 1,197 charactersbrewskis, Nov 30, 2013

bottled on date of September 24th, 2013.
poured into snifter glass.
Appearance: dark brown bodied beer with 2 fingers of a medium khaki colored head resulting from a hard pour. The head has some staying power, but eventually drops to a thin cap. Nice lace on the side of the glass after you swirl the beer.
Smell: This smells big, rich, and sweet. Loads of dark fruitiness and caramel. The barleywine base seems to smell stronger than the barrel notes of this beer. Chocolates and toffee. Oak, coconut, and mellow bourbon. Slightly spicy booziness. Really nice balance with all elements, but I wouldnt mind just a little more of the barrel presence in the nose. 
Taste: Dark fruits and a mellow bourbon note mingle together at the first sip. Toffee, caramel, and vanilla with hint of earthy oak. In the middle I get leather, plum, molasses, and tobacco notes. I get alot of brown sugar and bitter chocolates in the finish with some hintings of port wine. Great complexity and balance in the flavor profile. Definately a bit different animal compared to most english barleywines! 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation level. Rich, creamy, sticky, and especially silky mouthfeel. Just a touch boozey, but thats okay it works very well with this beer. 
Overall: I had a bottle of King Henry about two weeks ago and the experience is still fairly fresh in my mind because King Henry is still kicking ass if you cellared your bottle properly. I think that Bourbon County Barleywine has a little weaker barrel presence in nose and flavor profile than King Henry, but the mouthfeel seems better than King Henry did fresh. Bourbon County Barleywine is a bit more fruity than King Henry; it seems as though more of the base beer comes through in Bourbon County Barleywine. It also seems that King Henry is a little more barrel forward of an English Barleywine than Bourbon County Barleywine. With all that said... Great effort on this beer and I will gladly seek out more of this beer! Thank you Goose Island for putting a great English Barleywine into a small format bottle and in 4 packs to boot! I dont know of many barrel aged English Barleywines that come in single serve bottles that are at this high of quality! I think that this will also be a good beer to sit on, it should age well. Welcome to the "Bourbon County" family Bourbon County Barleywine...hoping that you become a yearly release! 2,482 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Nov 30, 2013

A- Pours very dark with a small amount of light protruding through the top sides of the glass but nothing more. A small amount of khaki head quickly fades to nothing. This beer sits very still with little carbonation. 
S- Bourbon, oak, vanilla, and caramel on the nose. Very rich smelling beer with great bourbon aroma. 
T- Great beer. Drinks smooth with dark fruits and raisin tones at first taste. Then comes the oak bourbon and vanilla notes. Each sip gets more flavorful as the beer warms. 
M- Heavy, low carbonation, rich, and flavorful. At 12.1% ABV, the alcohol is noted but not overwhelming at all. 
A great addition to the Bourbon County line and a fantastic BA BW worth seeking out. 806 charactersvic21234, Nov 30, 2013
4.17/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This long-awaited treasure actually showed up in mid-Missouri, much to my surprise, and a 4-pk set me back about $18.00. Figured I’d try one fresh and age the rest. The bottled-on date here shows September 24th, 2013. An elevated pour into my Duvel tulip shows a dark walnut beer, crowned with a tan cap which, on account of the pour and the nucleation in the tulip, actually shows a bit better retention than I was expecting. BCB is almost completely opaque, though there are a few garnet highlights at the bottom of the tulip when held to the light. A riot of red and dark fruit notes emerges first, and these are followed by some toasty brown malt notes, a hint of nuttiness, and faint notes of whiskey and wood. Perhaps a ghostly note of burnt molasses as this approaches room temperature, possibly from the BCBS contribution. On the palate, this shows strong notes of booze up front. The booze stops just short of being hot and, if it weren’t for the intense flavors and significant sweetness, this might seem a bit over-the-top in terms of alcoholic strength. The flavors are a bit muddled at this point, but there’s sweet, sticky dark caramel, some dark red fruits, just a bit of toasted nuttiness, and just the slightest hint of something I’m not entirely enamored with…perhaps just a slightly metallic edge to the molasses flavors (something readily apparent in many high-octane imperial stouts, including BCBS, when young) but I’m guessing that this will mellow with age. Rich, thick, boozy mouthfeel. Rich almost beyond description. Is it King Henry? Not quite. But this is a damn fine English-style barleywine, and one which I have no doubt will improve 1,677 charactersBedetheVenerable, Nov 30, 2013

A: Pours a dark brown appearing black in the glass with a dense slightly tanned head. Takes a couple minutes for the head to dissipate, leaving some lacing on the sides of the glass. This brew barely lets any light through.
S: Real nice chocolate and bourbon notes to this one. Dark roasted malts blend together with a touch of raisin and fig. Alcohol is present as well. Oak barrel in the background along with a bit of vanilla and carmel sweetness. 
T: A very nicely blended beer here. Hits you from all sides, initial bourbon, molasses and vanilla. Then you begin to realize the dose of bittering hops and chocolate malts. Great oak qualities that make this beer shine. As it warms much more of the malt base comes our lending deeper fruit tones.
M: Full body with moderate carbonation. Velvety mouthfeel that makes it a pleasure to drink. Finish remains pretty crisp. The alcohol isnt too hot at all just a pleasant warming. 
Overall this is very impressive. I've always been a fan of the regular bourbon county and this barleywine base puts on some serious competition. If you see a bottle, do not hesitate to pick it up, this is worth top dollar. 1,223 charactersCloudStrife, Nov 30, 2013

A- Pours a slight purplish brown that appears almost opaque black with some translucency in the glass. A thin off white head appears that recedes at a moderate rate leaving some light clingy lacing.
S- Bourbon soaked raisins, dark fruits, balanced malts, figs, slight grapes, hints of chocolate, slight port aspect. Fairly aromatic with a very nice complex aroma.
T- Bourbon soaked raisins, figs, dark chocolate, dark fruits that mix with the chocolate from the third use barrels to give it almost a port like flavor. Finishes with more raisins, chocolate, plums, grapes, and a bit of booze.
M- Medium bodied to a little bit on the thicker side, slightly creamy, some heat from the abv that I think will settle over time. 
O- This was a fantastic barleywine that is easily up there with the best. It's still fairly hot right now, but I think it will be perfect with a year or two on it. I've found that I love barleywines that are used in third use barrels after holding high quality bourbon and a stout, I feel like the stout adds an additional complexity to the barleywine bringing out more dark fruits. Overall I'm glad I joined the masses searching for this on Black Friday, I just wish I could have found more then three bottles! 1,318 charactersjaasen64, Nov 29, 2013

T: Taste is similar, but more developed. Starts with a mild sweetness. Plums and prune juice and a light port quality. Then the oak comes oak with a lot more sweetness. Brown sugar, molasses, treacle, and toffee. Finish is smooth, plumy, and port-like. 
M: Full bodied and smooth, though that is probably because it's also virtually flat. There is a mild bitterness on the backend, though it's actually more of a woody astringency than a hoppy bitterness.
O: Overall, a very good beer. For some reason, I think I actually preferred this one to King Henry, though I'll admit I drank KH some time ago and have had many, many beers in the interim. Never-the-less, this one should be much easier to find while still worth the search. 1,077 charactersFlorida9, Nov 29, 2013

4.09/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4A-Pours a very dark, hazy crimson/brown. Not much head. Even an aggressive second pour only yields an army of quickly vanishing bubbles. Now there is a thin ring and an accumulation of light, cloudy carbonation in the middle of the glass. One thick stripe of initial lacing followed by progressively thinner stripes.
S-Dark dried fruit steeped in bourbon. The oak aroma is like that of a dried out barrel. Almost has a cork aroma to it. Lots of rich sweets like molasses, brown sugar and caramel. Vanilla.
T-The flavor is exceptionally rich. The bourbon encompasses the fig and raisin flavors as well as the loaded maltiness of the beer. Vanilla and even a bit of port wine. Spicy tobacco. Almost like some sort of boozy sticky toffee pudding. Dried out oakiness. Big on flavor of course.
M-Exceptional feel. Carbonation is light in intensity but plentiful. The feel is heavy, thick and velvety. Obviously a pretty hot drink. Sticky.
O/D-A decadent Barleywine. A solid addition to the Bourbon County lineup. Definitely worth a bottle if you stumble upon it. Somewhere between very good and excellent. 1,104 charactersVelvetExtract, Nov 29, 2013

A- Murky mahogany with thin lacing with pretty good retention. Not transparent at all. 
S- This is where the beer shines for me. The notes of vanilla, caramel, oak, molasses come off very strong. This beer smells wonderful. 
T- Vanilla, caramel, booze, dark fruits
M- Very smooth. This has a medium build for a barleywine. 
O- My favorite barleywine to date (edit; had King Henry right after this, and that blows this brew away). I have only had White Chocolate and Bligh's Barleywine. 616 charactersgueuzedreg, Nov 29, 2013

The beer is dark brown with a thin beige head. Aromas of bourbon, toffee, malt, oak. Oh my. Smells fantastic. The taste follows suit. Rich and smooth. Elegant and just a lovely beer to sip. Delicate alcoholic warmth in the finish. As good as I hoped. 271 charactersHuhzubendah, Nov 29, 2013

I was able to get a bottle of this before black Friday, $5.99. Color is super dark brown, head died quick fast. Aroma is whiskey, sweet, fruity. Flavor is fruity, boozy, and might even have a touch of bourbon county stout but maybe that is the power of suggestion. Overall, pretty solid bourbon barrel barleywine but to me not as good as Bligh's or Abacus. I never had the original King Henry either so I can't speak to that one. Still, glad I bought a couple bottles. 531 charactersArrogantB, Nov 29, 2013

Smells of whiskey and vanilla with a big oak aroma. Brown sugar and blackened toast with a slight whiff of smoke. Bourbon is quite strong and there is also a rum scent. Chocolate and coffee are present but it really is quite boozy.
Starts out sweet and quite strong Bourbon and vanilla flavors. Lots of brown sugar and whiskey without any bitterness like the smell the taste is quite boozy. Toffee candy and butter flavors mostly what I get here are whiskey flavors.
Mouthfeel is thick and oily.
Overall pretty tasty but you had better like whiskey if you drink this. 634 charactersZorro, Nov 28, 2013

A. Poured very dark brown almost black with a light amber head that retreats to a fine rim. Fairly viscous with a nice lacquer on edges of glass when swirled. Some blotchy lacing but not much to speak of.
S. Major notes of bourbon soaked oak and dark malts. Some similarites to a bcbs. Minor notes of figs, toffee, dark caramel, and raisins. 
T. Fall season fruits like apples, plums, figs, and grapes are very prolific but the bourbon and bourbon/oak is certainly present. A little vanilla and toffee. Not overly sweet at all. Dang near perfect balance. 
M. A super smooth taste with moderate carbonation, full bodied, and a clean finish. 
O. This ale blew me away. Not only is this the best BA barley wine I've ever had, it's one of my favorite beers in general. I've been lucky enough to have this repeatedly over the year and it is amazing. It has changed but not dramatically like some barley wines. I don't know how they did it but the 3 use barrel aging must be the way to go. Hats off. 1,016 charactersmacher0, Nov 27, 2013

This great idea by Goose Island pours a rich and full bodied dark, dark charred rosewood in color with a one finger, very creamy one finger beige head. As the beer pools in the glass it actually comes just short of being black. If you saw it from a distance you could easily mistake it for an imperial stout. It fully coats the glass and possesses a good amount of residual sugar. The nose is actually very similar to Bourbon County. It is a touch sweeter and and lacks the complete richness that accompanies Bourbon County but I can say that it certainly doesn't smell too much like any other barleywines out there (King Henry excluded of course). The stout influence is impressive. The beer is big and rich. It features big, sweet malt with candied sugars, chocolate, and a touch of roast and drinks like it is half Bourbon County. It has a lot of flavor. I love how much the Bourbon County influence shows itself in the aftertaste as well, resonating for a few minutes. It drinks full bodied and is very smooth. It isn't hot at all (unlike King Henry when it was released). This is a very well rounded, and polished, beer from Goose Island. I'm very impressed. I'm sure this will be all that most people could imagine a Barleywine could be. 1,271 charactersaasher, Nov 26, 2013
4.68/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bottle poured into a GI Snifter
A - Very dark and deep, almost black, brown. There is a light brown carbonation that is trailing up the sides into a small head comprised of tiny bubbles. The beer is clean looking and reflective with a light color near the sides
S - Nose initially is pure English barleywine full of dates, caramel, brown sugar, and loads of malt. After this, you get some spice from the barrel with oak, light orange, bourbon and a light chocolate presence that you'd expect from the BCBS barrels. Really good nose on this
T - Caramely barley wine that is loaded with sweetness and fruit up front with dates, vanilla, port and brown sugar. After that, a chocolately, light bourbon presence comes through that is definitely the distinctive quality from using the second use BCBS barrels. The beer has a light oak presence that adds some spice and a sweet bourbon presence that adds some strong but delicious bourbon near the finish. The milk chocolate and caramel linger on in the finish well after the beer is gone.
M - The body is thick and velvety as it comes in and slowly coats your tongue. There is actually a decent amount of carbonation that helps prevent this from being cloying. The finish has a nice spice on the finish from the light booze and oak that lingers on the tongue.
O - This is a great Barleywine and one that is definitely worth seeking out. It reminds me of King Henry without the butterscotch from the PVW barrels. This really shows to me that the second use BCBS barrels (3rd use overall barrels as they like to call it) helps adds the distinctive chocolate flavor and smoothness in this Barleywine. 1,646 charactersjeonseh, Nov 26, 2013
4.81/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Wow, just wow. One of the greatest beers I've ever had, let's do this review. 
Dated 9.24.13, poured into my generic tulip. 
Pours a deep black with some amber highlights, very minimal head that leaves a lacing down the glass. 
Smells of fig, raisins, dates and hints of bourbon. As it warms up the sweetness comes out more. 
Tastes like it smells, strong on the bourbon and a hint of the stout and its dryness at the end, that mutes the usual sweetness of a barleywine. Still syrupy and sweet. Lingers with the bourbon taste at the end. 
Mouthfeel is syrupy but dry, a very weird combo but I love it. 
I definitely plan on aging more of these and hope this isn't a one off from them. Overall a great addition to the bourbon county brand. Would highly recommend this to all barleywine fans, all bcbs fans and all beer drinkers. 833 characterstikk, Nov 25, 2013

4.49/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Dark brown nearly black with mahogany highlights around the edges in the light. Initial finger of light tan foam that settles after a few minutes. Wispy broken skim on the surface.
Rich and sweet caramelized sugars in the aroma, brown sugar, maple syrup, bourbon. Reminds me of a glaze I've made with those exact ingredients. Trace woodiness.
Toffee and caramel in spades, bourbon-soaked wood, vanilla, plum, malty bread crust in the aftertaste and dry wood. Full bodied and smooth, though the bourbon is fully present, it's more of a warming feeling. Very rich but drinkable, with some nice complexity from both the barrel and base beer. Different from King Henry obviously, but not a bad substitute by any means. 716 charactersemerge077, Oct 04, 2013
