Pours a golden amber hazy body with a one finger white head that reduces to a layer of foam and leave pretty nice heavy lacing. 
Aromas are piney and malty, caramel malt, floral hops, hop resins. On the tongue it's less malty but still sitting on pretty good malt backbone with resinous hops, citrus, grapefruit, and piney aftertaste. Mouthfeel is medium with low carbonation. 
A solid DIPA.. I could crush a few of these easily. 524 charactersgcamparone, Mar 27, 2017

So far to date, my very favorite Grimm beer. Not too carbonated, not too sweet, and a very enjoyable moment in every sip. Some of their IIPA's, though amazing, are on the sweet side and very fruity. Afterimage delivers what I would call "the perfect example of today's beer style. Not double dry hopped, not trying too hard to be fruity or bitter, this is just a great IIPA.
L: Hazy
S: Soft and fruity, hint of dough
T: All the tropical and more, with a slight bitterness
F: Calm and on the lighter side, still an above average moments
O: A high quality beer canned on 3/3/17 @ 12:38 (Thank you for this detail, it mean a lot to those who care)
I am very excited for the opening of their own brewery. They really are leading the way as a nomadic brewer and I have a feeling that great things are on the horizon. 953 charactersNickandToni, Mar 23, 2017

4.45/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Straight pour from a 16oz can to an oversized wineglass (Jester King stem piece). This was canned on March 3, 2017, making it 16 days old at the time of consumption. (Based on black ink packaging info, printed on the underside of the can: “CANNED ON 03/03/17 09:03:09”.) It’s been refrigerated for several days, and rolled around gently before drinking, as per the brewer’s suggestion. 
Appearance (4.25): This pours out about a finger and a half of fluffy, meringue-fine foam, capping a beautifully hazy but not opaque, light honey-orange body with deep orange-tan undertones. The head dies down slowly, leaving a thick film and dense, webby arcs of lace all around the sides of the glass. As the drink goes on, it leaves only scattered, fat splotches of lace and foam on the sides of the glass. 
Smell (4.25): Crazily bright, juicy fruit aromas leap out of the can: navel orange flesh, champagne mango, some passionfruit and gooseberry . . . but I feel like it’s leaning pretty hard into that juicy Clementine-type aroma. You know what? It smells like San Pellegrino aranciata. Which is awesome. There’s some cracker-like, bready aroma, too, but it’s just got juicy hop aromas draped all over it. It’s a phenomenal nose, if you crush hard for American hop varieties. 
Taste (4.5): It’s a moderate departure from the nose, leading first into snappy red grapefruit pith and underripe mango before shifting gears. That initial bitterness is quickly followed by a slowly blooming mixture of sweet navel orange, limeade, and moderately intense, slightly piney, mostly dank resin, along with a touch of green banana peel. It dissolves into a mixture of overripe pineapple, some champagne mango, but the lime flavor sticks around, leading into a finish that’s marked by lemon curd sweetness, a touch of resin, and lime zest. On the mid-palate, though, it’s just so goddamned bright and juicy. The malt, like in the nose, is mostly lost here, but it shows up by adding an earthy layer, sitting underneath the point where lime zest, orange flesh, and dankness meet just past the mid-palate. It pulls the resin and zest away from astringency, bringing them closer to a bitter coating over brioche, a bit of tobacco, and cracked wheat, and oat bran. No booze to be seen anywhere. 
Mouthfeel (4.75): Smooth, but not butter-smooth, and creamy, but not frosting-creamy. The body is on the full- side of medium-weight, but just barely; the carbonation is fine and prickly, and perfectly distributed to just about every corner; the body is soft and smooth, but not so full as to be velvety. It really is just so freaking soft. And then, the hop oils come through and dry everything out evenly and thoroughly, but short of parching. Outstanding. 
Overall (4.5): I wavered a bit on couple of the scores. I was tempted to go 4.5 in the aroma, but it’s not deep or diverse enough to warrant that. Still, it’s juicy, extremely aromatic, and lovely. I was tempted to go 4.75 on flavor, but it’s not quite so funky and unique in that department. I was tempted to give it 4.5 in appearance, but I have very high standards when it comes to lacing. All of that said, it is outstanding in every regard. It’s gorgeous, smells like a damn fruit salad (if it was half orange), tastes phenomenal, and feels nearly perfect. It is, needless to say, very highly recommended. This is, more or less, the type of beer that hope for when I get a chance to try some new (to me) NE-style (D)IPA. 3,492 charactersfmccormi, Mar 20, 2017

CAN: $4.99 plus deposit at a Whole Paycheck in New York City. 16 fl oz. Pull-tab. Fun 1980s neon-themed label design. Canned 03/03/17 (check the bottom of your can for the date).
Imperial IPA (they call it a double IPA). 8.00% ABV. Brewed at Beltway Brewing.
HEAD: ~8cm in height. Fairly frothy. Soft-looking, but not particularly creamy or fluffy or luscious. Robust enough. Lasts a good 7 minutes, leaving no lacing on the sides of the glass as it dies.
BODY: Not as hazy as one might expect of a Grimm imperial IPA. Pale slightly hazy translucent transparent copper. Lacks vibrance; it's rather dull. No yeast/lees are visible within.
A drab looking imperial IPA, Afterimage is easily inferior in appearance to its cleaner more vibrant filtered brethren. I'm optimistic, but this trend towards unfiltered turbid (I)IPAs has serious costs in terms of a beer's look.
AROMA: Tropical. Luckily there's no pineapple (I hate pineapple in beer), but there's plenty of tangerine and mango bouncing around alongside floral hop aromatics, guava, melon, pink peppercorn, marmalade, an almost bubblegum-like phenol, and candied fruit. The candied fruit sweetness coupled with the pale malt sweetness prevents any overt hop bitterness from presenting, but I wonder if that is going to come at the expense of hop pungency. 
Aromatic intensity is average. Not a "dank" or strong aroma, but a generally appealing one.
The hop profile doesn't seem terrific; one can imagine the subtle blueberry of Mosaic or the fresh floral notes of Cascade or the resins of Amarillo elevating this, but it's definitely enticing and I'm looking forward to trying it.
TASTE & TEXTURE: Sherbert-like creamy sweetness goes well with the soft coating mouthfeel. Smooth, wet, medium-bodied, almost perfectly carbonated, and refreshing. It seems Grimm has their water chemistry dialed in well judging by the mouthfeel.
There are no off-flavours and I barely find any booziness here.
Flavourwise, it's...fine. Candied fruit, orange marmalade, melon, guava, generic floral hop flavour, maybe some mango. No juicy citrus, oily resins, pine/evergreen, biting grapefruit, or Noble grassiness. Mellow pale malt and candied fruit sweetness does quell any hop bitterness, but while this isn't too sweet, I do have to say it lacks in terms of hop pungency and depth of hop flavour, not really going for the jugular in terms of emphasizing its hoppy flavours. I'm not on the "more hops! more IBUs! more bitterness!" bandwagon like many seem to be, but this definitely downplays its hops to the beer's detriment, not really committing to or showcasing its hops well.
I can't call it imbalanced, but it needs more hops and/or less sweetness to really be true to the imperial IPA style.
Flavour duration is average. Flavour intensity is below average.
I'm impressed at how well the ABV is hidden; I feel like I could down this by the pitcher.
The more I drink it, the more I appreciate its orange sherbert flavour along with its silky soft creamy texture, but in terms of that kind of build it's a few steps down from some of the beers coming from other NY breweries such as Equilibrium.
OVERALL: Not that it affects my rating, but $4.99 per 16oz can is a steep price to pay for this beer given its quality, especially with superior beers like Lagunitas Sucks available in the same market for $13.99 per sixer (let alone superior locally brewed expressions of the style from the likes of Other Half and Greenpoint). There's no doubt this is highly drinkable, and I bet many who claim not to like (I)IPAs would find this nevertheless appealing for its lack of bitterness, but it's not true to its style and doesn't offer too much of interest hop-wise. Chalk it up to personal preference if you must, but as much as I adore many Grimm beers this one just doesn't deserve a spot in a list of the Top 250 beers currently being brewed.
Nevertheless, it's nice stuff I'd probably pick up an odd six pack of from time to time were it $10, and the mouthfeel in particular is masterfully executed.

Beer pours out a deep gold/orange in color with a medium to medium minus haze and soapy bright white head. Aroma definitely has that charactaristic GRIMM sweetness with lots of Pineapple and Peaches along with a good amount of oniony dankness. Aroma translates to the palate along with a medium to medium plus vinous bitterness like chewing on grape stems. Solid medium mouthfeel in line with it's ABV. A solid overall offering from GRIMM that blends tropical NE flavors with plenty of bitterness. 93 points. 544 charactersMikeyMcD86, Mar 11, 2017

S:  Very tropical with mango, pineapple, apricot and some huge dank smells.

4.85/5  rDev +9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Canned 8/17/16. Consumed 8/29/16.
A: Pours a hazy orange with about a half finger of white head, which dissipates rather quickly. Pretty much completely opaque, almost on the level of a Tree House / Trillium beer. ABV is apparent as thick lacing runs up the glass. 
S: Insanely tropical in such a unique way. In addition to the ‘typical’ tropical fruit notes (peach, pineapple, mango), I get a combination of some crazy exotic, super sweet, almost candy-like fruit flavors. Tons of passionfruit, pineapple, honeydew, strawberry, papaya, and tangerine. An underlying, very sweet malt—kind of like high-quality, artisanal honey—is also apparent. It’s just smells so damn sweet, almost to the point of artificiality. But there’s also a light pine character that reminds you you’re smelling hops rather than fruit. Simply put, it smells freaking delicious.
T: Follows the nose to an extent, but leans more on the citrus end of the spectrum vs. the tropical end. BIG notes of candied orange, tangerine, and a hint of grapefruit. All those exotic tropical fruits—pineapple, passionfruit, strawberry, honeydew, papaya--are present too, but dialed back a bit. Sweet bready malt hits in the middle, providing notes of toasted caramel and brown sugar. The finish is a mix of mouth-coating sweet citrus and a very mild appearance of piney dankness, which brings with it a medium bitterness to attempt to balance out the sweetness.
M: Mouthfeel is on the fuller side of medium. After drinking a bunch of Tree House beers, it’s tough to call this one creamy, but it definitely leans toward full. The bitterness is restrained, but apparent. It feels necessary to balance out some of the sweetness and keep this from being cloying. Carbonation is a bit light, maybe medium minus. I might prefer it with a bit more effervescence on the feel, but overall, it's super soft and silky smooth.
O: This is one of the most intensely flavorful and aromatic DIPAs I’ve ever had. It demonstrates such a unique combination of hops/yeast/malts to bring out the most exotically tropical aspects of the hops used. It’s unapologetically sweet, but not at all in a malty/cloying way. More than any other beer I’ve had, the this one epitomizes the ‘candied fruit’ descriptor damn near perfectly. And at 8%, it goes down way too easily. If I could change anything, I'd maybe opt for slightly more creaminess to accompany the sweetness. That signature Tree House 'bubblegum' / banana bread yeasty note would do wonders in conjunction with the flavor profile of this beer. And a bit more carbonation would be welcome! But overall, Afterimage is another awesome beer from Grimm, and likely my favorite of those I've had the chance to try. 2,734 charactersavas, Aug 30, 2016
4.59/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5The hype is a little much. This is an excellent, well-balanced double IPA, but not world class, and probably not worth the effort of trying to track it down. There are better, more accessible big ipas in nyc.
Edit: I change my mind. I was in a pissy mood the other night... I had it again among other decent beers I thought were at this level, and none of them could compare. This beer is just an excellent example of a well-balanced, juicy, complex, New England double IPA. Worth the effort of finding it. 507 charactersspacemanspiff13, Aug 30, 2016

4.3/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Picked this up a while back in New York, finally getting around to this tonight. Canned on 3/8 but still tasting fresh and without a lot of (big) floaties in this. Loved the other Grimm  Ales that I've had and once again, this was a "meal in a can" as this took a while to savor but only because this was so complex in flavor that I had to let it fully warm up. Beer like this demands a big block of time to enjoy it and to admire the Tommy Boy Records-like label!
Good pour to this as it came out golden, with the aforementioned floaties in here with a sufficiently thick head that didn't last for terribly long. Only a few thick cloud-like patches of lacing remained on the top third of my pint glass as the foam didn't stay around for terribly long either. Lots of marmalade, sweetness, candied sugar, and a fair amount of booze in the nose with more in the taste. Breaded malt, sweet malt, tropical fruits like melon and honeydew, were all in the taste to accompany a faint but lasting hop presence of pine and spruce. Low on carbonation, the malt stuck around in the aftertaste as the finish was quite clean here with a nice juicy and waxy coating staying in my mouth until the next sip. How these guys pack so much into one brew remained a mystery to me but there was a *lot* of depth to this that took a while to unravel. 
This was fairly strong but with so much going on here, you wouldn't even know it until the liquid was fully downed. IPA's are a dime a dozen, as I've stated in a ton of my reviews, but a beer like this almost calls to be placed into a category that doesn't even currently exist. Beer is sometimes referred to as "liquid bread" and after having this, it's easy to see why that nickname has been in existence for ages. Yet another offering and brewery killing it in the Big Apple right now! 1,820 charactersJerzDevl2000, Jun 23, 2016

I smell grapefruit and unsweetened orange marmalade. 
Tastes like fresh grapefruit initially along with a bit of alcohol and pale, fully malted barley.  This gives the beer a rich body with an elevated carbonation.  The flavor is long lasting after the swallow in a prickly way. 415 characterssmcolw, May 28, 2016

4.06/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A very interesting brew. I had it first on tap in Brooklyn, and then again tonight from a can at a pizza joint near Union Square. Poured from a can dated 3/8/16 into a Teku glass.
Look: Gorgeous. Super turbid/hazy/whatever, beautiful dark amber color with a nice pillowy head
Smell: Smells interesting. Kind of fruity.
Taste: Not what I expect from a DIPA, it's almost... Saison-y. It's got a sharpness to it with very little hop bitterness to it. Slightly tart, very unique and interesting beer. I like it. Don't love it, but I like it.
Feel: Great, pillowy mouthfeel
Overall: A DIPA unlike any I've ever had. Very unique beer drinking experience. 649 charactersDeweyCheatem-n-Howe, Apr 27, 2016

Look- Pours a very hazy dark gold with thick floaties stirring about. There is a generous finger of creamy white foam that surfaces, then settles into some beautiful lacing on the glass. 
Smell- Pineapple, passionfruit, grapefruit and mango. Juicy!
Taste- Passionfruit, grapefruit, some pineapple and orange peel. There is a rye-like spice that surfaces in the finish. Some floral notes come out as well. 
Feel- Slick, light and very easy to drink for 8 percent. 
Overall- A tropical juicy beer with a hint of some hop spice that assaults the palate, then washes it all down with a slick malt backbone. World class indeed! 743 charactersPrager62, Apr 20, 2016

4.52/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From a fresh growler, pours a fairly bright orange. Definitely hazy, but not opaque. Nice 2 fingers of foam leave decent lacing. 
Smells like candied fruit--oranges, grapefruit and tropical mango type things. Taste is all that, but with a spicy hop element that keeps it from being fruit overload. There's a yeasty fruit note in there, like the slightest hint of a banana/clove thing, but it's way back and very subtle. Light bitterness, but it sticks around nicely with a fruity aftertaste that goes on forever. 
Feel is a smooth medium, with a pleasant creamy heft. Overall a really great IIPA from Grimm. 609 charactersBeers-es, Apr 10, 2016

Pours a hazy, bright orange color with one inch of white head and low to moderate carbonation evident. Tons of orange, citrus hops, tropical fruits, fruity malts, mangos, floral notes, and lemon zest. Medium body and moderate carbonation.
Overall a great DIPA; one of the best I've had from an NYC brewery. I loved this and would love to see it around more often or to get some cans of it. 465 charactersmdfb79, Apr 08, 2016

Smell is what stands out here but the taste comes up really short compared to the smell.  On the softer end for mouthfeel.  Little bit of bitterness, definitely more than other Grimm beers.  Surprisingly clear, could see right through the glass.  Not one of my favorites from Grimm but a solid IPA. 334 charactersBltByKrmn, Apr 07, 2016

Bright golden color with a copper hue. Kinda like peach skin. Mostly clear it seems but if I put my hand behind the glass I realize there's a haze here. Frothy pale white head is full and fluffy. Lace sticks everywhere. 5
Sticky mango and passionfruit are the aroma. Overripe pineapple with some residual sugar aroma. Smells a lot like juice. 4.25
Damn. Fruit juice is no exaggeration. This does taste like a pineapple and mango mixture. Light passionfruit and a grapefruit finish. I had my beer-hating wife sample it and she said " Is that grapefruit juice?" I told her it was an IPA (her idea of the worst possible beer) and she tried it again and couldn't believe it. Grimm, if you're listening, you've done magic. 4.5
I'll just reiterate the juiciness. It's got the consistency of a Jugomex nectar, thick and almost pulpy. It's got some real sweetness up front but finishes dry, bitter and zesty and a touch peppery. 4.5
Grimm does these juice bomb/juice box IPAs exceptionally well and this brew is no exception. Fantastic. I'm just pissed I only had one can and it's now gone. 1,130 charactersONovoMexicano, Apr 04, 2016

L - orange, hazy to the point of being opaque, one finger head fades to a thin layer
S - pungent marmalade and mango, a little biscuit
T - more fruit, especially orange juice and lychee, somewhat dry for a NE style IPA, malt and yeast take a backseat, a little pine, surprisingly mild bitterness on the finish given the huge hop flavor
F - creamy, low to medium carbonation, slightly numbing
O - I liked this slightly better than the spring 2016 release.  I could drink this every day.  One can only hope their new Brooklyn brewery means more volume.

early 2016 review:
L - yellow, slight haze, one-finger head made of small bubbles that sticks around
S - pear, passion fruit, more pear
T - follows the nose, with a little bitter grass and pine added, not very bitter given the extreme hoppiness, somewhat dry, lychee aftertaste lasts forever
F - tiny champagne-like bubbles, low to medium carbonation, medium thickness
O - similar to Grimm's other DIPAs, but with more of a dry sparkling wine kind of impression 1,075 characterscfalls, Apr 03, 2016

4.53/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours a pale gold, very bright but quite hazy.  1 finger eggshell head.  Good lacing and a thin layer of foam remains once it recedes.
Very bright aroma.  Lemon, orange, mango, and peach.  Straw and very light cracker-y malt.  Mild pine and bread dough as the beer warms.
Taste much like the aroma.  Tropical and citrus hops.  Some floral hints with pine towards the end.  Doughy malt is stronger than the nose.  Really get the lemon throughout.
Medium body with medium carbonation.  Incredibly smooth.  Big hops, fruity and low bitterness.  Lemon lingers for days.
Really great DIPA.  Drinks like a session IPA.  I like it more with each sip. 647 charactersleroybrown10, Apr 03, 2016

Comes in golden with eggshell head. Very cloudy with some floaties, definitely unfiltered. Smells like sweet ripe papaya, mango, passionfruit, it's a tropical juice bomb! The Grimms are spot on about the three week mark, this is exploding with flavor, even compared to the same beer two weeks ago. Flavor is sweet tropical fruits, sweet bready malts, and a mid mouth rush of resin and dank/ earthy hops. Mouthfeel is creamy, with soft carb like all Grimm ipas. Another winner, worth the hype from Grimm. I hope they grow and their beer gets easier to buy 578 charactersBiaSongThan, Apr 02, 2016

Orange zest, sweet grapefruit, cat pee (in a good way), and melon notes make a very delectable, medium strength aroma.
Wow, bright taste, a lot going on.  All the flavors of the nose are here in a well balanced presentation, but there are myriad undernotes that are hard to give names.  It is a touch less sweet than the aroma predicted, and has a drying bitter that wasn't in the bouquet.  As it warms I get peach and mango notes.  Really delicious.
Nicely low carb. and medium viscosity, with a killer, clean finish that is just juicy enough.
Excellent beer, somewhat overpriced and hard to get, but very delicious, and recommended. 767 characterscavedave, Mar 28, 2016

F: Evenly bodied with soft, plush carbonation - very smooth
O: Really enjoyed this offering from Grimm. Although Tesseract is my favorite, Afterimage represents an equally juicy and dry offering that when combined with its citrus profile certainly deserves its well regarded status 639 charactersFireman_RK, Mar 25, 2016

4.2/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This beer pours a cloudy golden orange reminiscent of orange juice. The head is one finger and bright white. The retention is solid and there are plenty of thin hanging sheets of lacing. Smell is a bit more subdued than other Grimm offerings, but still awesome. Grapefruit, mango, orange, pineapple and some pithy citrus all blend together to form a very complex aroma. Taste is similar with a solid amount of bitterness that seems to lessen as the beer warms (still a good deal more bitter than any Grimm IPA other than Pulse Wave). The tropical and citrus fruit is there, but not as prevalent as in the smell because the bitterness seems to stymie them a bit. There is also just a subtle hint of honey-like malt sweetness. Feel is medium with the bitterness tickling the tongue on the finish. Not nearly as soft and juicy as most of their offerings. Also a bit under carbonated. Overall an excellent beer, but definitely a level below the world class standards Grimm has set with their other hoppy offerings. 1,010 charactersCNoj012, Mar 24, 2016

S:  A big aromatic bouquet that you expect from the heavy hitters. Big quality and depth of aroma. Grapefruit.

As Lord Vader would say, "Impressive, most impressive."
Wow, the aroma is so pungent that it hit me nostrils 3 inches from the glass with a blast of pineapple, melon like honeydew, papaya, orange, light grapefruit, peach and seemingly endless waves of citrus fruit and citrus hops. Dank...juicy...oily...all appropriate here to describe what I'm inhaling. Best part is that all this fresh hoppy goodness is mixed with tobacco, fresh piney hops, caramel, gummy bears candy, tangerine, honey and a sweet malt base that brings melted butter and biscuits to mind as a backbone. One of the best smelling DIPA/IPA's I've ever encountered.
Thankfully the taste is on par with the nose; a notch slightly below, but still incredibly tasty. A wonderful mix of dank citrus hops brings on papaya, orange, pineapple, honeydew melon, grapefruit, peach, tangerine, mango, apricot and all kinds of fresh fruity flavors. The malt base is there to prop it up with toasted grains, sweet malt, brown sugar, buttery biscuit, toffee, caramel and lots of fruity candy such as Razzles, gummy bears, skittles and some mild candied Belgian sugar. No yeast to speak of, no real bitterness, but some faint spices like pepper, cinnamon and coriander peek through before being washed away by citrus fruit and the accompanying floral hop and citrus hop tidal wave. This is so fruity, but not cloyingly sweet, so much so that each sip impressed me more and more. Simple yet very complex and an outstanding use of hops.
Mouthfeel is creamy, slick and smooth, with a velvety feel that slides down and gives off only a slight bitterness; some people may want more bitterness in a DIPA, but I loved how easy this was to drink at 8% ABV, to me this was session-able. The body was medium with some chewiness, mild carbonation and a finish that was hoppy, sweet and packed with citrus fruit and tons of flavor. This was a pleasure to drink, a world class DIPA...a very high recommendation. 2,190 charactersCHickman, Mar 19, 2016

Hazy, straw blonde. Good head, good carb. My olfactory system is pretty shot but what I got was very sweet, pleasant summer fruits—peaches, nectarines, apricots—rounded off by traces of ripe tropical mango, dragonfruit, guava, papaya, passion fruit...
All those flavors are present but this beer is WAY hop/citrus forward. Intense grapefruit, lemon zest, orange juice... Total West Coast IPA from tiny East Coast upstart. Mid-range bitterness. Moderately sweet but minimal malt presence. Not boozy whatsoever. Right up my alley for a DIPA. Easy thirst quencher for hotter days/warmer climates but complex enough to pair well with grilled whitefish, roasted pork tenderloin, charcuterie platter (in lieu of a fruit paste...). 
Instead of West Coast or New York I feel like I should be drinking this while running cocaine on a small boat in the humidity off the coast of Florida... 1,032 charactersMista_Carta, Jan 29, 2016

This is just as good as I remember the first batch being, and strikes a great balance between Lambo Door and Tesseract. Look is a nice hazy yellow-orange, but not incredibly turbid. Smell smacks you right in the face when you crack the can - mango, white grape, melon, and a bit of pine on the finish. Taste follows - incredible juicy flavor with just the right amount of bitter on the finish. This is incredibly drinkable for a DIPA, I finished the 16oz can much faster than intended. Soft mouthfeel, similar to other Grimm IPAs, perhaps a little under-carbed. Overall, this is phenomenal and possibly even edges out Tesseract for me. 663 charactersberto714, Dec 10, 2015

L: Appears a vibrant, golden yellow color with a solid finger of head. Nice sticky lacing.
S: Tropical fruit on the nose. I get a lot of mango an pineapple. 
T: Follows the nose with tropical and candied fruits. Very little bitterness, no alcohol, and very little malt flavor. Definitely hop forward and in the same vein as the powerhouse juicy NE style IIPAs.
Feel: Medium bodied, almost fluffy, mouthfeel. Very easy to drink.
Overall, this is a great juicy IIPA, comparable to the juicy IIPAs from NE. 542 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Oct 23, 2015

Pours a golden/hair color. Big 3 finger head, and lacing all over. 
Nose was tons of tropical fruit. Mango predominantly for me. Tons of hops with a nice resinous characteristic. 
Flavor paired very will with the nose. Tropical fruits, hops, and resin everywhere. Just bitter enough to complete an outstandingly flavorful imperial IPA. Great refreshing taste. Masks the 8% abv very well. 
Medium bodied with strong carbonation. Refreshing with a little bitter/resinous aftertaste. 
Overall, a fantastic beer. Thanks to my friend in NY, this is the 4th Grimm offering I have got my hands on, and it's by far my favorite. 724 charactersAllDayIPA23, Oct 19, 2015

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a slightly hazy pale yellow orange color with good clarity and vision of bubbles coming up through the glass.  Frothy lacing down the glass as the beer was drank. 
Smell:  Tropical, citrus, candied stone fruit, tangerine, grapefruit, apricot, caramel, bready, biscuity, and toasted malts. 
Taste:  Nice blend of hops and malt.  Very balanced and tasty.  Some chewy notes and bitterness in there too. 
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, medium bodied, delicious, medium carbonation, a little chewy, and light bitterness. 
Overall:  One of the best DIPA'S out there.  Definitely getting another one. 723 charactersFlounder57, Oct 17, 2015

4/4.5/4.25/4.25/4.25
Hazy yellow-brown with pillowy head. 
It smells delightfully fruity...Mosaic? Nelson? Mango and weed. Lovely. 
Quite bitter and lemony, with an earthy spiciness that hints at Belgian yeast and lingers enticingly. Some (okay, kind of a lot) of sweet wheat. Herbal finish. On the sweeter, juicier side of DIPAs. 
Thick and fun. 
Good, but not quite great. Nearly though! 465 charactersAgentMunky, Oct 16, 2015

L: Golden ale with 1 finger head that quickly dissipates
S: Amazingly juicy with notes of stone fruits, white grape, citrus, dank earthy weed, and a pinch of fresh cut grass
T: Same as the smell but adds another layer of juicy dank hops. Amazing. Each sip leaves you wanting another.
F: Very smooth mouthfeel while also very juicy. The finish is suprisingly dry for how juicy this beer is.
O: Very solid brew from start to finish. Taste reminds me of a sweet hop bomb. It really wasn't too sweet though and finishes with a nice burst of fruity hops. Would love to see them can this regularly. Well done Grimm! 656 charactersflskydiver, Oct 08, 2015

Smell is fantastic. Notes of mango, peach, fresh orange, cotton candy, melon is prominent.
Taste is also incredible. The isn't a bitter hop bomb at all, it's sweet and has tropical citrus. Pineapple, mango, grapefruit, and tons of melon. Maybe the slightest hint of bell pepper. 
Mouthfeel is great. Goes down like candy. Like Capri Sun, as Grimm aptly puts it.
Phenomenal beer. I've also had Lambo door which was incredible and both are up there as two of the better IPAs I've ever had. I look forward to their next release. 662 charactersJordonHoltzman, Oct 08, 2015

Extremely drinkable, without even trying I drank the pint in 5 minutes. I was only able to get one can from a local bottle shop but hopefully can get more in the near future. I drank my first Zombie Dust the next night which didn't compare to how awesome AfterImage. Look out for Grimm, they're poised to make some major noise in the beer world soon. 439 charactersBeerKarmaNYC, Oct 05, 2015

4.69/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer was served on tap at Tap and Mallet in Rochester, New York.  It arrived in a house snifter showing off a ruddy auburn, toasted apricot coloring.  It held a creamy, wispy one finger head of solid heady bubbling.  This retained well before disappearing into outlines of mountains around our glasses.  Definite haze obscured clarity, and the beer just had this salty look about it.  No sediment was noted.  Carbonation appeared to be lighter.  The aroma was where things really starting getting crazy.  This has got to be the fruitiest, most intensely juicy and melony hoppy explosion we’ve ever encountered.  Hoppy aromatics were melon, poppy citrics, and sweet grassy varietals, while the remainder of the nose’s receptors were flooded with clean and lightly toasted pale grain, soft white wheatiness, raw barley, green strawberry tops, pear juice and macerated flesh, the freshest lemon and orange juiciness, dusty pollen, candied cashews, cotton candy cloy but without the esterness, big mineral twangs, sweet ethanol, green grassy resins, and Kool Aid sugars.  With warmth came rum, sweet tea, and so, so, so much honey sweetness.  The flavoring translates with insane, mechanical accuracy into a flowery sashay of skinned cucumber, spicy, zesty, juicy, and incredibly poppy citric, tropical nectary, and floral hops, white chalk, cantaloupe and watermelon rind, graphite, heavy lemon peel and seed, dripping wet washed peaches and passion fruit, simmered holiday cranberries, and pale and clean light amber graininess.  The aftertaste gave exaggerated notes of bittered citric peel hoppiness and massive waves of clean vanilla fruitiness.  The body was a solid, full medium, and the carbonation was high and electric.  Each sip gave silky slurp and smack off the rip, with a lighter creaminess or frothiness.  Pop was rolled into the carbonation, and nearly indistinguishable on its own.  The mouth is coated in the softest snow of bubbliness, leading you to the lightest touch of a dry, crispy, hoppy finish.  The abv is appropriate, and all but undetectable, and the beer drinks absolutely phenomenally.  The problem is that you want to savor it because this might be your only glass ever.
Overall, this was an incredible treat.  After having heard about this one from several different people we’ve been trying to track it down.  Low and behold, on a random day when we’re not even looking for it, we stumble upon it.  Fate, as some would say.  Joking aside, this is one of the best beers we’ve ever had.  The nose is unforgettably and supremely fruity, with the predominant notes being tropical fruit, citrus, and above all, flushed with melon.  From the first to the last whiff it gets sweeter and sweeter, with bigger honey by the empty glass than any other beer we’ve seen.  Honestly, cannot be improved upon.  Perfect five for aroma.  Again, as stated above, when moving to the taste, there are very few beers that do it as seamlessly as this one does.  The likes of Heady Topper comes to mind.  Fruit to the walls, but it never becomes overly soggy, syrupy, boggy, or burdensome.  You just want more and more of it.  The 8.0% abv tag is surprising, as it is essentially imperceptible, and doesn’t slow you down at all.  Again, much in the same way as some of the best in the business.  This is one of the cleanest DIPAs to come across our table in a long time, giving us faith that there is still some pretty untouchable stuff out there waiting to be had. 3,492 charactersTheBrewo, Oct 04, 2015

The aroma is dominated by sweet tropical fruits. The taste follows the nose, orange,pineapple, cantaloupe, passion fruit, peach, and a bit of bready sweetness. Really drinkable, like juice. I have to say this is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Reminiscent of Lambo Doors. Definitely worth your while. 397 charactersIsz9, Oct 03, 2015

4.47/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5On draft, NYC, 37F, 12 ounce fluted tulip snifter.
Nose aroma is special. Refined, balanced and mathematical.
Texture isn't too light, but also not very heavy for an 8.0% abv ale. Triple beam malts and hops here.
Taste is definitely equisite, but for this style of hop blend (nelsony and simcoey), its not the best, but very close to it. Plenty of fruity notes, followed by organic two row pungencey, followed by dank hops. Pretty amazing in terms of whats availible in the North East tri state market, still not as complex or flavorful as  Grey Sail, Singlecut, or Other Half.
Afterimage, while it is an amazing product (definitely seek it out) it tasted very similar to Grey Sail Captains Daughter, which I preferred more, mainly because of the more extreme malt presence and dry hop schedule.
Very impressed with Grimm Artisanal ales. Seriously top notch, and they certainly have a Vermont and Massachussets juicy cloudy IPA influence, but I think that Other Half, Grey Sail and Singlecut do it slightly better in terms of IPA's. 
Cannot wait to try some of their imperial stouts.
I will also mention that I think their bottle and can art and graphic design is absolutely amazing. Inspired by the 80's sci-fi generation of Automan, V, and Predator. 
A+ for the design people behind the logos and label artwork. 1,321 characterspinyin, Oct 03, 2015

Got caught up in the hype of just being able to obtain a can so expectations were very high, especially after Grimm placing two beers in the Dbl IPA contest. Tasted direct from can and then from glass. It pours a nice hazy orange. It smells like hops but with no real distinction of what hops might be. I didn't get the fruitiness that others did. Certainly not like Treehouse Haze or Sip of Sunshine. It did not feel like a double, more like a 6% beer. Overall very good but not the equal of some other Northeast IPAs out there. 572 charactersDVP, Oct 02, 2015

But that's the closest I can find for flaws in this dipa. Insane fruity hop aroma with passion fruit, grapefruit and guava up front. Flavor is similar fruity/ tropical hops with a dank spice in the background. Malt is very light and lands way behind the hops. Mouthfeel is just incredible. Soft, dry on the finish, seems insanely light for the ABV. Props. 460 charactersSimont, Oct 02, 2015

very good beer. super duper juicy. abv is invisible and drinks like a fruit drink. more citric than tropical but definitely a nod to tropical fruit in this mostly soft citric hopped brew. very very drinkable...dangerously so...hard not to gulp. this beer will probably not change your life, but it might depending on what you dig, that said...very worth checking out. nice job by the locals! 510 charactersimonhiatus, Sep 30, 2015

On the level with Heady Topper and Sip of Sunshine.
Murky unfiltered appearance with a short tight head on top. 
Aroma is bursting with fruity hops. 
Taste is assertively bold while remaining balanced with the hop bitterness & flavors, and malt sweetness.
Mouthfeel is excellent, with an almost creamy texture from the carbonation.

The taste follows, with passion fruit, peach, sweet mango prolonged through the middle, maybe guava, and a slight bready and wheaty touch before a hint of pine hits and a lingering slight bitterness. Very well made. Would like a bit more bitterness but for what they were going for, this is spot on. 376 charactersDustin_Sallitt, Sep 30, 2015
4.44/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Purchased a growler of this from Vista Beer and Beverage in NY.
Pours a hazy yellow-orange; seems to be becoming the standard pour for so-called "East Coast" IPAs. Not much head, but there is some pleasing lacing that clings to the glass during consumption. Some carbonation is visible, but not a particularly large amount. Overall quite nice in this regard.
After unscrewing the cap on my growler, my nose was immediately awash in a strong, but not overbearing peachy aroma. Aside from the peach I'm getting some other lighter tropical fruits as well, namely pineapple and a little orangey citrus. Smells very juicy; not detecting much pine resin, dankness, or malt presence in the nose. Definitely a pleasing scent though.
The taste is a little more complex than the nose, but predominantly fruity. I'm getting a lot of tropical fruits throughout though the backend does feature some bitterness and just a little resin. Not detecting any alcohol; I could easily drink this all day.
The mouth feel is somewhat thick for the style as are most of the newer East Coast IPAs. I'd prefer more carbonation than what is present but that's biggest complain; the beer is otherwise luscious and creamy and features an incredible aftertaste with plenty of lingering bitterness. Definitely closer to a wet than dry finish.
Overall Afterimage is an excellent beer, though slightly weaker than what I was expecting given the hype behind its release. My biggest problem is that while the juiciness in itself is quite pleasing and complex, there isn't enough of a musty/dank hop profile to complement it, nor enough bitterness (before the aftertaste). I'd drink this at any chance I'd get, but it falls a rung short of elite in the style for me. 1,735 charactersTomMorris, Sep 29, 2015

Hazy orange colored body topped by a small, frothy white head that sticks well.  Juicy hop aroma: peach, pineapple, mango, and apricot with a slight herbal edge.  Flavor is equally fruity and juicy bringing much of the same to the party...passion fruit joining the other tropical fruits.  Not terribly bitter, not too sweet, and lighter than expected which, in addition to the light carbonation and soft dryness, makes for a very drinkable beverage.  Grimm seems to have a knack for turning out all things juicy... 527 characterswedge, Sep 26, 2015

A - Looks like a standard East coast IPA.  A wheat-colored yellow/orange with a bubbly off-white head that's not going anywhere.  It's glowing!
N - Smell this one from a mile away.  Bright, juicy hops with very little bitterness.  Lots of citrus and pine.  Very pungent and inviting.
T - Yeah, so much like the nose.  Plenty of juicy hops, but absolutely no bitterness.  It's all juice.  Most impressively the flavor is tremendous, but the finish is squeaky clean.  A thirst-quenching IPA with absolutely no alcohol.
M - Just what I love; immediate froth.  No liquid whatsoever by the time it hits my tongue.  It's like drinking hoppy cotton candy.
O - An impressive offering from Grimm.  Better than their sours as far as I'm concerned. 824 charactersCraftFan5, Sep 25, 2015

This pours a nice hazy and thick looking orangey peach color, with a half inch head, and a good amount of lacing.
Smells like peach, pineapple, honey, sweet malt, pine, and cannabis.
This is another great big awesome DIPA from Grimm. It's fairly sweet, with a huge candied fruit character, tons of peach, pineapple, and orange. Beyond that big sweetness up front, there's a fairly herbal bitter finish, with a twinge of marijuana. The bitterness is definitely nice, and keeps the sweetness in check.
This is medium bodied, fairly thick for a DIPA, and slightly syrupy, with a moderate level of carbonation.
Grimm continues to kill it with Afterimage here, another slam dunk for sure. 752 charactersGreesyFizeek, Sep 23, 2015
