Smells slightly tart with a with something mildly unsanitary - supposedly a dirty sock. The flavors were similer, it was not strong and upfront but very mild and very balance. The apricots are hard to notice. It's mildly sour and sweet with a characteristic funk.  Very easily drinkable that doesn't leave your teeth eroded. Definitely a beer a single person can handle. The mouthfeel is light bodied with mild acidity. Overall I expected flavors to be heavy and apricots upfront. It was not the case, instead it was very balance and easily drinkable. 656 charactersBenish, May 07, 2017

Aromas, of ripe apricot, white bread, hay, and barnyard funk. The taste followed closely - the fruit was there but restrained. The funk was also restrained and melded well with the sweet flavors. Not much tartness. A dry but layered feel. So happy to enjoy this. 377 charactersBuck89, May 06, 2017

It seems like I'm biting in a fresh slighty acidic unripe apricot. All along the main attributes might be its fruitness and the fact that it's damn well refreshing. Tart but not acidic the beer delivers a brett apricot and mango smell. The taste is never sour but still very fruity and slighty herbal. The lambic ain't too funky here. 
The highlights of this very sought after beer are its simplicity and its balanced.  A beer to love. I'm dying waiting to try the bottle I have in the basement. Hoping for a bigger complexity along the balance.
Few weeks later from the bottle. Same unripe apricot presence but as it warms up, more and more like an apricot pie. Perfect balance for a lambiec based beer. 751 charactersBruno74200, Apr 14, 2017

Smell is sourish but you get notes of hay barnyard and horse blanket with lemon; not much fruit.  Taste is very balanced with a little fruit sweetness in the middle.  It gets sweeter as the beer warms.  Not overly sour, just the right amount of balance in all its different aspects.  Feel is light and moderately carbonated.  Overall I understand what the hype is about.  Super balanced sour beer but you don't really get much apricot, only generalize fruit sweetness.  Still excellent however. 562 charactersAmguerra305, Apr 04, 2017

The taste is tart, acidic, light fruit, slight pepper and herbal notes. The feel is very mild and crisp, very inviting.

Sticky, peachy apricot is all over nose, with a little funk and sting. They really bring the fruit forward here--I've had a lot of beers purporting to have apricot in them which turns out to be almost undetectable. This vaunted sour is truly earning its reputation.
Refreshing apricot and peach with a little bitter mango. That's all there is to say about the flavor, which is a wonderful thing. It starts tart to sour, with a wet feel, and a slight acetic burn, but only just enough. 608 charactersSabtos, Nov 07, 2016

Fades into a nice ring around the glass. A nice bright tart aroma with some funk, a little barnyard, unripe peach and apricot. A pleasant sour acidity, with a full apricot and peach fruit flavor. The funk and barrel is subtle, but really brings it together. Feel is light and fizzy with carbonation, finishes dry and quite tart. It is superb and worth seeking out. 452 charactersRi0, Oct 21, 2016

Also, had a fresh bottle afterwards generously handed out by Jean-Pierre to each table. It had yet to undergo the secondary fermentation, so was obviously quite different. And while not as great as a normal bottle, it was certainly interesting. 356 charactersmoose1980, Sep 06, 2016

Cloudy orange with a thin khaki head that remains as a thin ring and leaves spots of lace. The smell is of unripe apricots with subtle vinegar tartness.

Appearance: It poured a hazy golden orange colour with a two finger white head with pretty good retention and left sparse lacing.
Aroma: Funky, sour, apricot, stone fruit and citrusy lemon.
Taste: Sour, tart, apricot, mango, orange, barnyard, hay with a hint of vinegar.
Mouthfeel: Crisp, light bodied with moderate spritzy carbonation.
Overall: Wow, really good. Easily a must buy in my book and I’m definitely on the lookout for it. 552 characterskitch, Aug 16, 2016

Had this at The Sovereign in DC, served tableside by the house Cicerone. I'm a sucker for Apricots so this has always been on my radar. This was a 2015 bottle, pours a yellow staw color with some haze. Lightly carb'd gives a very nice mouthfeel. There was fantastic fresh apricot upon first smell and taste, giving way to some tart and funky notes. This was not overly sour or funky, which I appreciated greatly. This was an easy drink and a really exceptional beer. Lucky to finally try it 613 charactersoskinker, Jun 27, 2016

4.65/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I got a bottle of Cantillion's Fou' Foune for $24.99 at The Lager Mill.  I've been wanting to try this beer for a very a long time and I can't wait to see what it's like, so lets see how it goes.  2015 Vintage.  Poured from a green 750ml corked and caged bottle into a teku.  
A-  The label loos good, it's got a classic and artistic look to it, I think it's a little eye catching.  It poured a nice orange color that took on more of a brighter orange color when held to the light with two fingers worth of fizzy and fluffy slightly off white head that died down to a thing ring that eventually faded away and it left a little bit of spotty lacing behind.  This is a very nice looking beer, I have no complaints.  
S-  The aroma starts off with a slightly higher amount of medium sweetness with some funky yeast aromas being the first to show up with a horse blanket and a wet straw like aroma and it leads into a noticeable sour aroma followed by  the fruits with apricots showing up the most with some fruitiness in the background and the apricot has a nice natural aroma that isn't too overpowering.  Towards the end comes a little more sourness with some fruitiness showing up towards the end.  This beer has a great aroma, the apricot is showcased very well.
T-  The taste seems to be similar to the aroma and it starts off with a medium amount of sweetness with the apricot being the first to show up imparting some great fruit and apricot flavors and it's followed by a higher amount of sourness.  Up next comes that same funky yeast that I got in the aroma, but this time it's a little lighter. and it's followed by a little bit of a malty flavor.  On the finish comes more of that high sourness with a nice fruity aftertaste with a little funk.  This is a great fantastic tasting beer, all the flavors work really well together.  
M-  Fairly smooth, a little refreshing, crisp, a little fizzy, medium bodied with a slightly higher amount of medium carbonation and not too acidic.  The mouthfeel is very good and it works great with this beer.  
Overall I thought this was a fantastic beer and I thought it was a world class example of the style, I've had a couple apricot sours before, but this one took it to a whole other lever and it really proves why this beer is so highly regarded and searched after.  This beer had nice drinkability, the sourness might wear on me, but since it's not too acidic I could see myself drinking the full bottle, especially if it was warm out.  What I liked the most about this beer was that everything worked great together and nothing felt out of place.  What I liked the least about this beer is nothing, it sucks it's so hard to find, but as far the beer goes there's not a single thing about it that I would change other than the availability.  I would for sure buy this beer again if I see it again and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Sours and apricot sours.  All in all I was impressed with this one, it really lives up to it's title of being world class and I would drink this often if I could easily get it.  It made for a great first impression for this brewery and it's easily my favorite apricot sour and one of my favorite sours.  Fantastic job guys, this is a world class beer. 3,249 charactersStoutHunter, May 05, 2016

My second time having it (previous was 2014). Consumed solo over poetry on a lovely spring afternoon.
Massive foam at pour fades to loose bubbles
The smell is apricots soaked in orange juice
Taste follows. Apricot is there, but it's mainly apricot skins. White grapes and orange pulp and tannins and some noble hop cheese? Or is that just the oak? Aggressively dry but not phlegmy. Apricot nicely present on aftertaste.
Rather full mouthfeel, which is where so many American approximations fall short.

Aroma is a smooth blend of fruity and floral, perfume like quality of fresh roses, some sweet apricot concentrate. Characteristic Belgian gueuze funk and undelying buteric acid, some lactic notes...some pepper. But oh so smooth and quite a treat. This one is clearly not a product of the Cantillon hype train...it is for real. 403 charactersfrasergrove, Apr 04, 2016

3.8/5  rDev -16.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75On-draught (!!!) @ Moeder Lambic in Brussels.
Served in a Moeder Lambic pint glass, which I thought odd. Cost was 11.60 euro/50cl.
HEAD: ~6cm wide. White colour. Gorgeously creamy and soft looking, with nice frothiness and a great robust consistency. Retention is stellar - easily 12+ minutes (longer than I could wait before my first sip). Leaves no lacing as it recedes.
BODY: Hazy orange-copper. Okay, not the most vibrant body I've seen, but it indicates a healthy lack of filtration. I see no yeast within.
Appears perfectly carbonated. The head is a real treat, but otherwise it isn't unique or special appearance-wise.
AROMA: Evokes apricot fully and expressively - fuck, that's vivid. Apricot flesh, apricot skin...it's all there and everything about it screams authentic; this isn't one of those garbage artificial apricot puree brews (I'm looking at you, Pyramid...or is it Widmer?). Wonderful tartness, Subtle but undeniable lambicus yeast and bacterial sourness, fruity esters, perfect sweetness...I can't wait to try this incredible smelling brew.
Aromatic intensity is average. Some sour lovers may crave still more tartness and sourness from the aroma, but I find it inviting as-is.
TASTE & TEXTURE: The Subtle smackiness of the mouthfeel accentuates the mild (~3-4/10 in terms of intensity) sourness while keeping it drinkable and approachable; a puckering warhead-like Lactobacillus-bomb this is not.
Apricots take center stage - genuine in every way, with no artificial apricot/apricot puree nonsense. Tart, though still more tartness would be divine. One of the freshest apricot flavours of any beer I've tried. It does flirt a bit with mango as well.
Mild funkiness. Faint suggestions of oak. No vinegar/acetic character.
Bacterial and lambicus yeast intangibles abound, lending this impressive subtlety. Balance is great, the build is impressive. Good depth of flavour.
 Medium-bodied, decadently soft on the palate, smooth, wet, near perfectly carbonated. Constructively, more of a lighter, delicate, more fragile feel on the palate would be an improvement. But there's a nice harmony of texture and taste as-is.
Finishes more tart and sour than it begins.
OVERALL: In classic Cantillon fashion, it's a high quality fruited Lambic. Drinkability is high, but not ridiculous -the medium body does make it a bit more filling than most Cantillon lambics. As much as I adore this brew, given its high reputation I did hope for an even better beer. More tartness would really elevate it into the stratosphere, and more acidity and sourness wouldn't hurt.
It's possible the draught (ultra-fresh) version is less sour and funky than the bottled stuff (I can see the wild yeasts and bacterial taking hold more as it ages for a couple months); I look forward to finding out.
I found this superb, but not mind blowing, and in terms of fruited lambics from Cantillon, I prefer the kriek or the framboise - good thing Moeder Lambic has them from a cask for less than this costs.

4.93/5  rDev +8.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This really looks the color of an apricot, juicy appearance, 1/3" white head that retains itself quite well, especially for a lambic.    Aroma just drops all kinds of apricot and oak notes.  Much like Filmishmish and Cascade Apricot, this is excellent, but has extra funk and brett going for it to up its aroma grade and firmly establish itself as the King.  Its a clean funk, none of that wet horse blanket and manure or rubber stuff.
Taste drills your mouth with a 9 on the 1-10 sour scale.  It really drops 9s for fruits and pucker power.  Quite possibly the best lambic Cantillon makes, which also makes it possibly the best in the world. 643 charactersrodbeermunch, Feb 11, 2016

S: For the '15, it was all fruit.  So much apricot and some funk...damn great. The '14 was a little less apricot and more funk...some vinegar smell as well. T:  The same as the smell really, a bunch of fruit and that typical Cantillon funk...both just gorgeous. M: Medium to full, a little stinging carb. All around solid for a lambic.  O:  I loved both of these beers, I prefer the fresher to the aged, whereas others in the group liked the aged, it was just amazing.  A true joy of an experience 603 charactersAMCimpi, Feb 07, 2016

Firm lactic sourness, no vinegar, underripe apricot, and the signature musty cellar funk that is the trademark of Jean van Roy's blends. 
Golden color, short lived head, typical as far as sours go
Very quenching overall, paired well with salmon. Acidity higher than Boon's Geuze and less harsh than Hanssens 336 charactersACarp, Feb 02, 2016

A- Beautiful, hazy orange the seems to radiate outward.
S- Tart and funky apricot skins. Some underlying sweetness. Barnish.
T- Wow. This definitely lived up to the hype for me. One of the greatest sours I have had. The funk doesn't mask the fruit but complements it.

A - Pretty orange hue, thick dense white head.
S - WOW, slight funk but huge fruity presence.
T - WOW AGAIN, I have been building up my cellar and my palette trying the very best I could excluding Cantillon so I would truly appreciate awesomeness when it happened. Well it did. 
M - Honestly I have to admit that the mouthfeel of this beer and what I would imagine all other Cantillon taste like, may be the best part about this beer. Smooth creamy full.
Overall - I debated for a good two days before the new year whether I wanted to crack this open or save it, glad I opened it to enjoy the creamy fruity deliciousness. 724 charactersHesscabob, Jan 02, 2016

drinking a 2015 release. picked it up in November.  stored in my cellar for the month. served at cellar temp.
perfect laced head well after the pour. great head upon pour. looks like liquid gold. sensational.
nose is pure lambic with a hint of cat piss and mango.
taste: as others said, not an apricot bomb, which is what makes this amazing. the lambic blends with apricot perfectly both on the front and the back of the tongue. you can taste them separately or together. it pairs so well. on the tart scale, it's high up there. 
i wouldn't age this at all. it is perfect as it is now. 709 charactersatomeyes, Dec 16, 2015

I had this 3 times at the brewery over the course of two days. 750ml bottle served in a lambic basket into their stemmed tasting glasses. It looks incredible, with the first pour being (of course) more clear than the last. With that said, there are still good clouds from the first to last pour. A good amount of head, one of the most out of the Cantillon's I had over the weekend. Almost an inch with a rigorous pour. Smell is of classic Cantillon lambic/gueze with just a hint of apricots. I don't get as much fruit as other people did. It's way more hidden than Framboise or Kriek.  Great taste, with hints of apricot. In my opinion, not an apricot bomb whatsoever. Which is nice. Very balanced between funk, sourness, and fruit. Mouthfeel is great again, light with perfect carbonation. Obviously I recommend this, but I preferred LPF over this one. Two different beers that I am incredibly fortunate I had the opportunity to try. 976 charactersMatthewWalters, Nov 17, 2015

Tried again on Nov 18, 2016, same batch. Much better than the first time, tons of apricots in both aroma and taste, more sweet and round. 340 charactersMarius, Nov 03, 2015

Pours crisp pale orange with slight haze.  Huge stone fruit on nose with a touch of brett funk.  Tons of apricot on the palate, with a soft acid bite and a subtle funk undertone.  Fantastic beer.  just wow 233 characterspagriley, Oct 24, 2015

Pours a not quite cloudy but not clear peach color with a very minimal head that disappeared quickly. The nose picked up the tart right away, and on the back end you could get the apricot.  There was also earthy tones present, such as grass and a tiny bit of funk.  The taste was sour/acidic right up front and then you get unripe apricot, with the sweetness of the apricot following much later on the very back end of the palate.  Feel is medium with a prickly carbonation.
Overall, I enjoyed the hell out of this beer.  My third Cantillon, and definitely the one I have enjoyed the most to date.  The finish is fantastic and it is an easy to drink beer. 726 characterspolloenfuego, Oct 23, 2015

The aroma is bright stone fruit and lemon. Not getting the funk I expected. Taste is bright, tart lemon with apricots, more earthy than funky. Mouth feel is medium bodied and crisp making this very drinkable. It still needs time to develop some more complexity, but still excellent. 387 charactersdanh53, Oct 06, 2015

Small head that was gone without a trace quite quickly.   Nose was a little lighter in funk than I'm used to with Cantillon, so I may upgrade this as the beer ages.  Nice clean fresh and tart fruit comes through clearly.  Seems more lemon than apricot. Flavor is again not as sharp or sour as I expected.  Fruit comes through nicely, but not overly fruity.  More apricot, but still some lemon. Bright.  I have a few more bottles, so I'll be looking at this again over time. 572 characterscaptaincoffee, Oct 03, 2015

The packaging looks great. I would, without a doubt be extremely happy if I received it as a gift - it looks much better than any wine bottle I've ever seen.
The yellowish and highly carbonated liquid smelled fantastic. The taste was excellent - refreshing and prickly. My wife found it too sour (she is used to Lindeman's and similar sugary treats), but I found it just perfect. 587 charactersAndrijas, Sep 30, 2015

4.82/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 52015 vintage, 75cl from the brewery.
A nice mix of fresh and dried apricot straight off the bat. Notes of lemon, and some unripe stone fruit come to mind as well, whereas the "classic Cantillon funk" is a little on the muted end of the spectrum. There's a slight sweetness that emanates after you let the glass sit a little, kind of like delicious Costco-bought giant steel cans of dried lemonade powder.
Sour apricot (if such a thing exists), stone fruits, lemons, and a surprising amount of earthy notes. There's a very pleasant symbiotic balance between the fruity acidic flavors and the Cantillon funk whereby the funk amplifies the sourness upfront but tones it down as it travels further down your alveolar ridge. I remember the 2011 and 2014 vintages making my entire face pucker when I had them, but no such instance here with the 2015 (maybe I've become more tolerant?); but that in no way hinders the experience altogether.

2015: 4.75. Tons of apricot jam and clean, light funk but a little too acidic.
2014: 5. Perfect fruited lambic, my favorite. Apricot jam, clean light funk and perfect acidity.
2013: 4.5. Murky, slightly butter apricots with a bit more complex funk. Perfect acidity.
I'll update this as I have vintages again, or new vintages, and as they age. 361 characterscultclassic89, Jul 25, 2015

This was surprisingly mild, not a ton of apricot flavor, but definitely a woody/minerally dimension to it with some lemony citrus and mild funk. There was a fairly nice balance in terms of flavors but this is nowhere near as robust as the typical american wild ale. 345 charactersworldsworstextra, Jun 12, 2015

The smell is incredible the sour funk an apricots, lovely. The taste is just smile inducing, could drink it day after day, depth is the key sour, fruit, funk and smooth clean finish. 292 charactersNachojon, May 16, 2015

750ml bottle in a basket split amongst a bunch of wine glasses at the Cantillon brewery.
Pours very hazy -- yellow, with a fair head. Very nice looking. Smell is velvety apricot, and tart.
Taste is lambic with slight apricot, which builds as you sip. Very nice.
Mouthfeel is soft and fuzzy. Overall, great beer. 325 characterssnaotheus, May 14, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5L: Pours a light haze, peach/apricot color. Very little head.
A: Let the beer warm up in your glass. As the beer warmed, the apricots were jumping out. Get notes of peach/apricot, little citrus, orange peel, and of course the signature Cantillon sour funk
T: Apricots, peach, tartness (not too much just a little), lots of funk, grapefruit, orange peel
M: Tartness and funk are present for a little after swallowing. And boy does that apricot flavor linger yumm...
Overall: A fantastic beer, please try it if you can. Probably my favorite apricot sour that I have tried so far. Gonna be hard to beat this one. 610 charactersMesa512, May 12, 2015

Pours a vibrant, hazy peachy color, with a decent, fizzy head.
Pure apricots. So much fruit, accompanied by wooden stone qualities, fermented apricots and leathery wood. The nose got a glue like, vinegar whiff to it, accentuating the funky tartness, while its focus remains without a doubt on the fruits.
Perfectly carbonated, with a very refreshing light body.
Taste mirrors the nose, regarding the apricots, revealing apricot pulp, vinegar, vaseline, plastic, soap, glue - all funked up, by leather and barnyard. The nose comes incedibly nice together, again, revealing its fruity characteristics. Finishes tart, dry, with a fermented fruit bitterness, still complimenting the apricots, leaving back a tooth pluckering sourness.
Incredibly well pronounced apricots among a supersoft mouthfeel, wrapped up by a thirst quenching, dry sourness. Refreshing in body, juicy, with a sour lemon peel infusion, leaving with a long lasting, acidic tartness. 977 charactersaleigator, Apr 25, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52013 edition into a stemmed wine glass.
A- Pours with just a slight haze after a still loud pop of the cork. A 2-3 finger, fizzy head forms and hangs around a few minutes before turning into a thin film on top of the beer. The lacing is pretty good, but temporary on the sides of the glass. The body is a vibrant, medium gold to orange in color.
S- Starts off with a slightly acidic/lactic, tart punch, but it is very mild compared to other Cantillon brews and lambics. The apricots follow up the initial tartness very quickly and still pack a strong fruity flavor in the scent. A touch of the apricot lingers after the smell, along with a touch of oak.
T- The taste profile follows the nose pretty closely here. Tart and lightly acidic flavors of the base lambic hit right up front and give a little bit of a pucker before the fruit comes in. The fruit is juicy and on the mild side, blending with the base beer very elegantly. As the beer warms in your mouth, the fruit strengthens a little bit and tastes more and more like you just bit into a fresh apricot. A light oak characteristic mixes in as the drink fades and leaves a mix of tart, dry, and fruit flavors on the tongue.
M- Not much to say here except that this beer feels like a good fruited lambic should. There is a good amount of carbonation to compliment and hold up with the sour flavor profile, but not so much as to be stinging. The body of the beer is rather light in weight, but smooth at the same time.
Overall, this is the first Cantillon that I have had live up to its insane hype. Their other beers are good, but this is delicious on a whole other level. The fruit and sourness mingle perfectly and give a balanced flavor to satisfy cravings both flavor components. My favorite part of this beer is how well the fruit stands up to the base beer and displays its flavors. Great beer! 1,861 charactersboilermakerbrew, Mar 14, 2015

4.18/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big bro ups to the magnificent beast that is flexabull for carting this one all the way across the pond, over my head to CA, then back to MN. I’d like to have its frequent flier miles. 750ML bottle capped & corked, split with my wife, who’s almost panting in anticipation. 
The pour is pure spring sunshine in a proper Cantillon glass, with a sharknado of carbonation swirling right up the middle. The yellow fruit is still strong in the nose, though I would have guess peach instead of apricot, but whatever, with a fair amount of sharp lemon & white wine. Thoroughly enjoyable for whiffing. 
Fou Foune is my kind of lambic. The fruit & sour are about 49.2% vs. 50.8%, & I can’t tell which side is which. Lovely light fruits do the bagurumba with a light acidity imparted by the wild beasties, imparting a lovely tartness on the tongue and other mouth parts. Mid-palate is that spritzy white wine again, oak on oak, lemon coming on strong. Light & summery, this is a joy on the palate, & something that I could drink for quite a long while. There simply aren’t many wild ales you can say that about. 
So happy I finally had a full pour of this, after having samples at numerous tastings over the years…& I gotta say, much better fresh. Goes without saying: this is an excellent brew. 1,297 charactersmaximum12, Mar 07, 2015

Aug 2015 bottle, opened Mar 2016:
A - Hazy light straw body with a towering cap of pure white foam.  Nice retention and low lace.
S - Stellar nose.  Bright, fresh, ripe apricot, juicy nectarines and a touch of earthy barn.
T - Opens with a bright, sour lemon-lime note.  Deliciously tart, crunchy apricot is loaded throughout the center and finishes with smooth, creamy wheat.  Exceptional balance.
M - Smooth and surprisingly full for the style.  Well balanced carbonation.
O - A world class fruit sour. 558 charactersvfgccp, Feb 21, 2015

Smell: apricot, funky. Sour. Vinegar. Light wheaty base

Mouthfeel: lighter feel, quite a bit of funkiness but nothing over powering. some vinegar and a light acidity. very strong refreshing qualities.
Overall: a seriously killer beer. has all the funk you could want while remaining not only drinkable but refreshing as well. amazing fruit and sour qualities. 838 charactersSportsandJorts, Feb 13, 2015

The nose featured aromas of puréed apricots, funky Belgian yeast, and tart acidic notes that are quite pleasant to the nostrils. The mouth was outstanding; flavors of ripe apricots are prevalent up front, followed by hints of lemon peel, musty earth, white wine, and funky yeast that create a memorable taste. The mouthfeel was light bodied, with enamel eroding acidity and a bright, apricot finish. This was my first time having Fou', and wow, it was quite delightful. Thanks again for the bottle, @ehrenblanche! 98/100 719 charactersthebeerfrontier, Jan 24, 2015

A- pours a murky golden-yellow with a rich and creamy white head that seems to retain forever, leaving thick patches of lacing behind that sticks long after the pour, perfect pour
S- pureed apricot mixed with freshly sliced apricot and apricot jam, so amazing.  Tart vinegar with some funky wild Belgian yeast to close it out.  Perfect aroma
T- dry, tart and funky up front with flavors of fresh apricot preserves, lemon peel, musty earth, tart yeast, dry finish with more fresh apricot on the finish
M- medium creamy and foamy body with low carbonation leads to a tart and bone dry mouthfeel and finish 
O- The best nose I've experienced from a lambic, so much apricot that actually gets better as it warms
*Note- I had this side by side with West Ashley & Map of the Sun.  This was the clear favorite. 822 charactersTreyliff, Jan 09, 2015

A- Light orange and hazy. One finger white head fades to a ring with spotty lacing.
S- Funky overripe apricots. Sour vinegar aroma like many sours. The apricot scent rules here.
T- Tart, slightly sour apricots. I was expecting this beer to be more sour, but it is subtle and balanced. A great sour. Apricot flavor popped as it warmed.
M- light and carbonated. Dry finish. This is so drinkable.
O- A bucket list beer that was wonderful. Hope I can try again someday. 491 charactersnodder, Jan 01, 2015

A:  A hazy orange with an off-white, one-finger head that lingers.  Thick lacing.
S:  Light and fresh.  Apricots dominate with a white wine ambiance.  Belgian funk.
T:  Tart and heavenly.  A lovely apricot hue slides in with white wine and vanilla in the background.  One of those taste bud orgasms.  A bit of oakiness and Belgian funk.    
M:  Light to medium with medium, creamy carbonation.

This one pours light orange, with a 1.5 inch head, and a little bit of lacing.
Smells like the freshest, ripest apricots, with some funk, oak, and a slight hint of vinegar.
This tastes like biting into a tart apricot cloud. It's so light, and heavy at the same time- huge tart apricot flavor up front, with a highly carbonated but creamy finish, big white wine barrel character, and a nice funky and earthy character, along with some mild oaky vanilla. This is fantastic.
This has an amazing light airy mouthfeel, almost like drinking a cloud, as I said above. The carbonation is high. The beer is incredibly drinkable, but you've gotta savor every sip of it.
This is the best sour I've ever had. It's a fantastic achievement. 791 charactersGreesyFizeek, Dec 21, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -0.9%I really enjoy lambics but, unfortunately, don't know a lot about them and haven't tried many of the ones that are considered the very best. Cantillon's Fou' Foune did impress me a lot, though. I had it on draft a few weeks ago at The Hourglass Brewery and am very glad that I got to try it without having to trade for or purchase a bottle. Now that I've tried it, I definitely will consider those options with confidence.
FF is delicious. Mildly sour, appropriately and slightly sweet with a great color and a pleasant aroma ... so much to take in and appreciate. This is one of my favorite Cantillons, to date.
I rated this 4.5 on Untappd and might give it the full 5-star review next time, if I'm fortunate enough to try it again. 735 charactersM_J_Z, Dec 14, 2014

2014 bottle straight from the source. 
I hate reviewing what a beer looks like, but let's just say it looked awesome. 
Aroma was off the charts. Quite funky but doesn't detract or take the focus off of the apricots. I let this sit in my other glass and open up while I tasted the other beers. After about 45 minutes, I started to drink it again and it had totally changed. The funk and lacto has disappeared and all that was left was juicy apricots. Absolutely amazing!
Flavor followed suit. The first few sips were sour, funky and filled with apricot juice. After it sat, however, the sourness disappeared and all that remained was straight apricot puree. 
Overall, this has been my favorite Cantillon to date. Well worth the hype and so glad I didn't have to give up any beers to finally tick it off. 914 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Nov 10, 2014

A ton of sweet apricots followed by a nice funk. The feel is light but full bodied. Heavy carbonated but sweet and juicy. I feel like i am taking a big bite of an apricot when i drink this beer.

A: Fou Foune poured with small bright white foam that quickly dissipated. Hazy golden yellow color with tiny bubbles grasping to stay on top of this beautiful beverage. Swirling gave the wine glass a slight lacing that slipped away each time. Only bringing to life the beautiful aroma of the beer. (5)
S: Big funky brett character with the classic Cantillon hay and light barnyard funk mixed with light oak. The peach and apricot fresh fruit aroma danced from the glass along with a moderately strong tartness that became more pronounced as it warms up. Complex at every turn, it seems to evolve as its being consumed. (5) 
T: Bright sourness at a medium to strong level that gives way to a complex brett funky character. Hay, ripe apricot, peach and nectarine flavor - But that's just the beginning. Oak is mild and develops more with the time on the tongue. Light sweetness morphs to an acute tart mouthfeel. Fantastically Complex (5)
M: Dry finish with mild carbonation that leaves a crisp refreshing body. No harshness at all. The sourness leaves a tingling cheek sensation. While you could drink this fast -  Don't - savor every drop. (5)
O: The complex classic Cantillon Lambic flavors combined with fresh apricot is a perfect match. If you're fortunate to see this beer buy it, if not trade for it. Even better travel to Belgium and have it at the Brasserie (like I did) - Nothing beats it. (5) 1,427 charactersguityler83, Oct 21, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +4.6%This is a typical Cantillon brew. It comes a little yellow and a little murky due to the apricots. It is nicely carbonated. The aroma and taste have all the Cantillon goodness, though as usual this holds not true for every palate. The aroma is sublime like smelling a crate of ripe apricots. Later also the typical Cantillon lambic aromas kick in. Taste is a little more tart and less fruity than the aroma but still very much apricot. This is a great Cantillon with sublime fruitiness, if you can get this fresh. 513 characterssafaricook, Oct 06, 2014

4.9/5  rDev +7.9%Enjoyed on draft at Zwanze 2014. Holy Grale.
A: Cloudy yellow. One finger fine-bubble, egg shell head. The head settles to a rim.
S: Tart fruit and sour Belgium spores. Neutral oak. Notes of peaches, dried apricots, bergamot blooms, honey suckles, and dusty grain.
T: The flavors are subtle and well balanced.  Sour yeast is very noticeable, then waves of neutral oak and fruit notes get capped off with a mild funk finish. The notes: peaches, apricots, tangerine flesh, citrus zest, and oak. This is a moderate on the tartness level.
M: High carbonation, very (x2) smooth, light body.
O: It is no surprise to me why this is the consensus favorite from Temple of Sours.  The flavors are very subtle, but perfectly balanced.  Perfection is unattainable - IMO - but this ale gets very close.  The fruit/sour/funk aspects meld so nicely, it is hard not to give this a perfect score. This is my favorite Cantillon. 915 charactersmacher0, Sep 29, 2014

Big thanks to Goblinmunkey7 for slaying and sharing this whale
A: Pours a cloudy apricot color with some nice honey - starts off with a giant, off-white head, fades to a few wisps of a cap, leaves a little lacing
S: Overwhelming majesty - do I even need to say more? - potent sourness with tart and juicy, ripe apricot - beautiful acidity with some hints of lactic sour - excellent level of tart - simply perfect level of apricot - juicy and fresh, without going over the top - oak - some other light fruits, with hints of apple and peach
T: So good, I don't know where to start - fantastic levels of sour, a nice blend of sharp acidity and some lightly musty lactic flavors - nice levels of tart - excellent levels of apricot, somehow tastes fresh (maybe even a little under-ripe) despite being aged - sour base blends very well with the apricot and the oak - some hints of white wine - light apples and peaches, with a hint of citrus and lemon
M: Medium body, nicely carbonated, not as puckering or dry as some other offers from Cantillon, but still great
O: Hype. Please stop living up to it.
Well, this is excellent. Cantillon does not make beer. They make magic. Consistently. Find and drink. 1,221 charactersangrybabboon, Sep 28, 2014
4.69/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Murky and hazy peach-tinged apricot. Head is white and fluffy. Starts with a massive pillowy head that drops to a few wisps of a cap with a small collar. 
Smell: Super oaky. Loaded with deep fruity character. Apricot and pear add a mealy fruit to the operation. Tart with a deep citric bite and a ton of lactic sourness as well. A touch floral with a ton of fresh peach. Juicy. Oak and more oak. Earthy with a solid musty element. Layered with some barnyard and straw and grass. Pale bready malt with a touch of a cracker snap. A touch of sweetness thrown in the back. Powdery yeast. Some tart apple and white wine.
Taste: A ton of apricot. Mealy in good measure. Loaded with a ton of citric acid - lemon and even more lime zest. A touch of pear. Tons of juicy white peach. Some white wine as well. Malts are slightly bready with a touch of cracker and some read crust. Deeply oaked with a slight tannic quality. So much oak. Green tree branches. Some solid earthy elements coupled with the typical straw and grass. Solidly funky with a ton of barnyard. Musty and damp. Deep cellar and freshly turned earth. Warming pushes the apricot up and it works well with the deep lactic and citric push. 
Mouthfeel: Bracingly dry on the finish. Sips a bit cleaner but has a solid astringency. Body pushes medium, but comes on the light side of it. Moderate carbonation as well. Oak smooths everything out.
Overall: Practice monomania.
Matches the hype. A ton of oak with enough fruit and tart edges to balance it all out. Complex and tasty to the point of absurdity. 1,573 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Sep 28, 2014

A - Pours a a yellowish straw tinted color with minimal head surprisingly for this beer. 1-2 finger white foam had that slowly recedes back into the glass. Somewhat cloudy but clears up after resting in the glass
S - Smell is of loads of apricot, definitely some straw and hay aromas coming through on this. Hints of white peach coming through.
T - Taste follows the nose on this one with loads of apricot not he front mixed with a nice balance of lactic acidity, some hints of the straw flavors with mixed notes of earthy funk and wood.
M - Mouthfeel is about perfect on this one. Not too light but very crisp and smooth at the same time. Fairly dry
O - Overall this has been my favorite Cantillon thus far. Will be seeking this one out so that I can dome a bottle myself.
2014 bottle --> this is perfect fresh, do not age this beer! Drank alongside 12 and 13. More apricot than any other bottle with wet hay and apricot pit skin and flesh on the nose. Not very tart which is nice for this, strong peach flavors followed by that straw/way dryish finish, but seeminglyy juicy on the front end. 
2013 bottle --> A little more funky on the nost, slightly more moldy, wet hay smells accompanied by a lesser amount of apricots on the nose. Taste is more acidic, less apricot, and more funk. 
2012 Bottle --> Smells like green apples and white grape skins here, not too pleasant. Taste is overly acidic with minimal apricot flavor left here. Taste like sour green apples with a funky finish. Least favorite of the 3.
Fresh wins here. 1,655 charactersdrmcleod10, Jul 27, 2014

The cork (which was quite difficult to remove) says it was bottled in 2013 and is lot C12345. Not as carbonated as I would have liked, but enough to get the job done. Somewhat clear, dark gold in color with a massive billowy white head that dies off very quickly. The nose carries lots of stony dry champagne-like notes, lots of mustiness, apple cider, apricots, and a hint of pear-like sweetness. Very pleasant and complex.
Very light body and sharp, tart flavor. Light, dry, cracker-like grain up front with a hint of kiwi-like sweetness, then a prompt rush of sour fruity flavors. Lots of complexity here. I get sour apples, apricots, lemon rind, dry white wine, green grapes, vinegar, and apple cider, all wrapped inside a mild mustiness that has a muted impact on the flavor. The finish is as dry as the Sahara, yet somehow the tartness softens in the back of the mouth without compromising the flavor. Very sour, yet very drinkable.
Overall, a stellar sour. I usually prefer sours with a noticeable amount of balancing sweetness. I can't remember the last time I had a beer this sour that I enjoyed so much. I can see why BAs seek it out, but at this price I probably won't ever buy it again (or if I do, I'll trade it to someone who's never been able to find it). Not recommended for those new to sours. If you're new to sours and you happen to stumble upon a bottle of this, do yourself a favor. Stash it somewhere and explore several other sours before drinking it, otherwise you may not enjoy it and could possibly waste your money (and the beer). 1,605 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Jul 25, 2014

A: Pours an apricot-tinted straw color, with a generous finger of fine, foamy off-white head. A solid cap sits on the surface for a good few minutes. Very good clarity and some champagne-like bubbles. 
S: Sweet apricot flesh, hay, some nice supporting spice character (oak, cinnamon, and vanilla frosting-like), apple cider, and a moderate dose of earthy barnyard. The apricot is deep and very well integrated, but by no means dominant, which may be a plus or minus.
T: Bretty earthiness up front, with mild apricot, just a touch of tartness, finishing bone dry (with some of the tartness carrying through) with more earth/herbal notes, as is common to Cantillon. The flavors are well integrated and interesting but pretty restrained. 
M: Medium body and medium-high, slightly sharp carbonation.
O: Highly drinkable, nice subtle flavors, and good complexity. Though it’s tasty, I don’t quite understand the fascination with this beer. I’d prefer St. Lamvinus or LP Kriek by far. 1,023 characterspmarlowe, Jul 13, 2014

T - Nice sour acidity, not too sour though. The fruit is not overpowering, its subtle but nice. Not as amazing as I was let on to believe, although very good.
M - As expected for a lambic, pleasantly fruity, but slightly dry, nicely carbonated.
Overall - I'm very glad to have had the opportunity to try this on tap. This is a world class beer, but I am surprised at how closely this compares to other American sours I have had. I do think this beer is slightly over-hyped after trying it, there are many American Wilds that rival this that aren't in the top 50 IMHO. 809 charactersChibeerguy1, Jun 28, 2014

Great clarity with four-finger white foamy/snappy soap voluminous head. Brew is nice peach color with tint of orange and yellow. 
Aroma is funky, ripe stringy, lacy, full of peach, apricot, apple, not much tartness on the nose. Well done aroma for being to barnyard and funky.
Flavors are light vinegar, nice light smooth sweetness is well blended with strong earthy pine dry bitterness. Full of horse blanket and barnyard earth... Carbonation is much lighter than expected and much appreciated. 
IMO, this is a bit of an over-hyped brew, but it's still very nice and enjoyable. It's a damn fine, highly drinkable, earthy sour, just a bit over hyped... Very solid, I just don't believe it's tops in class, but definitely a top 10-15 brew for it's class. Recommended, yes, even @ $30/750/ml 883 characterschugalug06, Jun 10, 2014

A: A slightly cloudy, golden apricot. Just seeing it in that tiny little glass gave me joy.
S: Smell of a good, solid, biting sour, with a twinge of apricot. Makes me elicit that 'sour cringe' just thinking about it now.
T: A rock-solid sour bite with a smooth finish that doesn't linger. Very faint apricot, not as much as I remember tasting in a Cascade Apricot Ale. 
M: Smooth, with sour attacking the middle/back of the mouth.
O: Definitely one of the best sours I have ever experienced. The buzz of something this rare showing up in a town this far from a major metropolitan area was justified. Very happy to have experienced this even once. 741 charactersIMFletcher, Jun 08, 2014

The aroma was a tinge sour with a fragrant apricot, lemon, Chardonnay and soda water and straw.
The flavors were nicely smooth and well balanced but not overly pronounced. The apricot was lightly sweet with a lemon, honeysuckle, raw honey and a white wine or Chardonnay like quality.
The feel is light and bubbly, almost spritzer like, but smooth and easily drinkable.
This is a very good lambic and it feels almost sour like but Top 12 in the World, absolutely not! 585 charactersKYGunner, Jun 03, 2014
4.43/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy golden with a lingering frothy white head.
Aroma is lightly funky, slightly sour, vinous, lemony, and doughy. There's an earthy character countering, as well. Floral notes renege.
Flavor is quintessentially sour initially, lactic, with fruity notes of tart lemon, apricot, and strawberries adding complexity. Earthy, slightly barnyard notes form the base and carry into the lightly dry finish. Notes of sweet tart candies surface late, complementing a very light confectioners sugar sweetness.
Body is a touch light, with high carbonation. Very refreshing, with light alcohol warmth.
I hyped this beer up pretty highly, perhaps too much so. While it's a very clean, perfectly sour beer, I expected a little more fruit presence. The fruit comes out a bit more as it warms. 788 charactersbarczar, Jun 02, 2014

Pours as I remember, pale gold with burnt yellow highlights, hazy, with a nice creamy white head that lingers nicely and shows off the beers effervescence. 
The nose is filled with that soft, young house Cantillon character with the addition of juicy apricot flesh, aromatic peach fuzz, crushed strawberry at a distance, and a guava like perfume that intoxicates the senses. One of those classic, time transcending aromas that you will always remember when good lambic comes to mind.
Flavor is more in line with the rustic nature of lambics. Still plentiful fruit notes but geared towards raw, fleshy and softly acidic apricot and nectarine, hints of apple, white grape flesh, and kiwi twang. Subtle brett funk in the form of dough, over ripe pineapple, fresh pasture, and wet earth are here, but just barely perceptible. It's mostly fruit slapping those taste buds around. 
Mouthfeel is typically perfect as usual with Cantillon beers. I think the outstanding mouthfeel of Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen is the main thing that makes them stand out from other lambic blenders. Armand and Jean Van Roy just seem to have perfected this part in Gueuze and lambic production. Light, prickly but not ultra bubbly. Dry with the perfect amount of lactic acid pucker. But then you get that malic acid fruit tanginess as well. Heavenly mouthfeel.
Overall, once again I'm knocked back to reality. Reality being that Belgian lambics are still king of the sour beer world. You get caught up with the American sour beer scene that you almost forget the superiority of Cantillon and Drie Fonteinen when it comes to "sours", "wilds", or whatever you want to call it. On top of those two you also have Rodenbach, De Cam, and Boon also putting out some top notch stuff. Give me an Apricot Mariage Parfait and I just may come in my pants. But babble aside, Fou Foune continues to be that gracious creation it's always been, and a beer by which all other sours should be measured against. 2,005 charactersMarcWP, May 26, 2014

Acquired in a trade with WilliamDbar, thank you for hooking me up with my biggest ISO yet! Opened in celebration of my engagement this past weekend!
Appearance - Pours a really hazy, cloudy, bright sunflower yellow body with a loud, fizzy, effervescent white head that reduces pretty quickly to leave a layer of foam behind. I love the artwork on the bottle. 
Smell - Wow, the aroma of this beer is absolutely mouth-watering. The apricot aromas are bright, fresh, and juicy while not being overpowering. Fresh fruit salad, including peaches and watermelon, combined with a tart citrus zing, freshly picked flowers, and a splash of Belgian funk make the aroma of this beer absolutely perfect. I couldn't imagine how it could improve in this category.
Taste - First off is a juicy, fruity medley of apricot, peaches, white grapes, nectarine, and citrus. Heavy tartness (not quite sour) takes over to produce dry, crisp notes with the lingering juicy apricot flavor still holding the spotlight. The finish is dry and citrusy. Very well balanced. 
Mouthfeel - Crisp, dry, highly carbonated, refreshing, sip demanding. Excellent. 
I have been waiting forever to try this whale, as it was my #1 want for over a year. Fou Foune is everything I expected and more. The fruity apricot balanced with the perfect acidity make for a near perfect lambic. Seek it out! 1,443 charactersgcamparone, May 20, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5What a glorious day to have this on tap at Provisions (with St. Lamvinus pouring as well!). Poured into a 6oz tumbler.
For the first time, I can safely say that this is a pretty Cantillon offering that actually resembles something closer to your everyday beer - amber straw in color, with some light orange hints at the side. I'd never guess this was made with fruit right away, although that jewel-like glimmer this brewery always offers may certainly give away what this is before I even evaluate it next time. Nice little strings of bubbles rises from the bottom up in the glass, while a frothy white head never recedes on top. Very fluffy and refreshing looking - modest yet presentable.
Yum! The aroma is a delicious dive into stone fruit and citrus notes, with some crisp and mineral laden flavors. Under-ripe, perhaps green apricots are definitely all over this, but you also get a good deal of fleshy peach skins, papaya, as well as pears, apples, and some white wine notes from the yeast, fruit, and malt bill alike. Some oak spices come in, such as sugar cream, baking soda, and vanilla. Reminds me a bit of a Portuguese Alvarinho, if it weren't for the unique crisp wheat, toffee-like flavor lingering at the back, as well as the damp cold stone cellar overarching aspect that makes this beer one of a kind - it's a mineral flavor that simply cannot be replicated anywhere in the world, not even in the Lambic region. Also, as this opens up, a beautiful bouquet of white pepper, white orchids, and light leather makes way to the front. Very elegant, bright stuff.
One sip, and I'm immediately appalled on how delicious this is, but also due to its elegance, brightness, and restrained acidity and funk. Other fruit Lambics (which are NOT Lou Pepe) are far more ridiculous to drink, but this is incredibly restrained on all accounts while simultaneously providing a juicy, fruit-forward texture. Every sip of this is less of imbibing on a beer, and more taking a bite out of a juicy, slightly green apricot, peach, nectarine, pear, or tart white grape. A little bit of tropical notes come in, but it's ALL about the stone fruit here, and the apricots definitely win. This is very refreshing, and light grassy notes, as well as a bit of white floral goodness, a little bit of leather, and that classic mineral refreshing flavor all come together gracefully. Leaves a lingering fruit skin sweetness, as well as some toffee and crisp wheat textures to cleanse the palate for the next sip. The oak also provides a creamy, airy experience that I've had in other Cantillon offerings, yet never this light and fluffy - vanilla, sugar cream, and baking soda all top it off, melding with the sour apricots to wonderful results. Very well integrated... Could be this brewery's most drinkable beer.
It's not my favorite from Cantillon, but it could grow on me over time - that is, if I can ever get my hands on a bottle of it. Too bad the hype has sucked out the facility of obtaining what is a marvelous and delicious sour such as this one, but it's definitely delicious and incredibly refreshing no matter how you cut it. I'd love to try a fresh bottle of this some day. Highly recommended, but don't pay more than $25 for it if you can help it. 3,250 charactersmagictacosinus, May 11, 2014

Pours a slightly hazy, almost milky, orange hue. It's really resembles peaches. There is an of white head that sits around a half finger size for the entire drink. Tart, acidic, funky, unripe fruits on the nose. You can tell it's going to be delicious. It tastes similar to the nose with a slightly sharper carbonation than I'm used to with other Cantillon beers. You could close your eyes and take a sip and feel like someone liquified the skin of a peach. The mouthfeel is nearly perfect. I would like it just a tad more creamy, and a tad less sharp. This is one of those beers that deserve the hype. It's worth it. 675 charactersKVNBGRY, Apr 08, 2014

S-Apricots almighty. It smells funky and tart but there is also a bit of fruity sweetness as well. Dried oak which makes me think of aged white wine.
T-Puréed apricots that are both incredibly tart and lightly sweet. Sour! Overripe apricot, underripe apricot and perfect apricot. Hay and dried out grass. Funky pale fruit. Highly acidic with some malt vinegar flavors. Excellent.
M-Creamy but yet still light. Puckering sourness that sticks to the tongue. Endless aftertaste. High acidity. Tannic.
O-I can see why this beer is so highly sought after. Easily one of the top three Lambics I have tried. What a goddamn treat to try this beer. An beer that can absolutely change the way anyone views beers, regardless of their previous experiences. 854 charactersVelvetExtract, Apr 03, 2014

Wow! This beer's nose is basically a lot of acidity along with a delicious apricot fruitiness. There is a good bit of the lambic earth funk that I've come to associate with Cantillons- same kind of smell that you get when you walk into the brewery. But this is a milder funk as the apricot is very strong here. 
The beer itself pours a hazy golden-orange body that is very well carbonated, with a massive >3cm head that takes a while to recede and never fully goes away. Lacing is very nice. Just what I would expect from a good Cantillon.
When this beer finds its way into my mouth, it is just so perfectly balanced in terms of the sourness, fruitiness, acidity and funk. It all comes together to create a sweet apricot accentuated with some lemon tartness. Incredible.
Mouthfeel-wise, its more or less what Cantillons bring to the table. Medium bodied, no dryness at all in the finish, sweet but not in a sugary way. The tartness is refreshing and makes for a delicious, refershing in-between beer between Bramble Rye and Vanilla Bean Dark Lord. 
This is the best Cantillon I've had and that includes the Lou Pepes.. it's just slightly above Saint Lamvinus, which is a bit unfair as both beers are different. This one brings out the apricot which is definitely strong here like the cherries in a Lou Pepe Kriek, etc. but without the apricot being overwhelmingly sweet. It is so well-balanced and easy to drink. Incredibly refreshing and flavourful. Eduardo tells me that he considers Cantillon to be bottled art. If that is the case, Fou' Foune is a true masterpiece in a bottle and Jean Van Roy is Peter Paul Rubens. This beer is definitely in my top 5 of all time.
Re-reviewed (3 months of age)
Opened up another 75cl bottle from August 2013 on 11/26/2013. So 3 months old the second time around. Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass. Basically the same as the previous review (with 1 year on it), except this is definitely less acidic and the apricots come out quite a bit more, especially in the nose which is even more perfect than it was before. Phenomenal nose, one of the best smelling beers I've had. Flavour-wise, I preferred the 1-year old bottle's acidity and sourness, but I can definitely appreciate the apricots here more. And the mouthfeel is phenomenal- so well carbonated, so creamy. Reminds me of Hill Farmstead's pale ales actually. But so substantial yet drinkable and refreshing. This beer's appearance isn't as sexy and tempting as its sister beer Blabaer, but the beer is otherwise perfect in my mind.
Re-reviewed (6 months of age): 75cl bottle from August 2013, generously bought over by Dustin at our celebratory whale tasting. Cheers to good friends! Poured into a Three Floyds teku glass today, 3/22/2014. Basically, the beer looks just the same as any of the other times. Smell is very apricot-forward still, but I appreciated more tartness, horseblanket funk. Best thing is that this bought out a lot of geuze-like lemon tartness, pepperiness on top of the funk in the nose. Incredible, sweet yet complex nose. Flavour is very similar- the geuze-like characteristics stand out far more than fresh. Lemon zest, pepperiness, barnyard Cantillon funk. It reminds me so much of Armand'4 Zomer. And you throw some fresh apricot juice on top of that? This merely reinforces how much I love this beer. And mouthfeel is a bit thinner and less creamier than fresh, but still very much medium bodied and refreshing. Again, the only conclusion I'll draw from this is: this is still my favorite beer ever.
Re-re-reviewed (2 months of age): 2014 vintage. Bottled 21 August 2014. Thanks Tim! Poured into a Cantillon balloon glass 10/19/2014 for our first anniversary. Essentially, I just want to re-reconfirm that fresh Fou' Foune is delicious, and this year's Fou' Foune is not lacking in apricots. The best advice I have to anyone who's opening up a bottle soon is to serve it at cellar temperature, aerate it and let it warm up a bit- the apricots truly come out as clean, crisp stone fruits in the nose that dance along your palate as you sip it. Great mouthfeel, soft, velvety but with a nice crisp, dry and thirst-quenching finish. There is no defect to be found in this beer- it is still my favorite beer after all this time, and worthy of its status.
Fresh 2015 vintage. Poured into a Cantillon balloon glass 1/30/2016. I'm not going to reinvent the wheel, but this 2015 vintage is drinking quite well. Plenty of stonefruit on the aroma and flavour, nice perfectly ripened apricot flesh paired with the classic brewery funk, mild acetic presence, mild wheat. Again, it encapsulates the perfect essence of what a fruit lambic can be, and accomplishes that in spades. 4,918 charactersStevedore, Mar 23, 2014

4.84/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Got to enjoy this wonderful beer on tap at Bier Station. I usually get my beers in a 4 oz pour to allow me to try several things without getting sloshed, but in this case, a full pour was a must. Poured into a Belgian tulip glass with a flared rim.
Appearance - Pours a sunny golden-amber hue that is mostly opaque with hints of runny egg yolk where the light diffuses into the glass. Atop the body sits a frothy stark white head about a finger thick, which dissipates over a few minutes to leave a thick film of suds across the top and a build-up of foam snowdrifts along the sides of the glass. Lacing consists of spotty, faint rings around the glass as I drink the level down.
Smell - A healthy bouquet of ripe fruit, with apricot leading the way. It gives me the impression that I am about to bite into a freshly picked apricot. Accompanying the fruitiness is a considerable amount of funk and acidity, along with a woody element that gives the impression of a fruit-forward dessert wine, like a sauterne or muscat. Still, the sweetness that you would expect from said dessert wine is nowhere to be found.
Taste - Apricots are one of my favorite beer-accompanying fruits, and I love sours--the taste of this beer represents a perfect marriage of the two. Ripe apricot flesh (I can almost feel the velvety hairs that sometimes are present on an apricot) mixes with wet hay funk, acidic tartness, with notes of granny smith apples and white wine vinegar. The barrel provides a slightly vinous element, which is not surprising given the nose, but it is dry and finishes extremely clean.
Mouthfeel - Light-bodied and moderately carbonated, with a dry finish that leaves the tastebuds longing for the next swallow. Good thing it's only 5% abv, because it would be easy to drink this in quantity, given how refreshing it is.
Overall, a beer that more than lives up to the hype. Of course, I'm predisposed to like it, given my penchant for beers that are sour and the use of apricots in beer, but that also means that I could have been easily disappointed, given the reputation of this brew and my high expectations. 2,118 charactersLambicPentameter, Mar 05, 2014

S: 11/12 - lots of apricot and barnyard notes, no detectable hops or malts as far as I can detect
T: 19/20 - on first sip, there is a subtle funk that quickly develops into complex fruit flavors - apricot (of course), lemon, ripe pear - admixed with tart, barnyard flavors; as the flavors develop, the malt character arises with a mild bready and wheat character; little detectable alcohol; finishes dry
M: 5/5 - high carbonation (almost Mimosa-like), easily quaffable (as expected for the low alcohol)
T: 10/10 - I had high expectations and this one lived up - a perfect mix of fruit and sour; although expensive, it was totally worth the $14/10 oz. pour

Hazy golden color - hard to judge in the dim bar lights. Retains a ring of lacing on the glass. 
Smells of fresh, sweet apricot and lemon, musty earth; sour
Taste is layered; fresh, juicy apricot, a bright lemony zing, moderate earthy funk. Fairly sour with only a touch of vinegar. The finish is long...the apricot keeps going ending in a very dry, slightly tannic and bitter end note. The apricot is integral; it adds so much but it never overshadows the underlying complexities of the lambic.
Mouthfeel is creamy; fairly active carbonation.
Overall: Incredible. This beer has so much to offer but so easy to drink. It's an intense sensory experience but has many subtleties to explore. One of the best beers I've had. Extremely expensive to order at a restaurant in NYC but worth every penny. 823 charactersbrianmandell, Feb 19, 2014

Appearance: Pours a hazy orange color with 1+ finger of a white soapy head that settles to a thick collar. Body is hazy but still translucent with some moderate visible carbonation. 4.5
Smell: Apricot, citrus, oak, barnyard funk, some acidity, apple skins with a slight herbal/earthy quality. 4.25
Taste: Lots of juicy apricot, mild funk, oak and some faint hints of lemon and green apple. Finishes dry with a lingering apricot finish and a mild lingering bitterness. Sourness is medium and a bit more restrained than some other Cantillon offerings. 4.25
Mouthfeel: Light bodied with medium spritzy carbonation and a nice soft mouthfeel. Incredibly high drinkability. 4.75
Overall: Another really good offering from Cantillon. I can see why this is so sought after. I didn't find it to be the mind blowing experience I've seen it described as, but that's not to say it isn't excellent or worth seeking out. 4.25
***Updated notes from 2014 vintage (Scores are based on this)***
Bottled August 21, 2014. Poured into a Cantillon Iris balloon glass in November 2014.
Appearance is basically the same. Aroma is much fruitier and a bit more funky/musty and just overall more intense than the 2013. Ditto for the aroma, with the slight herbal quality from the 2013, not being present in this one. Mouthfeel and drinkability are just as incredible as last year. Overall enjoyed the 2014 quite a bit more, though to be fair this I had this about 5 months fresher than the 2013. 1,546 charactersJonada, Feb 16, 2014

Large format bottle from Tipples, capped and corked, with an Aug 30, 2013 bottling date. Cracked Feb 9, 2014. Pours into my tulip hazy apricot yellow with a very large fluffy and fizzy white head that dissipates relatively quickly. Aroma of apricots, lacto, yeast funk, dusty dryness. This smells both mouthpuckeringly dry and sour. Flavor is apricots up front and tart lemons, with another punch of sour in the middle. Finishes dry but soft with oak and apricots lingering with an extra lacto sour punch. Light bodied with medium to high carbonation. A yummy sour beer with lots to like. The fruit really comes out as this warms a bit so make sure not to drink it too cold. Keeps improving as I go here. very nice. Looking forward to trying my Kriek now. 784 charactersBMMillsy, Feb 09, 2014

A - Light peach, immediately dissipating "head" and no lacing (to be expected). Cloudy, near opaque body.
S - Sweetart/shock tart candy, some horse blanket/farmhouse funk and assorted melon fruit notes. Some of the tart funk combined to form the slightest resemblance to earwax.
T - Peaches(apricot?) and Creme Hard Candy, light lemony tartness. Very faint touches of oak.
M - Very mimosa-esque, light dissipating mouthfeel and smooth creamy finish.
O - Amazing. Wouldn't have expected anything less. 571 charactersZach136, Feb 03, 2014

Smell is even better. So juicy, tart, loaded with apricots. Smells so fresh and vibrant. The taste its very apricot forward, with some funk on the backend. There's a decent amount of sourness here, but it doesnt take away from the fruit too much. Delicious. The mouthfeel is so creamy, coats the whole mouth with a fair amount of carbonation. The apricot and funk lingers for days. As it warms you get a few more flavors. Some green apple in there. Really glad I got to try this. 590 charactersMikeypnh, Jan 30, 2014

A - pours a hazy straw to light orange. Somewhat aggressive, foamy head that dissipates relatively quickly. 
S - even poured cold out of the fridge, this just explodes with aromas of sweet peach, apricot. Reminds me of Japanese peach candy. So much fruit aroma it is unbelievable. I could smell this beer for hours. As it warms, some of the typical Cantillon funk and wood notes come out. 
T - You expect a much sweeter beer based on the nose but it's a mildly sour beer with a dry finish and very nice stone fruit presence. 
M - dry, but with a nice sweet aftertaste, similar to eating a perfectly tart and sweet apricot. Pleasant carbonation. 
O - come on. There is just no way this could ever have lived up to the expectations I had for it. That being said, this is one hell of a beer and probably the best I've had from Cantillon. The smell drives this beer and the flavor is outstanding. 923 charactersEliotRosewater, Jan 21, 2014

Fou' Foune pours a delight in the glass. A hazy golden straw with a pillowy head to die for for. The apricots come and go with the temperature. They come with a warming glass, to offset the perfectly balanced sourness, and then disappear each time the glass is refilled from the bottle from the fridge. It's not too sour, but neither is it bland. It is Perfectly Balanced
Tonight I drank a bottle on my own as the sun set on my balcony, and I will never forget it.
Thank you Fou' Foune
PS the bloody cork shat itself into the beer as I opened the bottle, but that kind of doesn't go with the rest of the tale, does it? 642 charactersheygeebee, Jan 11, 2014

Hazed orange, ring of white head with some lace. The nose here is just insane, juicy apricots, fruity, funky and acidic, musty barnyard notes, fruity-lemon as well, but the apricot on this is just out of this world, top 3 if not the best smelling beers of all time for me. Taste is good but a step down from the nose, that being said it still is fantastic, big puckering sour upfront, apricot and fruit, lemony, tart all the way through, acidity is fairly restrained, but the fruity funk here is just crazy, apricot aftertaste. Dry puckering mouthfeel, medium carbonation and body. This blew me away, I thought it would be good but this was near perfect, drinking the whole bottle alone was a pleasure and would love to do it again sometime. 787 characterspeensteen, Jan 02, 2014

4.59/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a stemmed glass. This is a 2012 version, so has a little over a year of age on it.
Appearance: Pours a translucent gold-orange color and leaves a big two finger head which fades in a flash to nothing. Sporadic carbonation can be seen, but not too much.
Smell: Nice apricot, mild grassy funk, lemon-lime, mild juniper berries, apple skins, slight sour. The apricot really takes the lead in a nice way and is definitely not overwhelming, but just right.
Taste: Perfumey apricot, slight funk, lemon, grapes medium sour, oak. Very nice, and borderline puckeringly sour. Definitely has a white wine flavor quality to it. Very nice.
Mouth-feel: Low to medium carbonation with a medium, sour, dry body. Finishes quite dry and sour.
Overall: Really well balanced and nice. Just the right amount of sour for an apricot lambic, and the apricot really comes through deliciously. The aroma is wondrous. Opened this for a special occasion, and it's a great beer for that. So tasty and just a great drinking experience.
Edit: I had a 2014 version with 6 months of age on it and it had a lot more apricot, and a fantastic nose. I definitely enjoyed this with a little less age on it. 1,207 charactersResuin, Dec 21, 2013

A= This beer poured a hazed deep gold color and put up a 1" snow white head with every pour. The head dropped relatively quickly but left a nice ring behind.
S= The aroma was about 2/3 sweet apricot over 1/3 lambic character. Very beautiful in the nose.
T= Started off with a burst of sweet apricot flavor before the tart, funky lambic flavors kicked in. Nice dry oak character was present but not overpowering. The balance between sweet fruit and the sour character was just perfect. Finished bone dry and puckery, which inspired the next sip every time. 
MF= Light body with a nice dry feel. Prickly carbonation was just right. 
D= Off the charts delicious and drinkable. Rivaled the best sours I have ever tasted and one that I will be seeking out again and again. 854 charactersspointon, Nov 09, 2013

The aroma is of sweet sweet apricot along with oak, funk, and a balance of tartness and sweetness.
The flavor hits immediately of juicy fresh pure apricot then moves onto a gentle tartness that lingers lightly. There's a malt character that cleans that up and really makes this beer so perfect and balanced. It's a strong lemony sourness and dries of oak on the end.
This beer really stands out as the best sour I've had. It truly has fantastic balance. It's so delicious drinking with the fruit being the all star in this beer. 606 charactersdar482, Oct 28, 2013

4.54/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Cantillon Fou Foune 2012 vintage. 750ml poured into Cantillon sherry glass. Best before August 2017 according to the label. 5% ABV. 
Appearance: Pours a hazy, straw golden color. Off-white head consisting of one-finger-sized. Appears sparsely carbonated as expected.
Smell: Overripe and juicy apricots. Followed by light hints of oak and vanilla. Slight musty notes. Gentle lactic acid aroma. Finish is soft and delicate.
Taste: Smooth and gentle waves of lactic acid and acetic vinegar wash over the tastebuds. This fruited Cantillon is roughly a year old, yet still leans in favor of the sweet malts, rather than the sourness that dominates over time. The vanilla comes out a bit stronger than in the aroma, and compliments the wood-character very well. Fou Foune finishes with a bang of fresh, juicy apricot flavor that delivers on your wildest fruited-sour fantasy. 
Mouthfeel: Low but prickly carbonation. The body is almost medium in character, but I'd say it's right about a low-high. The gentle carbonation allows the beers flavors to shine.
Overall: A very impressive fruit sour from Cantillon. However, since it was nearly a year old, I was not able to enjoy it fresh as the brewery highly recommends. I'm betting the fruit character is much more intense and vibrant, and I look forward to this beer being released next month. Hopefully I get another bottle, after which I will update or add on this review to reflect that. 1,438 charactersClonies720, Sep 13, 2013

4.84/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I have had this beer multiple times during the last 2 – 3 years both draft & bottled. I have bought a case of it at some point. I must say that I am a bit puzzled by the American interest in this beer because age does not benefit this beer as is the case with quite a few of Cantillon fruit beers. Nowhere is freshness such a big factor as it is with Fou’ Foune. The fresher you drink this beer, the better. Fou’ Foune is at its peak during the 6 weeks after bottling, max. maybe 9. After that it is pretty level for most of its life span af far as I can see. It has a low point 6 months in or so, improves slightly after a year or so and stays level afterwards. 
It is a good beer once it has peaked but it is for me personally bit of a downer compared to how ridiculously good it is fresh. 
Review for a fresh bottle (75 cl.) @ brewery:
A: murky yellow apricot colour with a slight orange hue and a super firm lambic-styled head which doesn’t even vanish after you have finished your glass. 
S: ridiculous, pure apricots, slightly mashed super juicy apricots, ripe and within seasons, the kind that are impeccable.
T: this tastes basically like a glass of apricot compote but even better than compote is, fresh there is no “complexity” in this but who needs complexity when your beer tastes this good? Also getting some slight yeast, slight flour-like feeling, smallest hints of barnyard and lemon (smallest hint). No tartness and no real sourness to speak of, this is almost real fruit sugars sweet.
B: luckily not too much carb. full juice and slight touch of flour body. 
2012 one was way better fresh than the 2011 one, great harvest I assume?
By better I mean 2011 was nice, 2012 was mind-blowing.
Not sure about the score, fresh 2011 was around 4.6 – 4.7.
Fresh 2012 was almost 5. Aged ones were around 4.1 – 4.4.
Going to calculate mainly the fresh ones give it around a 4.8. 1,908 characters77black_ships, Sep 04, 2013

750mL bottle into a Teku
bottled on: 18 August 2011
A huge thanks for Sc0pey for the generous trade. And to think he came all the way across the pond to trade this one to me! 
A: Pours a hazy golden yellow-orange with 2.5 fingers width of bright white head. Head dissipates down fairly slowly, but leaves effectively zero lacing. 
S: Nose is apricot flesh, sour citrus, oak, vanilla, tart lactic acidity, and faint notes of funk. Good mix of sweet and tart, but neither is dominant. Smells incredible though, especially as it warms. 
T: Hugely sour right from the start, much moreso than the nose implied. There is an almost burnt plastic like funk character that is prominent at first but quickly give way to the lactic tartness. The tartness is puckering, and builds significantly throughout the drink. Big sour lemon, like a Lemonhead or lemon flavored warhead. A really nice aftertaste of apricot and oaky vanilla lingers forever in the aftertaste. Excellent. 
M/D: Medium body, carbonation on the heavier end, puckering mouthfeel from the sourness, dry on the finish. Drinkability is very good. 
O: Overall, an excellent drinking experience. This is only the second Cantillon Ive had to date, the first being St. Lamvinus. If I had to choose a preference, Id probably go with St. Lamvinus over this one, but no doubt that both are absolutely excellent. Highly recommend. 1,401 characterszac16125, Aug 24, 2013

4.81/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5the great and mighty fou foune, I finally found one. at a hole in the wall called novare res in downtown Portland, maine. this was on the last page of an incredible beer list. I ordered one and was told they were out. I threw a fit like a baby, said id driven 600 hundred miles to get one, and she said she would be right back. she offered me a 2005 lou pepe instead, but I just couldn't switch gears that quick. after sitting there debating what to do for a few minutes, the manager or owner emerged with a bottle of fou foune for me, all dusty and looking very much like something special. they chilled it for a few minutes, before serving it up in a very cool old mail bin with two cantillon wine glass type containers. the beer pours faded orange in color, rustic looking, cloudy, with a white head like fine champagne, rising and receding to about an inch. the smell is just mental, lots and lots of acid here, a fine lambic is the base. lacto and lemon, tart and funky. the apricots seem to add a floral element, a fruity sweetness to balance the sour, but I don't distinctly get apricots just by smelling it. it has the interesting effect of making my mouth water for every tasty treat ive ever had all at once. im watering like blue razz blowpops, sour nerds rope, lemon shaved ice, and porterhouse steak all at once. this sensation alone makes this beer a 5 out of 5 overall. nothing in the beer or culinary world has ever had this effect on my palate, and ive been around both a few times. the taste is very impressive, again, a mellow but distinct lambic as its base, I start to taste the apricots. they have a gentle fuzzy feel and flavor, like licking the outside of one. there is a sweetness there, but the juicy character of the fruit and pulpy morning time flavor profile are not dominant. what is dominant is the yeast. the best of lambic, tart and dry as any beer ive consumed. its acidic, and the lower the bottle gets and the warmer it gets, the more this is pronounced. my last yeasty sip is impossibly sour, putting hair on my chest to say the least. its dry on the palate after an insanely effervescent carbonation experience, but I taste the beer for miles and miles after the swallow. not sure ill have another beer again for awhile (yeah right). this is a one of a kind brew, an art form really, and worth all of the accolades its received and then some. nothing like it on the planet, and easily the best 50 bucks I have spent in awhile. not sure lambic will ever be the same... 2,505 charactersStonedTrippin, Aug 22, 2013

2006 Vintage
My man Lum sent me a couple of these since I haven't found any '06 bottles around here for a long time, thanks P! The body on this lambic is fairly light with hazy apricot being the dominant color but turning to a more milky lemon when backlit. The super white head grows to a finger in height easily with that snap, crackle, pop that goes along with a healthy carbonation. Drink lines remain after each sip and slowly slide back into the body. 
Fou' Foune proudly shows off one of the most amazing aromas I've come across in a beer of any style. The signature Cantillon funkiness jumps from the glass but is quickly met with a noseful of sensation stimulating tart and ripe apricots. The apricot is so vivid and in your face I can nearly feel the juice dripping down my chin. Damp, decaying wood and wet rock brings up the rear and rounds out this delicious concoction. The Cantillon funk, lactic sourness, and apricot create an aroma that's unlike any other and instantly makes my mouth water. 
The flavor can't quite reach the heights the nose did but that would be nearly impossible. Bracingly sour Cantillon funkiness hits the tongue first before the tart apricots makes their way through. Dry woodiness brings up the rear and lactic sourness bathes the tongue. The acidity hits immediately along with the sourness. After a few drinks I get used to the sour and the flavors open even more. Slight mustiness and earthy qualities swim throughout each drink. This is some delicious lambic. 
The body is light, the carbonation is lively and the sourness is enough to cause a pucker with each drink. The carbonation isn't prickly but does manage to scrub the tongue. The finish is slightly dry but not to the extent of the Sahara. 
The drinkability on this lambic is off the charts. When I get used to the bracing sourness it's hard for me to set the glass down. Each drink is so delicious and refreshing that I instantly look forward to the next. 
Dyan shared a bottle of this with me a few months ago and it absolutely blew my mind. Fou Foune is one of the best lambics on the planet and one of my favorite beers at the moment. If you are anywhere near this beer pick it up, more than one would be ideal. Thanks for the bottles, Lum! 2,261 charactersjoe1510, Aug 19, 2013

Appearance- Hazy apricot color with white fuzzy head that left nice lacing.
Smell- Straight apricot. Funk, apricot, lemon, yeast. Beautiful. Apricot dominates.
Taste- Apricot, yeast lemon, Cantillon funk, earthy oak. So good. Once again apricot dominates.
Mouthfeel- Medium carbonation, medium pucker factor. Not extremely sour, but perfectly balanced.
Overall- Easily in the top 5 beers I've had. Truly outstanding. Lives up to it's hype and more. 522 charactersSeanniek91, Aug 06, 2013

4.69/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Cantillon Fou' Foune pours (suitably enough) a lovely apricot colour that becomes gradually more and more sullied as the bottle empties. It looks quite charming in its proper glass, a bit less so as it becomes so murky. Little speckles of bubbles follow one behind the other to quickly align into a thin but long-lasting head and accompanying lacing to boot. 
This aroma does not have the nose-hair curling 'funk' of other Cantillons but is mouth-watering all the same (more?) in spite of it. An ambrosial apricot perfume lends plenty of grace to a bouquet that might otherwise be described with words like 'wet socks', 'lake water' and 'barnyard'. At the risk of sounding dramatic, it smells absolutely heavenly. 
The flavour of the fruit is far more prominent than it is in other Cantillon offerings (i.e., the Kriek or Rosé). The taste of apricot is instantly recognized and ethereal. We don't need to worry about artificial flavours or extreme sweetness with this brewer; the fruit taste is genuine (no overstated marmalade or nectar-like notes) and perfectly harmonized with the lambic's tartness. 
Not only is the beer a little more fruit-forward, but the sourness is a bit more reserved (relative to what Cantillon is capable of, that is). The acidity is sharp, but not really sharp enough to pierce the palate. The mouthfeel can feel a bit creamy on some sips as traces of vanillin are infused by the oak. There's even a crushed mint quality I've noted on at least two occasions. 
Adding fruit to lambic likely began simply as a means of not wasting precious produce in the days before refrigeration; anyone who's ever tried to eat local knows how short the growing season is and how difficult it is to find use for a whole harvest before it spoils. It turns out that, in the case of Fou' Foune anyhow, this practice happened to make one of life's most sublime treats. 1,881 charactersbiegaman, Jul 31, 2013

Riedel Tulip
A: Really brilliant orange color. Looks almost like light orange juice in the glass. Thin layer of bright white head. Not leaving lacing. Not a huge pop on cork, but there is still carbonation.
S: Really sweet apricot still. It's just amazing at how nature that smells. Then you get the typical Cantillon musty notes. It's something completely unique to them. Muted tart and funky sour.
T: Epic mesh of Cantillon funk and apricot sweetness. Even after nearly a full year since bottling, you still get pronounced Apricot in the flavor. It's not overly sour, as with a queuze because of this sweetness and it hasn't been completely eaten up by the bugs. Doesn't destroy the palate. Fairly dry finish, but there is still the delicious fruit.
M: Light to medium bodied. Dances on your palate.

A - Dark hazy golden orange with a nice one finger white head
S - Lots of peach and apricots that lend a light sweetness to the nose
T - Tart lemon up front with lots of lactic acid. The peach comes thru in the middle to give it a sweet presence but the strongest flavor is definitely the tartness.

O - Solid apricot / peach lambic that balances the light sweetness of the fruit with the tartness for the lambic. The tarter aspects defintiely dominate compared to the other flavors. 612 charactersjeonseh, Jun 12, 2013

A-The brew is cloudy and light golden apricot in color. A thin white head drops quickly to patchy cap of foam. A few streams of carbonation are visible. 
S-The smell has strong apricot, as you would expect, to go along with the mild, earthy funk. There is a mild sweetness here that balances the sour white grape and vinous acidity. Quite tart.
T-The taste also has heavy doses of apricot. The funk remains mild, and sort of in the background; it works well with the apricot flavor. The sour factor is pretty high here, but there is a lemon-drop type of sweetness that keeps the brew from being a pure mouth-puckerer. The finish is quite long and vinous.
M-The carbonation is fine and more assertive here than in some other Cantillons. That assertive carbonation works well with the tartness of the beer and keeps it lively and crisp-drinking.
O-This is close to my favorite Cantillon and close to my favorite beer. The apricot integrates so well with the standard gueuze/lambic flavors...much better than cherry or raspberry, in my opinion. The result is balanced, complex, bracingly tart, drinkable, and delicious. 1,156 charactersspoony, Jun 02, 2013

A- Very hazy orange (apricot skin) with a white head about an eighth of an inch thick that doesn't seem to want to go away. Vigorous carbonation is evident, the bubbles seem to be rising to the surface at a champagne-like rate. No lacing is evident. 
S- Classic cantillon barnyard with a citrus acidity similar to orange zest. Apricots are very evident as well, providing a sweet, tropical note to the funky lactic overtones. 
T- I don't even know where to begin. Extremely complex. While the apricot is very mellow on the nose, it comes through with a huge tart stone fruit mixed with lemon zest and orange peel. Pretty much, I'm trying to say it tastes like apricots without saying the word apricot. After the apricot flavor dies off, there is an earthy flavor that makes way for a huge blast of lemon zest and lactic acidity that leaves you looking like a sour patch kid. A good two minutes after a sip, I can still feel the tingly sensation you get in your face after downing a whole bag of sour skittles and then eating the dust in the bottom of the bag. For someone who used to eat lemons as a young child, this beer is a dream come true. 
M- Prickly carbonation with an extremely dry finish in addition to the extremely sour notes from the taste. I am literally sitting here sweating because of the level of puckering.
O- The aroma and flavor are absolutely the best part of this beer, which is nice since those are usually the two biggest factors in a beer for me. This one definitely looks great as well, but with the huge apricot aromas and the complex stone fruit flavors bouncing around with the brett funk and huge acid, the flavor and aroma are what make this a world-class beer. I'm glad I got to down a whole bottle of this by myself instead of the half ounce pour I was lucky enough to have at a tasting earlier this year. 1,904 charactersjustforrazors, May 26, 2013

A- Ligh orange colour with a bit of haziness. Decent white head, soon recedes but still leaves a ring and some lacing on the sides of the glass
S- Tart acidity upfront. On the background a lively, fresh fruity feel, citric, some other fruity notes that may feel like apricots though i don't know if i would have catched it if i didn't know before. Not super complex as expected but still pleasantly strong and fresh
T- Pretty much what the smell suggested. I expected maybe something more complex but this is still great. Straightforward acidity upfront, tart with a slight spicy/prickly feel. Strong fruity notes, apricots now more easily detectable (it has that tart/sweet combination that is typical of apricots), lemon, maybe peach. Again, actually quite simple but amazingly pleasant, vivid and refreshing
M- Light body, with quite a good dose of carbonation to make it more lively. Prickly on the palate and on the sides of the mouth, more on the juicy side on the tongue, with fruit flavours more vivid there. Finish is pleasantly dry and refreshing, leaves you longing for another sip despite strong tartness
O- As already mentioned, a straightforward fruit lambic, fresh, lively, amazingly drinkable for the style, though maybe not as complex as i expected 1,297 charactersCozzatoad, May 18, 2013

Pours a vibrant orange with a big white head. Slightly hazy. Decent retention considering the acidity of a lambic. Some lacing. 
The aroma of fresh apricots melds wonderfully with the lactic and "barnyard" funk aromas of the Cantillon lambic. 
The apricots come out in the taste as well and fit in perfectly. The lactic sourness and the flavor of the apricot gives it the taste of a wonderfully sour fruit. The brett funk adds complexity in the usual fashion of the lambic. There is a nice bread like malt character in the finish. Medium carbonation and light body. 
Apricot lambic is a good idea. 695 charactersDanny1217, May 12, 2013

The beer poured out as a slightly hazy orange color with a white head on top. Good retention and moderate lacing. The smell is awesome. Very fresh and fruity despite the souring of it. Excellent nose on this beer, I could smell it forever. The taste is tart with a fruitiness to it also. Very well balanced. The mouthfeel is smooth, not as pungant as some sours.

A: Pours a beautiful light hazy yellow/orange with one full finger of pure white head. The foam takes a while to settles, and there is on a little bit of lacing as it drinks.
S: The nose is fruity tart, sour, an a touch salty. The apricots in this beer are right in the forefront and it smells utterly fantastic.
T: This beer has a good helping of apricot fruitiness right up front. It's sweet, tart, sour, and freaking delicious. You can feel it in the back of palate and along the sides of your tongue.
M: Medium bodied beer. It's sweet and drying up front. Coats the palate where is gets really puckering, and then slides off nicely. Tons of lingering sour greatness.
O: World class beer. It might be the best apricot sour I have ever had. However... I was expecting it to be a bit more "in-your-face" apricot. The fruit is there, but it's not as intense as I would have imagined. Still... I'm grasping at straws to find a flaw with this beer. Wonderful. I can't wait to try this beer with a few years in it to really make the sourness intensify. 1,070 characterstrxxpaxxs, Apr 29, 2013

Aug ‘06
A- This beer pours a slightly hazy apricot body with a thin film of snow white head that sticks a bit to the glass with each sip. 
S- The dry stone fruit really comes through as an almost earthy peach aroma with some nice tartness in the finish and a hint of white cheese rind. 
T- The dried apricot flavor blends with a big rounded acidic tartness and a dry aspirin note to the finish. There is a nice citrus hint to the full brett grapefruit pith that grows in the finish. 
M- This beer has a medium-light mouthfeel with a gentle fizz and a nice astringent bite that lingers for a bit in the finish. 
O- This is a wonderful beer. The great depth of an aged lambic really shows the brett character along with the nice well rounded but full tartness. The fruit flavor really comes through and can hold its own with the tartness and they both work very well together. Delicious. Thanks Emerge for sharing. 956 charactersrhoadsrage, Apr 24, 2013

Pours a gorgeous golden orange with a healthy finger of head. 
The nose is packed with fresh, juicy apricots. Underneath this lies typical Cantillon funk; leather and lemon and general barnyard-y smells. As it breathes, a bit of apple comes into the nose as well. 
On the palate it is packed with juicy apricot, especially as it breathes. Lactic acidity is present throughout but it is well integrated. There's a bit of spice upfront along with the apricot but it dies out quite quickly as it moves down the palate. In the back, apricot skin and peaches come through. The finish is a crescendo of lactic acidity; a nice soft sourness lingers with a touch of acetic acid. The lactic acid profile is unlike any other Cantillon I have tired, I feel it is not as sharp as others, but more gradual and well integrated. 
The mouthfeel is great. Silky smooth and well carbonated, but not overly so. 
As it breathes the fruit really comes out and it becomes a much brighter beer. This beer is amazingly well rounded, and the balance is incredible. Juicy apricots are contrasted with a touch of leather, barnyard and funk on top of a nice integrated and gradual sourness. The fruit is what shines here though and it makes for an incredible lambic. 1,262 charactersTallSaint, Apr 22, 2013

Re reviewed 2nd bottle from same brew date on March 31, 2013
Appearance 3.5/4
Hazy honey yellow with a ¾ inch of an effervescent white head.
Aroma 3.5/ 4.5
Mild sour lemony funk, with notes of sweeter candied apricot. As it warms up, more fruit; but not that overall aromatic with regards to fruit aspect
Second bottle I tried had much more intense apricot aroma with still aspects of funk notable. 
Taste 4/ 4.5
Relatively moderate sourness with undertones of lemon and some mild earthy funk. Finishes with a very tart aftertaste. Don’t get a lot of fruit, just a hint of sweetness midway through on the palate. 
Sruprisingly second bottle had much more apricot presence even though drank at a much later date. Definitely way more enjoyable and more of what I expected. 
Mouthfeel 4.5/ 4.5
Moderate carbonation. The beer is moderate to high sourness with fair amount of puckering ability. 
Overall 4.5/ 5
Presentation is clean, somewhat crisp. However, I was expecting more from this, based on the hype. The apricot presence is very subdued with my first bottle, but way more fruitiness in second bottle. That being said I found this beer very easy to drink and enjoyable. 
1st bottke-But not my favour Cantillon offering. Also given the price ($28 Canadian), I’m not sure if I would seek out again, given that I could find other offerings. 
Consider trying.
2nd- significantly better experience strangely. Now u understand the hype as this bottke had great sourness but also tins if apricot flavor. Definitely wish I had more.

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to huskermike for the trade on this one - definitely one of my top "wants" and I couldn't be more excited to finally try it. Shared with Mike as part of our mini sour tasting. Fou Foune pours a cloudy and slightly rustic, sunburst shade of amber. The foamy white cap sits generously at two fingers; big and bubbly, leaving a little bit of lacing along the sides of the glass.
The intense aroma of Fou' Foune starts infiltrating my nostrils as soon as the cork gets popped. Bringing the glass close to my face just launches me into complete beer nirvana. Holy fuckin' smokes. Crazy amounts of tart, sour, and funk just completely obliterate my sense of smell for moments at a time - peaches, apricots, apple skins, light lemons... The fruits just unleash their inner tartness and send my brain into a frenzy. 
Fou' Foune is so deliciously sour and tart, juicy and fresh, clean and inviting, it's unbelievable. Funk is no stranger either, with heavy amounts of barnyard, hay, and cellar funk clashing so elegantly with the fruit. Acidic all the way, with some milder vinous and vinegar notes hidden amongst the ruckus. The smell is simply mind-blowing, and it left me smelling the empty bottle, long after the night was over.
I just kept hoping that such a beautiful aroma was a promissory note for how amazing the beer was going to taste. Sometimes the aroma can build up your expectations, only to be let down once the liquid washes over your palate. So I take my first sip, and any expectations I had were just annihilated - completely blown out and blown up. If there really was a "nectar of the gods," it was Fou' Foune. 
My tongue is met immediately with a gorgeous bouquet of peaches, apples, apricots, and white grapes. Fruits so fresh, ripe, juicy, and tart, you wouldn't believe it if I told you. Start to finish, the sourness lasts and keeps your saliva glands pumping, but the tartness is controlled so perfectly and elegantly as to keep the beer drinkable without turning astringent. How is this possible?
Fou Foune offers an incredible stinging of the senses, and I mean that in the best way possible. The everlasting tartness is backed up with a moderate fruity sweetness that provides a good balance and only adds to the already insane drinkability. Little hints of wood, oak, and funk just pop in and out throughout the jungle of fruity goodness. Cork, hay, barnyard, funky yeast - added in seemingly perfect amounts. 
More copious amounts of oak and musty cellar funk in the finish compliment the fading tartness and fruity sweetness in the most elegant way possible. Thin-medium bodied with a surprisingly large presence for a 5% ABV lambic, crisp and sharp mouth feel with a ton of carbonation. It feels nice and drinks easily enough.
My expectations for Fou' Foune were high, and they were surpassed beyond belief. This is such a masterful beer in nearly every sense of the word. Most definitely the best sour I've had to date, and possibly the best beer I've ever had, period. Fou' Foune is a masterpiece, a work of art, and a one-of-a-kind benchmark of the style. Make it your life-goal to get your hands on Fou' Foune if you haven't already. 3,181 characterstectactoe, Mar 31, 2013

This review is of the '12 with some added notes from the '11. Thanks hevvymetalhippie and standardcherry for the bottles.
A- Pours a peach colored orange that's mostly translucent with some slight haze. A light thin white head forms that recedes to leave just a ring around the edges. Decent carbonation with fast rising carbonation bubbles.
S- Lightly tart with a nice funk presence typical of Cantillon that balances nicely with fruity apricots and a slight lemon acidity.
T- Fruity apricots and a hint of lemons with a nice balanced funk that goes well with the apricots. Finishes with a lightly sour lemony apricot presence. The '11 Fou has very little fruit presence with added funk.
M- Medium bodied, a hint of wateriness which in my opinion adds to the drinkability, nice carbonation that lightly tingles the palate.
O- This was a great fruit lambic that definitely lives up to Cantillon's esteemed reputation in the beer community. The beer is definitely typical of Cantillon and carries the Cantillon musty funkiness that is so unique from they're brewery. The funkiness balances terrifically with a nice peach presence and is highly drinkable for a sour. Glad I was able to try this and I wish obtaining bottles was a little bit easier. 1,353 charactersjaasen64, Mar 24, 2013

Smell: horse blanket, funk, mild apricot and other stone fruit.
Taste: a very sharp bite at first which dissipates into mild fruit flavor and then a fairly dry finish. leaves you at the same time quenched and wanting another puckering sip.
Mouthfeel: acidity is bracing balanced with enough sweet tones to land nicely on the palate. pleasantly full carbonation.
Overall: Better than I remembered from my last tasting. Not my favorite Cantillon but certainly a well done and very traditional fruit lambic. 632 charactersjono311, Mar 07, 2013

From a 750 into a tumbler
Bottled 28 August 2012
Best Before 2017
APPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, medium looking white head with decent retention. Hazy amber orange in color with lower levels of carbonation evident. Head fades to a thick ring but leaves no real lacing down the glass. 
SMELL: A bolder nose on this one with some lemon and citrus esters, funky and musty notes, as well as an obviously big apricot presence. A good dose of the added fruit, but not too much to dominate the lambic. Quite nice. 
TASTE: Follows the nose well, with a heavy dose of apricot, though not enough to crush the lambic. Some puckering lemon and funky, mouldy flavors though the middle, then more sourness and floral bitter notes at the swallow. Tart lemon, funky notes and enough bitterness to balance the sweet apricot in the bold and lingering aftertaste. Quite enjoyable and well put together. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium levels of carbonation. Creamy on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes rather dry. Puckering and somewhat acidic after the swallow. 
OVERALL: Really enjoyed this, and it definitely won the Cantillon fruit lambic showdown at the Kebab and Cantillon dinner party. The fruit was really nice and in enough force to put on a show, but not so much that it dominated the nose or flavor profile. Delicious and quite complex, this one is actually worth all the praise it gets. Glad to finally have tried this while paying attention. Cheers guys! 1,537 charactersJeffo, Mar 07, 2013

4.17/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured a pale golden orange in color with pale yellow highlights and a nice thin bubbly head that left some good frothy lacing sticking to the glass. Definitely had the signature cantillon bretty barnyard funk upfront on the nose with fresh peach apricot fruit notes, good citrusy notes with oak wood and nice acidcy for sure. The peachy apricot fruits came acroos more on the palate alongside great sour acidic notes with oaky wood accents which brought out more flavors, a touch of vanilla and plenty of brett barnyard horse blanket character to go around. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a fruity, semi sweet, bretty funky, woody, acidic sour and dry finish. I definitely dig this beer all around but I thought the 09 vintage was way better. 784 charactersGobzilla, Mar 03, 2013

Bottle from 20th of August, 2012.
A: Pours a light orange color forming a small white fizzy and very bubbled head. Small retention and no lacings formed or left
S: Very fruity. Strong notes of apricots and peaches. Lambic yeasts. Metallic. Vinegar. Light notes of malts
T: Very fruity. Again, mainly apricots and peaches. Lambic yeasts. Slightly sweet upfront. In overall, a dry and tart taste, however, much lighter acidity if compared with the Lou Pepes, for example. A little bit metallic with light notes of malts. A very light bitterness can be felt in the very end. Quite smooth and pleasant taste
M: Light body, good carbonation. Smooth fruity aftertaste. Quite good taste of peach left in the mouth
O: Excellent drinkability. Excellent fruit beer. Mandatory to Cantillon fans, independently of the hype around it 885 characterseduardolinhalis, Feb 01, 2013

Pours a fluffy white head that almost fizzles away. The Foune has a opaque orange body with varying shades throughout the tulip glass.
Lots of apricot aroma and sweetness. Some pear, acidity, funk, hay and cheese.
That first sip hits you in the jaw with a right hook. Sour! Afterwards it lessens quite a bit after shocking the system. Apricots and apricots. Funkiness hangs out in your dry mouth.
Lively bubbles and a light body. Spot on. The mouthfeel on Cantillons always seems to be on point.
Worth the hype? Maybe. Super solid regardless. I would say definitely drink it within a year like the bottle says if not sooner. The apricot is too good. Had a 14 month old bottle and I could easily tell the difference in apricot levels although the older one had a heftier sourness to it. 802 charactersMattSweatshirt, Dec 27, 2012

A: Golden-orange with good clarity. Semi-aggressive pour into a Cantillon tulip produces about an inch of dense head that recedes fairly quickly to a layer of foam
S: Pure apricot with minimal funk. Great expression of the fruit.
T: Lots of fruit. Quite tart, but not over the top. As it warms up, a bit of woodiness shows up, but the fruit remains dominant.
M: medium-high carbonation. Fairly light in the mouth. Plenty of acidity to keep things lively.
O: I've never had this beer so fresh and it's quite remarkable to see how much fruit aroma and flavor it packs in. Great beer. 619 characterskscaldef, Dec 25, 2012

Appearance is at first fizzy settling into a golden orange with only a wisp of foam. 
Smell is dank and deep. Obvious apricot with only a hint of sour if you search for it.
Taste starts bright on the tongue followed by a wave of apricot nectar and then perfectly balances sweet and sour at the end. Somewhat dry, the fruit acidity leaves the mouth watering for more.
Mouthfeel is a bit slicker and chewer than I expected, in a good way.
Overall this is an easy review...two words sum up this beer: well-crafted and delicious. 553 characterswifehatesthebike, Dec 15, 2012

4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from Belgianbeershop.com. A hazy orange golden beer with a moderate white head. The aroma is very fruity, filled with peach and apricots and a clear sourness. The taste is very well balanced and very fruity (apricots, peach, a touch of citrus). This is a wonderful lambic, near to perfection and a must drink for every lambic lover. 339 charactersMarc_V, Dec 05, 2012

A: pours a cloudy golden color with fine bubbles coming through, but not much head, and no retention. 
S: bright smelling with lemon, apricot, and peach. Some good funk is in there, but it doesn't come through too much. 
T: again with a slight funk, but mostly sourness and fruit flavors like peach and apricot. The acidity is delicious, but certainly not the most sour out there. Barely a hint of sweetness. 
M: bright, acidic, thin but coats the mouth well so that you can feel it for a while. 
O: most excellent lambic, so happy to have tried this finally. It's not overwhelmingly flavorful, but delicious and balanced for my tastes. 693 charactersHolland, Dec 04, 2012

A: Golden-orange with a thin lacing. 
N: Apricot, lemon, some sourness. Not as complex as I might have expected.
T: Tons and tons of apricots. Lemon rind and some raspberry hints. More apricot. Peach. A very pleasant sourness some ’glue’ funkiness. 
M: Dry and somewhat oily. Good without being perfect. 
O: The fruit is spectacular here, but it’s not quite as complex as I would have hoped. Still a worthy beer, but I think its ratings have gone up due to the difficulty in obtaining it. 642 charactersSarlacc83, Dec 03, 2012

4.85/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle into a large tumbler at Churchkey during Zwanze day 2012. From notes.
A real nice orange amber pale lemon color, opaque and orb glowing. Head is presented with a thin creamy top of light off tan color, almost looks like a dolop of cream spooned on to it. A real nice looking lambic, it glows in the sunlight.
Nose hints with classic sour funky aromas, and apricot juice. Rind like zest peel, and dried apricot fruit, even goes into cherry like aromas, fascinating. Mouthwatering smell with a real balanced acid compliment.
Palate comes with a large fruit component in the first taste. Whaffs of apricot fruit and large juicy feel with a malt depth taken over by a good sourness. Biting rind of zest comes through with chewy apricot and sour. Not particularly tart, but sourness takes over the malt action keeping the fruit just slightly downplayed. The head comes with the palate and makes a wonderful creamy feel along with the thick fruit juice quality on this. Finish gives wonderful big pepper, a quick black pepper a little. It all feels real nice together this controlled apricot and cream and pepper and classic funk.
Overall I think this just might be my favorite Cantillon to date. This also drinks so incredibly easily, it was hard to nurse this I wanted to finish this in nothing flat it's so delicious and have more. 1,355 characterssmakawhat, Dec 02, 2012

(A)- Just like I remember it. Pours a hazy brilliant golden orange color that produced a nice pure white head that dissipated quickly.
(S)- Intense yet vibrant apricot fruit. Not tons of funk or oak, but they are there. The acidity is also quite bold; excellent.
(T)- Similar to the smell pretty much. Just superb acidic apricot and peach flavors that are balanced just so well with a subtle oaky dryness. Quite sour, but just so good.
(M)- An excellent carbonation level combined with a superb and excellent balance of sour fruits and dry oak with just a bit of funk in the background. Finishes ever so sweetly that just balances it out that much better.
(O)- Just superb in every way. It has been awhile since I last tasted this (almost 2 years), and it is great to try it at a fresher stage since the bottle I had back in 2010 was an '05. So vibrant yet so sour and fresh tasting. Had to go back for a second pour. 948 characterssweemzander, Dec 02, 2012

A-Bottled 28 Aug 12, this beer pours dirty golden with a ringing of white foam with a lot of lively carbonation.
S-That typical Cantillon smell-funky. Aromas of barnyard, horseblanket, just a very subtle hint of apricot. Not as much fruit aroma as you get in the kriek or rose.
T-Very tart-the sourness definitely hits you up front. The apricots are there in the finish but as in the aroma they are quite weak, in a fresh bottle I expected more.
M-Typical Cantillon
O-Yes definitely a Cantillon beer and no doubt fans of the brewery will like this brew but for my money I think either the standard gueuze or a rose de gambrinus is just as enjoyable if you are looking for eithe a straight gueuze or a fruit lambic and don't see the hype associated with this beer...other than it is hard to get. 1,009 charactersdeebo, Dec 02, 2012

Super dry and effervescent. Plenty of fruit funk and sour qualities. You get some of the apricot but it's like the dry intense flavors of dried fruit. Very enjoyable. Again with this style its so complex and delicious that it's hard to describe. But in my personal opinion, not as great as I was hoping for and I think Zwanze 2012 was much better. 377 charactersGatch, Dec 01, 2012

Hazy orange gold body--infused by the color of apricots. Poured into a tulip, a half inch head was produced that quickly dissipated completely. 
Clean sour and sweet apricot notes, old wood and vanilla. 
Bright and delightfully tart taste of fresh apricots. There is just a bit of funkiness ending with a little bitterness, probably from hops as the website says the apricots are pitted. Dry finish.
Light body with fizzy carbonation, this drinks like champagne even when the foam is gone. 
Terrific. One of the most delicious and most unique beers in the world. I really can't find anything to fault. Though I am sorry to have consumed my only bottle. 838 charactersBeerenauslese, Nov 24, 2012

Pour: Hazy golden orange, with a nice two finger fizzy head. Head dissipates rather quickly, and doesn’t leave much lacing.
Smell: Wow. Sweet apricots and pear up front, with a nice funk throughout. If something can smell sour on the nose… this does, with a nice lactic aspect. Again, wow.
Taste: WOW. High apricots and apricot skin, tart pear, lemon zest, and a slight peach skin right off the bat, followed by a beautiful funk. Amazing lactic sourness throughout. A slight oakeyness helps this beer finish dry, but the tartness lingers.
Mouthfeel: Great prickly sourness mingles with really nice carbonation. Acetic, but in a great way. Awesome dryness on the finish. Perfect.
Overall: This beer is flawless. That is all. 797 characterscfrances33, Nov 22, 2012

A: Gorgeous head, delightful foam. Below it is very pleasantly honey-colored.
S: The unmistakable Cantillon funky horse blanket is there, but only just. It's far more subtle than the gueuze or kriek. A little touch of sweetness in the aroma, but not much. Beguiling.
T: Only slightly sour, which was surprising. Slightly tart, with a lovely apricot hint. Very well balanced with delicate complexity.

Pours a deep clear golden color with a huge white head that slowly dissipates but remains a cap on the top. The aroma is quite tart with lemons and sour apricots dominating the nose. A solid hit of funk and light plastic phenol round out the nose. The flavor is fruity with apricots with a lemony tartness and hints of sour cherries and plums. A solid hit of horsey funk round out the flavor nicely. Medium body with a moderate level of carbonation and a tart puckering mouthfeel. I think I'm going to go against the grain on this one a little bit here. This is a fine beer and I enjoyed it, but I can't see what all the hype is behind this one. 660 charactersjohnnnniee, Nov 11, 2012

Pours a beautiful translucent straw-orange, with a fluffy white head. Kind of an apricot color, obviously. Nice lacing.
Smell is really big juicy, kind of peachy. Really big smell, don't need to lean towards the glass at all to get it. A bit of funk, but really the fruit takes center stage. This is unbelievable smelling, though. Apricot, peach, a bit of apple, slight funk and hay. Delicious. I want to live in this smell forever.
Taste is very similar. A bit lighter on the apricot and a bit bigger on the funk. Still, it's not very sour. It's got a nice tartness, but not much mouth puckering. Apricot is big upfront, gives way to lemon and granny smith in the middle and some funk in the finish. Really delicious.
Mouthfeel is fantastic. Light, dry, well carbonated. Goes down very smooth.
This is absolutely fantastic. Just delicious, and crazy drinkable. Putting down a 750 of this is no problem at all. Like a delicious apricot mimosa. Drink this. 974 charactersrodkin, Oct 07, 2012

Poured a glowing, full hazy, bright orange with powerful carbonation and a thin but persistent white head leaves swathes of lace. Nose is amazing geuze character: bright citrus, lemons, tropical melons, sweat, salt water. Taste is full sour with amazing fresh fruit character though one specific fruit is impossible to pinpoint. "Apricot" is not necessarily evident as much as some medley of tropical melons and tangerines. Some slight eggy suplhur character comes in and out but does not detract too much from what is a massive lactic body that is zippy on the palate. Very refreshing, very sour. Can’t wait to crack some vintage bottles. 9/20/2010 9/4/8/5/16=4.2
750mL 2011 bottle. The fresher this beer is, the better. More of a juicy Yellow Bus style peach nose with fuzzy skin and rich juice. Taste is not quite as aggressive. Really nice- not one I think is worth to hoard but rather to crack open immediately. 963 characterstarheels86, Oct 02, 2012

A-Pours a hazy faint orange in color with a small amount of tight white head. 
S-The nose is perfection....the pinnacle of what every beer should smell like. It’s like apricot purée, apricot jam, and fresh apricot skin all shoved into one glass. It’s bliss. 
T-The flavor is a balance of apricot, lemon, oak, and funk. It’s incredibly sour, but not yet bracing. I much prefer fresh Fou Foune to aged bottles because of the balance sour and apricot. 
M-Mouthfeel is light, it’s acidic, gentle carbonation, and a long, pleasant finish. 
O-I’m hard pressed to think of many beers that surpass Fou Foune in quality. It is one of the best fruit lambic from probably the best brewery in the world. I need like 70 more bottles of this. 859 charactersTnudish, Aug 27, 2012

Score: 98
Bottled 08/18/11. Served in a Kentucky bourbon ale snifter and enjoyed on 06/20/12.
Appearance: Pours an opaque pale honey color. Good lacing and retention. Pours a thick fizzy white ring around the glass. 4/5
Smell: Lots of sweet apricot mixed with pear, tangerine and sweet citrus. Nice lemon backbone to the nose, a little sweet vinegar too. No real funk in the nose, which is how I like my sours, though there is a touch of "plastic." The sweet citrus becomes a little more vibrant as the beer warms and opens up. 4.75/5
Taste: Tons of tart apricot and peach and lemon zest. A little pear flavor to boot with the tart citrus. There is just a hint of funk on the midpalate, leaving me to wonder what additional complexities this beer develops with age. I am still learning to appreciate sours and learning how to pin down their complexities, so I am sitting here wishing I knew how to better describe this beer drinking experience to no avail. Suffice it to say that I am greatly enjoying this brew. 5/5
Mouthfeel: Light-plus mouthfeel, light-plus carbonation. Tartly sweet and mildly dry on the palate, but no huge pucker effect here -- certainly less than the Classic Gueuze from Cantillon. 5/5
Overall: One of the best non-IPA/non-stout beers that I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. If this beer was cheaper and more readily available, I would likely have a case-plus of this stuff in my cellar. Cantillon is slowly turning me on to the world of lambics, gueuzes, and other "sours."
Recommendation: Seek this world class lambic out; it will not disappoint.
Pairings: Lemon poppy seed muffins.
Cost: $35 for a 750 ml bottle (bar prices). 1,740 charactersjegross2, Aug 22, 2012

It pours a lovely apricot-orangey-peach color, very murky, even with a slow pour. Lots of bubbles racing around the glass. A nice offwhite head races up the glass but recedes just as quickly leaving no lacing or head retention. The aroma is fantastic, tons of fresh juicy apricot, peach fuzz, vinegar, funk and yeast. The fruit character of the aroma is just outstanding and perfectly inviting. The flavors are superb, the apricot flavors are super nice and juicy, tart, not overly sour. A little more acidic than I'd like with a high presence of vinegar and funk than the nose suggested. Some woodiness is definitely present as well. The body is good, a bit sharp, but nice and playful on the tongue. Carbonation is high yet the beer remains juicy. 
Verdict: Fantastic lambic from Cantillon. Probably my favorite lambic they make. I've had older vintages, which are very special, but something about the fresh fruit is just so perfect. 1,004 characterskevanb, Jul 29, 2012

O: For a sour beer, this is quite pleasant and very easy to drink because the fruity flavors of the apricots help to balance out the sourness. 582 charactersmetter98, Jul 16, 2012

poured at cellar temp into bruery tulip
750 ml bottle
Color: A hazy, but yet bright golden/orange. White 1 1/2f finger head that reduces to a thin bubbly cap after awhile. No lacing with light retention
Nose: Apricots what else, but the fruit has definitely faded compared to the fresher batches. Nice funk aroma with hints of wood, hay, and light lemon peel.
Palate: Wow! simply amazing. A perfect amount of carbonation making this beer very drinkable. The apricots hit the tongue first followed the an enjoyable wave of sourness and funk. This beer is dry, but yet it contains a good amount of spritz. At the end you begin to taste the oak/woody textures of this beer.
Finish: Long and dry with a good amount of texture. Mellow fruit which balances the light acidity at the end. An incredible beer that can be consumed fresh and aged.

A - Pours a hazy golden orange with two fingers of white head. Head has good retention but leaves no lacing.
S - Soft apricot with light sourness. Slightly funky.
T - Subtle apricot flesh with a funky, barnyard like flavor. There is a mild tartness that is coupled with an oak and vanilla like sweetness on the finish.
M - Medium-bodied, extremely dry, and supple. Carbonation is much more active than I expected it to be.
O - Definitely a great beer but it was a little bit of a let down for me. I thought the apricot was going to stand out a lot more then it did. Still another nice offering from Cantillon and glad I finally got to try it. 660 charactersSkiBum22, Jul 13, 2012

Vintage 2011. 
Look: Pours a cloudy orangish yellow color with a small bubbly head no real retention and leaves a film on top of the beer.
Smell: Barnyard funk and apricots. Didn't really pick up much else and found the nose to be a touch weak
Taste: Again I can't say I was let down here but I thought there would be more Apricot. The first sip of the beer brings so subtle sourness with a nice barnyard funk which is nicely balanced and on my second sip the apricot finally shows up it is not overpowering but I think in just the right amount but more could have helped it a bit
Mouthfeel: Thin body and bubbly carbonation slightly dry finish
Overall: This is a very good lambic and I am glad I got the chance to finally try it since I have passed on it in the past. Highly recommended and would drink again 827 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jul 03, 2012

Pours a slightly murky light honey orange with a foamy bone colored head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is sour, tart, and funky with wood and apricot aromas. Taste is the same and has a fantastic apricot flavor that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a great level of carbonation with a very crisp and somewhat dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is an exceptional beer and by far the best Cantillon I have tried so far by a longshot. 627 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jul 01, 2012

A - Poured into a Cantillon stemmed tulip a hazy golden yellow hue with a very thin white blanket that faded into a slight halo.
S - Aromas of nice light funk and faint apricots. Honestly I would prefer a bit more fruit/apricot with this.
T - Ah, there's the apricot! Nice and tart and sour with good almost puckering apricot. Light light stone/pits with some skin too. Nice fresh apricots slightly tart/bitter finish.
M - Mouthfeel is very nicely carbonated, almost harshly but the tart not white puckeringly sour apricot plays off of it nicely.
O - Overall this beer was basically every bit as good as the legend tells. It's a freaking delicious beer, however, as far as apricot goes I found The Bruery's Filmishmish to deliver more 805 charactersrudzud, Jun 23, 2012

(Make sure you don't pay too much for this one, because as with many Cantillon beers, it's way overhyped and way overrated.)
Looks nice: cloudy, honey-orange color, with about a 1/2" cap of delicate white bubbles for a head that recedes to a small ringlet, leaving soapy lacing on the glass. Distant, dry aroma, citrus zest, musty, touch of apricot. Tartness hits you up front on the palate, very drying, more citrus pith than anything, lemon juice, afterthoughts of candied apricot and grassy funk. Don't drink this if you have chapped lips. Fairly light bodied, a bit on the thin side, acidic, but with a good drying balance that improves the drinkability. Nice, but nothing really special going on here, but if you're a beer scene noob, you'll love it. 953 charactersRifugium, Jun 20, 2012

A - Cloudy orange/yellow. One finger of white head formed and receded to a thin layer.
S - Sour and funky up front with a fresh sweet apricot aroma.
T - The apricot is more prominent than in the nose and adds a nice juicy fresh fruit profile to the beer.   The tartness is perfect with a nice amount of funk balancing out the fresh, sweet fruit.   Perfection. 
M - Medium body, moderate to high carbonation. 465 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Jun 16, 2012

The aroma is full of fruity apricot, balanced softly by a nice suggestion of tartness.
This is incredibly sour. The taste is dry and tart throughout. The fruit flavor hinted at by the aroma is only subtly delivered in the flavor as it drowns in a hefty dose of tartness with a hint of grassyness.
This is medium bodied, with great crisp drink-ability. This is an absolute gem; all that it's cracked up to be. 561 charactersandrewinski1, Jun 16, 2012

Apricots and funk on the nose. Hints of acetic acid perhaps behind it all but minimally if at all. The fruitiness builds with time and the temperature of the beer increasing. Stellar funky nose that develops over time. I need to spend more time to think about this, in order to really do this justice, but I don't want to think too much The body has a strong effervescence that bites the tongue giving the beer a body that I think it would otherwise have lacked. More apricots in the body, with nice barnyard notes that pair well. A great beer I am glad to have 5 more of to consume over time and consider its growth... 784 characterskjyost, Jun 11, 2012

Appearance. Pours a quite hazy straw-peach with a finger of frothy white head that fades to a skim pretty quickly, but leaves some lace behind.
Smell. Ripe apricots, juicy tangy peaches, sweet grapes and some nice and soft, sweet and fruity hayloft funk. I could smell this the second I pulled the cork from the bottle and also now from my glass several feet away. 
Taste. Sour, slightly under-ripe apricots and peaches in a much more delicate way than the smell suggests. There's some good dry funk and a little bit of old wet wood. Very sour and tangy, and very nice. 
Mouthfeel. Medium-light body with fairly strong, fine carbonation. 
Overall. Another fine beer from Cantillon. I can't say it's the best in their regular
lineup for me, but I am loving every drop of this and will look forward to having it again someday. 915 charactersRutager, Jun 05, 2012

reviewed from notes taken 6/1/12.
vintage 2011.
Appearance: murky/hazy medium yellow bodied beer with a thin short lived white head.
Smell: Huge barnyard and funk. Little fruity peaches, apricots, pears.
Taste: This one is really sour. Lots of hay and funk; followed with peaches and hint of apricots. Nice complexity.
Mouthfeel: light bodied beer with carbonation placed at the high end of low almost at a medium carbonation level. Sharp, acidic, and clean. Finishes dry.
Overall: Awesome beer. Glad that I was give an oppurtunity to try such a hard to get beer. I probably wont see another bottle of this beer in my life time. This is my second Cantillion I have tried and its very nice. 758 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jun 03, 2012

Classic lambic look: hazed golden hue with a fine, tight white head that dissipates and leaves some soapy lace. Not much of a shift in colour from the fruit addition—it just looks like any other straight lambic or gueuze in Cantillon's range.
Nose is awesome, with crushed dried apricots coming through strongly above a vanilla sweetness like shortcrust pastry. There's a little greenness to it, but surprisingly, the lambic funk and acidity really doesn't come through. Overall, it's smooth, fragrant and rich. Lovely aroma.
Taste is also soft, and while the acidity is present here, it's much more restrained than in some of Cantillon's other brews. Ripe apricot, some fruit skin finishing with a clean crispness and a mild, soft tartness. Finish is long with a lingering funk and a bit of dust. Very nice.
Amazingly drinkable brew, perhaps one of the most drinkable Cantillons I've had the pleasure to sample. The soft sweetness of the apricots cushions the palate beautifully. Lovely beer. 1,085 characterslacqueredmouse, May 26, 2012

Pouring a burnish orange, honey hue with a certain denseness that points toward a yeasty haze; the beer builds a short-statured head of creamy white foam that reduces to a film before holding true for the last quarter of the session.
A sharp pang of sour notes create immediate impact on the nose in the form of tart peaches, apricots, and mangoes that may have been marinated in white wine, dry cider, and light vinegar. There's just the sense of pickled fruit that plays out in a rather musty and leathery scent that creates such intrigue and apprehension going into the first sip.
But that sip is just as sultry, savory, and sharply decided as I had feared- or shyly coveted. Just after the clean acidity hits the mouth with the taste of cider, white wine, and pickled fruit, the immediate aftertaste of peach or apricot arise even before the finish is delivered. The dryness and effervescence of the beer ushers in a quick visit to the gullet before the beer is appropriately evaluated. But as each sip whaffs over the tongue, other elements of dried fruit, including pineapple, green apple, peach, mango, and even papaya; all make marketed impressions on the palate en route to the whimsical lemony and leathery aftertaste.
This beer is alive with a clean and zesty texture that introduces its finish as soon as it does its initial taste. Drinkable, palatable, digestible... sure, but it takes a lot of concentration to understand the quick procession that this beer does, dancing across the tongue. It's incredible that a fruited sour ale delivers this intense of a dry beer without exposing any flaws in taste, astringency in texture, or wavering of body. Flawless? ...almost. 1,928 charactersBEERchitect, May 17, 2012

Hazy and the color of the fruit in it, with good head and retention. Funky, fruity and good! The apricots are strong here... I can only imagine how awesome would it be fresh. The fruit gets stronger with warmth.
Lactic and soft tartness in taste, very very sour. Some wood. Super dry and very enjoyable, but I am glad it was shared between 3.

A - Pure hazy, golden coloring. Wisps of white foam across the sides. Simple yet elegant.
S - Fantastic depth. Sweet ripened apricots, honey, light lemon bread, banana, clove, herbaceousness, flower petals, vinegar, and an incredible assortment of spice undertones. Could nose this for ages, love it.
T - Definitely has picked up a ton of puckering sourness and astringency from its time in the bottle. Front-end pure lemon and vinegar. Mid-palate shifts over to faint apricots and breadiness with lingering sourness. Light oak barrel and peppery spices on the backend. Pleasant light-fruit aftertaste.
M - Infinitely dry finish. High carbonation, medium body, smooth throughout the palate.
D - My favorite Cantillon thus far next to St. Lamvinus. The fruit has faded a bit in the drink, which is a slight disappointment (drink the 2010 asap), but the nose is really spectacular. 1,021 charactersAuracom, May 14, 2012

Shared at Beachwood BBQ's Ode to Lambic
App- A very very hazy orange looking yellow with a bit of a popsicle looks. A few bubbles and very little cling and a bit murky looking.
Smell- My word. Feel like a deep sourtherner. Huge fresh and vibrant apricot with a huge amount of funk on the back end of this one.
Taste- Again, taste follows the nose and it playes well together. The apricot is bright and a bit dry and the funk adds to the dryness but leaves you wanting to have more. It's fairly sweet, but not overly sweet nor puckering.
Mouth- A lighter medium and a medium carbonation. Didn't leave a lot in terms of residual flavors.
Drink- Damn tasty beer. I understand now, why so hard to get and why no one would say where bottles are. 815 charactersFosterJM, May 08, 2012

I can actually taste the apricot where as the aged bottle was much more sour and less fruit forward. I recommend drinking this fresh as possible.
Bottled August 2010. Courtesy of a generous Texas trader, can't recall exactly, poor job by me.
Pours a hazy dark golden color, almost orange, with a nice fluffy white head. A bit of spotty lacing and a minimal head that stays throughout.
Aromas begin with a lot of lactic acidity, lemon, peaches and tart green apple. The oakiness emerges as it warms with a really nice wet hay and barnyard funk.
The tastes directly follow the nose with loads of apricot/peach mixed with some very nice lactic sourness. The funk, earth, and wood emerge more and more as it warms. The lactic sourness and fruity apricot and pretty equal here; I credit that due to the age as I have been told this is much more apricot forward when fresh.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. Finish is dry and acidic but not overly so; pleasantly sour and tart in the finish but by no means the sourest or Brett forward beer I have ever had. Really in balance overall which is how I like pretty much all my beers regardless of style.
Overall this is world class, no bones about it. Flavor profile is exactly how you would want a fruited lambic to be, balance of fruit and funk is second to none. I don't think I would drink anything but Cantillon from June-August if I could readily track it down, but alas that will never happen. I prefer St. Lamvinus to this slightly but that is a personal preference, both are the two best Belgian lambics for my money. 1,676 charactersclaspada, May 05, 2012

4.45/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle from the Beer Bistro, Lot 11/08. Bottled August 5, 2008 - best before December 2018. 750ml into a tulip.
Clear gold in colour, with a white head and light lacing. A dense ring of retention remains. Nose is acetic with a typical Cantillon funk, light oak and a generally piercing acidity all around. Apricots are a bit hidden intially, but begin to reveal themselves more as this moves closer to room temp. Taste wasn't as sour as I had anticipated (7-8/10 sourness?), but still quite acidic in its own right. More white balsamic vinegar, Cantillon funk, only a sliver of oak, and similar to the aroma, warmth aids the revealing of the apricots. Some sweetness in there as well. Lighter medium body and sourness carries well into the finish. Fairly exquisite, and had my nose on this one for a better part of the time. Definitely a sipper, took me and the girlfriend over 2 and a half hours to get through this 750ml. Hoped for a bit more apricot flavour - perhaps a fresher bottle would've had more of this (eagerly awaiting one from a trading partner - will re-review!) 1,078 charactersliamt07, Apr 30, 2012

Been dying to try this and since the brewery was out, bye bye Euros. Hope it's worth it. 
A - yellowish-orange, clear, one finger of white, fluffy head. Dissipates slowly
S - bitterness, funk , apricots, fruity heaven. Fruit is apparent without being overpowering. Nothing could stop me from consuming this divine nectar 
T - tart, fresh, apricots. Clean finish. Fantastic. Crisp. No lingering anything. This is apricot. How the hell do they take a fruit I dislike and create a beer I cherish? Every drink causes tingling explosions of fruit but finishes crisp. Hats off to the boys at Cantillon again. 
M - clean. Coats the palate but dissipates quickly. Leaves you wanting more immediately. 
O - I could go on and on about this amazing brew. Cantillon doesn't make a "bad" offering, this one is great. Bottom line, if you have even a remote interest in this style, you owe it to yourself to seek this out. Even if you don't like the style, if you find it, drink it, odds are your mind will be changed. The price tag was hefty but zero regrets. Drinking it at Moeder just added the cherry (or apricot) on top. 1,199 charactersMomar42, Apr 26, 2012

A: The cork didn't seal the entire bottle, and disintegrated a bit into the beer. After pushing the cork down into the beer and pour delicately, we're left with a clear yellow pour with a finger of head. Minimal lacing is noticed, but the retention is decent.
S: The aroma is beautiful. Tart and sour with a wonderful addition of apricots. The fruits really mixes with the tartness well. The two play off of themselves perfectly.
T: This taste is why Cantillon is known as the best Lambic blender in the world. The apricots lend themselves to the tart, sour body as well as any fruit could. The above average sweetness and the lip-puckering sour contrast and blend in a way that makes it unfair to compare to other Lambics.
MF: The aftertaste is fresh and clean. The drinkability is crazy high as the balance keeps you coming back for more. Light in body and carbonated well.
O: $30 for the bottle, which was worth it if you can swing the price. I'm so glad I finally got to try this, if you see it splurge. You'll thank me later. 1,048 charactersrusswbeck, Apr 21, 2012

A: Cloudy apricot in color (go figure). Pinpoint bubbles with lots of effervescence at first. It glows!
S: Characteristic Cantillon acidity at first, then a gentle and refined wave of floral apricot character. A sweaty brett vibe envelopes the whole thing. Amazing and quite approachable for Cantillon. My nose was in the glass for 2 hours.
T: Huge brett barnyard basement funk, rounded and firm lactic acidity with soft apricots through the middle and finish. Finishes with trademark Cantillon 'saltiness'. 
M: Impeccably dry and extremely refreshing. It required a huge effort on my part to drink this as slowly as I did. I could kill a keg of this!
O: As amazing as any Lambic (or any beer), soft and approachable for Cantillon. Masterpiece. 763 charactersmattsander, Apr 10, 2012

A - Pours a very cloudy, light orange with a large fluffy white head. It slowly fades to half.
S - Funk and horse blanket tones hit you first, then the sweet apricots follow.
T - A soft gentle apricot, slight sweetness, followed by a slight funk.
D - Thinner body with good carbonation.

Bottle poured into cantillon tulip at Moeder Lambic.
Served in a lambic basket. Classy.
A - Pours a hazy golden brown with two fingers of white head. Head has good retention but leaves no lacing.
S - Musty smell with nice apricot presence.
T - Wow, very nice tart apricot taste to start, followed by a musty earthy middle with more apricot on the finish. The tartness is very refreshing, not puckering sourness. The apricot taste here is perfect. I'm surprised there aren't more lambics made with apricot, as it is so complimentary to the earthy funk elements.
M - Medium light crisp mouthfeel with a dry clean finish.
O - Just excellent all around. Tart but not overpowering. Funky but balanced. And a great showcase for the apricots.

Beer is a cloudy golden/orange colour. I am inclined to say apricot coloured given the flavouring of the beer and that would actually be pretty close. Small white head fades quickly.
Smell is clearly sour, with some chalk, yeast and funk. A strong, tart apricot scent is present. Minimal sweetness in the nose. The fruit smells very real, with none of the artificial qualities that I often find in the aroma of fruit flavoured beers, even when real fruit is used. 
Taste is like the nose. Very sour apricot, some funk, a bit of a crisp spiciness from the wheat. Not a sweet beer at all, actually a very dry finish along with the heavy sour flavour. 
As for mouth feel, pucker up! Dries the mouth out incredibly. Moderate carbonation and medium bodied, very smooth. 
Overall, very enjoyable if you like your beer sour. Really nice flavour and aroma. 877 charactersjrenihan, Mar 29, 2012

Cantillon Fou' Foune pours a hazy tangerine, with about two fingers of white foam. The head retention is surprisingly good for a lambic, but there's not a speck of lacing left behind. The nose is an absolute apricot bomb, loads of fresh fruit jumping out of the glass. Lurking behind it is some wet hay brett funk and a light lactic sourness. It's a beautiful aroma, but a little bit more balance in terms of more funk and sour to compete with the fruit would really make this perfect. My thoughts on the flavor profile are fairly similar. The big blast of apricot up front is great, but the wild aspects of the beer almost seem like they're just sneaking into the picture on the back end. I really like this beer now, but I think with another 6 months on it, it would be absolutely sublime. One thing that doesn't need time to improve though is the mouthfeel. THe body i crisp and light and paired with a wonderfully bubbly, almost champagne-like carbonation. Fou' Foune is another absolutely killer beer from Cantillon, quite possibly my favorite that I've had from them. It's a shame it's relatively hard to get your hands on, because I'd love to see what a little age does to this beer. 1,301 charactersaxeman9182, Mar 22, 2012

4.25/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on-tap @ the iTap House in Soulard (St. Louis), MO for $8. Tapped from a beer faucet w/o a Tap Handle (due to Cantillon not having their own handles) into a 33cl. Chimay Goblet. This is 2011 Vintage.
Aroma- Dusty apricot, belgian complexed blend of sour notes, and quite an acidic background. All very subtle and appropriate for this Apricot Lambic. 
Appearance- Received with a 2 finger, frothy head that has terrific head retention. Has a copper/apricot color body and is semi-hazy. Suds stay on the glass for minutes but then end up disappearing through the body and never stick. 
Flavor- Apricot and musky flavors start this one out. Seem as though this has been aged for some time, maybe due to sitting in the keg. Acidic and has a semi-dry finish. 
Mouthfeel- Light-Medium Bodied, Medium Carbonation, Musky, and leaves good apricot and light acidity on the palate. Puckers the tongue just a bit, nothing like other Cantillons. 
Overall Impression- While I waited for a month and stood in line for over an hour to get my glass of this, I had WAY too high of an expectation for this lambic from Cantillon. It was still very nice and enjoyable but would like to get my hands on a bottle of this since everyone agreed the bottle version was MUCH better. Still would HIGHLY recommend enjoying this one if you ever find it but didn't find it to be one of my top beers produced by Cantillon. 1,403 charactersDCon, Mar 15, 2012

This pours a hazy orange color with a huge 3 finger head from the tap. Had to let it settle before taking first drink. Aromas are pretty strong with plenty of funk and fruits. Amazing smells. Taste is lots of funk with subtle but delicious hints of apricot. Nice acidity in the after taste. Somewhat sour but fresh. Mouthfeel is thin bodied and good carbonation from the tap. Overall this is truly amazing. So glad I got to try this. Will look to drink from a bottle in the future as I've heard its better from the bottle. 530 charactersabrand, Mar 14, 2012

Soft apricot with light sourness. Slightly funky.
Taste is similar. Apricot is soft and subtle, but there. Nicw light sourness up front. A bit funky throughout, blends well.

Bottled August 25th, 2011---fresh baby! I heard fresh is the best way to go with this beer. Pours a very hazy, straw yellow-orange color with a large white head. Very fizzy. Scent is just as funky as I was hoping it would be...quite funky. Sweet apricots in the aroma with some grass and funky cheese. Definitely some sharp cheese aromas. Lots of barnyard funk with a bit of stinky gym socks. Considering this is a fresh bottle, the aroma was much more funky than I was expecting...which is great! Taste is tart at first...not sour. Switches to sweet apricots, funky/strong cheese flavors with a ton of barnyard flavor. Then the apricots come back in, but more sour this time. Finishes even more sour than it started. Great finish to this beer...scratch that, THE BEST FINISH. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with some puckering notes and very highly carbonated...could use a little less carbonation. Drinkability is high as it could get. Overall, another AMAZING beer from Cantillon. Now that I've tried this gem, I will be seeking out more. 1,124 charactersDovaliHops, Mar 11, 2012

4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Well I am excited to try this as the other similar beer I’ve had with Apricot is the Cascade and I just love that beer.
Fluffy/ Sudsy head grows and stays for a very brief visit. A fairly light gold/straw color with a dull finish.
Aroma is fantastic. That simple Sweettart aroma up front with a sharp edge and then a subtle but obvious Apricot nose. I really love this aroma.
OK, now I type the opposite of what I have many times. Most often it is noted that the flavor is not as sour/tart as the aroma leads one to believe. Here it’s the exact opposite. There was certainly hints of sour/tart in the nose, but it was rounded. The initial punch of sour is more than this and more than expected. It gives way to a wonderful acidic/lactic draw of white wine notes and some green grape, Then the apricot hits late palate and provides a wonderful fruit complexity. It stays with you after the finish.
Delicate body, again sits like a wine in the glass and even as you drink it.
I can see why this is highly sought after. I am happy that I was able to secure one with the recent Cantillon distribution in MA. 1,112 charactersReagan1984, Mar 04, 2012

4.8/5  rDev +5.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This was… dare I say, a milestone in my beer education—and I owe thanks to the good people at Jester King for making it possible. 
I’m not even sure ‘hype’ is the right word to use when talking about cantillons, because they’re not lumped in with what I think of as other rarities, or those special bottle releases that people (myself included) are willing to line up for. Perhaps reverence? Respect? Certainly curiosity. I was aware that cantillons aren’t commonplace—I had never seen one before, let alone tried one—but when I got in line I had no idea that this was going to be the mystery keg they were tapping. Chalk that one up to being lucky, I guess, because once word spread the line grew exponentially. And I can totally understand why. 
This poured a slightly cloudy orange yellow in color, with a great apricot aroma and noticeable tartness, even from the aroma. Simply amazing. There’s a big effervescence to this that lets the flavors dance across the tongue. The apricot floral-fruitiness is subdued, but its present and tasty. It’s tart, with a lingering, dry finish and a touch of sweetness like a firework going off. Half a pour wasn’t enough but its more than many had. Can’t wait to have another! 1,244 characterselNopalero, Feb 28, 2012

Had on tap at Local Option during their Occupy the Local Option. Served in a mini-snifter.
A: Pours a hazy golden color with dreamsicle like hues intertwined. The head is bubbly, airy and bone white in color. It recedes to a thick collar and leaves some splotchy lace.
S: Musty, earthy and funky in nature. There is a light apricot tartness and some under ripe apple skin as well. 
T: Subtle apricot flesh with a funky, barnyard like flavor. There is a mild tartness that is coupled with an oak and vanilla like sweetness on the finish.
M: Creamy up front with a drying, tannic finish. Spritzy carbonaton and a light body makes for a nice drinking brew.
O: The flavors seemed slightly muted overall and it didn't wow me like I thought it would. It was still an above average lambic, but I expected more fruity flesh and a little more tartness. 861 charactersTreebs, Feb 20, 2012

Lots of ripe apricot with light funk in the nose. The perfume from the fruit is intoxicating when mixed with the sharp acidic peach, lemon and tart flavors, light metallic notes, and damp musty hay.
This is one of my favorite beers, by far the best in the Cantillon line for me. The balance of juicy fragrant fruit and expressive lambic in this beer is what other makers of fruited wild beers should strive to emulate. The best quality 620 charactersSoonami, Feb 12, 2012

750ml bottle, bottled Aug 25, 2011.
It's pouring a cloudy yellow orange with a firm 2 finger head of foam. The lacing left behind is very impressive.
It smells very yeasty, fruity, sourish, funky, a very incredible aroma. There's no way that the taste can live up to the smell. No way.
And then...the taste. Apricots bring a light sweet flavour almost immediately over taken but tart and bitter fruit sensations. I note a yeasty and light funkiness here too. I find the fruity bitterness a bit surprising but more than welcome and the tart notes are done near perfection. My oh my, this is so damn good and drinkable. 5%abv helps make it so.
I wondered what the French/Belgian word for apricot was and it turned out to be abricot. Not as "interesting" as like names for cherry, raspberry, or peach so I reckon Fou' Foune will do nicely. ;^)
With plenty of carbonation and a lightish body, the mouthfeel is just right. This really is a fine drinking experience. I'm glad I got a chance to try it!! 1,037 charactersBitterbill, Feb 12, 2012

Pours a hazed golden with nice white lacing and decent retention.
The nose is amazing... I could smell a goblet all night and never complain.. bright fruit and the expected Cantillon funk.. lactic and dry lemon and white wine barrel goodness... fantastic.
Flavor is lemony and tart... the apricots come out swinging mid palate and dry out immediately leaving a long funky fruity finish.. dirty brett and dank basement funk... antique books (yep, I've tasted the paper... you should too) the fruits are the main player at the end of the day.
Loving the spritzy carbonation with a still light/medium body... fruity lambic done right.... I believe the apricot pulp adds some body that makes it a touch heavier and enjoyable.
I can't... CAN NOT believe that I've passed on Fou Foune over the years.... I am a moron... that said, I am happy to have friends who are smarter than I am. Sam and Dave are good folks for sure.

Just like Iris, Fou Foune poured expertly off the handpump, I was greeted by half a glass of orangeish gold liquid with the top of the glass full of white foam. It settled out nicely with nice retention and minor stick.
Unlike last years Fou Foune cask serving at the same venue (and possibly the same vintage), this smelled way off. I got baby powder and old feet and a plastic scent. Hardly any apricot until the end of the glass. I know each vintage is different, but I did not warm up to this.
The taste brings it back. Not getting any of that old Cantillon scent, im pleased with the nice acidic sourness and apricot with some old musky barnyard thrown in. Some oak with warming and old cheese taste at the end. Last year, this stuff rocked, if this is the same vintage as that, it's fallen off, and that's just my opinion on this vintage, I know what this beer can be.
Feel is very light bodied and nicely carbed up. A nice amount of sourness hits the gullet, yet not extreme. While I really enjoyed this, I could not get another glass, I went with Iris instead. I really want to try a fresh bottle of fou foune and make a solid decision on it. 1,233 charactersBARFLYB, Feb 06, 2012

A- A very bright golden peachy color. A nice foamy white head, retains a ring around the edge for what seems like forever.
S- Pungent sour and funk, touches of lemon and apricot skins. Some vinegar and tannic scents, very strong.
T- The biting sourness hits almost instantly, very dry and fruity, lemon, peach, apricot. There is some vinegar sourness, just crazy funky.
M- A little bubbly at times, but pretty much perfect for the style. This is a total palate wrecker though, just so soury.
O- Overall, if you like sours this is one of the better Cantillons I've had. I found the fruit to be quite pronounced, and prevalent. A very dry and sour beer.

Appearance – Pours into a tulip with a radiant orange color. About a half finger of off white head is achieved that dissipates quickly leaving slight lacing.
Smell – Woohoo. Heavy barnyard funk, still plenty of apricot. Oak, lemon zest, wet hay. Very musty and funky.
Taste – An immediate puckering. Light acidity, earthy funk, plenty of apricot (though not as noticeable as when I had this fresh). Slight vanilla oak and more tartness.
Mouthfeel – Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, finishes dry.
Overall – Just a fantastic beer. I traded one of these away earlier this summer and am kicking myself for it now. One of the better Cantillon’s out there for sure. 767 charactersSpdKilz, Jan 31, 2012

Pours a hazy straw yellow with a thin white head that fads to a patchy lacing. The aroma is very delicate, notes of citrus, peach, pineapple, sour lactose and a hint of funk. The taste is similar to the aroma and just as delicate and complex. There is more citrus then I was expecting in the flavor, lemon being the prevailing flavor. It is only slightly sour, which allows for the other fruity flavors to breath. The body is medium light with a medium carbonation and it is exceptionally easy to drink. I didn't want my glass to end, but alas all good things must come to an end. 697 charactersjamescain, Jan 30, 2012

Bottled: 18 August 2011
Served in a wine glass
Slightly hazed, glowing golden yellow in appearance. A one-finger, bubbly, bright white crop of froth topped the liquid. Within seconds, the head faded to a clingy ring.
The nose was complex and quite interesting. Musty notes came through strong. Funky but not super tart with hints of lemon peel. Oaky and dry. Some Chardonnay wine-like notes appeared as well. A slight, malty sweetness balanced things out. As the beer warmed, the tartness intensified.
The taste was similar to the nose initially. Lots of basement mustiness and barnyard funk. Crisp and dry. Fruity and moderately tart with notes of lemon. Some wheaty tartness was apparent as well. The beer became much more sour as it opened up. Strong tart fruit notes came through on the back end. The finish was dry, oaky and surprisingly hoppy. Remarkably bitter for the style (I am certain that this was due to the freshness of the bottle). The hops came out even more as beer warmed.
The mouthfeel was lighter bodied with a zippy, spritzy, lively effervescenece. Crisp, clean and quite refreshing.
Fou' Foune is a notable fruit lambic but it is far from being one of my favorite Cantillon offerings. Without the knowledge that this beer was brewed with apricots, I never would have guessed that it was. Furthermore, the beer seemed to lack some overall complexity. Based on the scores that this receives, and on its price point, I was expecting more. 1,569 charactersDamian, Jan 29, 2012
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage poured into a gueuze like tumbler. Pretty standard looking lambic here. Golden straw color, a little orange hugh. Puffy white head that recedes with a fizz. Beautiful fruity apricot and stone fruit aroma, at first I didn't pick up on it, but as this warms it is there in spades. Also some lemon and light but present barnyard funk. Fruity, fruity flavor. Stone fruits lemon, a hit of lactic sourness and funk. Fou foune has a really clean apricot fruit finish that lingers. Fare carbonation with drying sourness. 
I really enjoy the unique fruitiness of this lambic, unlike any I've had so far. 607 characterspmlondrigan, Jan 28, 2012

A: Light colored, very fluffy white head (to make the glass seem more full. At $9 a pour there was no consistency to the glasses or the amount in them. I'm not bitter though.)
S: Reminded me a lot of Cantillon classic gueuze, didn't pick up much apricot at all.
T: Again, I would have guessed Classic gueuze if I didn't know better. Funky with a tiny bit of apricot at the very end. Was hoping for much more fruit flavor, maybe it was an older version of Fou' Foune.
M: Crisp, refreshing, tart, very drying and kept me wanting more.
O: It wasn't as good as what I was hoping for when I first heard apricot lambic, but still a pretty solid brew. Maybe its different out of the bottle. If i could find a bottle, I wouldn't pass it up. Cheers. 805 charactersantoines15, Jan 28, 2012
4.45/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Super happy we found 2 bottles of this @ D & L truck stop!!
Bottled in 2011
Appearance:
A hazy, rich looking light orange beer with a foamy, white head. Although the head fell flat, this beer didn't run low on carbonation. Tight bubble lacing and there's definitely some sediment at the bottom.
Smell:
A lightly sweet and sour apricot. I'm already liking the smell of this more than the old gueuze because it's more balanced and slightly more floral.
Taste:
Ok this is the best sour I've had to date. It's definitely heavy on the sour, but also balanced by the fruit/sweetness. There is tremendous character in each sip, very intense flavors that seem to touch on sweet, sour, salty, and funky. You basically just need to try this beer, it's incredible.
Mouthfeel:
Effervescent and dry/acidic. The aftertaste is a thick, sour and loaded with flavor. I greatly anticipate each sip and obviously salivate heavily for it...Incredibly refreshing. Completely cleanses 
Overall:
Whoa $23 for a bottle...definitely worth trying once. I have another bottle to let sit for a bit, but don't plan on opening it for awhile. Highly recommended, although some people may get an upset stomach after drinking.... 1,201 charactersThePorterSorter, Jan 28, 2012

A- Pours a light, well, apricot color. Produces a thin layer of fluffy white head.
S- Very tart, the usual yeast must with a nice layer of floral and absolutely huge apricot notes behind it, the apricot aroma is enormous and fresh and just amazing.
T- Hugely sour at first, it takes a while to get used to. At first all you get is citrus, it takes a while for the apricot to come out and develop. A nice complex fruit flavor combines with chalky yeast funk and a bit of wood. The flavor here is really great, the sourness is massive but the fruit flavor behind it is very subtle.
M- Medium-bodied, high carbonation, has a light crisp feel.
O- An incredible beer, I'm a big fan of Cantillon but this is probably one of my favorite beers from them. Very refreshing and tasty. 818 charactersWillCarrera, Jan 28, 2012

Drank from my Cantillon Geuze glass.
A - Pours a hazy scrumpy like colour with a White head that off course reduces quickly. Very inviting to look at.
S - Classic Cantillon sour tartness and horse blanket. Nicely balanced with sweet Apricots. Just enough not to take it away form the main event.
T - Apricot hits you straight away and leaves beautiful vapours of sweet fruit. The sour tartness comes in to balance out the Apricot, but the Apricot remians till the end. The finish is dry and the sourness perfect.
M - Light to medium body with medium carbonation.
O - The best Lambic that I have tried to date. The balance between fruit and sourness is a masterful display of brewing that leaves you just wanting a whole lot more. This beer deserves the hype. 782 characterseric5bellies, Jan 21, 2012

5.5oz poured into a small wine glass
A: Sublime. A gorgeous cloudy golden orange. Starts with a two-finger head that settles to a nice cap. One of the most inviting beers I've seen.
S: Funk! Barnyard, horse blanket...all those typical descriptors. 
T: Heavy brett but with more dimensions than I'm accustomed to. Moderate lactic sourness. Apricot provides just a touch of sweetness but this isn't an in-your-face fruit beer. It's more about the yeast, the tartness and the bugs.
M: Excellent. Plentiful carbonation combines with the sourness to give you the essential lambic experience.
O: I'm really glad I got to try this. I kept wanting to come back to it. Couldn't let it sit for very long between sips. If the bottled version is even better, then I'd love to get some. 818 charactersmjtiernan, Jan 18, 2012

Wow, this beer is beyond tart. If you're into sours and feel like someone is drilling into your jaw, this is the beer for you (in a pleasant way). Not much of a head, poured a golden-orange like color. Smells of barnyard funk, not much apricot on the nose. Then suddenly, upon the first sip, the tartness was crazy. From a vinegar like acidity, to a punch in the face with apricots (I am salivating as I am writing this review). Compared to the 2011 one which was more juice-like, this beer developed significantly throughout the years. Nice carbonation in the mouth, extremely drinkable. 
We were 3 heads on this bottle and no matter how tart it was, it was extremely drinkable. Easily now in my top 5 sours. 
I think it's at its peak. Fantastic. 817 charactersPlinyTheKid, Jan 18, 2012

Pours a hazy orange with a loose white head, not much lacing. The smell is tangy, then sweet, like wood sorrel and honey. The taste starts off with some sour notes, not too strong, with some round floral and fruity notes in the middle, with a dry finish. It's crisp and clean in the mouth, with lots of carbonation and a thin body. Glad to have had a chance to try this one. 405 charactersgory4d, Jan 13, 2012

Now I know why people are always looking for it. This beer pours a beautiful orangish color with a small white head. The head was the only part I was expecting more from. The smell is huge vibran apricots up front followed by a tart funky slightly barnyard smell. The flavor is again huge on ripe apricots with a nice sourness and funk in the finish. Not to acidic just right on the acidity. The mouthfeel is light and juicy with the apricot flavors well carved and overall an amazing lambic.

Pours a hazed peachy colored copper, topped with a ½ finger of fizzy bright-white head. This retains with a rich and foamy ring around the edges of the glass, slathering the sides with a heavy cascade of frothy lace that quickly slides down. The aroma is OMG! Juicy and ripe apricot character just jumps out of the glass. Some funk and light acidity adds a certain amount of airiness to the nose. Man that apricot flavor just dominates this though and that isn’t a bad thing at all! 
The taste is bright and fairly sour feeling, with a blast of sugars and fruit that then gives way to more of a intense tartness along the back. This is so accessible and smooth for what it is. The finish is dry and woody feeling before segueing into a final push of fruit and sugars and then completely drying out in the end. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a lively and crisp feel throughout. As this warms, a bit more chewiness emerges, which holds the bulk of that juicy apricot flavor in the body. Like most Cantillons, the body really helps pull this all together. 
I had heard a lot about this beer and it didn’t disappoint. I think that the fact that this was a fresh bottle really helped, or at least gave me what I was looking for out of this, as those vibrant apricot flavors just made this. This is an fantastic Lambic and one that I will be seeking out again in the future. 1,519 charactersKegatron, Jan 11, 2012

A: A cloudy light orange look, what a great color. Very consistent, the clouds don’t float around its extremely cloudy all over rather than in spots.
S: Sour and funky, like most cantillon lambics. It has that “Belgian” smell to it and I don’t really detect any fruit.
T: Sour all over, much more than anything else they make. Tastes somewhat like their gueuze but nothing special. Lots of carbonation in this one.
M: Sour with some apricot and peach notes on the end of the palate.
O: I’m really disappointed with this beer. I had really hoped this would be amazing as it’s impossible to find and everyone wants to try it. Really, it reminds me of their gueuze, just not as good. Certainly not bad and I’d try it again but I wouldn’t jump through the hoops that people do to try this (it’s just not worth it). B to B + range. 921 characterscodysjb, Jan 10, 2012

A- Golden orange hue body poured into Cantillon wine glass. Complete yeast haze throughout. Nice foamy white head with good size and retention. Patches of lace.
S- Great mix of Cantillon funky bugs and apricot flesh, more apricot here than flavor. Oak and lemon sours as well.
T- More going on overall, a huge fruit pit flavor here more than actual apricot flesh. Barnyard, lemon sours, big oak, some funk but not a ton, grass, peppercorn, some bread when sour subsides, acetic grape, apple. Complex and diverse flavor profile.
MF- Foamy light body with big carbonation. Obvious tart sour feel overall. Silky smooth, perfect for style.
A great Cantillon, love the aroma and apricot flavor mixed with that classic Cantillon bug funk, a true treat for a surprisingly low price. 896 characterscbutova, Jan 07, 2012

Served lightly chilled in an oversized wine glass. 
Bottled on: 18 August 2011 
I opened this this morning to celebrate my 23rd birthday. This is the third beer in my series of sours. Though sadly it looks like there will not be as many as I hoped as some of my boxes have been delayed. 
Fou Foune has been one of my top wants since I joined BA, I hope it lives up to my expectations. 
Appearance: Moderately cloudy golden-orange body topped by a large white head that lasts pretty well and leaves sparse lace. Subsequent pours yield a darker orange colour and much murkier body. This is a pretty good looking sour! 
Smell: Wow, yesterdays Lou Pepe Gueuze shocked me by having a hint of sweetness in the nose; Fou Foune takes this oddity (sweetness in a Cantillon) a little further with sweetness almost as prominent as the sour in the nose. 
Initially the nose is almost exclusively apricots; sweet fruity ones and tart under ripe ones in equal measure. Closer inspection yields some over-ripe, almost rotting peaches, both sweet (oranges) and tart (lemons) citrus and subtle funk. Throughout the bottle I also noted: Wet chalk, dusty sacks, wet hay, oak, a hint of yogurt and a light floral note.
This nose is amazing - one minute the tartness tingles your nose and the next there is a distinct candy sweetness. 
Taste: Delicious!
Similarly to the nose the flavour has a massive burst of apricots - tart ones this time with a lingering flavour of dried ones. Other notes include hay, old dusty books, oak, yogurt, musty basement and lemon. 
The tartness seems to grow throughout the bottle, becoming quite puckering. I adore tartness so this increase allowed me to bump the taste score up. 
Mouthfeel: Medium-light body with a medium-high level of crisp carbonation. Pretty much bang on for the style. 
Overall: Not quite the super sour bomb that I was expecting, but surprises are always good, especially when the result is an insanely delicious beer like Fou Foune! Highly recommended, one I will certainly buy every year from now on! 2,068 charactersThehuntmaster, Jan 05, 2012

A - Poured from a chilled bottle into my awaiting glass. Pours a hazy hay yellow with a pretty energetic head that snaps, crackles, and pops before settling down.
S - Fruity with a floral scent as well. Some yeast and bready backbone as well. Very appealing.
T - Some might ding this a bit for not being overly sour or missing a big bite, but I find this to be in one word perfect. The fruit is there with just the perfect amount of tartness to make this refreshing and crisp. Some light acid to tickle the tongue and missing the overly pucker power of other Cantillons. I would describe this as being the perfect sourish beer for people who don't like to be assaulted. The composition allows this to not be overly sweet or tart but to blend both in a fashion that will probably please everyone.
M - Very light, crisp, and refreshing. Bubbly and a perfect beverage for New Year's Eve, I was just 24 hours early.
O - For me, my favorite Cantillon beer that I have had (including Blabaer). I have a couple more bottles of this but can see myself making the plunge for more. 1,271 charactersBeerisheaven, Dec 31, 2011

3.7/5  rDev -18.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5From a 750 ml green bottle, corked and capped. Pours out a cloudy apricot hue, fittingly enough, with a finger of spongy off-white head that recedes very quickly.
Ripe apricot, dried apricot and some funk appear on the nose. Hints of dry leafy spicy hops.
Tart acidic sourness up front in the flavour, quick flash of dried apricot, finishing with mild earthy dry hops and a mouth puckering sharp acidity. Things dry out and clean up in the aftertaste except for a sticky acidity that clings to the roof of the palate. Apricot 
Mouthfeel is light, sticky acidic texture with moderate pin-prickly carbonation.
Rather mild for the usual Cantillon's that I'm used to, but still delivers that sharp acidic twang that is the signature of the style. Also a rare one where they recommend consuming it within a year of its production, rather than aging it as long as you can hold out. I feel lucky to have had the chance to sample this, though still not a huge fan. 960 charactersIronDjinn, Dec 28, 2011

T: Light acidity tickles the tongue at first then opens up into a complex layering of floral, cereal malt breadiness, barnyard funk, tartness, vanilla oakiness and massive apricot fruitiness

4.05/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Lukie @ IBS via Owen
Poured into Victory tulip. Head dies quickly but can be briefly reinvigorated with a swirl. Looks like Schweppes orange and mango.
Smells like apricot, mango, fermenting sweet and sour fruits. Little bit of funk. Rockmelon.
Taste is minerally, sour apricotty. Actually get the base fruit in this (unlike some other fruit lambics), presumably because it hasn't yet been dominated by the Brett.
Mouthfeel is like a spritzer or soft drink with sourness. Good carb, hiding the slightly-less-than-medium body and of course sourness. Very nice.
Extremely drinkable but seemingly lacks a bit of complexity at this young age. Will chuck the other in the cellar for as long as possible.
Also, something about the nose and taste seemed to evoke a Tripel slightly. 790 charactersdanieelol, Dec 26, 2011

Bottled: 25 August 2011
Thanks to digita7693 for this one at our recent Utrecht tasting! I’ve had this a couple of times previously, but finally decided to review this heavenly creation.
A: Hazy, golden apricot with tint of orange. 1.5 (white) fingernail head on medium pour. Looks pleasant!
S: Like barn…hay, funk, must, and just nice. Hints of apricot and more funk. Very inviting, so let's give it a GO!
T: Like it smells; just wonderful! Apricot, funk, sour, tart, sweet, and just beautiful. The acidicty balance here is perfect. Again, wonderful! I cannot say this enough.
M: Medium body with moderate carbonation. 
O: I absolutely love this beer! Having it on-tap at Brouwer’s during Seattle Beer Week in May was awesome, but in the bottle it holds up just the same. Lambic is growing on me, but this is done so perfectly it is hard to find anything bad about it. Crisp. Clean. Beautiful. Delicious. The list could go on... 994 charactersspdyfire83, Dec 19, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottled: August 18, 2011. Poured into a tulip glass. 
A - This body has a cloudy, almost syrupy appearance to it. The color is somewhere between gold and pale orange. There was a short lived white head that led to some tight edging. Swirling yields some lively carbonation and some lacing. Looks fantastic!
S - As soon as I popped the cork I could smell the apricots. Super intense apricot aroma. It smells more like the dried variety than fresh apricots, as it almost has some candy notes to it. The finish is fairly acidic with a touch of brett funk. You can tell this is going to be a sour beer.
T - More of that dried apricot sweetness. Just a massive fruit presence. The finish is sour and acidic. Not a lot of funk or brett flavors to speak of. A bit better than the aroma.
M - Very lively and spritzy. The carbonation is perfect, and the body has some weight to it which is great for these flavors.
O - This is the best fruit lambic I have ever had. It really captures the apricots, and I can't imagine aging this any longer as the fruit sweetness is perfect. However, its not as mind shattering as I thought it would be. Is it worth $28 and the hunt of landing a bottle? Probably not...but it is delicious and really well made. 1,240 charactersdavey101, Dec 18, 2011

A: Beer pours a hazy orange with a white head. Kinda looks like a DIPA.
S: Woo boy, this smells incredible! Fresh apricots mixed with lambic funk makes for an amazing aroma. Neither smell really overwhelms the other and they coexist perfectly.
T: Taste follows the smell almost exactly, it's a wonderful mix of fruit, funk and sour in the finish. It's not overwhelmingly anything, and the flavor as a whole doesn't overpower. It's actually a bit subtle, but delicious.
M: Light-medium bodied with moderate carbonation, though something about it makes my tongue tingle. 
O: I've had Fou' Foune a few different times (2010 bottle, on cask), but I think the 2011 is the best experience I've had with it yet. This is what a fruit lambic should be, where the fruit and lambic flavors really coexist almost perfectly and complement one another.
2012 vintage addendum: The 2012 isn't as fruit-forward as the 2011 was, but is a lot more sour. It still maintains the apricot flavor, but it's more mixed in with the other flavors than out front as it was with the 2011. 1,116 charactersstarrdogg, Dec 18, 2011

A-Pours a hazy Apricot hue which leaves a creamy two finger head that stays for a while and leaves some nice lacing.
S-Fresh Apricots straight away covered with horse rugs,barnyard funk and sweaty socks.
T-Wow what a balance of Apricots,barnyard funk,sour lollies,sherbet and of course finished with a bitter sweet dry dose of Apricots,very nice.
M-Light but fullfilling all in one and finishes bone dry.
O-I know i stated earlier maybe i might of cracked it too early but after this i think i did the right thing as the flavours just hit you and suprisingly i really dont like apricots off the tree but this drop even though the Apricots are there they just become a nice mix of the Lambic itself without being the forefront and now i understand the hype this brew deserves cheers drink if you can find. 1,055 charactersADZA, Dec 17, 2011

On the tongue it follows suit, sour apricots, dry, yeasty, in the middle thru the end Im reminded of an easy saison. Finishes with a dry champange feel. Although not very heady, lots of carb bubbles come thru in the mouth. No bite. Not overly sour, only slightly puckering. I am very excited to have tried this.

I don't like sours. Hence the avatar. 
 This one looked pretty good. Yellow, hazy with a nice two finger head.
smells pretty much like a saison. Bready, yeasty. Horse blanket?
Taste was fairly pleasant. Not too sour. Mind you I just done a blind quad tasting and a Darkness vertical. I could actually taste fruit like apricot and the bready yeasty flavors I love in saison...
Feels like a mouthfull. Not like a big B elgian pale ale but still pretty full. medium body with medium carbonation.

Poured a corked and capped 750ml into a Cantillon tumbler. This beer pours a ultra hazy Orange with a 2 inch cap that quickly disappears into just a thin line around the inside of the glass. Just a hint of soapy lacing lazily slides down the inside of the glass. The aroma is funk and apricot. Wet grass and damp earth. Grapefruit pith layer with apricots. Fantastic stuff. The flavor is spot on apricots. Underneath is lambic funk. Old closets with damp earth. Citrus pith with crab oranges. All wrapped up with fresh apricot. The mouthfeel is spot on. Fresh and crisp and finishes bone dry. Cantillon really knows how to make faNtastic beer. I truly wish I could buy this year round. 700 charactershwwty4, Dec 11, 2011

A - Pours a delicious slight peach colored yellow with some nice haze. Slight straw gold liquid. There is a nice 0.25 inch white head that is quite lively and fizzy. It recedes fairly quickly. (4.5)
S - Aroma is delicious. Pure apricot juice comes up quick to the nose with some delicious juicy sweetness and some nice yeast funky. A bit of spice is present as well as a clean woody back. Slight tart notes. (4.5)
T & M - Very refreshing and delicious lambic. Starts off with some nice apricot sweetness, slightly sugary then followed with some nice tartness that comes up quick and balances the sweetness. There is some slight salty notes as well. Slight vinegar but just slight. There is some nice slight yeast funk mixed in with the woody notes that lay in the background behind the delicious balance of apricot and sour notes. Motufheel is light and crisp. Refreshing and delicious. (4.0)(4.5)

The hazy orange brew poured into a tulip glass. A huge frothy white head forms but recedes right away and leaves a small ring of bubbles. 
Nose is of fresh apricot fruit, a slight funkiness and apricot candy.
Taste is very delicate, the fresh apricot is upfront, a nice blast of funk from the wild yeast and a light sourness. The finish is fairly dry.
This one was very different from the other Cantillon I have drank. This is very fruit forward and the fresh apricot is very apparent in the taste. Right now the funk and sour taste is there but not nearly what it's like in other Cantillon. I look forward to drinking and aging a number of these. 793 charactersalpineclimber, Dec 09, 2011

A top 100 for #1000 holy shit eh!!
A hazy golden orange with a nice two finger head that falls quickly after touching my hairy greasy lip, no lace looks like a lambic 
S fresh apricot with a little vinous white grape and some mild earthy, woody funk. I can't get over how fresh and strong the fruit smells I could smell this all day, not overly complex but just plain brilliant 
T fruits much more mellow compared to the nose and the funk comes out a little more. more earthy notes then I could smell with some grains 
M little bubbles are abundant and give it life as soon as it enters your mouth, a little pucker too it and it leaves a little behind to savor 
O smell alone could carry this one pretty far, loved the smell but only really liked all other aspects 
I just can't get over how good this beer smells, I'm only merely impressed by the other aspects, solid stuff for sure and I'm not mad I have a few more to drink but I'm scared the fruit will fade if I age it. I may have spent my kids Collage fund on this stuff but this works well for me because as far as I know I don't have any kids.

The label imagery is another Cantillon marketing win - a simple still art scene, twisted just enough to go well with the titter-worthy name. Maybe I need to encourage the random gods of my current mp3 list to play a certain recent Rammstein single, to tie this all together...
This beer pours a hazy, frosted glass medium golden yellow hue, with two fingers of thin foamy white head, which expires expeditiously, rendering a few random specks and minor streaks of lace around the glass. 
The aroma is duly pleasant - soft, sweet apricot/peach fruitiness, solid, even wheat grain, and a mild, weirdly enticing lactic funk. One is inclined to expect very much the same in the flavour, and that is indeed the case, save the tart, somewhat acidic opening ante offered as I glugged that first gulp. Once quickly acclimatized to this initial zing, notes of light wheatiness, subtle dry apricot, green apple, and an undulating current of earthy, almost woody, funk come through. 
The bubbles are present, and just finely prickly, the body a weak medium weight, a bit pithy from the fruit, and smooth enough, once the froth of the carbonation settles down a bit. It finishes with a fuzzy, slight focus on the funk - it really doesn't stand out too far from the lingering wheat and fruit backbone.
A lovely, enjoyable fruit lambic - all the expected talking points are there, and in admirable balance - no palate wreckage today, mon ami. Fruit, malt, funk, and brio, all in well-blended moderation. This bottle is certainly going down faster than any of its colleagues who have gone before. 1,637 charactersbiboergosum, Dec 03, 2011

T- great perfect acidity and soft oak flavor up front. The gorgeous funk blends in with notes of horseblanket, goat and earthy musty wet hay. A zesty lemon and mint sits inbetween the funk and fruit. On the finish you get dried apricots, juicy apricot fruit and a lingering earthy brett.

This beer pours a slightly cloudy dingy tangerine orange in color with a slight white head that turns into a lacing around the edges of the glass. The aromas are of fresh, lightly sweet, and tart, juicy, mouthwatering candied apricots witha slight acidic sour. It has to be one of the most impressive noses of any lambic. The flavor features tart and juicy fresh apricot, plenty of sharp citric acidity, light oaking, must, and light funk. It has great flavor and finishes light and dry, which makes it even more drinkable. Overall this is one of the finest lambics I've had to date. This is my third time trying it and I appreciated it most this time, at just over three months old. It was a treat! 791 charactersaasher, Dec 01, 2011

Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with some dark yellow around the edges. A thin cap of white head forms and quickly recedes leaving some haze behind...
Smells like a typical Cantillon fruit lambic...nose is full of semi-tart citrus fruits with a bit of sweetness coming from the apricots. However, like most Cantillons, funk dominates the nose, maybe even more so than their other fresh fruit lambics, with musty damp basement coming through strongly...
Taste starts with a quick apricot sweetness, that quickly turns tart and just as quickly finishes sweet with the apricots really shining through in the end. Kind of bizarre actually, how quickly the flavor changes and comes back. A strong, and I mean strong brett spice powers to the forefront in the middle of the drink and leaves a lingering funky spice throughout the finish. Of all the Cantillons I have ever had the pleasure to drink, this one has, by far, the most brett character yet, it actually starts to overpower any fruit flavors as I drink. Very light on the tart/sour flavors as well.
Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation, feel is highly typical of all fresh Cantillon fruit lambics. 
Overall this was a good beer but not any better than any other Cantillon fruit lambic, in fact, I prefer St. Lamvinus and Vigneronne to this beer. Good lambic and glad I go to try it, but not at all worth the effort/$$$ to pursue again... 1,608 charactershawks10, Nov 25, 2011

A: Pours a cloudy hazy golden apricot color with a thin and bubbly off-white head that had great retention and lasted the whole beer through. 
S: Super apricot in the nose. This beer is full of sweet and savory fruit. Smells very dry. 
T: Very tart, very dry candy like apricot sour patch kids all the way. This beer is sweet, fruity, dry and fresh at the same time. The finish is funky and musty, and the aftertaste is very dry. The sourness isn’t overwhelming. This is very drinkable. 
M: Drying mouthfeel, sweet clean medium-light body, with soft carbonation and a refreshing tartness. There is a bit of acidity to the beer, but I thought it was well integrated. 
O: One of the best out there. One of the best Cantillon’s, one of the best lambics. Everyone needs a bottle of this. 902 charactersscottfrie, Nov 23, 2011

A - pours a faint orange / apricot color (who would have guessed that) with a good looking head on it
S - nose is of lambic scents (citrus, some funk) and apricots. Again, no surprises in the nose, but it smells damn good.
T - Starts off with fresh, juicy apricots that dominate the front and middle of the palate. These fade to some funky citrus flavors. It is almost like taking a bit out of an apricot and washing it down with lambic. The fruit really balances out the sourness from the lambic and creates an awesome tasting sour.
M - bubbly carbonation with a medium body works perfectly for this one
D - What can I say? Awesome beer here. I haven't have a fruit lambic before that was so well balanced. The apricot gave it a nice, smooth sweetness and held the citric/acidic lambic part of the beer in check. Best Cantillon I have tried, and easily the best fruit lambic as well.
---
Cellar update: the 1 and a half year mark on this brings on a really nice balance between the acidity and the fruit flavors. That seems to be the sweet spot on this beer.

The smell of this brew is packed full of fresh juicy peach/apricot character that is quite reminiscent of grandma's jelly. It has almost a floral component augmenting the sweet side of the aroma. A stunning bouquet of sweet, juicy fresh fruit fills the nose. There is a mildly funky backing that comes out more as the brew warms with a little bit of oaked quality.
The taste is tart and fruity with funk and a mild woodsy character. Juicy apricots and peach flavoring reside throughout the mouth with a faint grainy backing. Even as the nose eluded, there is even a touch of floral character to the taste as well. Faintly herbal across te back with an earthy aftertaste of natural peaches/apricots and bacterial funk.
This is a light bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Very salivating and extremely satisfying across the board. There is no alcohol inclusion readily apparent despite the brew getting warmer than ideal during the session. I could absolutely kill this beer all day long. I would have no regrets choosing this as the only beer to drink for the rest of my life. A beautiful, perfect aroma is one of the best I have ever smelled in a beer. I strongly consider but hesitate giving this a perfect 5 rating... If a 4.99 rating were possible, that's what I'd give. I was lucky enough to have multiple draft pours of this beer 5 months ago so I knew what I was in for. Opening this bottle exceeded all expectations. 1,823 charactersstakem, Nov 15, 2011

A: Orange-yellow color with lots of carbonation bubbles floating around. Finger and a half of white head, lacing is almost non-existent, but spotted
S: Apricots punch you in the nose, but there is plenty of lambic smells to balance it out - wheat, hay, funk, and earthiness. 
T: Apricot lambic all the way. Nice and juicy fresh apricot, extreme sourness, wheat, funk, oak, and some yeast.
M: Light bodied, highly carbed, dry. 
D: Very high. It's quite sour, but there is so much more going on that you want to enjoy quite a bit of it.
O: Like much of what Cantillon produces, Fou Foune is a world class beer. I still prefer some of their others, especially when you factor in accessibility, but Fou Foune is a treat. Seek it out if you can. 805 characterscbeer88, Nov 14, 2011

Bottled 18 August 2011
A- Pours a hazy yellow orange with 1 finger of bright white head that dissipates fairly quickly. Good amount of carbonation streaming up from the bottom of the glass.
S- To say the least this beer smells absolutely amazing. Even from 5 feet away the first thing that hits you is sweet apricot notes with a slight bit of tart funk behind it. 
T- Lots and lots of apricot sweetness up front, tropical fruits, with a good amount of funk, brett, and oak. Can't say enough although the funky yeast characters come through a lot strong than the nose would suggest. Expected more fruitiness but still extremely balanced and easy to drink. 
M- Medium to light body with champagne like carbonation and a nice slight tart funky finish.

4.99/5  rDev +9.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5see original bottle review below:
this taste was at Hunger N Thirst on tap:
A beautiful golden peach color with slight cloudiness wth thin white head and fine bead with lace that sticks. The smell is intensely fruity with tart aroma incredible how much peach is in the smell. The feel is great -not too sour as it has a nice level of acidity yet balanced well by the peach sweetness with moderately high carbonation and semi-dry and sour finish.
 The flavor is almost better than I remember if that is possible - juicy tangy and tropical with a distinct woody quality from the lambic with a great acidity which brings you back for repeat tastes. The sour and sweet are intertwined with only a slight advantage to the slight vinous elements from wild fermentation. This is undoubtedly my all time favorite in this category and possibly beer in general I won't hesitate to keep seeking it out after many experiences have not let me down yet.
 A - 4.5 Smell 5 Taste 5 Feel 5 Overall 5
this is one of those beers like Blåbær that I was anticipating trying some day, but when the opportunity actually presented itself I was extremely happy thanks stakem-enjoyed from a Cantillon tulip poured from a 750ml. My 1000th bottle review
The color of golden apricot with a translucent clarity and thin band of tightly compressed beads with slight lace pattern and very fine bubbles that rise slowly. The smell of floral esters and sweet fruit with a mild acidic yeast scent with the wild yeast giving off a lot of funkiness too, the apricot is mild in the nose but provides a slight fruity tangy aroma which is inviting. The mild tangy and dry combo is extremely pleasant with a fruity juiciness and moderately high carbonation provides a semi-dry overall feel with slightly puckering finish.
 Fou'Foune has a totally complex amount of flavor with the apricot taste mixing sweet fruit with a tart and mild floral quality while at the same time mild spice and a woody tinge is blended in with slight lactic acidity which never seems to outdo the fruit, just augments it with a seriously intense amount of tropical notes. The apricot skin sour flavor comes out with slight lemony lactic tinges and hints of bitter tannin at times. The woody toastiness works very well alongside the floral and mild sweet flavors from the fruit. with a jammy apricot flavor the sour and complex amount of sweet tangy fruit notes linger until the last sip. The yeast at the end seems to give a more oaky quality that wasn't as evident in the first pour but even that is seriously tasty in its own way. The expectations for this beer were met and completely exceeded. A less aggressive sour than some cantillon beers but it impressed me even more with its balance. I am totally won over by this beer and the drinkability is ultra high to me. 2,813 charactersSlatetank, Nov 13, 2011

Thanks for sharing this, dmsohyea!
Slightly hazy dull orange and apricot in color with a thin off-white head. This leaves dots of lacing down the glass.
This is one of the most wonderfully aromatic beers I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing. The aromas of fresh, juicy apricots, stinging sourness, and just a touch of funk combine for what is one of the finest smelling beers in the world. Just perfect.
The flavor is just as special as the aroma. The apricots are so vibrant and fresh it's stunning. The accompanying sourness is not at all overwhelming but completely complementary. The tangy yeast is mild but present. This stuff is perfect.
Medium mouthfeel with moderate to high carbonation.
This is my favorite Cantillon to date. I don't see how it gets better than this. Thanks again, Ian! 821 charactersehammond1, Nov 08, 2011

for sharing this one at his birthday tasting; thanks Matthew! Been a big Want of mine for a while but have never had it, finally getting the chance to. Poured into my Cigar City tulip.
a - Pours a murky medium orange color with one inch of white head and moderate carbonation evident. Apricot in color, which is pretty fitting.
s - Smells of fresh apricots, tropical fruits, sour fruits, brett and funk, light wood. Nose is a bit sweet and dominated by fresh sour apricots; I was pretty amazed how much they came through and how good it was. Wonderful sour nose if you like apricots.
t - Tastes of sweet and sour apricots, funk, oak, earthy notes, tart tropical fruits, sweet fruits, and brett. Again, very nice and sour, and a bit sweeter than the nose. Still outstanding, but a slightly step down from the nose.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation, dry and acidic finish. Very easy to drink; felt like I could take down a whole bottle by myself and would like to.
o - Overall I thought this was a fantastic beer and glad to see it has lived up to what I hoped it would be. The nose is pretty much perfect; I loved how much the apricots came through in it. Something I will certainly try and get more bottles of, and would be itnerested to see how it ages because I thought it was pretty perfect fresh. If you like apricots, this is our outstanding sour. 1,413 charactersmdfb79, Nov 07, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: apricot, a little cloudy, bubbly half-inch head 
S: strawberry-banana yogurt, orange zest and creamsicle, peachy, peach sherbert or peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream 
T: tart not-quite-ripe-but-fresh apricot, strong apricot, like apricot jam, but also unripe peach. Sour, but without the vinegar you sometimes get with sours. The sourness is like plain Greek yogurt, vanilla ice cream on the finish.
M: light- to medium-bodied, twinge of carbonation keeps it sharp and crisp.
O: really tasty, had this on cask at Moeder Lambic a couple of months ago and it was one of the best I've ever had--tasted exactly like strawberry-banana yogurt. In the bottle it was a little more sour and a little sharper, but the flavors were the same. Smell was really exceptional. 770 charactersnickhiller, Nov 02, 2011
4.9/5  rDev +7.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5750ml bottle from the 2011 vintage. Fresh bottle with the organic flower on it. Euro version. Opened this one up with vacax and jerz. Thanks for the tasting, again.
A - Light orange with one finger head and perfect retention. There were bubbles on the bottom of the glass. Slightly cloudy with a bit of chill haze.
S - Nose is all apricot and bacterial sourness. A touch of table sugar. Not very cheesy or funky. Really nice.
T - Taste is quite sour and very fruit forward. It's interesting how such a perfect balance could be attained. For one of the most sour beers I've had, this has tons of apricot flavor. Sourness and sweetness are perfectly in harmony. Acidity is quite high, but it's dangerously drinkable.
M - Mouthfeel is a touch thin but not watery. Carbonation is moderate and good for the style.
O - Glad I was able to procure so many bottles of this online. It's amazing and I don't think I will be trading any of these away. 944 charactersdmsohyea, Oct 31, 2011

The taste is apricot, apricot, apricot, and a slight lemony sourness. No toot tart, well blanced, It so easy to drink, so refreshing, so well done.

4.58/5  rDev +0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750 mL bottle poured into a goblet. Bottle dated August 19, 2011.
Appearance - Hazy, murky orange body with an ample, pillowy head. Continuous froth as I drink it. Couldn't look better for a lambic. It even looks the color of an apricot.
Smell - Beautiful, subtle apricot aroma. Slight acidity in the aroma. Not much funk, which is disappointing, but it's probably what allows the apricot aroma to be so perfect.
Taste - Slight apricot flavor immediately overtaken by lambic acidity. A bit of barnyard acidity and some hay and wheat flavors. The finish is slightly bitter, but it gives way to a nice apricot flavor in the finish. It's as if the apricot flavor is continuously there, but the lambic comes through and overwhelms it at certain points.
Mouthfeel - The lightest lambic I have had. Amazingly flavorful for so little body. It really allows the apricot to shine. Perfect carbonation, of course.
Overall - Cantillon really does a terrific job with fruit lambics. They're more acidic than funky, which allows the fruit to shine. In this case, the fruit flavor is perfect and manages to showcase without being a fruit bomb. 1,134 charactersAlieniloquium, Oct 28, 2011

S: Serious sweet apricot aroma with a slight tartness in the back that suggests strawberries and raspberries.
T: Initial fruity sweetness lingers for a few moments before a nice mild herbal bitterness asserts itself in the middle. The lactic acid blends beautifully with the apricots. The fruit comes back at the end with a bit of a tartness.
M: Bubbly, yet smooth. Very flavorful but not too assertive in body. Just a touch dry.
O: Definitely my favorite fruit lambic, though overall I still prefer Iris. The apricots here are really quite sublime, and the entire beer is amazingly delicate yet rich in flavor. 688 charactersBMoldy, Oct 15, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours out a bright apricot orange looking pour with a thin white head, that for a lambic, actually stuck around for a little while. 
Smell is right on, massively tart and sour with plenty of apricot all over it. Stays away from funk/horse blanket/sweaty socks and just drills you with fruit and sour that is so clean. Taste remains like the nose, awesome, clean, and powerful. How something so sour can retain so much of a fruit presence at the same time, well, that's why it got a 5.
Its just simply phenomenal stuff, never does the sour and fruit dissipate or become 'normalized' with your taste buds. Top notch.

Appearance: Pours a slightly cloudy golden straw color with a layer of white head that leaves a ring around the glass.
Smell: Sour apricot and peach. Very fruity and refreshing. One of the best smelling beers I have ever run into.
Taste: Unbelievably, it lives up to the smell. Not quite as fruity, but I could still pick up some peach and apricot notes. Tart and lemony with a slightly bitter finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with tingly carbonation and a very dry finish.
Overall: Just amazing. So refreshing, I was really bummed I couldn't just buy a whole glass. Loved the fruit and the level of sourness. I will definitely try to find this again one day. 755 charactersoline73, Oct 05, 2011
4.51/5  rDev -0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from the bottle at the Bottle Funk event at TND. 
cloudy golden color with almost no head from the pour. Lacing on the walls of the glass appear to have sediment reminiscent of fruit pulp. smell is almost entirely of apricot with very little funk to remark on. Taste also has a ton of apricot, along with some sourness. Taste also has a bit of a woody taste as well. It's fantastic as the apricot is so obvious. One thing to love about cantillon's fruit lambics, the essence of the fruit is not lost with all the wild critters fermenting it and this one is no exception. This may be my favorite Cantillon. 613 charactersBlanco, Oct 03, 2011

4oz. sample poured into a snifter.
Appearance: Hazy, straw yellow body with a loose, fizzy, white crown. Nice retention.
Smell: Squashed, overripe, apricots. Nothing else. This is the most pure apricot smell I've encountered since my childhood, when we'd have cardboard boxes of apricots sitting on our back porch in Fresno. Transcendental!
Taste: Apricots and lemon juice are the only two flavors that really come to mind. Sweetness appears at the onset of each sip, but heavy-handed tartness and acidity quickly take over afterward. If you're a sour lover, this one's for you!
Mouthfeel: Very tart and acidic, so much so that it's tough to pick apart the rest of this beer's attributes. Moderate-to-high carbonation, I think, with a light body.
Overall: Epic. Certainly one of the best sours/lambics I've ever had, and one of the best smelling beers I've ever encountered as well. This beer deserves it's reputation. Track it down! 1,085 charactersThreeWiseMen, Sep 30, 2011

A: This one pours a pale straw (ever so slightly hazy) color, and is topped with a thin bone white head. Head is not much to speak of nor is the lacing.
S: Stone fruit (Apricot for sure), Meyer lemon, and a subtle grassy note.
T: Very acidic up front mellowing into in the middle with the most incredibly tight carbonation I have experienced to date. Tart apricot and white peach dominate, this is a joy to drink albeit not the most complex joy. 
M: Soda Fizz. This has a very lengthy finish and again I have to note that the carbonation is most impressive. I figure it would easily be fantastic 10 years from now. 648 charactersflannelman808, Sep 22, 2011

Pours cloudy yellow with very little head after the pour. Smells of pure funk - barnyard aromas, musty, yet inviting. A little bit of old moldy-like wood. Acetic vinegar aromas permeate throughout. Tastes sour but not overly puckering. Hints of apricot. Tastes vinegar-like and inviting: great tasting. If this is a prime lambic example, I'm hooked!!! 529 charactersjwhancher, Sep 17, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750 ml bottle enjoyed with dinner at the Hopleaf in Chicago. Kicking myself for forgetting to check bottle date, but according to the bar they haven't got any of this in a while so the bottle was a couple years old.
A: Beautiful cloudy, hazy golden hue. Not much head. Slight lacing.
S: I expected a more pronounced apricot smell. It was faintly present. But perhaps that's the beauty of this beer. The apricot was very nuanced. Typical awesome Cantillon funk smell present. Lemon rind, too.
T: I can understand some of the reviews complaining of too much of a lemony flavor. It is slightly lemony, but it wasn't off-putting to me. When tasting you could pick up more of the apricot. Funk and sour are definitely present. This beer has loads of that. Very appealing if you are into that sort of thing.
M: Crisp and refreshing. Bubbly and champagne-like. Paired wonderfully with the prawns I had.
O: Not much to say here that hasn't been said. This is obviously an excellent beer. Cantillon does amazing things and continues to impress me with every beer of theirs that I am fortunate enough to consume. I was very happy I had the opportunity to try this, and I would obviously drink it again. 1,197 characterscccarson, Sep 13, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52010 bottle purchased and split at Lord Hobo - a pretty delightful surprise. Served in a tulip.
It really does look a lot like carbonated orange juice. The body is a pale yellow-orange, lighter around the edges of the glass. Fairly murky. A very small white head fades pretty quickly, but leaves nice lacing around the glass. 
The smell is pretty close to flawless. There is more fruit in the nose of this beer than any other Cantillon I've tried. My first impression is of barnyard funk and tart sourness, but underneath there is a huge apricot presence. Freshly picked fruit, sweet and bright, only becomes more prominent as this warms. 
There's also a tremendous amount of apricot in the finish. There are a lot of vinous, tart, lactic funk notes in the taste, with a lingering sourness that almost burns the back of my throat. But, like the smell, the support base of all that funk is a wealth of apricots. The fruit is so vibrant, like no other sour beer I've ever had. Simultaneously refreshing and multilayered. 
The mouthfeel is spot-on, with a perfect level of champagne-like carbonation. I could have easily taken down a bottle myself.
Though I'm curious to try an older vintage, I couldn't imagine enjoying this beer without the fruitiness. A phenomenal expression of natural sweetness and a superb lambic. 1,322 charactersamphion1065, Sep 10, 2011

5.5 oz pour into a taster flute (had 3 of these)
Pours a nice murky yellow with fuzzy white fluff coating the edges of the glass and topping the body. 
Why don't more beers use truck loads of apricots in them? The smell is outstanding. Extremely fresh apricots laced with lemon rind and sprinkled with a delicate peppery spice. So simple, but done to perfection.
Taste follows with the same idea. Very well balanced between the juicy apricot and acidic lemons. 
Mouthfeel is nice a creamy. I wish it were a little more acidic, but can't knock it too much since I enjoyed it quite a bit and it makes it hard not to overlook any flaw.
Very glad I got to try this. My only problem is that my girlfriend absolutely loved it so now I have to find a bottle or two for a special occasion. Oh well, can't complain. 846 charactersDearthVader, Sep 07, 2011

A: Pours a cloudy yellow with a medium white head, nice spotty lace.
S: Apricot and lemon, with a lot of acid, true fruit smell.
T: The apricot is there, the fruit is true and lends complexity. The lactic acid is prevalent, but melds seemlessly with the apricot to make a stone fruit/lemon mix that is delicious.

O: Another fantastic lambic from Cantillon. Not a traditional fruit, but it certainly works. I have been wanting to try this for some time and it did not disappoint. Great beer. 623 charactersHalcyondays, Sep 06, 2011

2000-2010 (minus 2003, which was coincidentally the first bottle of foufoune i had back in the day)
tasted all of them blind, and i was able to correctly guess the vintage of four out of the ten
here's the play-by-play, with ratings out of 5 for each:
2000 - funkier than many, quite thin with patchy clouds - 4/5
2001 - muted compared to some, little thin but still nice and tart, good oak - 4.5/5
2002 - really vinegary acidity, dark cloudy with tart fruit, this was the whale-status year as far as rarity and ended up being many people's favorite - 4.5/5
2004 - creamy and fruity with a big full mouthfeel, clean, streamlined flavors throughout, best in show - 5/5
2005 - soda-y, less cloudy, with an acidic pop in the middle - 4/5
2006 - cleaner than many, tart and fruity, thrilling and just a hair behind the 04 as my favorite - 5/5
2007 - fruit pit/flesh pronounced, acid but then mellow finish - 4/5
2008 - kinda schizo-fruit flavors, acidic middle, good and unique in the crowd - 4.5/5
2009 - very acidic, tongue stripping, less assertive on the fruit and funk end - 4/5
2010 - this one was full-on peach sugary fruit with no acidity, funk, or oak, although that said it was fun to have a peach syrup palate cleanser in-between the ridiculosity of the other nine, this one i didn't feel right giving a numerical score
the cuvee of all these was a fuzzy, funky reflux-inducing treat, the dreg blend was like butter... so thankful for this once-in-a-lifetime experience, cheers to all the contributors 1,618 charactersBankhead, Sep 04, 2011
4.54/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Multiple pours from 2010 750ml bottles into a tasting glass at Ebenezer's Night of the Great Thirst.
A: Cloudy pale apricot-colored body (appropriately enough) under a persistent, fine white head. Nice.
S: Holy apricot! Richly juicy fruit, with great balance between sweetness and tartness. Citric acid backs things up with a lemony sting. Fan-freaking-tastic.
T: Sour apricot up front, followed by even sourer lemony acidity. The apricot persists all the way through, granting a delicate sweetness to the long finish. Lovely, but just not quite as astonishingly perfect as the aroma.
M: Frothy, soft, and delicate. Quite nice.
O: I've been wanting to try this one for a long time now, and it certainly did not disappoint. I love how vibrant the apricots were in this fresh bottle, and I can't really imagine wanting them to dissipate over time. Aged Cantillons are great and all, but none of them can possible smell like this. Do yourself a favor and try fresh Fou'Foune if you ever get a chance.
Cheers! 1,011 characterswoosterbill, Aug 26, 2011
4.32/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From a bottle at Ebenezer's, not sure of the vintage.
Hazy peach-skin orange with a 1-finger or so white head that retains well. Amazing smell, pure fresh apricot pulp with some funk there as well. Taste has nice apricot/peach, not over the top but definitely not subdued at all. Funk and oak are there but kinda take a backseat, some lemon, bread/yeast and white wine notes there too. Smooth mouthfeel, not crazy sour, one of the more drinkable and fruit-forward Cantillon's I've had so far.
I got a pretty small pour of this and it was gone pretty quickly. Glad to have tried this, I'd like to be able to sit down with a bottle sometime. 641 charactersChico1985, Aug 21, 2011

A- Pours a murky yellow straw color that is hard to see through, one finger white head that dissipates to a nice white layer on top, minimal lacing on the side.
S- The aroma is fantastic, this might be one of the best smelling beers I’ve ever had. Fresh Fresh Apricot upfront, slight peach aroma, nice funk and oak in the background.
T- The taste is sour apricot right away, slight lemon and peach flavors in the background, really sour, mouth puckering, some peppery spice notes, tart, slight oak flavor, this one is truly delicious. 
M- Medium mouth feel, well carbonated, coats the palate with an amazing sour apricot flavor, dry on the finish.
O- This was truly a privilege to drink. The best sour I’ve had to this day, pretty drinkable for how sour it was, I could not put it down, savored the last drop for as long as I could. I need to hunt down a bottle of this gem.
Had the 09 vintage a couple of days ago from the bottle and I was blown away. This beer is even better than I remembered it to be. The apricot is phenomonal. 1,123 charactersChriscrundwell12, Aug 16, 2011

Mouthfeel: Medium-thin body with medium carbonation 
Overall: I love sours and had many of them, but this one is like a geuze with pure lemon juice added, making it a bit unbalanced IMO. Just expected more of this one, although would never turn one down 545 charactersrvdoorn, Aug 14, 2011

Big bright and gorgeous fluorescent yellow beer sits in my glass with light fizzies floating on the top and no head. Aroma more subtle than I expected. Slight citrus notes and not as acidic as I imagined, more of a funky floral musk which tempered my expectations.
Initial sips were a tasty, sour, gueuze-like lambic that left me somewhat underwhelmed. As the glass warmed, the flavors began to pull through fast and furiously. Bracingly sour and acidic, pronounced barnyard funkiness and a shockingly big finish of apricot goodness that totally floored me for an '07 vintage.
Mouthfeel was extremely prickly from the carbonation and puckering from the extreme acidity. Dry finish.
Truly a world class beer that deserves it's standing among the elite lambics. Not worth mortgaging your house over, but undoubtedly something to seek out and try if you should ever get the opportunity. 960 charactersvictory4me, Aug 10, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52010 bottle, shared with my beautiful and wonderful girlfriend. I have had older bottles of this, but never one nearly so fresh as this. The brew pours a turbid orange hue and is capped with a nice, albeit short-lived, white cap of froth. Wow. It smells so strongly tart, fruity and funky. It tastes like a tart Gueuze macerated in copious amounts of the juicy and tart flesh of apricot and peach - first and foremost - but it also suggests hefty doses of nectarine, Alphonso mango, Mandarin orange supremes, papaya, and loquat. Very very tart. One of the most puckering beers I've had, sip after sip. Many standard nuances of a Cantillon brew (ex.: grassy, woody-tannic and/or bright lemon-y) are obfuscated by the brutal funkiness of this heavily fruit-laden Lambic. Strong acidity here, from the sharply tart malic-tartaric-citric acid notes (akin to sour candy), to the heavy malt vinegar nuance, and finally rounded out by the pungent overipe-rotten orchard fruit notes and a musky hay-straw-barn funk. Overall, this beer is a stunner. Relatively fresh, like this bottle is, the brew is as intensely fruity as any you're likely to encounter. Give it 5 years or so, such as the bottle urwithdave shared with me recently, and the brew is equally stunning, but radically different. The fruit is a ghostly nuance after 5 years, and all of the elements are expressed in a divinely sublime manner, as opposed to the shocking intensity of the fresh brew. 1,452 charactersktrillionaire, Aug 09, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I was fortunate enough to have the 2007 and 2008 poured side by side at monk's Cantillon event today. For me, the 08 was the highlight of the day, the 07 was extraordinary as well, but not as mind blowing as the 08. 
The beer was foaming up a bit, but this sour initially had a surprisingly creamy tight head. The 08 was a bit cloudy, while the 07 was very clear. Both approximately apricot (duh) colored. The aroma was amazing for the 08, and very good for the 07 as well. The 08 was more aromatic and fruity. You can reallly tell this is a big apricot beer. The 07 was more sour and less fruity. The highlight of the aroma was the funk rather than the fruit. 
The 08 tasted like a tart refreshing amazing apricot funky glass of heaven. The sourness was a bit more pronounced than the aroma suggested. 07 was big sour funk and the fruit was a bit more subdued. Both had a mild tannic oaky thing happening which was really nice.
It was a nice light and tangy beer, maybe a bit under carbonated, but that very well could have been because some of the taps were pouring foamy and to best serve everyone, they poured it into a pitcher and then poured the glasses. 
Overall this was an outstanding beer that I was fortunate enough to be able to try. While I have been venturing into sour beer, the 08 version of this beer is the best I have ever had and confirmed my love for wild yeast. Outstanding. 1,400 charactersAgold, Aug 09, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a caged and corked 750 mL bottle into a tasting glass. Special thanks to whoever brought this 2006 bottle to Alewatcher's birthday. From notes.
Appearance: This has a very elegant hazy golden yellow appearance in the glass. With its translucence it appears almost angelic, although I might just be thinking that because I am so excited to try it. A ring of white head rests in the edge of the glass, remaining mellow and not bothering to leave much lace.
Smell: This aroma is fantastic, just the perfect balance for a summer beer. A little bit sour, with just a hint of funk, there is a ton of apricot that screams refreshment.
Taste: The flavor is really a progression of apricot. Up front it starts sweet, like biting into a ripe apricot. It shifts to become more sour, gaining momentum from an acidity that starts in the periphery and eventually makes me pucker. On subsequent sips this sensation subsides and I distinguish some lactic sourness and a light mustiness at the end. 
Mouthfeel: The body to Fou' Foune is light to medium, with a good amount of carbonation that is mostly creamy but provides a bit of crispy pep as well. Overall in line with what I want from a beer of this nature. Very dry at this point. 
Overall: It is a cruel joke that this beer is so hard to come by in the United States. I am beginning to wonder if I should move to Belgium just to be able to drink Cantillon all the time. Seriously. 1,437 charactersKickInTheChalice, Aug 09, 2011

A - Pours murky light orange with a big two finger tall white head leaving spotty lacing down the glass.
S - Smells of lots of sourness, sharp apricot and even some peach, light funk, and some dry oak tannins. I would have preferred just a bit more fruit but it isn't a huge deal really.
T - Starts off with a big dose of tart sourness slowly giving way to a mix of ripe apricot, damp must, and some dry oak tannins. The sourness is strong but once it dies down a bit you can detect the great fruit core of this beer. The finish is a mix of sourness and light dryness, lingering for some time.
M - Medium-Light body and flavor with moderate carbonation. It is very tart and dry in the feel lingering long after the finish. While the sourness is strong it straddles the line of being overpowering very well.
O - Easily one of the best sours out there. The sourness is strong but if you can get by it you are in for a treat. The fruit is a perfect complement to all that funky goodness. I can't wait to have this on-tap in a few days. 1,170 charactersorangesol, Aug 04, 2011

A-Hazy, turbid, orange highlighted milky copper with a medium bright white head that slowly faded to a wisp of retention.
S-Mildly sharp apricot aroma with accents of oak and a light touch of mustiness. Certainly a pleasant aroma but nothing crazy.
T-Well, where the aroma is a bit reserved the apricot sourness hits you hard on the palate! Massive, sharp fruit punch in the face. But, much like the way wasabi heat it powerful but quick and fleeting, the tartness here is similar with a huge way that disperses quickly, not that this is a bad thing. Accenting notes of oak dryness, damp basement mustiness and a touch of lemon zest zing.
M-Medium-light bodied with an impressively zippy mouthfeel. Tartness is present initially with long lingering, astringent apricot skin fruit notes.
D-Without question one of the finest fruit sours I have had the opportunity to enjoy. I honestly can find nothing "wrong" with this beer. If this could be my summertime lawn mower beer it would! A refreshingly tasty, tart, flavourful and satisfying brew! 1,089 charactersDeuane, Jul 26, 2011

T - Delicious ripe apricots, peaches, tart green apples, lemon rind, and a lingering funk. Very bright but well balanced.
M - light body and carbonation glides over the tongue and finishes crisp and dry.
The first time I had this beer it was 6 years old and it was a sour bomb. The fruit was barely kicking, but it was still enjoyable. I would have to say I prefer the fresh bottles for the great balance of sweet and sour. My favorite fruit lambic to date. 646 charactersxpimptastikx, Jul 25, 2011

Pours a very bright, golden blonde body with a tiny-bubbled tuft of white head. Good carbonation. Absolutely fantastic aroma: delicate apricot floods the nose, as if I were biting into the fruit itself. Hints of peach rind, wheat, and lemongrass in the background. Incredibly fragrant.
Flavor is delicious--tart and fruity with hints of peach sourness hitting the sides of the tongue. Very bright and fresh, and the tartness doesn't overpower the palate. The apricot gets a bit lost after a few sips, but that's to be expected. Excellently carbonated, the light body glazes the palate with ease. Just a well-crafted beer...Fou Foune is a Cantillon sour at it's finest. 756 characterswagenvolks, Jul 24, 2011

A: clear gold in color with a one finger white head that has nice retention and great lacing.

T: Wonderful balance in this beer. There’s a slight bit of sour apricot skins, some general funk, and bit of champagne.

Hazy light yellowish wheat appearance, like a wheat beer or light gueuze maybe. Or maybe the color of apricots but a little lighter. The lighting was poor when I poured this one so don't trust my comments here too much.
Smells wonderful. A blast of super sweet apricots. Sourness is barely detectable beneath the overpowering apricot aroma.
Taste does not follow from the nose exactly as this one is definitely very sour. The amazing apricot flavor is there as well. Very acidic but also sweet and extremely fruity. Maybe not quite as sour as its reputation would have you believe (the Lou Pepe Framboise we opened the same night was at least as sour if not more so, and the regular Cantillon Kriek is more sour than either to my taste) but still very sour and very, very delicious.
This beer is just insanely good, the fruit and sour flavors are both world class and coexist perfectly, you couldn't ask for more from a lambic.

Pours a bright yellow color that isn't unlike that of many wheat beers. There's plenty of yeasty haze to the beer, and the last 1/4 of the bottle is milky with yeast. Still, there's plenty of rocky, white head to go around. 
I expected this beer to be extremely complex, and it did not disappoint me. This is a young bottle of Fou' Foune, so the apricots are still quite strong in the aroma. Fleshy stonefruit and peach skin aromas are most noticeable, but the soft funk is right behind it. Some rotting hay and mildew signify the Brett component, and it plays well with the fruity apricot nature. As the beer warms, more interesting aromatics surface, rose petal and strawberry chief among them. 
The taste follows the nose. Lots of apricot/peach flavor, with some accompanying plasticky flavor that reminds me of the skin. Plenty of sharp acididty to this beer, though it is the least funky/Brett tasting beer from Cantillon that I've ever had. That neosporin-meets-wet ground flavor from the Brettanomyces presents itself as soft and well-rounded. I love how much unadulterated red fruits I'm picking up on in this beer. Strawberries for sure, and also some wild cherries. 
There's a nearly perfect amount of effervescence to this beer. The active carbonation really assists with the acidity. Overall, this is one of the best lambics I've ever had. I still can't believe that a KC beer bar got in at least a half-case of Fou' Foune. I consider myself very very lucky to have been able to try this beer. It's one of the rare instances in the beer world that lives up to every bit of its hype. This is a world-class beer. 1,720 charactersReaper16, Jul 05, 2011

A - this lambic was poured into a snifter glass that I drink pretty much every one of my classy beers from. The appearance of this beer was exquisite. It looked exactly like the inside of an apricot (maybe a tinge lighter than the real fruit). Not much head to speak of on this beer (1/8 of a finger of head). Some carbonation beads trailing up the sides of the beer. 
S - you can smell that cellar funk that is common with many Cantillon brews. Really the smell of this lambic was the only thing that didn't impress me. There was a faint apricot smell to the beer and some sweet notes as well. 
T - a very impressive taste to this beer. You can really taste the apricot in the beer. There is some sweetness in the beer, but nothing that is overpowering. Upfront, there is that cellar funk that comes from the wild yeast., but that quickly disappears. What you are left with is a strong apricot essence with an accompanying pleasing sweetness. 
M - there is some carbonation in this beer, but nothing that is overpowering. As you swish it around your mouth, it feels very smooth and not at all watery. You can really tell that they have packed a lot into this beer. 
O - what can I say? My introduction to Cantillon brews was a success. I use to think (in my younger days) that Lindemans was the essence of what a lambic should be. I realized later that beers should pull their greatness from natural ingredients and not added sugar. Cantillon really shows that natural ingredients can come together to make a beer that really puts the fruit it was aged with in the forefront. 1,605 charactersajcobb24, Jun 22, 2011

Poured into a tulip. This one pours a slightly hazy straw color with a thin layer of white foam that settles down pretty quickly. 
Smell is right up front sharp and sour. A really nice sour flavor with a subtle apricot flavor. It starts nice and tart with a little bit of sweetness to round it out. A little bit of acidic lemon. This is the most sour beer I've ever tasted. It comes right out of the gates with a nice tart apricot flavor that finishes a little bit sweet. A nice funky barnyard flavor with a bit of oak and some lemon zest.
The feel is good. Nice crisp and light body with soft carbonation. Overall this one is the real deal. It's easily quickly becoming one of my favorite sours. 826 charactersBendurgin, Jun 19, 2011

Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! 2010 Vintage! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a hazy golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, peaches, apricot, and sour. The flavor was of sweet malt, fruit, peaches, apricot, and a slight tart note. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this brew is nothing short of excellent. Everyone at the tasting (including myself) agreed that this was one of the Top 5 beers (out of 45) that we tasted during the night. The aroma was quite inviting and pleasant on the nose. The flavor was very complex and smooth at the same time making this one really easy to drink. This one even looked quite nice as well for a lambic. Really glad I have a bottle of this sitting in my cellar to see how it develops over time. Definitely get this on your palate if you have not before. It is definitely worth trading for without a doubt. 1,158 charactersthagr81us, Jun 16, 2011

Pours a hazed golden yellow color with a haze of white head. Retains well while drinking, leaves wispy film and patches of lacing.
Extremely fragrant nose, big time funk and tart but with a pleasant balance. Some wheat and biscuit malt, spritzy and fruity with apricot and pear. 
Decent sour blast right up front with some acid and fruit. Decent funk and yeast, balanced by some fruit sweetness and a noticeable amount of apricot. Lighter malt base with biscuit and tartness. Continuing sour notes with fruit, extremely balanced and pleasant while drinking. Finishes dry, tart, and lingers on the palate forever.

A: Hazy orange / golden body with a thin pure white foam ring around the glass. No lace is present but some carbonation bubbles can be seen clinging to the glass for a second or two, then releasing.
S: Apricots, tart strawberry candy notes, pucker mix, peach.
T: Immediate wash of tart, ripe fruits notably apricot and peach coat the palate. A slight grain note is in the back-end of the palate, finishing with more ripened fruits - pear - with almost a caramel twist. Very interesting and quite complex, absolutely delicious.
M: Light bodied, effervescent and crisp. Perfect for the style. I did have to knock some points off because this left an extremely dry and almost uncomfortable feel in my mouth.
It's was a true pleasure to finally sample the iconic Fou' Foune from Cantillon and it was worth the hefty price tag that came per ounce. One to sip and savor, in my opinion. 1,038 charactersShanePB, Jun 06, 2011

A: Bright clear golden color pouring a frothy white head which clears into a small ring around the glass. Some nice lacing as well. Beautiful.
S: Aroma starts with some interesting fruit aromas including: chardonnay grapes, apricot, bitter orange, and other various citrus fruits. There is also a nice leathery, earthy character produced form the Brett. This is not an aroma I would describe as 'Barnyard'. Relatively clean and more focused the fruity earthy characteristics. Not too much acid on the nose either. Extremely complex and outstanding! 
T: The fruity notes on the nose translate into the flavor as well. Although this is an apricot lambic, chardonnay is the strongest characteristic I get. The acid is much more pronounced in the flavor of the beer including strong tangerine notes. The finish is puckering and dry with light earth, leather, and oak flavors. Like no other lambic I have ever tried. More comparable to Russian River Temptation. 
M: Nice medium body with strong champagne carbonation with a nice prickly, puckering effect. Desirable tannic, drying qualities in the finish. The carbonation is surprising for a cask conditioned beer. That goes to showcase the super attentuative cantillon strains. 
O: Simply put, this is the best blended lambic I have ever had. This will be a tuff one to beat as well. This is also the most refreshing sour beer I have ever tasted. Bravo! 1,544 charactersmmercede, May 31, 2011

A: Pours a cloudy light orange color with thin white head, no lacing left around glass.
S: Really bright with ripe, tart apricots in the forefront, some funk, earthy and citrus notes are detectable beneath the powerful apricot aroma.
T: This is fantastic, really tart with lots of fruit from the apricots, sour with not much sweetness. Like the aroma there are some funky and earthy flavors that go along perfectly with the tart fruit. My favorite lambic I have had to date.
M: Very tart with moderate carbonation, finishes pretty dry.
O: I really love this, the apricot goes along perfectly with all the funky, earthy flavors and sourness of the lambic. Absolutely delicious and highly drinkable, another incredible creation from Cantillon. 806 charactersAzurescens, May 29, 2011

I'm getting peaches more than apricots, but the idea is there and well expressed. Stone fruits, shall we say? Unbelievable. I want this inside me. And so I do. The sour and funk are so complimentary to the fruit that it's hard to discern the flavors from one another. It marries so well as to make them indistinguishable nearly as separate flavors. Damn! This is a beautiful beer, an inspiration for these clearly darkening times.. 524 charactersdragonWhale, May 22, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Cask at Teresa's Next Door.
Pours a hazy golden straw color with subtle tints of pale orange and a frothy two finger soapy white head that slowly fades into a lasting ring. Spotty lacing.
Funky earthy aroma with a decent amount of horsey barnyard character, bret and other bugs, oak, hay and cobweb. Slight lactic presence with hints of light fruit, mostly apple, pear and of course apricot. Subtle acetic vinegar.
Medium bodied with an excellent tart, puckering flavor that isn't harsh, abrasive or acidic. Pretty funky while still remaining soft and delicate. Prominent light fruit with hints of apricot, apple and citrus. Lots of earthy oak complimenting the musty funkiness with a dry acetic finish that leaves me salivating for more. 
Overall, this beer was very good but the hand pump/cask serving seems t have curtailed the sour acetic character a bit. The result s a well balanced softer beer but I prefer the more tart funky bottle and regular tap version. 969 characterscorby112, May 22, 2011

A- comes to me with a small cap of bright white head that settles very quickly to leave just a thin ring and a few wisps on top. A hazy heavenly gates golden yellow in color and glowing wonderfully in front of the windows. 
S- hugely fruity and bracingly sour. Lots of funk but not an over powering oak. Lemon zest and juice. Bits of the barnyard but this nose is about the fruit. 
T- the one two punch of juicy apricots and bold sour funk is amazing. The fruits are fresh and lush with the apricots in the lead but there's so much more to it. I'm getting loads of tropical fruits as well, mangos and pineapple come to mind. Very tart and more oak then the nose leads on to, its wet and funky just the way I like it. Malts are light and biscuity and provide an excellent back bone and a touch of sweetness to round things out. 
M- less then medium in body and lightly carbed, ill say a bit more brightness to the carb then I was expecting and its wonderful. Huge pucker and this one get your juices moving in the right direction. 
O- I've been blown away by this beer every time I have it. Hands down the best brew I've ever had from cantillon and one of my favorite beers ever. I can't say enough about how amazing this brew is. Get some in your body any way possible. 1,416 charactersoglmcdgl, May 21, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5First BA rate. Picked up this gem while on vacation. The people at the bottle shop had no idea that they had this or what it was. 
750 ml green bottle. Bottled on August 11, 2010. Consumed March 16, 2011. A hazy golden beer with a nice fluffy head. The aroma was very nice, tart and sour with lots of lemons and some green apples. Very fruity(apricots) but not overpowering with some funk mingled in there. As it warms the oak starts to show itself. Wow I could smell this my whole life.
The taste again is tart especially on the lips withe the apricots showing themselves in the end. Very lemony while the oak shows up at the back of the taste and seems to want to add some dryness. This really makes me lick my lips which I like. 
All of these things that I speak of seem to work in harmony with each other and not overtake one another. Very light and delicate, and very refreshing and balanced. I would love to drink one on a hot summers day. I shared a glass with my brother whose beer of choice is Bud Light Lime and he loved it. Now he loves lambics and sours and because of this beer he went and bought a case of Cuvee Rene. Thanks Fou Foune cause you may have turned someone from the dark side. 1,205 charactersHopsSchnapps, May 18, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 375ml Japanese edition bottle shared with Weisguy & alampear for one of our small weekly tastings.
Served slightly chilled, a huge head appeared on a fast pour decanted into one glass to share between the three of us. Hard to tell how much sediment was left, but I would guess 1-2 ounces. Color was a light yellow with a gold hue up to the light with a couple tiny bits of sediment swimming around. Smell was sharp fruit and some vinegar. Described by Ari as "smelling a peach pit." Notes of peach and apricot skin were very evident. The taste was an intense combination of resiny sour apricot and fruity acidity, while much funk was almost nowhere to be found. Unnoticeable alcohol on the palate and finish, but a slight burn from the acidity was present. Mouthfeel was medium bodied and I'm sure it would have been a cinch for any of us to drink over a liter of this. I've had Fou'foune a few times (many courtesy of Weisguy), including a fresh 750 of the 2010 bottling, but this bottle stood out as nearly a whole nother beer than what I tasted before. Much more fruit on the nose and tongue, while the balanced acidity made for a very enjoyable lambic. 1,161 characterssarro, May 12, 2011

This was not my first time having this beer. But this bottle was exceptionally good. Poured a nice hazy golden orange. Unbeleiveable aromas of peaches and apricots, unlike any other fruit Cantillon I have had before. Great acidity, definitely a little Cantillon funk, but very mild. Just like the aromas, the flavor was spot on apricots and other stone fruits. Very enjoyable. 466 charactersalampear, May 09, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52010 bottling
A: Slightly hazy tangerine colored brew, bone white and wispy head. 
S: Sharp apricot both fresh and candied, some tropical fruit, Cantillon funk that is lies underneath the bright fruit. The funk is a larger part of the beer but I love this fresh apricot stacked on top.
T: Sour, lemony funk and light spice that is completely permeated by fresh apricot. The balance lies in favor of the fruit with lemony sourness on the other end of the see-saw. If I can divvy up the components, I'd say 65% fruit, 35% funky sour.
M: Light, bright and prickly carbonation, clean but not too dry. The fruit in this young lambic is still saliva-inducing. I always appreciate Cantillon's ability to keep a healthy amount of carbonation 15-20 min after you pour it without going flat like many American wild ales.
O: No disappointment here. I've been wanting to try this for a long while. Cantillon keeps supplying a consistent, clean and funky brew that leaves no doubt nor regrets. 985 charactersLazerlobe, May 07, 2011

Appearance -Pours a hazy yellow, orange with a large, white foamy head.
Smell- much like gueze with a little more sweetness
Taste - upfront a little sweet, a little vinegar with undertones of apricot. Changes to extremely sour on the backend.
Drinkability and overall - I can only drink one glass of any sour beer at a session and lambics not my favorite style. However, this beer is complex and mixes the sweetness of apricots and the sour of a lambic well. A world class beer. 502 charactersdwaz, May 07, 2011

The aroma is vinegary, slightly musty, and slightly medicinal with a very noticeable unripened apricot presence.
This is a light and refreshing beer that does a masterful job at balancing the flavors of unripened apricots with a medicinal and vinegary edge. Slight hints of clove, paprika, and marmalade. 
A light, thin body with fizzy and prickly carbonation make the mouth-feel of this beer definitely a good one for a hot summer day.
Notes- This is a good take on a lambic- one of the best fruit beers I’ve had. Despite the complexity of the apricot, sourness imparted by the wild yeast, and medicinal notes it’s all balanced very well. A respectable entry by Cantillon. I'd get it again in a heartbeat. 809 charactersOneBrewru, May 02, 2011

Hazy peach (I guess apricot would be more of an appropriate descriptor) and a white head.
Still an amazing fresh apricot smell. Musty brett and sugary toasted oak (possibly given off by the fruit).
Bracingly sour and tightens up your jaw. Finish of apricot jam. This is really a two part flavor of intensely sour unripe apricots and then bright and soft ripe apricots. Oh but how much flavor there is. Any kind of funkiness is sort of drowned out. 460 charactersBearsOnAcid, Apr 17, 2011

Appearance: Light, straw colored. Pours with a slight fizzy head. Very effervescent and light. Not much cloudiness on my pour at all. Most of the yeast was still settled at the bottom. 
Aroma: Lemons, fresh apricot, and a good bit of funk. Definitely can tell this is more on the sour side from the aroma. Really nice balance of the sour and funk notes with the fruit.
Taste: Tart lemon sourness hits first. Definitely tart, but not the most tart I have ever experienced. Big oak and apricot notes are there as well. Plenty of funk interweaving there as well. Extremely drinkable and tasty.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied with plenty of carbonation. Very effervescent and refreshing.
Overall, definitely up there among the best sours I have ever encountered. Wonderfully complex, fruity, and refreshing. Definitely will get this every opportunity I get. 954 charactersGosox8787, Apr 17, 2011

Thanks go out to him for bringing it right up to Philly for the tasting. The 15th beer overall. Poured into my tumbler, which is my go to for lambics and geuzes.
The body is a hazy light apricot-hued amber (go figure, I guess). The head is very creamy and resilient, especially for a lambic, as it bubbles to a half finger in depth and then lingers for 10-15 minutes without subsiding.
The aroma is typical for a young fruit lambic from Cantillon. Tons of fresh ripe apricots with a very muted sourness. Very sweet in the nose, and this translates to the palate, as well. There is an extremely clean and lemony sourness that works about as well as is possible with the fruit in the beer. This is like a tropical fruit basket. The sourness and sweetness play together, building and subsiding in harmony to maximize drinking pleasure.
The feel is light and spritzy; it is clean and refreshing. It is easy to see why this is a favorite, as it is so enjoyable in every aspect. Another example of Cantillon's incredible proficiency in fruit lambic production. 1,201 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Apr 17, 2011

A: Nice Straw color with deeper dark middle. Nice head thats fluffy. Pretty lambic!
S: Tons of fresh apricot, like sliced open apricot fruit with the pit as well. Some softer oak and vanilla notes with great barnyard funk and straw malt. Nice!
T: Amazing bright fruit and fresh apricots and tangy nutty apricot pit. A little bit of oak smooths out the fruit, but the tangy, tart sour fruit takes center stage. some grape and apple notes as well. Exquisite. 
M: Smooth front and tangy back. Good carbonation.
O: Well what else can you say? Another world class beer from Cantillon. 627 charactersDreadnaught33, Apr 16, 2011

Poured into a tall crystal tumbler glass (didn't get a Cantillon silk screened crystal glass for this one =( ), beer is a sunny and warm yellow orange with a finger of white foamy head. Head receded into a collar quickly, leaving light lacing on the edge of the glass. Large amount of carbonation seen through the slightly hazy beer. 
Nose is sweet stone fruit, apricots and peaches, sour lemon and sour apple, apricot skin astringency, earthy soil funk. 
Taste follows the nose, sour fruits and astringent fruit peels, then some sweet and juicy apricots and peaches. Lingering apricot sweetness, stone fruit pit, and earthy funk on the tongue. Very delicious.
Light bodied with soft carbonation. Draft may be a lot less carbonated then from bottle, so I'll have to track down a bottle for comparison. Refreshing, easy to drink lambic, with mild but present tartness, sweet fruits and earthy funk. Well made beer. 988 charactersnataku00, Mar 28, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52010 bottling. This has been a long time coming. My store got a delivery of this and Cuvee des Champions last week. The delivery was a whopping 2 bottles of each.
Pours a pale tangerine, a little sallow, with a 2 cm eggshell head.
This smells much less tart or funky than I expected. Maybe that will change over years. Mostly oak, apricot, and salty air. It's very restrained.
And, sour kick in the throat thank you very much! I don't know if I would pick out apricots if I didn't know they were there. It's a little fruity, but I taste much more oak and acidity. I would easily believe that this was a gueze and the fruity aspect was a yeast byproduct. There is also a seltzer water nuance that's kind of distracting. But it's still a Cantillon through and through, and it's delicious.
Excellent tingle, medium body, and just dry enough.
As much as I liked this, I can't justify spending the extra $10 to $12 over Gueze, Kriek, or Iris. It's really not better than them, and IMO, Iris is still the best one out there. 1,023 characters7ways, Mar 13, 2011

Wow is this funky. Dry and funky. Light and airy. Small sweetness and tartness.
Pale straw color with a murky appearance. 
Very nice sourness. Very string funk balances with a tart and sweet fruitiness. Mmmm. This beer drinks so nice. I would happily crack this regularly.
The color and body are both light and spectacular. I love this beer.
EDIT-- I just wanted to add more thoughts on this one and up my score a bit;
So in my opinion, the beer is WAAAY too fruit-forward in the first 18-20 months. 
In Jan 2012 we drank a 2005, that was one of the most sour beers I've ever had...
There's 3 things I look for in a fruit beer by Cantillon;
Fruit flavor
Sourness
Funk
Fou foune hits just about the perfect balance for me at about 2-4 years-- the fruit is present, but not overwhelming, and the age has allowed the sourness and funk levels to develop and increase. 
With pardonable exaggeration, I would say Fou Foune has all the characteristics of "the perfect beer." 1,040 charactersAleWatcher, Mar 05, 2011

A: Cloudy orange color. The pour dropped a big off white head the hung around and left tons of sticky lace.
A: Big apricot and sour notes. Lots of citrus, lemon, orange, and apricot. I get some floral, spicey notes as well.
T: Sour apricots all the way. This one is a puckerer. Not nearly as sour as the 05, but for my tastes, just right.
M: Light body, high carbonation. A little sharp, but on par for the style.
D and overall impression: Drinkability is pretty average. The sourness destroys the palate, so it makes having more than one a bit of a chore. Overall, a very good brew, not in my top 10 sours, but very solid. Skal. 773 charactersGtreid, Feb 23, 2011

Apple and cherry notes greet the nose, followed by a good amount of funk. When I say a good amount, I mean that it doesn't overwhelm the olfactory gland.
The taste is full of sourness, bursting with cherry essence. It's not a "fruity" lambic per se.
Not much to "feel" at the back of the throat. The funk is restrained, which may turn off true fans of the style.
This is truly a balanced and highly enjoyable lambic. It's also somewhat rare around these parts. 520 charactersBrad007, Feb 13, 2011

Pours with a huge, foamy, white head. The body is a cloudy, straw, yellowish-orange. Beautiful lacing coats the entire glass.
Cantillon funk, hay and light barnyard on the nose. Apricot, peach and clementine sourness fills the nostrils. Lots musty hay funk with a little more bitterness than what I remember from the bottled version.
Hay, apricots and some grassy bitterness on the finish. Again, slightly more bitter than the bottle. Tastes fresher overall. Apricot and peach sourness throughout. A great and balanced blend of funk and acidity.
The body has some good weight to it with lively carbonation and a delicious level of sourness. Feels somewhat slick. Quite good for a fruit lambic.
Drinkability is great like usual. Nice sourness with a good helping of fruit and funk. This on-tap version seemed to have some extra grassy bitterness to it, which I liked quite a bit. It helped to bring out some of the earthier and more floral aspects of the beer. Anyways, I hope I get to see this beer on-tap again some day. Excellent stuff. 1,089 characterssisuspeed, Feb 06, 2011

I waited until I had a better trained pallet and understanding of beer, so enough about me lets talk about this wonderful delight known as Fou Foune. I shared a 2010 with Shades Of Gray who so graciously opened my eyes to many Cantillons. First the look of this beer was very appetizing. Its an burnt orange-ish color and leaves a very nice head, full of lacing. Smell is very fruity, definitely strong apricot notes and some funk. Taste, WOW, I'm blown away. Very tart (as to be expected). Just a perfect mesh of carbonation, tart, apricot, and some what earthy in a very good way. The only bad thing I can say about this beer is it left me wanting more. Extremely quenching to the taste buds. . Again Big thanks to Shades Of Gray. 830 charactershenway, Feb 04, 2011
4.54/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750mL, bottled August 2010. No foil, though my label has some sort of red flower on the right side of the artwork, unlike the picture above.
Pours a hazy, peachy blonde with a small foamy head. Retains at a scant white layer, though it clings well to the glass.
The nose is something to behold. Very tart and vinous up-front, with a wild earthiness to it. At the very end there is a wonderful, aromatic apricot note.
Like every Cantillon, this is a puckering sour, though not as much as some of the brewery's other offerings. Lots of acidic, Vitamin-C tartness at first. Unlike some of the other fruit lambics from Cantillon, I can really taste the fruit here, and it's fantastic. Brightly fruity with wild strawberry, sour apple and, of course, juicy apricot. Bitter, rindy and funky fruit-skin notes throughout wear on the palate a bit, but it's still a refreshing brew. This is pretty much as smooth as Cantillon can be. The mouthfeel is light with soft and spritzy carbonation. 
About as drinkable as Cantillon gets, in my limited experience. For this, the aroma, fruit flavor and uniqueness of being an apricot Lambic, Fou' Foune receives very high marks.
Notes: This beer got better and more fruity as it warmed, so I would recommend drinking it at cellar temp., at least. Room temp. might be even more beneficial. 1,325 charactersdasenebler, Feb 02, 2011

A: Pours a 2.5 finger frothy white head that never really dissipates and gives me a creamy mustache every time I take a sip. Beer is a clear goldenrod with a slight shade of faded orange. Lacing is near non-existant with patches that cling here and there. 
S: Nose is mindblowingly funky. Hints of barnyard, straw, tart apricot, cobwebs, must. Tickles the nose throughout. 
T: Opens very tart, puckering lemon and citrus with overtones of Brett funk. Apricot sourness sneaks in at the middle and takes this one to another level. Funkiness intensifies tremendously at the back end and towards the finish as it dries the mouth. Moth balls, cobwebs, and bandaid right at the end just before a clean finish and a brief, fruity, apricot finish. 
M: Light to medium bodied and highly carbonated. Lively and prickly in the mouth at the start, dry towards the middle, and oily and slick at the end. Finish is clean with a non-lingering aftertaste. 
D: I've experienced one or two offerings in my time so far that have redefined what I thought beer could be and how incredible it could taste. There's no doubt in my mind that this is one of those offerings. It's a beer that I'm almost scared to finish for fear of not know when it'll grace my lips again. Worth all the accolades it receives. A once in a lifetime drink. 1,405 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 30, 2011

The aroma is lots of barn-yardiness, but with a lot of apricot fruitiness in there as well with some both clean and dirty laundry. The flavor smacks you in the face right away with apricot, fresh, delicious apricots. The beer is very very sour. It's also really dry with a dryness akin to say a brut. The fruitiness continues with some lemon rind earthy on sour notes. Dominantly this beer is packed with sourness and apricot flavor. The palate is fizzy but remarkably full and easy to drink. Just one damn fine beer. 626 charactersBieresDesMoines, Dec 20, 2010

A - Fou' Foune pours a medium gold with just a little haze. The eggshell head is average, coming to about a finger deep or maybe a little over. Lacing is on the minimal side. Carbonation appears to be fairly active. Not bad overall but I'd like to see a couple minor tweaks in this area.
S - It's kind of funky and tart up front. Hay and (what I assume is) pine really come through quick and hard followed by a healthy dose of old oak. Fruit is much lighter than expected. It mostly resembles peaches and oranges. More oak shows at the very end. One word sums it up nicely: pleasant..
T - Mouth puckeringly tart lemon flavor really takes over at first. Thankfully, it tames quickly. Old wood and barn flavors shine brightly midway. Fruit is more noticeable in the flavor than the aroma. Ahhh, there is the apricot. And it has notes of light berry too? Finishes with cured tobacco that works very nicely with the other woodsy flavors.
M - Lighter bodied with a medium carbonation going on. Finish is dry and tart just as I expected.
D - Drinkability is quite good for Fou' Foune. Even though I'm not an apricot fan, this is still a great brew. Apricot flavors are pretty mild overall which makes it work very well with my palate. The more it warms, the more it smooths out which adds another appealing dimension to this fine elixir. It encompasses all the great lambic qualities I've come to expect form the folks at Cantillon. 1,451 characterscsmiley, Dec 16, 2010

Full and round, vinous and white wine like. The fruit is great at this age, but a hard, slightly metallic age tells me this one would likely get better with some years on it. Very enjoyable, kinda like a slightly more acidic Duck Duck Gooze. 586 charactersJAXSON, Dec 04, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to csmiley for splitting the 750! I sadly traded mine away. You're the man, Chris!
Bottled in August, 2008.
Fou' Foune pours a yellowish-gold color. It's quite hazy, and has a distinct gold appearance when held to light. It's capped with a very modest white head. Carbonation looks active, but the head didn't quite rise to a finger in depth. Lacing was very, very light.
The nose is good. It kicks off with a very earthy, musky scent. It's rather prominent in the mix and lingers throughout. There's some light fruity notes. Smells mostly like lemon and peach or apricots. It's more of a secondary scent though. It certainly smells tart and a little vinegar-esque. Brett imparts a funky, barnyard scent. It's not very strong, but is effective. Oak really adds a lot of depth, and may just be the x-factor in this one. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. 
The flavor is impressive. I'm debating on the score. It is very musky and earthy throughout. It also features just the right amount of funk in the mix. The Brett presence is best described as moderate. That's my preferred approach. It complements, rather than overwhelms, the other flavors. It is quite tart and sour. It's not quite mouth puckering, but it's close. Definitely a little vinegar-y. The fruity peach/apricot flavors are there, but are somewhat subtle. Oak adds a ton of character and depth. Alcohol is buried. It finishes musky, funky, and sour. I'm convinced...the flavor's earned its score. 
Fou' Foune has a medium body that's incredibly svelte and smooth. Light carbonation definitely helps in that regard. It's definitely an authentic Belgian. No question. Drinkability is very high. This is a very tasty Lambic that goes down so smooth and easy. A 750 = no problem.
Cantillon makes incredible beer. While I don't believe this one will supplant St. Lamvinus as my favorite, it's not too far off. It's chock full of flavor, and is very deep and complex. It will challenge even the most sophisticated palate. If you happen to run across one of these, jump on the opportunity. It's worth at least one purchase...even with the steep price tag. 2,128 charactersprototypic, Nov 14, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I was blown away by this at Dstructo's recent mega sour tasting.
It poured like golden sun in my glass. 
Apricot was apparent in the aroma, but not to the extent I thought. If I hadn't known better, I probably could have mistook it for any number of other Cantillons. That orchard fruit sourness, you can just tell you're in for it. 
One of the best sours I have ever had. Intensely sour and dry, no doubt, but it didn't burn going down, it was not a difficult beer to drink. Plenty of apricot pith on the palate. 
Paired *exquisitely* well with triple-creme cheeses. Not only one of the best sours I've ever had, probably the best beer + cheese pairing I've ever had. 672 charactersPatrick999, Nov 13, 2010

Pours 1/4 finger of white head. Color is a hazy straw golden yellow. Kind of peach colored.
Aroma: Sweet apricots, funky barnyard flavors, straw. It is a bit muted. Some light acidic flavors and lemon citrus as well.
Taste: More sour notes here. Sharp lemons, apricots, horseblanket, funk, barnyard notes, and some acidity.
Mouthfeel: Sour and funky. Lighter bodied with a lower amount of carbonation. Ends clean.
Overall, a very drinkable sour beer. A bit weak of aroma, but what is there is nice. Fairly sweet. I could drink a lot of this one. 636 charactersmothman, Oct 22, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle. 2008 vintage. Pours a slightly hazed orange amber color with a slight white head that collars around the glass. The aroma is awesome with definite ntoes of apricot along with some acidity and funkiness. Light mouthfeel with some good carbonation. The taste is really nice with a balance of fruit notes (apricot, grapefruit) and sour acidity. This one does leaves you puckering a bit but not overly so. Overall, a really good beer and one I am glad I got to try. 469 characterskbutler1, Oct 18, 2010

This is an orange colored beer with a short lived, head, but like most sours, I wasn't expecting a whole lot of head. The nose is big and sour, really sour. There's a small trace of the apricot to liven things up. Like a lot of Cantillon's, this could become interesting. 
VERY puckering in the mouth. I get small hints of apricot and tons of acidity, enough to rip away the enamel on your teeth. As the beer dries, a cheese aftertaste is left with the puckering sourness. I was puckering a lot as I drank more and more of Fou' Foune, but I still liked it overall. 643 charactersDoubleJ, Oct 11, 2010

A - Golden colored beer with a pretty big white head. Some random lacing on the sides with a nice bit of stick for a lambic.
S - Exceptionaly tart, this is one of the more tart things I've ever smelled. Some lemon and a nice bit of of super sour apricots. The funk is appropriate, but complimentary.
T - Mouth puckeringly sour. The apricot is present, but it is so sour you have to really look for it. It is fantastic, but the ridiculous sournness makes it a sipper. Little bit of funk.
M - Medium bodied with some nice carbonation.
D - Love this, but it's not like you can session it without burning out your taste buds. Great stuff though, want to have it again. 792 charactersAgentZero, Oct 07, 2010

Big white foam head as the beer is poured and handed to me. It settled and got smaller until it entirely disappeared. The liquid was opaque and appeared glowing yellow in color.
The nose is not too sour, which surprised me. What did surprise were the aromas of dried apricots.
There is little sweetness to the flavor, but a lot of apricot. The finish is dry and sour. The coat is sweet and fruity but not oppressive. It is a very drinkable beer. Another fine Cantillon product. I wish I had more of it. 669 charactersToasterChef, Sep 13, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4750ml bottles of a 05 and a 09. I am reviewing them both, but I'm scoring the 05. A huge thanks to Don for hooking me up!!!
A- Both vintages pour a hazy pale yellow color. Both have a thin off white head with some spotty lacing.
A- The 05 is very sour smelling. Lemon and funk are present. The 09 is very less sour smelling. The apricot is detectable in the 09 but not even a hint is present in the 05. The 05 has a bit of vinegar in the nose.
T- As I was expecting, the 05 was extremely sour (one of the sourest I have ever had) with some barn yard funk and lemon. Very acidic and outright sour! Perfect for me. The more sour, the better. 
The 09 is much more tame. The apricot is noticeable here. Still tart, but not even a fraction as sour as the 05. Still a little funky but not nearly as funky as the 05.
M- Both were medium bodied. Nicely carbonated. Both had a tart finish, the 05 was just 10x as tart.
D- The sourness and acidity will limit the drinkability for sure. However, I had a full bottle between us and I didn't have any problems. My taste buds were completely destroyed afterwards, but man did I ever love these brews. The 05 was better due to the intense sourness, but the 09 was definitely much more fruity. 1,232 charactersurwithdave, Sep 12, 2010

Wow. To my mind this is the most sour of the Cantillon lambics I've had so far. Intense acetic sourness comes through along with tons of funk. The apricots are muted and come through as a citric tartness and back note. Overall, it's quite tasty.
Medium-light body with high carbonation.

750mL poured into Chimay chalice. 2008 vintage.
A- Pours a hazy golden straw. No head whatsoever and no lacing. Just a little bit of sediment sitting at the bottom of my glass.
S- A bunch of barnyard funk. Some nice sour grapes. A little bit of dustiness and some citrus and apricot. 
T- This beer is mouth puckering sour. Lots of barnyard funk. Big amounts of grapes and a little bit of lemon and apricot. Completely stellar brew.
M- Sour, very sour. Also very dry on the finish. Medium to thin bodied. This beer just is just so mouth puckering, I love it.
D- I don't know how much more than one glass I would want. It seems to be the perfect amount because of how sour it is. I can confidently say this is the most sour beer I have ever had. 786 charactersWisconsinality, Aug 24, 2010

Mouthfeel is light in body with a lively, refreshing carbonation and a semi-dry finish. Acidity lightly stimulates the salivary glands. This is delicious - extremely tasty and really quite refreshing This is one lambic I could drink all day. Probably my favorite Cantillon to date.

Yet another big thanks to alcstradamus for supplying out tasting with crazy-ass brews like this one!
A - Totally hazy golden yellow beer that has a low off-white head. Poor retention is acceptable for how acidic it is. No lace is left over at all.
S - Wow. Manure for the first time ever. Barnyard funk with an interesting acidity that gets stronger with a swirl. The apricot is moderate to low in the aroma and somewhat lost to me. I would really, really love to have more of the fruitiness pull through in this one, but then again, it could be the age.
T - Insanely sour, it has just taken over the top spot of most sour beer I've ever had. Pure sour dryness overwhelms the palate like super-sour Fundip powder. Mild apricot pokes through with a huge barnyard funk. Again, I wish there was more fruit.
M - Holy sour Batman! This is crazy, super tart and sour with a crisp carbonation bite. Very light apricot sweetness lingers through the sour finish.
D - A bit of rot-gut ensues from the acidity in this beer. Great brew but it's a sipper and definitely best split a few ways I'd say. Thanks again Adam! 1,195 charactersBeerFMAndy, Aug 21, 2010

Poured into my glass the beer is cloudy orange yellow gold. It looks like a cross between orange juice and apple cider. Minimal head with a small soapy lace ring.
The aroma is a fantastic mix of sour funky goodness and sweet peaches. Lots of barn yard aromas like hay, horse blanket, manure and old wet wood. The sweet side is filled with peach and lemon candy. 
The flavor is a full on nuclear 50 megaton blast of mouth and asshole puckering sour. It reminds me of cry babies. Those were some sour mo fo's. Just like the candy the sour fades into a sweet finish making this a perfect balance and oh so drinkable. 
Medium body with plenty of carbonation. Teeth crunching bone dry finish. 
Overall I want to find cases of this stuff so I can drink it constantly. Thanks Adam for giving me the chance to finally try this one. Now I want more. 984 charactersbeerwolf77, Aug 19, 2010

Re-reviewed; my initial score was too low. 
A: Pours a hazy straw body with short-lived off-white head. It leaves sticky suds everywhere as the cap vanishes. 
S: Tart apricot (took me a while to figure this out, as I thought it was peaches but wasn't quite sure). Some sourness. It's mildly funky, with horse blanket and leather aromas. 
T: Very vibrant apricot flavor. Lemon peel, grass, a hint of something musty. It's not particularly sour; it's tart, but the sourness is, well, balanced. Tannins (wood, apricot skins) in the finish. A dry, but not austere, finish. 
M: Light-bodied, with sharp carbonation. 
D: This beer grows on me more each time I have it. 706 charactersArbitrator, Aug 18, 2010

Hands down the finest lambic named after a woman's nether regions. Reeks of an apricot tree - bark and all. Tastes of stone fruit and fruit stones. The funk is a given.
But this one is not that puckering. Don't get me wrong - it's sour. But on a scale of one to five, one being mild empuckerment and five being total facial implosion, this is about a three. Time has stripped the fruit of its tartness and robbed the beer of its punch.
A little past its prime. 653 charactersalfrantzell, Aug 05, 2010

A: Fou' Foune is a hazy yellow color. There is 1/4 inch head that fades pretty rapidly, leaving no lace. 
S: The aroma is incredible, with scents of a farm, barnyard, apricots, straw. 
T: The beer tastes phenomenal. It's extremely tart. Extremely tart, I said. The flavor is bold and aggressive, with apricots and sour funk causing my cheeks to pucker in delight. 
M: Upon completion of my second glass, I was really feeling the finish. I felt akin to a boxer that got hit with a lot of body shots over the course of a bout. The acetic finish grows stronger with every ounce. I...can't...stop...
D: It's truly sad that this beer will no longer be brewed.
***
A: Hazy yellow, small head and no lace.
S: Straw, hay, the great outdoors, farms, apricots. Ah, Cantillon has the most incredible aromas...
T: Extremely sour, even for Cantillon. My mouth puckers in delight. A beautiful and natural taste of apricots and barnyard funk. 
M: Very tart with an acetic finish.
D: Delicious beer. Great for sharing a few ways.

A - Pours a very cloudy, hazy pale golden orange color reminiscent of fresh fruit juice (grapefruit maybe). Light fizzy cap that disappears almost instantly.
S - On first pour this had an overall fruitiness that was tough to indentify, but after warming a bit some grapefruit was noticeable and the apricot really started to come out along with some fresh orange aroma. Medium level tartness was easily noticeable, a hint of sugar that seemed to tame this a bit.
T - Fruity and quite tart up front. Was actually expecting this to be more tart than it was, but it wasn't as bracing as some other Cantillons I've had in the past...however, definitely not a knock. As with the aroma started fruity but difficult to idenity which fruits were present. A bit of warming and rousing the yeast in the bottle before the 2nd pour really helped this one open up. Lemons, grapefruit, oranges, and, of course - apricots. Apricot became more and more noticeable as the bottle went down. Somewhat mild yeastiness complemented things adding some mustyness to the flavors to funk it up a little bit.
M - Body is light, but not watery - just a bit on the thin side. Carbonation is ample and works well fizzing away in the mouth to propel the fruity and tart flavors all the way thru every sip.
D - Extremely drinkable sour. Definitely lives up to its reputation and doesn't disappoint. Tons of complexity here with new flavors being discovered throughout the bottle. Matches my experience with other Cantillons I've had. Very good cold/cool, but they turn into simply amazing with a little bit of warmth. Too hard to wait for them to warm up from the start for me (can't wait to dig in), but definitely worth it...although discovering new aspects as the temperature changes has something to say for it too. 1,917 charactersportia99, Jul 24, 2010

A: Light fizzy head covering fades quickly with a hazy, lots of color, golden wheat straw colored beer.
N: Nice sour fruit, tangy and tart, little citrus and zest, touch of sweetness, dry fruit, touch of yeast. Lots of fruit, plenty of the peach/apricot, and even a bit of a citrus zest.
T: Sour and tangy fruit, tons of apricot, almost like pure apricot juice, and that also brings some fruit flavors of peach, citrus, grapefruit, little creamy even. Pretty sour overall and tart, with a touch of lemon and mouthwatering tangerine apricot juice like flavors. Mostly dry. A light yeast, that seems to accentuate a touch as it warms. We stirred the yeast and the funk and yeast flavors came out a lot more, and it got a hint of barnyard.
M: Lighter body with good carbonation.
Overall awesome, great fruit, tartness, funk, an awesome wild/sour beer with tons of great fruit flavors. Wish I could drink tons of this if it wasn't so expensive and hard to get. 1,034 charactersjlindros, Jul 24, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5So this is it. My last fresh bottle of Fou'foune, one of my all time favorite beers. Bottled 13 August 2009, I am drinking this solo while eating an apricot.
The few months this beer has been sitting undisturbed have been kind to it. Pouring a light golden orange with a dense white head with excellent retention, this beer looks beautiful.
The nose is explosive. Bursting with ripe apricots, there's a tartness to the fruit character as well. The fruit does dominate the base lambic, quite a remarkable feat, given how sour this beer is. Unlike other vintages, this batch does have a more pronounced oak aroma, not really woody and it's more of a tannic character. All of this cuts through the fruit, making this truly exceptional on the nose.
The palate opens bracingly sour with a strong lemon peel sourness, way more aggressive than any other Cantillon beer I've had. I don't know how they do it. With a big, bright acidity, this opens the palate to the fruit flavors that come through with all the flavor of an apricot, rather unripened this time, with the great acidity and a big fruit character. The finish is surprisingly clean, with no real funk (this beer never really had much funk to start with) with a lot of lemony sourness and a great fruit character. The tannins do appear here, drying out the palate and contrasting the fruit very well. The palate is perfect. With a moderate to high carbonation level, this light bodied beer is perfect for this summer night. While my enamel is peeling just a hair, this is one of those very few beers where there's so much more going on behind the MASSIVE sourness. With a non-existent acetic character, this is perfect. And to give you an idea as to how fruity this is, my ripened apricot doesn't burst on the nose as much as this one does. Fabulous stuff.
**Review dated 13 Feb 2010**
I split a bottle of the 2006 vintage with joe1510 many moons ago. After it disappeared and I missed the 07 release, when the 08 came out (in 09), I made sure I grabbed a couple. I got to try it side-by-side with an 02 vintage (bottled 03) last night, thanks to Peter.
Both vintages pour a hazy light orange with a thin, choppy white head with decent retention. (4)
2009:
The nose is fucking epic. Fruity sour with fresh apricots, this is so goddamn fruity. Sour apricots with their nuance and unripened character, this is fantastic. The base beer is pretty sour too. As for the palate? Holy fucking fuck. Like biting into a raw apricot, this is fruity and sour. Quite sour and tart with a strong lactic sourness and plenty of lemony sourness, this is all about the apricots. Drying on the finish with more (surprise!) apricots, this is incredible. Light and airy on the palate with a crisp carbonation and a aggressive acidity, the fruitiness really helps tone down how much damage I feel this doing to me. Incredibly drinkable, this is awesome (4.5 x 4)
2003:
The nose is super sour, mildly plastic-like even. The fruit really has fallen off, or rather, the sourness has just completely ravaged it. The palate is similar, incredibly sour, probably the sourest thing I've had. Almost like pure lime juice with mild apricot flavor, this is bone dry on the finish that's acidic and tooth-raping in its lemon-like character. The sourness really does hinder the drinkability of this batch, though. Scores: 3.4,3.5,3.5,3.5
**Edit 26 March 2011**
This is the 2010 vintage that I got thanks to Robert. Thank you.
The nose is pure fucking apricots. Ridiculously fresh and fruity, the dried apricot character is excellent. Not as oaky and tannic as the 2009 vintage, this smells great fresh. Again, a great, clean, lemony sourness with a beautiful fruit character, this is a nice, fruity vintage. 3,734 charactersDefenCorps, Jul 01, 2010

We had a mini vertical with 2001, 2006, and 2009 bottles thanks to stowehop at our recent BA meet up, it was great to try these now that they won't be made again.
Pours a very cloudy and hazy light amber color, head is very small and pale white, not much for lacing as with most Cantillons. Visually all the vintages were about the same. The nost was very fruity and funky, the the '01 being distinctly more tart.
Wow taste on this is very tart and sour, it's crazy. Even though the sour is so mouth puckering its really tasty and quite drinkable, each sip just makes you want more and more of it. Super dry finish. The '09 had the most fruit flavor as you'd expect, and the '01 was the most sour beer I've ever had, it was crazy. No way you could drink a whole bottle yourself but amazing for a tasting. 872 characterskingcrowing, Jun 27, 2010

As I admitted to my bartender when I ordered it, I have no idea how to truly properly pronounce this beer's name, let alone attempt to define it. I was just excited to see such a touted lambic on draught in my neck o' the woods. It pours a hazy orange straw with a tall head of deeply longevitous (yeah, I said it...now, if only more people would use it...) white froth. As it died away, lingering on as the worst people tend to, it left some nebulous lacing behind. The smell wafting to me is of banana, peach, funk, flowers (pretty ones, I do believe), and a surprisingly healthy amount of vanilla. It's like brewer's potpourri. The taste doesn't bring this high esteem down any, either. Tart berries; sour peach, apple, and grape; a tiny bit of bitterness; and a slight hint of oak (or some kind o' wood, anyway) round out the puckering flavor profile. So this is a true Belgian lambic, eh? I'm impressed. The body is on the lightest end of the medium sub-spectrum, with a sharp, moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. I may not be able to guzzle this tart monster, but I sure as hell want to. Get some! 1,149 charactersTMoney2591, Jun 13, 2010

Not overpowering in either regard so its balanced giving some of what you look for in a fruit lambic...Holy moses, that's one sour beer. Didn't think it would be that tart from the aroma. Its got a huge tart bite sour, not a mucky horse blanker leather like a lot of Cantillon's. Here you get a lot more of the fruit not sweetness but the actual taste of apricots on the finish. Super balanced and flavorful...The feel is great, sticks to the mouth, very tannic...Drinkability is off the charts. It gives me everything I love about a lambic, sourness funk, but balanced enough that you can drink this all day, while at the same time not being such a fruit beer that's its super sweet or dominated by the apricot...Overall one of my favorite lambics, right up there with Blabear. 1,003 charactersjrallen34, Jun 12, 2010

First whiff reveals lots of barnyard funk, woody brett, sweaty horseblanket, urine. As it warms, a sweet tropical apricot comes out more and is quite prominent, so fresh, juicy and sweet. Mmmm.
While many of the Cantillons are acidic and bracingly tart, this one leans more to the fruity, funky side - which is aided by it's relative freshness. Light sweet apricot with a good dose of sweaty funk, a light woodiness, sour tarts. The sweetness actually balances out this beer, making it perhaps the most drinkable Cantillon I've had to date.
An absolute pleasure to drink and I am quite sad that this is being discontinued. A one time pleasure I guess... Thanks to Luk13 for the bottle in a trade. 955 charactersritzkiss, Jun 09, 2010

Pours hazy golden with hints of orange. Huge lingering fluffy white head. 
Aroma is of deep barnyard funk, then some peach and apricot as it warms, along with a little mango. Only slight hints of citrus. 
Flavor is nice sweetness and a delightful puckering sourness. As it warms, you pick up much more of the rich apricot flavor. 
Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and buttery, with great light carbonation. This is a sickeningly sessionable lambic that goes down way too easily. 506 charactersChrisPro, Jun 07, 2010

4.54/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4750 mL bottle, 2008 vintage, split with friends at Maxs.
Appearance is a cloudy, hazy pale straw gold with a thin fizzy white head that leaves minimal lacing. I'll be smelling this beer all night, long after I leave here. Extremely sharp, acidic and funky with mild apricot fruit sweetness and cheesy funk. It's hard to stop smelling this and actually taste it. Flavor starts initially apricot and oak sweet before becoming overwhelmed by acidic and vinegary sweetness which actually finds a way to become even sharper and more nasty funky in the finish. Not for the faint of heart or novice to the style, and maybe not the best bottle to represent this particular beer, but for a complex fruity and sour lambic this is near impeccable. 737 charactersyourefragile, May 22, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 3If anyone had ever wondered if Cantillon makes good sours, let me tell you right now that my mouth is salivating just thinking about Fou' Foune. This was one of the most palate destroying, mouth watering, sour grenades that I have had from Cantillon. Every sip was amazing. Bought at Toronado for $30. Thanks goes to James. 
The appearance is oily, like most Cantillons. With a very tall pour, this thing produces a crisp white two finger head that left pretty fast. I imagine the acids and alcohol in this one would kill just about everything. The color is a golden color with a slight shade of ruby. The legs on this were intense, leaving trails that could be seen from across the room. 
The smell is of juicy fruit, sour socks, musty teenage bedroom, stale barn, wheat grass, vinegar, peaches, apricot. 
Taste is an explosion of fruits, peaches and apricots, every range of tart and sour that your palate can comprehend. Acidic, vinegar, oily mouthfeel, fruity sweetness. I am reviewing this from notes and my mouth is salivating like one of Pavlovs dogs. 
The mouthfeel destroys. Anything and everything you can ever think of tasting is replaced by the juicy sourness that this body burns into your palate. The tart characters paired with the oily mouthfeel and perfect carbonation effects every part of your senses. It actually locked my jaw up a bit, the sourness got to be a bit much actually. This effected the drinkability a bit because my palate was fatigued after a while and it became a chore to keep torturing myself. 
What a beautiful beer. Nothing in America can come close to Cantillon.

4.22/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap served in the wine glass style Cantillon glass at the Trappist in Oakland. From notes 04/28/10.
This beer is a slightly hazy blonde pretty much identical in color to the gueuze produced by the same brewery. Only a minimal head forms, typical of Cantillon's beers.
Aroma is somewhat surprisingly musty on tap, for some reason I was thinking this wouldn't have the same complexity as a bottled Cantillon. There's a notable fruitiness which helps round out of the funkiness but not I'm not sure I'd be easily able to identify it as apricot if I didn't already know. 
Bracing, puckering, sour taste on the entry but this quickly gives way to the sweeter apricot notes to create a relatively clean and dry flavor profile. Although the fruitiness is still not intensely apricot it does remind me of the tart part of the fruit surrounding the stone. There's a fairly strong funky musty taste on the aftertaste. 
Drinkability is similar to most Cantillon beers. Goes down easy but the tartness keeps it a sipper. 
I'm glad I had a chance to try this since I can't seem to find it in bottles in my area. Since the apricots are so subtle, overall this is probably best described as a slightly sweeter version of their Classic Gueuze. 1,235 charactersberkey, May 02, 2010

A: The pour from a 2009 bottle is a hazy light golden yellow color with very minimal white foam on top.
S: An intense nose as always. Tons of lactic acidity, lemons, apricots, and green apples. The oak is a bit more pronounced than usual with a really nice wet hay and barnyard funk.
T: This is certainly one of the most acidic and sour Cantillon beers out there. A very sharp lemony tartness followed by some apricot, but not overly intense. Wonderful wet and musty funk and heavy oak components.
M: Light on the tongue but a powerful sourness that is tongue-buckling to say the least. A nice dry and tannic finish.
D: Easily one of my favorite beers (from Cantillon or otherwise). I could drink this stuff all day, and I'm glad to have another bottle. 861 characterswomencantsail, Apr 22, 2010

Vintage 2001. Finally decided to break this one open. Poured from a 750ml magnum bottle. Poured into my Lindeman's champaigne flute. Pours a wonderful pale hazy copper color(slow pour)...with a pretty substantial white frothy head that dissapates down to about a half finger and remains there for a VERY long time. Leaves thick/though quick sliding fizzy white lacing.
Aroma is wonderful! Not much apricot left...possibly just a light crisp fruit, major funkiness. SUPER tart!
Wow! The most tart beer I've ever had! I've had a lot of sours...krieks, gueuzes, lambics...etc. This definitely "takes the cake" for the biggest tart factor! Very impressed though overall with the flavor. Besides the rediculous amount of puckering tart, theres really no apricot noticeable anymore...not that it hurts the flavor one bit IMO. The HUGE funkiness comes in after a couple seconds and has a long lasting aftertaste. Leaves a sweet and enjoyable flavor on the lips for a few minutes as well. High carbonation, tart, lemon/citrus, light body. As the beer warms up, the funkiness really comes in even bigger! Wow, what an extrordinary...off the wall beer! 1,294 charactersShadesOfGray, Mar 31, 2010

Pours a cloudy orange-tinted straw topped by a nice bright white head.
Loads of mouthwatering funk on the nose, begging me to take a sip. Light citrus follows along, and temperamental fleshy ripe apricots--the apricot aroma seems to only come forth when I set the glass down, wait a few moments, and take a sniff without swirling. If I swirl the glass, there's no apricot to be found. Wet hay and barnyard aromas round out the nose.
Razor-blade-like cutting sour notes on the palate. Dry and prickly, and almost needle-like. Dusty hay, funky, fruity, and absolutely delightful. Try it if you ever have the chance. 670 characterswnh, Mar 29, 2010

Aroma is super sour, really tart. Smells awesome.
Slight sulfur, tastes kind of like flowers. I'm not picking up on the fruit so much. Its pretty sour. I think it smells better than it tastes. Overall drinkability is good and mouthfeel is good as well. 406 charactersdrabmuh, Mar 22, 2010

Christ what a great smelling beer. Sour and funky with oaky undertones tart fruits slight bit of citrus and obviously that aroma of apricot. 
Deliciously mouth puckering. Great sour middle and finish so fruity and delicious. Apricot really takes the lead with oak later on. Good acidity levels and perfect carbonation. Not nearly as thin as majority of sours out there and it really helps that out. But hell it is cantillon. Little heart burn kicking in from the acidity and funky undertones. Could drink this for hours on end. 748 charactersmcallister, Mar 02, 2010

S: Very, very sour with lots of apricot and white peach notes. A bit of funk and oak.
T: Loads of apricot with some very nice lactic sourness. A bit of funk, earth, and wood; mainly, though, this one is all about the sour apricot and I love it.
M: Fairly light bodied and incredibly dry and crisp. Very powerful acidity.

My fellow dude-bros everywhere would taunt me mercilessly if they heard I drank it. Well, I had to throw down the 30 smackers that K&L wanted for a 750ml of this one since I saw the Cantillon crew pitting the apricots for it when I visited the brewery back in July '09. Those 'cots looked pretty damn good.
Well, this beer pours golden-orange, not too far off the color of an actual apricot. A well-formed whitish head sits on top.
The aroma is excellent, although very sour. Apricots dominate, along with some oak and earthy funk.
Flavor is sour apricots through and through. Very good, but not quite as awesomely fruity and flavorful as I had hoped. A little funky and extremely tart with some barrel notes.
Medium-bodied with very high acidity and somewhat effervescent carbonation.
Overall I really like this beer, although it's not quite as impressive as some other Cantillon offerings. 940 charactersnickd717, Feb 08, 2010

S: wheat malts, fairly funky, but more on the sweaty gym socks end of the spectrum, apricot jam. Not the most impressive smelling Cantillon. 
T: the apricots are definitely there, and as others have noted more tart than it is overly sour. Great aftertaste of apricot jam. Lemon like tartness. Fairly light. A little bit of honey in there as well. Really lacks that strong funky intense profile that I would hope forInteresting.

Pours a sunny orange with a tight white head that leaves a few spots of lace as it drops to a film and then nothing. The aroma is rich in apricot, but still has strong evidence of that lambic base, and has nice notes of barrel.
Huge apricot flavour places a wonderfully fruity imprint on anything. This beer tastes like summer in the south of France, and is all the better for it. There's certainly that quintessential Cantillon sourness, but its moderated by a delicate sweetness and this seems the most balanced of the three brews we had tonight. There's also a light funk, but its far lighter than the Lou Pepes. In a way, this is a far simpler beer, but i think better for it, and its hard for me to fault the flavour. The same applies to the body, which alternates between light and slick, but never becomes any less than refreshing.
This may well me my favourite fruit lambic - it transports me to a different place and whispers softly in my ear. A treat that I need to get more of! 1,173 charactersbobsy, Feb 01, 2010

Taste: Great dichotomy between the sweet apricot on the bouquet and the biting acidity on the tongue, followed by apricot again on the finish. Has a nice, light, earthy horse blanket funk. There should be a rating for presentation. Very sour. Slightly chalky.

Pours with a finger of white head over a murky golden orange body. A quarter inch of foam sticks around begging to be swallowed away.
I can smell funk from 2 feet way. Sticking my nose closer, I actually get a bit more citrus fruit than I do tart funkiness (though it is definitely still there). Very appetizing, like apricot or peach flavored candy. Some light band aid and cobweb. Notes of white grapes, banana peel, and sunflowers. I can barely take my nose out of the glass.
Oh wow, the taste caught me off guard. Didn't catch too much acidity in the nose but the taste is another story. Puckering like someone just dumped sour powdered candy on my tongue. Rich, luscious fruit flavor underneath. Apricots, peaches, grapes, apples. After a few swallows the acid begins to become less surprising, and the deep funkiness underneath peeks through. I'm think I'm swallowing dirty gym socks. I feel like I just took a deep breath while changing my vacuum filter. But then that juicy citrus flavor comes rushing back with each sip temporarily wiping it all away...until it returns in the finish. My senses are stretched to their limits with the complexity of this wonderful liquid. As I swish it around my mouth before swallowing I am then greeted by the most pleasant, longest finish in my recent beer drinking memory.
Body is medium, perhaps medium/full for the style. Good levels of carbonation. Very dry, but enough citrus character sticks around to make for a long finish.
This glass is disappearing quickly, but the overall palate and sense destroying nature of it would make me want to limit my intake. Still, seriously drinkable for the style. 1,749 charactersalcstradamus, Jan 14, 2010

Appears a hazy, light gold with a orange tinge when held to the light. A small white head floats atop the glass before slowly fading away into a tiny cap and leaving streaks/spots all around the glass.
Smell is of obvious apricots, peaches, nectarines, vanilla, tart notes of vinegar and funky hints of horseblanket,and perhaps a hint of passion fruit/mango blend.
Taste is of the aromas with more of an acidic presence making itself known in the form of soured peaches and green apple.
Mouthfeel is light bodied, tart, making one salivate...but easy drinking and perhaps even refreshing if given the proper setting. 637 charactersweeare138, Jan 06, 2010

3.35/5  rDev -26.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 2 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Poured from the bottle into a tulip glass. This was an odd experience. This is the first Cantillon beer, and one of the first traditional lambics, that I have not completely enjoyed.
Pour is pretty - golden yellow color, quite hazy, with a medium white head that dissipates to a collar relatively quickly. Inviting.
The smell... goddamn, I haven't smelled anything quite so funky in my life. I love funky sours, but this is a bit off-putting. Stinky cheese is the first thing I notice, in abundance. So cheesy. Also, weirdly enough, I'm getting a fair bit of canned tuna as well. This is bizarre. Some apricot in the aroma as well. The normal Cantillon barnyard and musty smells are there, as are sweaty socks, but they are absolutely dominated by the cheese and tuna. I actually do not like this much. It improves (i.e., less tuna) as it sits out and warms a bit, so I will bump it up a half-point.
Taste is actually pretty good. Lush apricots in the beginning. As it warms up, peaches seem to be the fruit of interest. Quite sour, with the fruity sweetness evident only upon the first portion of the sip.
Mouthfeel is good, as usual with Cantillon beers. Good carbonation, drying finish. Maybe could be even a touch more carbonated.
Drinkability is only okay. I took a while with my portion, and I wouldn't reach for it again if I had other sour options. It does improve as it sits out and opens up. I wonder if this is an aberrant bottle... looking to others' reviews, it seems like the cheese is normal. But the tuna? I don't know. I will revise my scores here if I find that this bottle was off in some way.
Odd, and not altogether enjoyable beer. I would run back to the Rose de Gambrinus, St. Lamvinus, Iris, or Blabaer before hitting this one up again. 1,766 charactersdavod23, Dec 06, 2009

Pours a very hazy, cloudy light orange in color. There's a nice half inch of white head forming on the pour.
The smell is pungent. Almost to the point of being off-putting. Stanky gym socks, old cheese, and a little bit of earthy skunkyness. The smell is so strong, you begin to question whether or not you want to take a sip of this thing.
Taste is incredible. Very sour/tart. Lip puckering sourness. Very nice apricot and light fruit flavors. Absolutely wonderful.
After time, the smell starts to come around and become much more approachable.
Very puckering tart in the mouthfeel, with the perfect amount of carbonation. This beer is absolutely amazing. I couldn't help but to think how much this compares to Isabelle Proximus with each sip I took.

Poured from a bottle into a Portsmouth Tulip. The pour yields an effervescent straw body with a nice glow around the edges. The head is a bone white frothy two finger affair that bubbles for several minutes.
The smell is funky sour musty cheesy lemon zest with the slightest touch of sweet fruits. Once the beer warms the apricot scent is evident, as well as some definite barrel characteristics.
The taste is tart sour lemons up front that push the boundaries of the taste buds. There is a healthy dose of musty bleu cheese funk and as the beer warms the apricot flavors really come out. Throughout the taste there is a nice oaky-woody backing that supports and balances the flavors.
The beer is light and crisp with a nice dry finish that makes it incredibly drinkable. The flavor is sharply sour, but the finish is dry and compliments the flavors well. 962 charactersrpstevens, Nov 25, 2009

A - Pours a light golden color with a white head. Half a fingers worth of head leaves some lacing along with a nice cap on top of the beer. 
S - Super tart/sour, funk, barynard notes, apricots, sweet fruit such as mangos and pears. A nice meld of funk and sweetness. Lots of the funk up front and a nice subtle sweetness on the finish.
T - Much like the nose, only more sweet fruit notes by comparison. Sour/tart, funky barnyard, horse blanket, apricots, pears.
M - Light and fizzy. Champagne-esk carbonation. Refreshing and gentle on the palate.
D - Not my favorite from Cantillon, but I do like this to change it up every now and then. Looking forward to trying the 2009 release here soon. 751 charactersSean9689, Nov 11, 2009

S: Bouquet of sour vinegar, horse stable with straw, and peach pit
T: The flavor is tart and acidic, followed by sweeter apricot, followed by copper-ish mineral flavors, both complex and refreshing.
M: A sting of carbonation, then creamy stillness. It fills the mouth without coating it or being chewy. Belgians have the best mouth feel.
D: This goes down too quickly, and should be savored. 482 charactersMaction, Nov 09, 2009

A: Very hazy orange color with a reasonably big white head that leaves plenty of lacings.
S: The smell is really acidic with lots of tart fruit notes of lemon, apricots and some green apples. Lots of funky notes as well, mostly mud and blanket. Very intense.
T: The taste is almost unbelievably sour, really mouth-puckering. Lots of acidic fruit notes, mostly of apricots and lemon. Pleasant rustic funky notes of mud and wet hey. Notes of grass and wood. The finish is bone dry, and I really mean bone dry. The beer ends with tart notes of apricots, hints of salty aged cheese, mild grassy bitterness and lingering acidity.
M: Medium body, rather sparkling carbonation.
D: I've had this beer once before, but I was still amazed over how sour it is. By far one of the most sour beers I've tried. All in all, it's a great beer - wonderful fruity character and intense rustic flavors. 931 charactersricke, Oct 29, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bottle poured into an oversized wine glass. Pours a lightly hazy gold with a single finger of white head that retains shortly and leaves a soapy rim after a minute or two.
Aroma is of heavy Cantillon funk and a base of acidity with notes of wet hay, horse blanket and some distant fruit that blends right into the funk. Only Cantillon can produce a funk like the one here. So intense, yet curiously soft in the nose. Wonderfully proportioned without much of an apricot presence, but that doesn't hurt the brew at all.
Taste is excellent. Follows the nose closely with an acidity that cuts through the other notes and leaves the palate semi-dry with the only residual being a bit of funk. The funk is less concentrated than it is on the palate, but just as complex. A pucker after the finish leaves the palate wanting more. There is solace here for sour lovers, but this may be too acidic for those not aquired to the taste. Otherwise this is a standard brew from Cantillon: nothing short of fantastic.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a heavy acidity and a puckering sourness that leaves the palate semi-dry and mildly sticky. A wonderful sour in texture.
Drinkability is great. Truly sour, but very tasty. The acidic notes are balanced by a healthy dose of funk, all under a light fruit banner. Only a Cantillon brew can reach the level of something this complex, yet so drinkable. Cheers! 1,393 charactersbotham, Oct 27, 2009

S: The aroma is huge, and just amazing. I can smell this all the way across the room. Sour and tart fruits. Funky barnyard aromas, Belgian yeast. Apricot comes out in full force as this warms up a bit.
T: Again, sour and tart fruits. Funky flavors that follow the nose. Some yeast, and apricot comes out as this warms up. The typical acidic and vinegar flavor for Cantillon. Again, a huge flavor that is great. 
M/D: A medium body that has a little to much carbonation. Dry and crisp. The sourness makes this a slow sipper. Though I can sip on this all day.
Another wonderful Lambic from Cantillon. This is what a fruit Lambic should be. Not artificial flavor and syrup that so many other examples are. Highly recommended. I have to give a big thanks to biggreen for sharing this with armock and me. 891 characterschamp103, Oct 22, 2009

I picked up this bottle in person from the Cantillon brewey less than one month ago and it appears it was only bottled in Aug 2009!
Maybe that is why I was REALLY blown away this time, as the intense apricot smell and taste was at full power. 
The balance of the apricot with the trademark Cantillon sourness was exceptional, in a similar way to the blueberry profile of the 2009 blabaer. It's been like catching a master brewer at the absolute peak of form in 2009. 
I have to highlight the drinkability of this! For me at least this 750ml bottle disappeared with such ease that if a second bottle had been at hand tonight it would have been a struggle not to go for 1.5 litres...it was just so delicious, OK I admit to being pretty enthusiastic about sours, but this was SO moorish!!
I managed to pick up a few 2009 bottled Lou Pepe's and an Iris on this visit so I am pretty excited about these considering Cantillon's current form. 
I await with interest what they are going to try next? 1,107 charactersHabanero58, Oct 07, 2009

T: A tow front glandular assault. My throat collapses from the apricot and tart combination. The lacto almost makes your throat hurt. Excellent.
M: Super light. The lacto makes it feel heavier than it is.

Pours a hazy cedar with shades of peach. Thick white head has excellent lacing and settles to a thin cover. 
Nose has tart citrus, apricots, manure, oak, horse blanket and earthy soil. The apricot presence really grows as this warms and pairs beautifully with the many other complex aromas. 
Taste is quite sour and acidic up front followed by sweet malts, oak, barnyard funk, sharp citrus fruits and apricots.
Crisp body is delicately carbonated with a nice dry finish. Another amazing lambic from Cantillon. 528 charactersrye726, Sep 13, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Really excited to try this one. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip glass. 2008 Vintage.
A- The outside edges of the beer carried a pale, straw yellow color. As you move towards the center, the color becomes more of a hazy, vibrant golden color. Quite remarkable. Hazy, zero visibility overall. Produced a half fingers width of white head, quickly dissipated.
S- A wonderful combination of ripe apricots with some lemon zest and oak. If I didn't have to extract this glorious nectar with a couple twirls before each sip, I would have given it a higher score. 
T- All I can say is that this is a sourheads wet dream. One of the better experiences I have had with a beer. For the simplistic flavors and ingredients, this was pure perfection. The ripe apricot aroma that was not so pronounced in the smell hits you as soon as the beer touches your palate. Combine this with some oak flavors and an acetic citrus concoction and you have yourself a fantastic brew. Seriously, one of the most mouthpuckering beers I have had. The sour intenseness just grew and grew, paving the way for an awesome finish.
M- If I could find one flaw is that maybe it could have used a tad bit more carbonation. Still, very solid. Light to medium bodied. Coated the palate wonderfully, leaving a consistent sour residue. 
D- For those of you that aren't sourheads, be warned. This is damn delicious and very sour! For me, I could drink this all day. For others, I can see how this might get overwhelming at points.
Overall, yup...after this I am loading up on a few bottles for my cellar. It's amazing how people go nuts over the new rarest sours, yet forget about Cantillon. They easily make the best and most consistent sours in the world. If your a sourhead and have been following all the hype behind American sours, do yourself a favor and pick this up. It'll make you forget all about trading for $30 sours from Lost Abbey. 1,916 charactersrhinos00, Sep 02, 2009

Smell is real nice, definite funk, lemons, wood, apricots, peaches, vinegar, quite acidic in the nose, some bready malts, nice. Taste is similar, sharp and acidic at first, sweet sour middle, like those old school peach candies, apricot is subtle but there, peaches, lemons, lightly woody, nice vinegar and acetic finish.

4.87/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bottle from Monument Liquor in Concord. Great store!
Pours a light... apricot... color, a cloudy yellow-orange with a relatively sparse, but dense head. Aroma is an immediate signature Cantillon sour yeast element, but ripe fresh apricots are blended beautifully into this one. The sour lemony acetic quality of the lambic is divine paired with the apricots in this. A joy to inahale. The taste is a blast of the sourness I adore from Cantillon paired with a complex fruitiness. What is biting into a fresh lemon at one moment tastes like sour apricots the next moment, or orange zest. If I dare sayso, this is one of the best authentic authentic fruit lambics I have tasted. Body is light, with tight medium carbonatioon that leaves me puckered. As sour as this is, the fruit really enhances everything from aroma to drinkability. Lasting tart apricot finish keeps me going back for another sip. Exceptional. 910 charactersvacax, Jul 25, 2009

Pours a cloudy peach with bananna hues with a small halo of white foam around the edges. No lacing seen.
There's a great, clean funk on the nose following by bitter citrus including orange rind, lemon and a bit of the barn...
Oak, sour, lemon and orange zest follows on the flavor. This is a delightful sour that's just on the cusp of being very bitter.
Light, refreshing and has a great sour aftertaste. Very nice beer for it's style... Cantillon makes great beer. 601 charactersbeachbum1975, Jul 18, 2009

served in unique klokke roeland stemless snifter.
just wanted to note that this time around, there is a much bigger blast of fruity ripe apricot (skins and all), especially in the aroma, while still having all the complexities as before.
served a little less cold this time, so i didn't have to wait for it to warm. thus i got a little more carbonation, and thus probably more body.
warrants some score boosting

ORIGINAL REVIEW 2-12-2009
on-tap at deep ellum, in allston, massachusetts. poured into goblet with a slight taper and flare.
bright straw color with amber tones. hazy. nice head that barely fades. this was served to me far too cold for my tastes, so i had to warm it up in my hands for about 5-7 minutes. even after all this, the thin layer of head still remained! lacing forms after each sip, but never sticks.
cider vinegar and gentle funk in the nose, with woody oak and a hint of leather, which really peaks in the middle.
flavor is tart, like champagne and cider vinegars. more wood and leather. hints of yeast and funk mingle near the end, which remains tart and crisp.
peach or apricot fruit is actually only barely perceptible in both the nose and palate, and really only if you look for it.
feel is crisp and acidic, but just slightly thin. carbonation is quite mild. keep in mind that we had to let this sit for nearly ten minutes to warm up. 1,580 characterschinabeergeek, Jun 27, 2009

Very excited to try because i just bought a bottle and wanted to see how long to age it. I'd say 2-3 years in bottle will be perfect. Had next to beatification batch 2, which was much more sour, and it was great to go back and forth between the 2. Apricots come thru but only when it warmed up and on the super long finish. A femenin brew but personaly i enjoyed this cold as it was so refreshing. Too bad it's not available all the time and around $10 for a 750 because it is the perfect summer brew. Very nice and again a pleasure to have a shot at this on draft. 644 characterspaytoplay, May 26, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Batch 2007. Windir and Fou' Foune in the Holiday Inn Express. Epic, to say the least.
Poured into my Deschutes snifter, the beer is a bright and hazy straw golden with a huge frothy white head. A beautiful beer. The color is reminiscent of peaches, perhaps freshly picked by a young and homely Belgian maiden.
The aroma has a very strong Brett profile. Notes of Siberian tiger urine and horse blanket attack my nostrils, as well as goaty musty barnyard. Apricots are in the distant background and I might not have noticed them if I hadn't read the label. Sadly, I was hoping for more apricot character in this beer. It smells sweet and slightly tart.
The flavor is also dominated by Brett, mostly musty barnyard. The beer is tart for a short amount of time, but then abruptly cuts off and leaves my palate hanging. Fruity notes hint at apricots, struggling to rise above the Brett. The finish is musty, goaty Brettanomyces with vague fruit notes. Alas, I was hoping for more fruit in the flavor as well.
Light bodied with a medium level of carbonation and a dry, slightly puckering mouthfeel. 1,096 charactersHopHead84, May 15, 2009
4.72/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Served at cellar temperature in a Girardin tumbler glass. 2006 cork. The first thing I notice is the super bright clarity and orange jewel tone, pretty much in line with the marriage of apricots and lambic. There was a nice cap of micro fizzy foam, that miraculously stuck around for the whole glass. Micro particles of fruit (!) or yeast were suspended in the glass, and each sip stirred up a flurry of bubbles. Aroma was out of this world, strong identifiable Cantillon lambic (lemon citrus, musty oak) once the cork popped. On closer inspection, the nose was dead on fuzzy apricots. Mild acidic notes with wet wood underneath the huge amount of fruit. I find myself smelling this just as often as I drink it. 
Bracing sourness at first that gives way to a puckering fruity apricot flavor. Dry finish with occasional notes of musty wet barrel, slightly tannic, with succulent apricot pits, stems, and fruit. After getting acclimated to the fairly intense sourness, this was an absolute dream. Excuse me while I polish off the bottle... 1,038 charactersemerge077, May 12, 2009

This place is still far and away better at producing any kind of fruit lambics than anything here in the states. Plus, this stuff is available here on my local liquor store shelf. Why again am I trading rare beers for sours produced here when this stuff is readily available? A treasure. Pours a slightly hazy golden with the barest head. Glows in the glass. Smells very sour and acetic with some savory/salty notes, and pure, zingy apricot on the finish. The taste is awesome. Sour, salty, and with absolutely vibrant apricot flavors. Tangy and sweet notes with some light funk/barnyard right at the end. Wonderfully blanced and laser like in flavor. The mouthfeel is juicy, clean, and absolutely knife-like in how it cuts through the palate. Delicious, as always. I think this is one of their better lambics. The apricot really lends itself to the style. 926 charactersGeorgiabeer, May 04, 2009

4.22/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A very light orangish colored body that looks a little like an apricot color itself. A pretty good sized cream colored head rises above that body and has some decent retention. Leaves some lacing behind on my glass.
The smell is great. A big blast of tartness like one would expect, with notes of vinegar but followed by a great apricot aroma that smells like it is natural.
This beer tastes a little more sour than it smells. The biting, puckering chracter that every Cantillon has comes through with a big burst of tartness. The sad thing is that the apricot in the aroma doesn't really transfer over to the flavor. Only a touch of the fruit comes through, and that only if you look really hard for it. Overall a good lambic, but I would like some more apricot.
Mouthfeel is dry and puckering.
Drinkable beer, a little less biting than some Cantillons such as the kriek. 876 charactersHojaminbag, May 01, 2009

A - Poured with a good ivory coloured head which then dissipated over time to reveal a cloudy apricot colour liquid.
S - A funky sour smell bites at the nose. I think that I served it too cold initially, it was only when it warmed up did I get a nice apricot smell.
T- Insanely sour on the first sip but this really grows on you with each sip thereafter. As for the smell, as it warmed up I began to get a gentle apricot taste.
M - A smooth mouthfeel that is slightly dry.
D - If you didn't take another sip after the first one, you would swear this is undrinkable. As I said earlier, as it warmed up it really came into its own. I find it really hard not to like anything from Cantillon (not that I'm trying to hate it). Well done again Mr Van Roy! I only wish I had another bottle. 862 charactersSimmoGee, Apr 24, 2009
3.97/5  rDev -12.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3Pours a hazy orange gold. Small white foam crusting. Nice bubbling. 
Smells like unripe apricot, vinegar, and a hint of funk. Muted funk, though.
Taste is insanely dry. There's a soury apricot, apple, and lemon vinegar notes. The sourness would be more palatable if there was any balancing agent, but this is so extraordinarly arid, it becomes a chore after a while. 
Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated.
For a beer with such a strong fruit component, it's just too dry. I am not sure why, but it's a bit offputting. 515 charactersOverlord, Apr 23, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle into wine glass. 
Pours hazy, orange-gold, thin big-bubbled head that fades quickly. 
Smell is tart and bright, with tons and tons of fresh apricot. This is the most fruit I've ever gotten from a Cantillon fruit lambic, and it's delicious. 
Flavor is gorgeous - huge, vivid apricot. Clean tartness up front, hints well-integrated of barnyard funk and wet leather at points, and so much gorgeous apricot it's stunning. Dry, more acidic sourness than funk. Finish is so much apricot it feels like there should be chunks still floating in the glass. Complete showcase for the apricot, sans any hint of sweetness. Masterful.
Mouthfeel is light, subtle but crisp carbonation underneath a light body that's just brimming with flavor. Some acidity in the back of the throat complements the carbonation. Beautiful. 
Drinkability is astronomical. I had 16 ounces, and felt like I hadn't even gotten a good start. Could have finished an entire bottle and then started on the next. 982 charactersJohnQVegas, Apr 23, 2009

The pour was fantastic looking. Rich orange and amber in color with a good amount of cloudiness and haze to it, enough that you could barely see through to the other side. Nice light puff of white on top that faded leaving only a little bit of lace on top. 
The aroma was beautiful. Rich sour funkiness with huge touches of apricot mixed in. Light peppery and spice notes come through as it warms, but the sour funk was so hardcore. The flavor was puckeringly good. Rich apricot and apple vinegar sour notes are all over this one. As it warms like barrel notes, lots of spice and a long drawn out and very dry. Super drinkable and very refreshing, this was one of the best sours I have had. Worth the wait. 884 charactersmikesgroove, Mar 10, 2009

Smell: sour fruits and a bit of funk is surprisingly very pleasant on the nose.

Mouthfeel: medium bodied. Crisp throughout. Aftertaste is long as the sourness glues itself to the tongue. 
Drinkability: after having a few ounces of this the sourness became less shocking and more pleasant. But after completing the glass over a long period I had enough for the session. 600 charactersGavage, Feb 19, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Deep Ellum...served in a teardrop glass for $8 a pop.
Good, clean white-colored, full-finger head. This sticks decently and shows pretty well adequate lacing...There's just a little bit of haze emerging from a pineapple/honey colored body.
The sweet apricot essence is quite mild. There's a fair amount of pure citrus Bret that is dominant. We're not at the horse blanket stages by any means, but the yeast and Brett electricity on this one is quite nice.
So, so crisp...tart, citrus and Brett funky pucker is countered well by a solid apricot sweetness and very light tropical and white fruits (mango, melons, grapes, maybe a tinge of pear). Yeast strain is powerful and keeps this one extremely clean.
The tight pucker on this one is extremely enjoyable. It's balanced by husky apricot fruit tones and maybe even a tinge of oakiness. Brett is a tie that binds, keeping this all in sync and quite smooth.
For a lambic and its funkiness this drinks incredibly well. I will most likely seek this out whenever possible. 1,032 charactersIBUnit63, Feb 05, 2009

Appearance: Slightly peach colored hazy golden pour. Quite lemon looking with an overall fine foam head.

Taste: Exactly like the nose but the egg note is minimized and the barnyard note is increased.
Mouthfeel: Very refined, sophisticated, creamy, delicate. 
Drinkability: Very approachable considering the style. 
I think the apricot sweetness would disappear completely with any additional age put on this one. But the sharpness and dryness would continue to develop. Its already fairly sharp and dry so who knows what extremes it could reach! Definitely not a low class sweet fruit lambic. This is a winner. 785 characterskoopa, Dec 15, 2008
3.78/5  rDev -16.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.512/4/08- Purcahsed at Plumpjack's in San Francisco, CA.
Presentation- 750ml bottle, vintage 2003 says the cork. Poured into my Cantillion small tulip/wine glass. 
Appearance- Seems to be a brown liquid under the cap surrounding the cork. Pours with a grapefruit colored cloudy white-yellow. Slightlest of spritzy head upon pour which fades upon impact. Leaves super light spotty quick disolving lace.
Smell- Smells very vinegary...the cork pops and still smells a bit vinegar-like, but also more lambic like with some definite barnyard qualities of wet hay and earthyness. Sour fruits, but I can't make them out. Possibly lemon, but apricot does not stand out.
Taste- Pucker city. Possibly the most sour beer I have ever encountered. Tart and mouth puckering. Lemon, grapefruit and other citrus fruits are pretty mucn undefinable due to the extreme tartness. 
Mouthfeel- Very dry with an ultra long lasting sour feeling on the back of the tongue. Medium carbonation level.
Drinkability- This about pushed my limits of sourness. It tore up my stomach as well. Only for the people who can tolerate extreme amounts of citric acid. Tasted just fine, but hard to complete an entire bottle for me at least. 1,206 charactersGClarkage, Dec 05, 2008
3.96/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42007 bottle poured into a snifter.
It pours a bright, hazy yellow gold with a moderate size fluffy white head that lingers as a ring and swirl for a while. The lacing is minimal.
The aroma is quite sour, with lemons, apricots and a bit of funk - barnyard, hay, etc. Quite a bit like lemon juice combined with some vinegar.
The taste is even more sour than the aroma with a massive acidic lemon kick up front before a little bit of fruity sweetness in the middle, but then back to the massive sour presence that attacks the taste buds and makes the lips pucker in the finish.
The palate is light and dry with a tingly carbonation presence.
Wow, this is a seriously funky and acidic lambic that is pretty harsh on the taste buds. Very tasty stuff. 750 charactersgford217, Nov 21, 2008
4.72/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle 2007 vintage $22. Beautiful golden color, hazy. It smells like apricot or peach pits, slight bit of hay, really excellent aroma. Taste is sour apricots, peaches, lemon. Very sour but it doesn't get in the way at all, delicious flavor. The apricot aroma is really my favorite part about this beer but overall this is probably the best Cantillon I have had thus far.

3.89/5  rDev -14.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750 ml bottle brought back from honeymoon in Belgium.
Pours a peachy orange/yellow color. I've never seen a beer this color before; kind of pretty, actually.
Smell is of tangy, sour wheat with a hints of apricot and orange.
Apricot flavor is there, but not overpowering or even entirely noticeable. I wouldn't even be able to pick it out if I didn't know what it was, I bet. Overall it's a soft wheat flavor, with a lightly sweet, moderately sour, very refreshing tartness. 
Amazingly drinkable, would love to have this consistently, especially in the summer. 559 charactersmbrandon2w, Oct 18, 2008

Appearance: Pulling off the wrapper, uncapping the crown and remove the cork is always a messy process with Cantillon beers, usually leaving you covered in mold and other foul-smelling matter. This one's no exception, and may even be worse than any others I've encountered. Between the black mold underneath the bottle cap, the white muck under the wrapper and the grey ooze that seeps from the cork, I have to wonder what this beer is doing to my innards. Fuck it all though, with a beer this delicious you can't worry about what it's doing to your stomach lining or general health. Rambling aside, the beer itself pours a milky wheat color, not far off from the appearance of their gueuze. Cloudiness is significant, but then again, I made no effort to let the sediment settle in this bottle. A vigorous pour left me with a couple inches of head with rather large bubbles, and though it leaves no lacing, retention is pretty good for this style of beer.
Smell: Apricots. Sour, unripened apricots. It's remarkable how much the fruit shines through in the aroma. Before opening this bottle, I wasn't sure how well the fruit would stand up against the acidity of Cantillon lambic (astoundingly well, is the answer). Beyond the fruit, there's plenty of signature Cantillon funk too, but the apricots really steal the show. Awesome, maybe the best nose I've come across on a fruit lambic.
Taste & mouthfeel: Intensely sour, like taking a big bite from an unripened apricot. Again to my surprise, there's a ton of apricot flavor here, and it works beautifully with the bracingly acidic lambic. Even by Cantillon standards, this is sour stuff. I can't see my stomach faring well by the end of this bottle, but that's not going to stop me from finishing it (slowly). The mouthfeel is light and bubbly, with all the signature dryness and acidity people have come to expect from Cantillon, and alcohol is never really felt. Simply an awesome beer, one that I wish was available locally so that I could grab a few to cellar.
Notes on other vintages:
2001: With 9 years of age on it, this batch is still very fruity, lactic, lemony. Sharp sourness. Not as fruity as some of the fresher batches, but still excellent.
2003: Unusually turbid and thick. Not a lot of fruit here compared to newer vintages, though it does come through. Strong lactic sourness, funky, somewhat one-dimensional. Not one of the best batches, but enjoyable.
2004: Musty and slightly metallic, big lactic character, strong apricot skin aroma and flavor. Seemed a bit past its prime to me.
2005: Bottled opened early 2011. Extremely sour, one of the most intensely sour batches of beer I've tried from Cantillon, in fact. Moderate funk, little oak or fruit. Enjoyable in small quantities, the acidity is pretty intense.
2007: Extremely sour and simple with mild fruit and barrel character, one of the weaker batches of FF.
2008: Similar sourness to the 2007 batch but with a big juicy apricot character to balance it, excellent.
2009: Big apricot character with restrained sourness compared to previous vintages. Very oaky, tannic, fruity. Quite good, might be my favorite vintage. As of late 2010, it seems to have become more sour and less tannic with age.
2010: Fresh this is very fruity and bright, lightly sour and funky, less oaky than the '09 was fresh. Amazing apricot bouquet. Very enjoyable, sourness should increase with age. Another great vintage.
2011: Fresh, this one is less fruity and slightly more sour than the previous two vintages. Not as interesting to me as the '09 and '10 batches. Still very good. 3,651 characterslargadeer, Sep 10, 2008

Poured into an Eb's snifter a pale yellow with some slight haze and a thin, quickly dissapating head. Aroma is definite Cantillon tart, sour fruit with some definite funk in there. FLavor is of the tartest apricots I could ever imagine. THis one is one of the most puckering beers I have ever tried. Very dry and refreshing, though. One is an experience. Interesting and very good lambic. 498 charactersDrDogbeer, Aug 30, 2008
4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52004 bottle.
Pours a nice clean yellow/light orangey color with a slim stark white head. Nose is pure cantillon lambic funk with some slight fruit. Taste follows with a very present apricot flavor hidden behind a wonderful blanket of tart barnyard funk. Really impressed with the noticeable apricot in here. Mouthfeel is uber dry and super tart. Drinkability is very fine for the style. Overall, this is defenitely one of my favorite brews from Cantillon. A very good offering, I just wish the goddamn price was a little nicer. Very good lambic, strongly recommended for all the sour heads out there. Great. 608 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Aug 28, 2008

Aroma is funky, citrusy and nice sour peach/apricot - none of that artificial fruit you get from some lesser lambics (and I'm not even talking about the horribly sweet Lindeman's versions). Love that funk.
The taste is quite tart and relatively clean. Yummy funk and sour apricots. Soft wheat-like character upon warming.
Sourness is not quite as sharp as on fresher bottles, but you could argue this is a good thing. My preference - nice and sharp. Age treats it very well though, so you won't go wrong aging a bottle.
Still, one of my favorite Cantillon beers. How I need to get some more bottles! I'm also wavering between a 4.5 and 5 for flavor - I think a fresh bottle might bump the taste score to that elusive 5. 799 charactersrallison, Jul 23, 2008

The beer is a hazy, light peach and pours with a decent inch and a half of foam, a little soapy trails as it falls down.
The aroma is pure funk and fruit!! Love it. Apricots in full force, natural and not "pixie stick" candy like other apricot beers I've tried. Cheesy, salt water, peaches, and sour orange.
Sour apricots...period. Apricot flesh and skin, salt, and a bit of wheat after it warms up.
Near perfect mouthfeel, slightly syrupy but a good level of carbonation livens this one up enough to be very drinkable. Pure indulgence. 
Pucker up!!! 663 charactersseaoflament, Jul 21, 2008
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52004 cork dated 750ml bottle poured into my large St. Feuillien goblet, Fou' Foune is a hazy, darker gold with a off-white collar and skim. 
Smell is super funky, pushing burnt rubber, but in an enticing manner for lambic lovers. As it warms, it gains a soft honey sweetness, although it's very faint. Finally, the apricots flirt through, very nice, wow!
Taste fails to disappoint, this is about as funky as it gets. Four years in, any traces of the famed "Bergeron" apricots are long gone, but I've always preferred pure lambics to fruit ones anyways. As the palate adjusts to the intensity of the sourness, the sweetness starts to cut through, but any hints of the fruit are probably subliminal - if I didn't know the label, I wouldn't recognize them now. Still, I love sours, and this reigns supreme. 
Mouthfeel is puckeringly tart, with a medium body for the style. 
Drinkablity is precious, if you've come this far and shelled out the dough ($30 in my town) then you'll probably wish you'd be able to drink another bottle. Chances are, you can't. I'm saving the dregs for homebrew. If I come close, I'll drink it all day long, albeit not terribly quickly. This is as sour as it gets! A special vintage bottling indeed. 1,227 charactersccrida, Jul 04, 2008
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Popped the cork on this bottle to find out that it was from early 2006. Poured this one into a Cantillon glass to a bright golden color similar to what you would get in a pilsner with a small white head that dissipates after about a minute to just cover the top of the beer. The smell is quite exceptional with a slight funk fading into a great apricot sweetness, almost exactly what I expected it to be. The flavor of this beer was even better than the aroma. Right up front you get a great dryness that quickly fades into a mouth puckering sourness. This eventually turns tart and the after taste gives you the apricot sweetness. The mouthfeel is quite full considering the beers color with lively carbonation. This beer is a pleasure to drink and a geueze/lambic that would please connoisseurs and novices alike. Although the price was a bit high, this was well worth it. 874 charactersjastack, Mar 16, 2008

The aroma was bursting with sour funk, apricots, and citrus notes.
The flavor was intensely sour - more so than almost any sour I've had before. Simply awesome. The flavors of tart apricots were bright and punchy. The fruit bleneded well with complex brett funk, lacto, and pedio sourness with a slight, but pleasant cheesiness faint in the background.
The beer had prickly carbonation with a light mouthfeel. The beer finished very dry and had a mild astringency that complemented the sour charateristics.
A wonderful fruit lambic with some of the most intense sour flavors I've ever had in a beer. This may be Cantillon's sourest. Dope. 699 charactersSacoDeToro, Mar 10, 2008

A: Hazy lemon/orange color with very thin white head. 
S: Tangerine aroma with some spicy tartness. Tart sour grapefruit flavor, like drinking lemon juice straight from the bottle. Wow. 
T: Wicked lemon flavor that is overbearingly strong makes this beer truly one dimensional in flavor. It only gets more sour when it warms but in a good way. Truly an acquired taste and for the seasoned Belgium drinker. Wow.
M: Thin body but extreme sharp/acidic lemon flavor. Makes your eyes squint just bringing the glass up to your mouth from the aroma.
D: 1 bomber is plenty for anyone i would guess. really extreme flavor and smoothing sourness. Price is a little steep to justify. 696 charactersbeerthulhu, Feb 17, 2008

3.93/5  rDev -13.4%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I like this one, I like it a lot.
It pours slightly more orange than the gueuze, and pours with the nice effervescent carbonation that lambics are known for.
It both smells and tastes, at least initially, like the gueuze. Lots of sour, coupled with a lot of barnyard. A quenching acidity then takes over, absolutely cleansing the palate and a nice sweet apricot flavor comes through with a nice light twang.
Wow, the acidity on this one is a little harsh, I should have had it after dinner because it would digest anything. Mmmmm.
I generally like my lambics straight-up, no fruits or sugars. But I'll make an exception for this one, this is great. 652 charactersshbobdb, Dec 23, 2007

A: Hazy, golden honey/orange, with a healthy amount of small carbonation crawling up the curving glass. Initially almost 1-finger of fizzy snow-white head, fading quickly to a thin ring and scattering of swirling film.
S: Quite tart aroma, musty and full of pithy citrus. The sweet/sour apricot smell builds and rises with each swirl of the glass. Smells a little dirty and earthy, very fitting for a tart lambic from the masters at Cantillon. One either loves or hates this fragrance; personally I couldn't get enough of this funky, yet mouth-watering, nose-tickler.
T: Bracingly tart/sour at first, filled with lemon and apricot and a undertone of musty natural yeastiness. A pleasantly light sugar sweetness trails down the back, lending a nice balance to the otherwise harsh tartness. Hints of woodiness in the lengthy finish. 
M: Surprisingly low carbonation in the mouth, this is smooth and even somewhat viscous. Leaves a coating and acidic tanginess, which keeps the tongue curling and the saliva flowing.
D: A wonderful sipping lambic, with a bold tartness in aroma and flavor and long-lasting memorable mouthfeel. A little like a quenching, pucker-inducing lemonade, ideal for a summery day. Low ABV at 5%, but this isn't really a style you'd want to drink much of. Expensive ($6 for this pour) but worth it, and one I'd love to have again. Recommended! 1,516 charactersmsubulldog25, Sep 03, 2007

4.25/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I got this at Premier Gourmet in Buffalo NY.
Pours a yellow pilsner-like color with a bit of haze, even lighter than the gueuze. The head almost immediately becomes a thin film, leaving sparse lace trails behind. The aroma is tart with wet hay and lemon and a woody hint. The taste is immediately very sour with an acidic wave subduing my whole mouth. Sharp lactic notes are abundant throughout. 
Very unripe apricots show in the middle, as well as the nutty slightly astringent taste of their pits. Fruit flavor is very meek compared to the sourness, but luckily the brett, pedioccocus etc fair better. there are lots of farmy, earthy, musty notes all over the place. Cereal and tangy wheat flavors lie in the background. The finish is full of lemon rind sourness. The mouthfeel is medium with light carbonation.
Another fantastic Cantillon beer. It needs more funk and depth to be among the best. Still is ethereal stuff. 932 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Jun 14, 2007

A: Hazy, dull lemon colored brew with a spritzy carbonation. No head but a lot of bubble activity.
S: Vitamin C, dried hay, bitter funk and apricot.
T: Begins tart and sour, no surprise there. Lemon coats the sides while apricot hits the tip of the tongue as liquid moves across the palate. Sour apple thoughts hit the back of the tongue, near the throat. Then the flavors flash back to the sides with a more butterly lemon aspect. Finish is pure apricot with ascorbic acid mixed in.
M: Medium body, slightly prickly mouthfeel.
D: Complex with great balance. Apricot really comes through as it warms, teases the palate leaving you wanting more. 690 charactersWestsidethreat, Feb 06, 2007
4.97/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5750 ml bottle, poured into chalices. Bottled June 2006. Interesting, corked and capped bottle--nice idea for keeping metallic flavors away from the beer. When you pop the cap th beer tries to fizz out around the cork, but corkscrew required to get the cork out. Freshness likely maximized here.
Stored upright, the thick yeast later remained on the bottom of the bottle until my last pours stirred some up. Slightly hazy yellow-amber brew with tiny rim of bubbles. Really nice looking for a lambic.
Aroma is intensely infused with signature brett-wild yeast Cantillon smells that I have grown to love. Within the tangy, citrusy, horse blanket and barnyard lies a readily discernable apricot scent; well integrated, though, it doesn't stand out like an artificial smell might. You want to just inhale this all night.
On the palate the apricot is there but again subtly integrated into the gorgeously tart and crisp lambic backbone. Bone-dry as we expect from the real lambic makers; very refreshing and drinkable, complements food wonderfully...some of the best brewing art on the planet. Lowish lambic ABVs are a plus for drinakbility in my book. Stirring some yeast into the final pours intensified and added more yeasty notes...I recommend trying it. If any beer is worth more than $20/750ml, this is one. I just bought more. I want to move to Brussels. 1,364 characterskenito799, Jan 15, 2007

Appearance: Pours a hazy pale golden, with a fizzy white head that thins to a persistent ring.
Smell: Sour, light apricot fruitiness, with a strong wet blanket aroma that appears upon swirling.
Taste: Sourness is strong throughout. Sweet apricots appear in the center and fade as earthy barnyard flavors become dominant in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Light-bodied with an extremely dry finish.
Drinkability: The relatively subdued sourness and fruitiness make this easy to drink.

3.72/5  rDev -18.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2Cork dated 2004, pours into large flute glass at 50f with active 30% hea, this beer is very carbonated. I bought this bottle in the US just recently.
smell is typical cantillon acidic musty along with an unusual moldy odor I would normally associated with something ruined, but with lambic and cantillon in particular this is probably a good sign.
Taste is initially very dry and pucker-sour, and initial no fruit notes are visible in this. The second swallow I get a distinct hint of peach or apricot. At this point some of this replaces the moldy note in the odor. My palate seems to adapt quickly and the extreme pucker-power is more enjoyable. 
The aftertaste is notably apricot-ish, the part of the mouth not burned by pucker-sour notes feels distinctly that it has had an unusual fruit in its lambic.
Further into the bottle the fruit note becomes more prominent, carbonation remains very active, probably adding to the apparent harshness at first noted.
A somewhat unusual but typically excellent product from Cantillon
Follow-up - this beer was very slow-drinking and actually caused moderate acid indigestion, something I almost never get, not even from cantillon lambics. Stomach pain finally got so bad I did something I have never done with a cantillon product before - I gave up and poured the last 25% out. I am going to let my remaining bottles of this sit for a year or more and see if they mellow out. 
I drink cantillon products all the time and have never had anything like this. No idea if it is a temporary gastrointestinal problem on my part (comment 4/28/06, it was almost certainly a beer issue) but there are no other indications that it is anything but the beer. 1,709 charactersdogfooddog, Mar 21, 2006

Appearance: The beer poured a murky slightly green tinged pale amber coloration. Very light carbonation bubbled up in the glass. There is no head to speak of and no lacing present on the glass. This beer pretty much looks as expected.
Smell: I smelled tons of funky yeastyness playing with a vaguely citrusy vinegar combo. The funkyness of a cantillon is pretty unforgetable. Many of the smells present in the beer would be offensive in there own right combined together they form a strangely desireable combo. 
Taste: The beer has the briefiest of sweetness followed by intense biting acidic vinegar punch. There are all the funky taste associated with a lambic in the beer , farmyard, barnyard and a romper room combo. Oddly enough this beer is not offensive to my palate.
Mouthfeel: The beer has a light body with a heavy sharp mouthfeel. 
Drinkability: This beer was difficult for me to drink at times and hard to put down at others. I will definately give this one another try later. 1,082 charactersnlmartin, Mar 20, 2006
3.28/5  rDev -27.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.5Apricot colored liquid below a small, slowing forming head. Initially bright and vibrant fruit aroma of apricot and peach, which becomes less apparent as the bottle nears final consumption. Other aromatic Cantillon lambic qualities are also present, but in a subtle way. Unbelievably harsh citric acid flavor, with very little character besides an extreme amount of sourness. This is an unbelievably intense lambic, probably the most sour lambic ever. Its so strange, because I adore the three year old Grand Cru, but that beer has so much more depth and character, besides the sourness. This is just cutting, with very little fruit character. 645 charactersCrosling, Mar 16, 2006
4.82/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottled in 2003: Pours with slight carbonation, body is light, hazy yellow, tiny bit of orange. The smell tempts me to jump in, but I resist it. Oranges, tangerines, peaches, malt, with all the dirty flavors that one would expect.
 The flavor is awesome. Fruit flavors of oranges, peaches, and apricots. Then, the dirt, the dust, the must, and the funk. This is amazing. The mouthfeel is puckering, to say the least. As always with Cantillon lambics, drinkability depends on whether you like sour beers or not. I love em, and this is one of my favorites. 557 charactersSephiroth, Mar 05, 2006

Appearance: Sunny and peachy orange like a tropical sunset or a really bad 80's T-shirt, it sported a thin white lacing.
Smell: Kapow! The usual Cantillon rainbow of aromas that you're not supposed to like but still do, the hay, the pig pen, old baseball mit and grandma's old photo album are there, but the fruit seems much more present, as if it were served with a twist of orange.
Taste: If it were any more acidic than this, it would puncture your stomach. But the fruit shines beautifully once again, showing oranges, tangerines, peaches and a little passion fruit. Finish is sharp and dry, but with a very long tongue flipping aftermath. The drinkability of this elixir was strongly debated amongst those who were kind enough to share it with me, and as usual concensus was not achieved. I was on the "yes" side, because I already dusted off a 750 by myself in Brussels, however I didn't enjoy the bottle I had at Delirium Café as much as this one. But I agree with the fact that this isn't for everyone. I'm not saying this to pass off as a snob, I'm just saying that there isn't enough Pepsid AC, Rolaids or Tums on earth to cure what this Beer would do to anyone with ulsers or acid reflux. 1,221 charactersGoldorak, Feb 28, 2006

Aroma: Another kick in the head from a true Lambic. Musty, old, hints of over ripe peach, bile, vinegar, farm, and various animals. 
Appearance: Hazy apricot glass shows no head and thus, no lace. Looks like peach nectar.
Flavor: Intense! Once you get past the lemon juice, its like youre running around a farmyard putting your tongue on various things, some of which dont appreciate it. While my other Lambic experiences have lemon juice intensity, I really got the lemon/citric feeling out of this one.
Mouthfeel: Mouth curdling tart, bone dry. 
Overall Impression: Good! Same pucker vinegar nut check Am I man enough? intensity. Im glad to report that, yes, yes I am, but wow these Lambics have me up in the middle of the night running for antacids. Its like they try to crawl back out, but no problems getting them down.
Thanks once again to Stonecrusher for the continued education. 944 charactersHardTarget, Feb 12, 2006

Aroma: Tart aroma of vinegar, sharp cheese, sour hay, and earth. While this sounds unappealing, it is not, somehow.
Taste: Profoundly sour, puckering, and astonishingly dry. Somewhat like lemon juice, and white wine vinegar, with earthy notes thrown in. Nonetheless, the reaction to this cornucopia of typically unappealing flavors is to take another sip. The finish is very, very tart, with a ghostly herbal hop presence. The apricot notes are present, but quite subtle.
Mouth feel: Smooth, very soft, pleasant, almost unexpectedly so,
Drinkability/notes: Like blue cheese, most definately an acquired taste, but once acquired, there is a profound attraction. A beer and a style that must not be missed. A friend commented that is very much like a Brut Champagne. Discarding one's preconcieved notions of beer is the best way to experience a lambic for the first time. 1,012 charactersPegasus, Feb 12, 2006
3.42/5  rDev -24.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2.5Pours a golden color, with a slight tint of orange, a fizzy head, and a negligible haze. The aroma is pretty funky: apricot is notable right off the bat, followed by a grassiness, horseblanket, musty earth, wood, and a serious vinousness. The first taste is a powerful, mouth-pckering, roll-up-your tongue, wrinkle-your-face sourness. Lots of acid. This lambic sure isnt sweetened. After the first few sips, and your mouth is prepared, a lot of funkly, fruity flavors come out. The apricot hides, and I could only pick it out as a faint effect of the finish. The musty, horse flavor is present through the taste. This is an extremely dry, extremely astringent brew. Theres a high level of carbonation. Pretty much no hop flavors at all. This is one sour, but subtle beer. The more I drank, the more it grew on me. I wouldnt drink it on its own againbut I think it would be fantastic with food. The beer would go great with some intensely rich foods (I kept thinking that this would be great with oysters Rockefeller). 1,027 charactersSuds, Feb 05, 2006

Smelled powerfully of apricots and a crazy wild yeast. The pungent smell reminded me of black earth and turned milk in the Russian River Supplication sort of sense. Im guessing there are a lot of strange bacteria at work here forming this beer into something very unique. Tastes of powerfully sour nectarines, oranges and raspberries. The flavor is so intense, its hard to identify just what fruits were used here. It nearly tastes like vinegar its so tough. Theres also a sour milk flavor here as well. Fortunately, theres a creamy apricot in the finish. Wow. When the waitress said its very sour she wasnt kidding. The mouth feel is thick and the sourness really puckers the mouth quite a bit. However, if you drink this slowly, you just may enjoy it. 842 charactersDarkerTheBetter, Jan 20, 2006

Some oaknotes in the back and dry but this sourness is just too much and think this one needs many years to get for me to an acceptable and balanced taste.

Appearence: Pours a wonderful orange cream color with a creamy white head that dies down to collar. Hazy as hell.
Smell: The smell is a mix of sourness, apricots, and an a strange smell I can't put my finger on. The funkiness of this beer is superb.
Taste and Mouthfeel: This is just as sour, if not more so, than the Brouscella, and I love it. The sour, funkiness is perfectly matched with a slight apricot flavor. The wood notes really help mellow this beer out. Super complex, super balanced, super sour, and super tasty. 
Drinkability and Overall: This beer right here is exactly why I love lambics/gueuzes so much. The sourness!!! The tart flavor is almost unbearable, but not quite, and it makes this beer damn near perfect. One of the best Fruit Lambics I've had to date. If you love to sour, funky flavors, you'll love this to death. 867 characterssantoslhalper, Oct 10, 2005
1.95/5  rDev -57%look: 1.5 | smell: 1.5 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 2 |  overall: 1.5Shared the huge bottle with a few friends. 2004 date on it. Picked up three different Cantillon brews at John's Grocery in Iowa City, and thought I'd give this one a try first.
The pour and look of this beer is decidedly awful. Fizzy head is gone in an instant, no doubt because nothing would want to stay sitting on something that smells like this...
Is that taste supposed to be apricots? Because it doesn't taste anything like any apricots I've ever tasted..it tastes like rotten, sour...i dunno..something not good. It's also as acidic as any beer I've had. I'm sorry, I'll probably get flak for writing such a bad review of a beer that's rated rather highly, but this thing certainly did not impress me in any category. I usually like more harsh, extreme beers..but this is simply sour and one-dimensional in my book.
I hope the $40 Cantillon Saint Lamvinus in my cellar doesn't taste anything like this, and that's the understatement of the year. I certainly won't be purchasing the Cantillon Fou' Foune again.
This may be for some...but it certainly was not for me, or the three others that helped me drink this bottle. None of us were impressed in the least. 1,176 charactershero27, Sep 28, 2005

eyes...
fascinating, cloudy murk with shadows like clouds suspended in orangeade. The head forms an Oring on the edges of the glass but if you tilt the glass the ring "spreads" out, I havent seen another beer do this. Also the bubbles on the surface of the middle were "streaming" out into the Oring.. I was frikkin mezmerized by the look of this beer. I took a full 10 minutes oogling this thing initially!
smell...
mild belgian farm funk (I wanted to eat the cork), apricots mashed into your nostrils with only a hint of the tart monster that is about to stomp on your ass like mosh girl... this isnt as mouth watering as say the Organic Geuze (on the nose), I think the Apricot masks the wild aspect of the beer very well and is so damn enjoyable. It reminds me of the first time a chick.. ah nevermind.. it's enjoyable as hell and memorable.
taste...
I like lambics. I like Cantillon. and I was completely unprepared. We (I was splitting this with my bud Yelterdow) gave a little to his wife.. she spit it out (well, we now know the answer to the spit/swallow question there.. sorry buddy..). On the first sip the beer took out the paddles of life and said "clear" before applying to my toungue such a frikkin kick it was like swallowing rancid jersey shore sea water (without the syringes). The initial salinity was brash and almost over powering to the point of putting me off. Undeterred by this blast I moved on to the next sip, and there it was, a prickly trip down motherf'r tartness lane. Out of the Cantillon line this one was the tartest I have sampled. At one point my friend and I were practically spitting on each other because this beer's tartness makes you drool like a rabid dog in heat, injected with viagra at the westminster dog show, in the summer, on the equator... This beer makes you take notice, there is no doubt cantillon says "FU. this is beer, just go ahead and try me fatso". The body was perfect, in a way full and large but finishing somewhat dry with the lemon flavor. The apricot flavor is hard to catch but it's domain is found between the initial blast and the final tart kick in the balls, wrapped up in there is a quaint subtle apricot gem. This beer floored me.
Verdict?
at $28 a bottle this isnt something I wouold go for everyday but this is one of those beers out there on the ledge of what beer can be. (beer all you can be). I found it easy to drink after the initial blast. This beer is one to drink for hours, the smell, the look, the crazy flavor can keep you talking all damn day. This certainly is not for everyone in any way shape or form but damn I gotta give props to Cantillon for producing something so amazingly original and hard to really describe till you experience this beer. I guess that is the point after all, you need to "experience" this beer if you like non fruity lambics. I personally prefer the Organic Geuze just for sheer drinkability but I wouldn't be adverse to picking this up again sometime down the road just to be reminded of how amazingly out there this brew is... WOW... 3,136 charactersEgo, Aug 22, 2005

Although the kreik is more robust, and stands to lend more flavor, this is still a real treat. The beer is a murky yellow tan color with high carbonation and no head. The smell is unmistakeably Cantillon; as the lambic base and its sharp acidity sting the nostrils. Once sipped, the fresh apricot flavor comes through, but when paired with the lambic it falls a bit flat, and really can't hold its own. I like the weeds, the musty flavor imparted by the Brett, even the way in which the fruit lends a slight sweetness and a bit of a foil to the uncompromising sourness. Make no mistake, this aint some US fruit beer. This is unabashedly raw and I love it. A great one to try. 768 characters99bottles, Jun 13, 2005

A small amount of carbonation is present in the murkiness. The aroma is definate lambic with barnyard elements and grass masking a suttle peach aspect. The flavor was the powerful presence of lambic sweet/sour brought crashing in by the definate astrigent nature of the body and finish. All and all a refreshing lambic for a relaxing afternoon. 488 charactersWildman, May 01, 2005

Aroma is enticing and funky with strong horsey, sweaty and barnyardy component. It definitely has a sweet connotation, honey-like blended with the horsey fruits (apricot, orange, pink grapefruit). Yep, this is a lambic, very fruity, limey, citric, lactic and funky. Yet, its aggressiveness is rather limited in mouth. Its tart of course, but pretty mellowed out. I assume the bottles are far more authentic in that regard, here, the mouthfeel is so lightly carbonated that it feels a bit lifeless. I wish I had an explanation for the name though! (Foufoune means buns in the sense of bottom or behind) 689 charactersRastacouere, Mar 31, 2005

Taste is of apricots. Sour, tart. Typical Cantillon, which is always a good change of pace. Not acidic. In regards to mouthfeel, this could use more carbonation. But hey, you get what you get with spontaneity, if you know what I mean. 390 charactersGeoffFromSJ, Mar 20, 2005

Appearance: light straw, cloudy, thinnish layer of white foam (on hard pour), poor head retention
Aroma: ethereal wisps of apricot/peach throughout a geuzy base: lactic sourness, wet straw, sulphur, cork, stale crackers
Flavor: puckeringly sour (like sucking a lemon), distant hint of apricot, stale butter, cork, trace of turpentine (or a taste like the way turpentine smells), finishes dry with a lingering tartness and some graininess and unripe apricots in the aftertaste
Mouthfeel: light body, mild carbonation, very acidic, slightly slick in the throat
Other comments: Holy crap this one's sour! Of course, Cantillons are typically sour, but this is outrageous! Can give you heartburn or acid reflux if you drink too much of it. Couldn't get through the entire 750ml by myself, so I'm going to use part of it to make dressing. 897 charactersGreenCard, Dec 31, 2004

S-acidic vinegar smell with some fruitiness to it also--either peaches or apricots--some hint of lemon too. nothing overpowering yet.
T- ZING!!! This is the tartest of all the Cantillons I have tried (had about 5 others) and its the tartest by far. Doesnt seem to have the horseblanket or earthy farmhouse-like taste that the other Cantillons do--maybe this is due to the fact that the tartness of these apricots (I think thats what the fruit is) is just so powerful that said horseblanket flavor is masked. It does have a cold very thirst-quenching finish to it. Drinking this beer is almost like biting into a lemon. Might be good once but not something you want to make a habit of.
MF-fine smooth peach or apricot fuzz--quite pleasant.
D-This is one hard beer to drink. I finished my whole glass but I won't be getting this one again. 871 charactersrousee, Dec 12, 2004

Pours a light golden peachy color with a slight minimal white head that leaves no lace. Initial aromas are pungent and citric, with just a slight hint of fruit and some of those classic barnyard aromas. For flavor this brew is crisp and delightful. There is a beautiful balance between the sourness and a slight sweet fruity like flavor that can best be described as a citrusy lemonade.. Following there is a nice bite of tartness to the brew, and a refreshing carbonation. Overall this brew is highly drinkable, though I would never think that Cantillon would use apricots in a beer, but hell it works. 652 charactersbigbeerdrinka, Nov 21, 2004
4.05/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Picked this up at Smokeless Joe in Toronto. Pours a lovely hazy peach colour with a white head that doesn't stick around for long. Smell was very pungent, very sour yeasty smell, but similar to the other Cantillon I tried. Taste was a tart if not downright sour apricot that was very dry. It was a very mouth-puckering mouthfeel that dries out the mouth. All these comments sound rather negative, but I really liked the taste, it makes you feel alive, and in my case, more sober for the long walk home. I would recommend this as it is a very good example of a Lambic, like it ot hate it. 587 characterstatterdash, Nov 08, 2004
3.41/5  rDev -24.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2.5This was only my fourth lambic, so perhap my pallette was not quite ready for this one. I read so many great reviews about Cantillon that I just had to try it out. Picked up this bottle at the the wacky Drive-thu beer store just downt the road. That place is nuts. They have the over 800 beers, yet its a drive thu and they discourage browsing. And they are waaay overpriced. Paid just over $20 for this bottle of 2001 vintage.
Poured slowlyinto my trusty tulip glass, revealing some head and minimal lacing. Very carbonated, could have produced much more head had I felt like it. Straw/gold in color, very silimar to a hefe, but less cloudy.
First sip puckered my right up. this is the most sour beer, and perhaps the most sour beverage I have ever had. Honestly, it made me think of the Sour Warhead candies I used to eat as a kid. Certainly a taste that takes some getting used to. But once I got used to it, I came to enjoy it to an extent. Earthy tastes become apparent as it warms and there are leathery flavors as well. If I didn't know that there were apricots in it, I might not have noticed them. However, I look for them and found them hiding in the nose and underneath the sourness, especially at the finish. Perhaps they would have been more apparent if the beer was fresher. 
I can't rate this one too highly, it just wasn't something I can see drinking all the time. But don't let that discourage you, you might enjoy it much more. Heck 6 months ago I couldn't stand IPAs and now I love them. 1,512 characterspoundboy, Oct 04, 2004
4.33/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.575 cl cork dated 2/2002. Glowing peachy golden color with a carefully poured cream colored head. Yeasty barnyard funk aromas as well as some fuzzy subdued apricot/peach aromas. It is really a culmination of those fruits that have fuzzy skin, like peaches, apricots and kumquats. Some would debate, but only domestic, Belgian apricots are only used in this brew, and it takes on aspects of all fuzzy-skinned fruits. It has a barnyard, wet-dog funk to it not unlike other quality lambics. Quite leathery and earthy. Really hits the sour portions of the tastebuds. Once again Cantillon delivers. Predominant taste is of tannins of unripened apricot skins. Rather acrid, yet wholly enjoyable for lambic lovers everywhere. Just make sure you drink within it's window of oppurtunity when fresh fruit is in it's character. Other unfruited lambics stay longer and are better aged. 872 characterscrookedhalo, Jul 31, 2004

Peachy color. Light peach. Thin and fluffy white head sits on top and is well retained. Lacing comes in patches. Carbonation looks to be moderate.Aroma is acidic, citric, estery, vinegar-like and fruity (as in green apples and nectarines). A little wet blanket on the nose as well. The mouthfeel is slightly prickly and more than slightly puckering. Not quite as mouth puckering as some of the other Cantillon selections I've had though. This one is held in check somewhat. It's pretty refreshing. The horse blanket is there. And the acidity is definitely there. Very slight apricot. Grape skin and unripe green apple. Nicely put together. Somthing keeps begging me to drink more of it. That's a good sign. 738 charactersBighuge, Jul 23, 2004

Huge tang up front and tartness that hits you like a cold bucket of water. Lemony notes and very big lime bitterness along with vinegar notes that make you pucker up! The fruitiness is very toned down. A pinch of apricot but burried beneath all of the acidity and tartness. Some light earthy notes and fresh grassy layers. Nice acidity although not to the degree of the gueze for example. For me this is a great beer for a starter or even a night cap. The perfect summer beer. I absolutely loved it. 606 charactersPopsinc, Jun 22, 2004

Bartender insisted this was it, not on way to the skunk. Good I split it with a friend and could have done so with three other friends. After first acid bite on mouth (which I still feel 7 hours later), it grows on you. Like a highly acidic apple. A bit of apricot aroma but we tasted nothing sweet or fruity. Yeast but overpowered.

The long-awaited Fou' Foune pours a cloudy, light amber-peach hue with hardly any head to mention. 
Aroma is boisterous in its proclamation of dirty socks, Brett, funky barnyard notes, leather, oak, and a mild hint of the apricots on which this lambic was soaked. Interesting.
The apricot fruit adds another dimension to the lambic in how it softens it -- this isn't the strip-the-enamel-off-your-teeth lambic monster, but rather a more well rounded, softer beer. The apricot flavor comes out first, while the typical lemon rind, citrusy notes reminiscent of Cantillon lambic appear on the finish. Lively acidity cuts at one's stomach.
Fairly "alive" in terms of carbonation, this a fairly smooth lambic. Medium bodied palate. Round overall.
Fou' Foune is refreshing in the way that Cantillon lambics tend to be. A fantastic beer that ought to be experienced by lambic fans. 904 charactersJon, Mar 29, 2004
4.38/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This lambic comes from the last traditional brewer in Brussels. The beer is aged for two years in wooden casks, and apricots are added, which produces a bright orange color. The head retention is high from the use of wheat that helps accent its color. The aroma gives the impression that this beer is going to be sour, which is the case for lambics especially from this brewer. At first, the beer almost puckers the mouth, but you are rewarded for continuing. The apricot flavor is soft and subtle amid the complexity of a wood aged lambic. It is almost syrupy and coats the tongue well. 587 charactersark57, Mar 15, 2004
4.22/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Cantillon Fou Foune smells and drinks like a well-balanced gueuze. The natural tartness of apricots makes them a natural pairing with lambic. The true fruit character doesn't come out until late in the finish at which point the lemony, herbal tartness that has some fruity notes blossoms into full, fresh apricot flesh and skin. The beer leaves traces of apricots on the lips, between the gums, and in the teeth. 
The apricots are enticing, but Fou' Foune is more important for what it does to the world of lambic. It tastes like a legend who has yet to realize his greatness or perhaps one who has no regard for such ribbons in the first place. 
Wholly balanced, the apricots are less important to me for their flavor and more important for their structure. As the cab franc and merlot in Saint-Lamvinus add some cocoa depth, but are moreso key players in the smoothness and drinkability of the otherwise aggressively tart and, for many, unpalatably authentic Cantillon lambics, so, too, do the apricots in Fou' Foune work in toning down the beer. 
As the flavors develop and come to a head, the apricot becomes quite apparent, especially towards the end of the bottle, but the lack of residual sugar and appropriate Cantillon muskiness leave us more with a sense of gueuze than with a sense of fruit. To use fruit to that end -- to enhance the natural properties of something -- is remarkable. In effect, Cantillon simplifies the expression of lambic by, paradoxically, adding something to the mix.
Apricots belong in lambic and a bottle of Cantillon Fou' Foune belongs in your stomach.
Quite the pairing with fish and chips.
Relax, relax.

Wow, I really though that the St. Lamvinus was the best lambic beer in the world, but this brew really gave the St. Lamvinus a run for its money! This brew was delivered to me courtesy of a beer trade. 
Appearance: The hard pour reveals a peach coloured golden liquid, that is murky, milky and cloudy. The head is fluffy, white and large, but it fades quickly leaving only a trace amount of fluffy white bubbles on the perimiter of my drinking vessle. Personally, I think this looks awesome, but I have to dock it .5 on the appearance scale. 
Smell: For a Cantillon the smell of this beer is very different and intriguing. The traditionl notes of earth, wood, barnyard funk, etc...are all here, but I also smell a lovely dry apricot aroma, and several distinctly different fruity aromas, these tend to be citrus-like in nature. Lemon peels, orange rinds, and dry fermenting peaches and/or apricots all come to mind.
Taste: Make no mistake, even though the aroma of this brew is very soft for a traditional Cantillon offering the taste is Cantillon all the way. The soft apperance and intriguingly fruity aroma of this brew only lead you blindlessly into the shocking taste of the first sip of this brew. This is incredibly acidic and sharp upfront. When the acidity finally subsides the citrus like tones of lemon, orange zest, and other fruits shines through. The middle is very dry (obviously) with hints of earth, barnyard, fruity, juicy apricots, and more. The finish is bone dry and saliva stripping with the apricots softening the blow of this brew a bit. All in all this is one fantastic tasting beer!
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel of this beer is very lively, carbonated, and lucious. The fine bottle conditioning of this ale make each and every bubble grasp onto your tongue and into the crevisces of your mouth, delivering a very high ratio of FPSI [flavor per square inch]!
Drinkability: The drinkability of this beer is exceptional, only marred a bit by the fact that this is just so damn acidic up front. Despite the soft apperance and different aromas of this brew, the taste is 100% cantillon all the way. However, I have to ask myself what a VERY fresh sample would taste like? The 3 years of aging surely stripped away some of the fresh fruit flavors and aromas and replaced them with some more classic lambic funk!
Overall: Holy shit, a mouth watering, saliva sucking, traditional Belgian lambic beer with Bergeron Apricots as the secondary sugar source? Who else, but Mr. Van-roy would think about, or attempt to make a beer like this, and suceed so damn well at it!? Do yourself a favor and pick this up if it is available at your local store. Sure it is $30 or so, but it is definately worth the price asked for it. Or, If you ever get over to Belgium you can get this for under $10 a bottle and haul some back with you. Not as perfect as there gueuze, or the insanely good (and expensive) St. Lamvinus, but it's pretty f'in close!
Jean Pierre Van Roy is simply one of the best brewers in Belgium, and the world! Cheers to you sir! 3,562 charactersfrancisweizen, Feb 17, 2004
4.32/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Slightly hazy orange gold. Very fine raspy white head makes a brief appearance, but comes back with swirling. Little lace.
Initial blast of dried apricot blows off to reveal classic Cantillon. Sour citrus leads the way as always, but here it is well-supported by a subtle earth and apricot. Bready malt pokes through as does a bit of barnyard, which increases with time. Simply a stunning nose, even for Cantillon. 
First few sips are over-whelmed by the Cantillon acidity, even for this veteran Cantillon devotee. Eventually, my mouth adjusts and the true palate begins to show. Acidic citrus still dominates, but there is some maltiness in there as well. A metallic note is present throughout and a bit distracting. The apricot is just an afterthought on the palate. Finish is incredibly long with the acidity somehow managing to build after swallowing. Quite a ride!
Mouthfeel is fine and soft. A challenging beer, and not recommended for the novice lambic drinker, but I enjoyed it. And that nose! 1,010 charactersRealale, Jan 13, 2004

Your funk is the best (talk!)
Take my body, give it the mind 
To funk with the rest  Adapted from Dr. Funkenstein
Ive been mesmerized by the Fou foune label for the past two months. Its perhaps the most dignified and artistic label Ive even viewed, and to boot its a little bit funky, just like this beer (I had some second thoughts calling this a beer). The beer is a cloudy orange copper and looks amazing in my flute. A thin layer of foam formed across the top. It smells like most lambics. The first sip begins mellow and then its tartness expands to its full potential. My cheeks puckered a little before the fruity apricot aftertaste filled my throat. Man the aftertaste is refreshing. The funk is sour, yet not overbearing, and adds some zest and zing every step of the way (hints of lemon, apricots, and of course yeast). I wonder if the Belgiums enjoy a cube of sugar is this fine offering? Anyway, this was a new experience for my in terms of lambics and highly memorable. 1,037 charactersStarchild, Dec 25, 2003
4.15/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5August 2009 Bottled on date; Sampled July 2010
The beer pours with a hazy, sedimented, mucky color due to the completely crap pour by the waitress. It is topped by a fizzy, short lived, white head. The aroma is very tart smelling at first, but yields to notes of apricots, a hint of yeast and then back to tart again. Musty aromatics are joined by notes of musky barnyard notes as well as some catty, urea like notes. The nose really has a nice, floral / fruit apricot character to it that makes this vibrantly aromatic.
The flavor is bracingly sour upfront and finishes with a softer apricot like acidity that is joined by lactic acid sourness too. A floral apricot flavor is definitely here, despite the beer being bone dry. The body is quite light and refreshing and is definitely a beer meant for consuming in quantity (assuming you can get past the sourness of course). This is very nice, I would have loved to be able to try an even fresher example
Sampled July 2004, 2001 bottling.
Pours a very hazy orange-gold color. The head is cream colored and dissapears after a couple of minutes. The aroma is tart and funky. It is quite sour with some muted barnyard Brett notes. As is usual with Cantillon the taste is at first shockingly mouth puckering. After all of this time I don't even get a sense of the apricots. A bit of chalkiness is in the middle of this beer, which seems to add a bit of fullness to this otherwise light and refreshing beer. The sourness is reminiscent of grapefruit and lemons. Though I really wish there was some apricot flavor here, it is still quite good, though just as a Lambic.
Sampled 2002
A orangish light gold color to this beer, that is more light gold than anything. Pours with a lively carbonation. I can't detect any apricot in the aroma, though there is a slight fruitiness, but mostly smell sour. The taste is of course quite acidic, with general musty character as well. If I did not know this beer I would have no idea that it was made with apricots. The lambic beasties have completely obliterated all signs of the apricots. As a lambic type beer this is quite good, though seems a bit simplistic compared to some of the other offerings. Tastes more of a citrus type fruit, which comes from the acidity. I am a bit dissapointed in the apricot character from this beer, but it is still quite good. 2,346 charactersGueuzedude, Aug 29, 2003
4.59/5  rDev +1.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Wow! Although apricots are not a real traditional fruit for a lambic ...this is definitely a real, traditional lambic! It's quite a refreshing change from the overly sweet and fruity lambics that are so popular right now.
The body is a hazy, glowing yellow with a peach cast. The creamy, bright-white head holds well at first and slowly drops to a thin collar and whispy surface foam. Sweet apricot is present in the first whiff, but it reveals it's seductively intense and complex lambic character upon closer inspection. The sweetness of the fruit is squelched in the flavor, although there is definite apricot character. The sweetness appears right at the start, but immediately vanishes as it's overtaken by a sharp, drying acidity that retains control until the swallow where lambic character lingers in the finish along with more fruit. Quite exceptional. Intense. Complex. Refreshing. 894 charactersNeroFiddled, May 02, 2003
4.72/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5FouFoune 2001
Presented in a 1 Pint 9.40 fl.oz green glass bottle, the front of which contains a strange looking label. It has an orange border & depicts a view looking from the moons surface into the blackness of space & what at first appears to be the Sun, closer examination reveals that it is in fact -an Apricot. Dragged back from Belgium for just 6.
FouFoune is the nickname of a french apricot grower, who continually espoused the virtues of his product to Jean-Pierre Van Roy (Master Brewer), it was just a matter of time before an Apricot lambic would be borne. Made with 300 grammes of de-stoned Bergeron Apricots steeped in each 1 litre of 2 year old lambic &gt; this is that product. Fou'Fonne also means "Peach Fuzz"!!!
I poured the whole bottle in one go, first into a large Glass Jug & the remainder into a Cantillon Tumbler (which I purchased with this Bottle at the Brewery only a week earlier). The beer poured with a haze even after being stored upright for over a week. Served at 55 Deg.F. 
It pours with a limited effervescence, and an orangey-cream head that is short lived, and remains as a 1/8 halo head collar in the Glass. Although the head is small, there is high inherent carbonation & bubbles continually stream upwards in the Glass Jug. The retained carbonation gives the usual superb Cantillon spritzy mouthfeel. This beer dances on your tongue whilst doing the tango with your saliva. 
The beer is a lovely turbid pale straw yellow/gold color that reminded me of fresh pineapple crush. The beer exhibited a haze from the intitial pour. Nose is of a sharp acidic beer. It does not disappoint. A lovely, striking, acidic introduction with an acidic-sweetness. Acidic-sweetness!!, what the hell is that?? I didnt know the two could exist together  but hey this is Cantillon & they do  believe me. Some sourness exists in the middle as it decides whether to grip you with the Cantillon Mouth-Pucker, or take a few more twists and turns before doing so. It decides to take the twists and turns; Acid, Sweetness, Oak, Acidic-Sweetness, Citric-Bitterness, Sweet Sourness & a hint of Apricots.
then comes the astringent shock finish, the trademark Cantillon Mouth-Pucker, damped down somewhat compared to say the Gueuze  but it is there, so brace yourself.
Wow, yet another unique beer, a truly traditional Apricot-Lambic.
If you have only ever tried the sweet fruit lambics from Timmermans, Lindemans, Mort Subite, etc. then you may not understand this beer.
This is Cantillon  The Lambic Master. We are truly NOT Worthy!!! 2,599 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Dec 06, 2002
4.25/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Very good. Hints of sweetness, due to the apricot, well balanced with a sour, dry, acidic finish, very refreshing brew. Quite complex, with hints of apricots, oak, lemon, sour yeast. Just another great brew from cantillon. 222 charactersrastaman, Aug 05, 2002
