4.59/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A - Stunning ruby red with a very light pink head which dissipated quickly but held at about 2-3mm.
S - Got some sweet dark fruit aromas (raspberries, plums and grapes) and some subtle funk.
T - Really well balanced sourness, funk and fruit. Dark grape flavours drove the palate. 
M - Quite highly carbonated. Would have liked slightly less which would have enabled more fruit to shine but a small knock on an incredible beer. 
O - Just an incredible Lambic. One of my favourite Cantillon beers. Hopefully I can get my hands on another in the near future. 559 charactersNarkee, Nov 21, 2016

4.03/5  rDev -9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Hazy garnet with a soft white, but slightly pink collar.
Funky aroma of brie cheese, light red wine vinegar, and merlot.
Lots of grape in flavor, but also lemon-lime, grapefruit, and brine. Raspberry develops as it warms. It's a little lactic, but overall more acetic, yet it's balanced and very well-made, as I'm not getting any hint of impending acid reflux whatsoever.
Tangy and crisp with a medium to high level of sourness, finishing very dry. 451 charactersSabtos, Oct 15, 2016

4.06/5  rDev -8.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Finger worth of loose, airy foam that has meager retention, barely leaves a surface coating behind, zero lacing as well. Opaquely cloudy liquid of a watermelon pink coloration, faded rose hued rims. Ripe, fruity nose of raspberry, strawberry with notes of lemon, clean and without the sour blast that such beers possess and knock you back on your heels, hovers steadily in the nostrils. Light-bodied, the initial sweetness frames things pleasantly before developing a broadening sourness across the palate. Same soft cherry, raspberry, strawberry fruit array, nibbles at you as well via accents of green apple. Has a minerally, metallic bite at the end, dry yeastiness. It is remarkable most for its smoothness and relatively high drinkability. Bottled October 26, 2015. 770 charactersfarrago, Jul 02, 2016

L - 2015 (4.75) dark ruby red, nice pink head, really sexy
2013 (4.75) consistent.  beautiful
S - 2015 (4.25)  funk, lacto, some fruit and more as it warmed.  2013 (4.5) way fruitier.  oak and grapefruit big time.  some of that wild yeast too and some barnyard hay
T - 2015 (4.25) red grapes, some raspberry, a little more dark fruits as it warms, and the oak opens up nicely as it warms.  2013 (4.75) tons of berry, grapefruit, and red grapes.  Probably tart grapefruit being the most prevalent, but really and overall flavor bomb.  Tons of fruit and oak and just wonderful.
F - smooth, tart, a coating feel that's a little heavier for a sour in a great way
O - 2015 (4.25) a very nice fruited lambic.  a little overrated in my opinion, but i would assume it ages gracefully.  the tartness was very pleasant, but the overall flavor profile was a bit of a letdown
2013 (4.75) wow this was a different beer than 2015.  I don't know if it ages really well or the older vintage was just a better made beer.  This is not overrated and was an absolute delight. 1,147 charactersrabbott2, May 14, 2016

The beer itself provides an earthy funk alongside the juicy wine-like grape character and drying tartness.  Enough fruit character to keep the beer from entering into high tartness. 274 charactersPHBoiler, Apr 04, 2016

Imagine a lighter shade of red wine, lesser than cab or merlot, but not by much.  Bright.  The head is a pink shade that foams up to a full inch.  Just sit back and look at it for a second.
Aroma was sour, big time, lemon, dark grape, oak, complex and nothing overwhelming the other.  Clean, doesn't cheese or barnyard up, but still has brett chewiness.  
A complex meld of grapes, oak, tart, sour, wheat, brett, its all here. 477 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 08, 2016

L - A brilliant shade of deep red. Like a red raspberry. A slight head attempts to form with a vigorous pour, but never fully forms and dissipated fairly quickly. 
S - A lot of funk with grape sweetness. Never understood the use of 'barnyard'  to describe the smell, but now I do. 
T - Funk overpowered by merlot grape sweetness. 
M - Not as soft as I had expected, hence the lower rating. Definitely does not detract from the beer, just had expected a softer feel. Carb was right.
O - Overall this is a really delicious beer. Vibrant, refreshing, worthwhile. I could drink it by the bucketful. 629 characterszoober911, Jan 02, 2016

A. Dark red to purple red. The first two glasses were very translucent and the last two were very cloudy. Moderately thin, not syrupy. A 2 finger fine bubble head that quickly retreats. This has low carbonation but this is not at all flat.
S. Sour yeast, bugs, grapes, and a tad bit of oak. Very straight forward.
T. Amazing. Not extremely complex, very straight forward.. A high level of tartness. The taste is sour Belgian spores, a little oak, a little dark grape, and tannins.
M. The ideal viscosity, slightly thin, not at all syrupy. Light body, low carb, highly drinkable.
O. This was very impressive. I'm not sure if the vintage added to how good this was, but this sour was on point. I love how straight forward the taste and nose were. Very well crafted and blended. This is at the top Cantillon list. Defiantly worth the effort and price. 876 charactersmacher0, Oct 09, 2015

4.52/5  rDev +2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewing this from my notes after enjoying with Mrs. LambicP as part of an anniversary celebration a couple months ago. Thanks to great BA F2brewers for hooking me up with this long-time want of mine. Enjoyed out of a green 750 mL bottle with the back label indicating it as a 2013 batch. Poured into a Duvel chalice.
Appearance (4.75) - Pours an enchantingly translucent carmine color with, appropriately, highlights (lowlights?) of merlot and burgundy. On the very edge of the glass, where the density is the lowest and the light is able to pass through the easiest, there is a swath of bright crimson. Atop the body sits a finger of effervescent head that is pinkish off-white. Retention is short-lived, receding to a smattering of bubbles around the glass and on the surface of the liquid. Minor, almost nonexistent lacing.
Smell (4.5) - Initially, the acidity offers the first salvo, rising out of the glass to bring notes of black cherry and merlot grapes to accompany a pleasant woody tannic quality. Wonderfully, the two worlds--wine and lambic--work together in a very pleasing manner. And as it warms, there is that Cantillon "house" funkiness that imparts a complex element of musty cellar.
Taste (4.5) - The taste presents a little more fruit presence, with the acidity from the aroma still present, but softer, allowing the fruity notes to present themselves in a complementary way. Still, that same funkiness and excellent barrel-toned mustiness are present to keep this firmly in the realm of lambic. Like so many Cantillons, it is sour, but not face-meltingly so like some of the up-and-coming American wild ales. There is a healthy balance of acidity and more earthy notes so that it's easy enough to take a full 750 to the dome without having to down a bottle of Tums.
Feel (4.5) Medium-bodied and moderate carbonation, with a drying finish and a nice gentle pucker on the tastebuds.
Overall (4.5), another fantastic showing from Cantillon, and while I can't say it's my favorite offering of theirs, the use of wine grapes really sets it apart and makes this a beer worth having again and again. 2,119 charactersLambicPentameter, Sep 23, 2015

It's a quite vinous offering in many facets, from the aroma and look to the taste and dry finish. A fantastic lambic. 325 charactersswanfungus, Sep 20, 2015

Macerated red grapes, sharp acetic vinegar, and the time-tested oak plus barnyard Cantillon funk on the nose. Subtle hints of mellow Merlot wine is present in the back end with a dash of lemon zest.
A sharp acetic vinous flavor (which is odd given Merlot's infamous mild and fruity character) jumps out at first, followed by the usual barnyard flavors. There's an unexpected well-rounded sweetness that balances out the tartness near the end which leaves you beckoning for another sip.
Medium-bodied with a pleasant amount of carbonation, no apparent booziness but if you share this with any wine lover (like I did) they'll be surprised that this isn't a 12-13% ABV table Merlot.
Overall yet another great grape-based lambic from Cantillon. Perhaps it's due to the characteristics of the grapes used, but the vinous qualities on display aren't as aggressive as I hoped they'd be. 942 charactersamano_h, Sep 14, 2015

This one pours a light purplish red, with a quarter inch head, and no lacing.
Smells awesome, huge grape presence, some red wine, cherries, musty basement type funk, some leather, and oak.
This is just too good. It was just perfect sitting and drinking the majority of the bottle to myself. The grape flavor is so nice, not all that sweet, but still so fruity, with some nice barnyard/basement funk, a super vinous character, wet damp oak, and some earthiness. The sourness is moderate, about a 5/10, not super overwhelming, works well with the rest of the interesting flavors.
This one has a fairly dry mouthfeel and finish, with a soft, moderate level of carbonation.
This was wonderful, and up there with the best sours I've ever had. 798 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jun 22, 2015

Pours a light purple red with a soft white one inch head. That quickly receeds into a lace. Light grape smell infront of a musky oak. Deep funk. grape is much more noticable in the taste.

4.94/5  rDev +11.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A truly world-class offering. 2014 750ML poured into Lambic Tumbler. 
The look of this beer is a bright shiny red, it is absolutely stunning, it is not like a kriek, more like bright red. The carbonation is light but present and the head is a quarter inch that dissipates rather quickly. The smell is incredibly barnyard-y, horse blanket, everything you would expect from a Cantillion offering. However, the scent of the grapes used in this Fruit Lambic are identifiable as well with a strong wine aroma with citrus. 
The taste is unquestionably balanced, with a sour surge at the beginning, and  a beautiful fruit-forward beaujolais taste that is low in tannins. The finish is dry and a gentle fruit rests on the palate. 723 charactersLightnerLiquorKS, Jun 03, 2015

750ml bottle in a basket split amongst a bunch of wine glasses at the Cantillon brewery.
Pours beet red. The color of borscht! Cork fragments in the beer. Someone needs to buy Cantillon a more effective cork puller. There is a ring of head. Smell is wine and tartness.
Taste is soft, grapey, and tart. Balanced -- very dry.
Mouthfeel is soft, velvety, with a touch of carbonation. Overall, again, very good. 421 characterssnaotheus, May 14, 2015

Appearance - Burgundy colour with a large size fizzy/frothy white head. There is an average amount of carbonation showing and there is some faint lacing. The head lasted for 3-4 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Grapes, vinegar, Lemon
Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and I can taste citric notes and grapes/cherries/currants. There is also a light vinegar flavour and a light amount of barnyard funk. It ends with tart yet fruity aftertaste.
Overall - You can really taste the quality and refinement in this beer.  It has a perfect balance and a complex taste that keeps you wanting more.  A perfect beer to pair with cheese. 717 charactersspinrsx, May 04, 2015

Appearance: pours the color of really fresh and ripe plum flesh. a finger or so of a white head with good retention and leaving behind a solid lacing. pretty hazy and almost to opaque. 
Smell: spicy red wine grapes and oak barrels, fruits from cherries to plums. slight vinegar and funk
Taste: opens with red grapes with a strong and spicy red wine character, the presence of oak red wine barrels are apparent. after the initial red wine comes lots of other fruits, mostly cherry and plum. towards the end a strong funky flavor comes in and mixes with some oak.
Mouthfeel: medium. Super funky. Slight acid. 
Overall: another killer sour by Cantillon. the amount of fruit flavor they get in the beers is amazing. also the funkiness is unlike any other breweries and they are the almost at the level of refreshing as berliners and goses 851 charactersSportsandJorts, Feb 13, 2015

Has a beautiful, vibrant color of red grapes, revealing a ruby note, and a fizzy, soon vanishing head.
Has aromas of a distinct leathery funkiness, paired with ripe grapes, pulling out their stone qualities in the best way, due to the supportive, wooden barrel. The funky barnyard tartness blends extremely well into the fermented, vinous, sour grapes. The fruitiness, as well as the wooden oakiness illustrate the acidic tartness in a very intriguing way, evoking the feeling of this being more wine than beer. 
Begins with prickly, unripe grapes among earthy, leathery malts. The grapes turn sweeter, riper as the malts stand out against the tart sourness, adding stone fruit qualities to the taste. At the same time, carried by a lively carbonation, the sourness becomes quite intense, with a vinegar note, evoked by the fermented grape sourness, while both tastes blend well together, wrapped up by the wooden barrel. Finishes with a tongue quenching, slightly dry sourness, along with lemon zest and grape pulp. The beer still reminds me in many ways of a young wine, while missing its typical sweetness, replaced by the typical lambic tartness, with a refreshing, high carbonation. 1,215 charactersaleigator, Feb 08, 2015

I was able to have a more substantial pour this time and it was just as good or better.  Pours a beautiful bright pink with a bubbly white head.  The smell and taste is funk and grape and oak.  My favorite Cantillon to date. 266 charactersWI-Beer-Man, Feb 02, 2015

L: Wonderful deep red hue with a slightly pink head. Great carb.
S: Smells like funk wine! I feel like the fruited Cantillons just work with their signature funk better than their Gueuze. It's very clean.
T: It is very similar to a carbonated wine with some clean funk. Since this is a '15, it's definitely very fruit forward and jammy.
O: Probably my favorite vintage yet. Saint Lam has always been one of my least favorite Cantillon fruits, but I really enjoyed this bottle. 554 characterscultclassic89, Dec 28, 2014

4.78/5  rDev +7.9%2009 bottle poured into a dyno glass and split amongst friends at Perennial before the SdB Release.
A - Cloudy off-redish pink color with a sizable white foam head that lingers. The liquid actually started permeating through the cork and was worried when I opened this. But the appearance was menacing.
S - This started with an off-putting nose, but once it warmed up a bit it started to shine. Nose include grape notes, oak, lemon and lactic. These smells did not come out until it warmed.
T - Taste is the best I have had from Cantillon so far. Tart notes that aren't overpowering which allow the merlot grapes shine. Really smooth and full of flavor for being 5 years old.
M - A little creamier and smoother than others maybe because of the age. But this has been hands down the best mouthfeel I've had from a Loon
O - Really glad I have a 2010 to visit soon and would love to try older vintages of this 911 charactersdrmcleod10, Aug 17, 2014

A - Pours a purplish/ruby-red colored body with a light pink/eggshell head that dissipates in seconds. 
S - Vinous, funky, acid, tartness, smashed grapes and oak. 
T - The tartness/sour aspect of the beer really plays well with the slightly sweetness of the grapes. There's an oak funkiness to it that encompasses all.
M - Light bodied and full carbonation. 
O - Very complex and well balanced with the funk, oak and grapes in this beer. 488 characterscvm4, Aug 17, 2014

Straight pour builds up a head that falls apart in seconds. The body looks like a wine with its red color.
Grapes and funk dominate the nose. Slight wet woodiness. 
Big Merlot grape flavor, sharp tartness, lingering musty funk. 
Prickly, light body, and dry.
A winner for sure. The flavor is so good. Even popped a bottle with some spaghetti bolo in Belgium cuz why not. The grape flavor is so nice. 425 charactersMattSweatshirt, Jul 22, 2014

Cantillon saint lamvinus nov 21 2012
A- Deep muddy purple pink hue with a small fizzy head that falls from one finger to nothing. I would say retention is low-minimal for the style. No lace or legs but the brew itself has a very beautiful color.
S- Fresh cantillon bug produced funk blend is strong with added Merlot grapes that are quite massive. Notes of oak, lemon, lactic and acetic, most vinous of Cantillon for me.
T- Follows the nose very closely with a massive grape vinous feel that brings stems and all. This is above the classic Cantillon funk blend, acetic and lactic, some cherry brett basement barnyard.
MF- Dried out light bodied with high end carbonation bringing some fizz to the palate but key to support the flavors. Finishes with a medium sourness not quite as high as other Cantillon. 
Vinous, Merlot grape fruit bomb with the classic Cantillon Gueuze feel. It blends together well and creates a very refreshing, hybrid style beverage between beer and wine. 1,106 characterscbutova, Jul 02, 2014

Good/great beer. I was expecting some grapes, but I didn't get much. 
Pours a nice dark beer. Little foam forms. Scent is faint, with traces of lambic, maybe berries. Taste is sour, tart. It is a smooth sour beer, not extremely acidic like most farmhouse ales. Very well executed, well balanced. Nice beer yet not over the top. Good if you are not looking for something to shock your taste buds. Cantillon after all. 424 charactersJulioH, May 28, 2014

S: Berries, red grapes left in the sun, and the almost cheesy Cantillon yeast funk.
T: Tart but not sour. Crisp and dry upfront followed by a wave of fruit that is initially more berry than grape but becomes more vinous in the finish. The aftertaste is a bold, funky rot but not nearly as unpleasant as that sounds. Again, there's a mild cheesy taste.
M: Thin and dry in the mouthfeel but bold in flavor.
O: This definitely grew on me as I made my way through the bottle. Not knowing quite what to expect I was perhaps underwhelmed or just unappreciative at first but as I drank more the balanced complexity became more apparent. Saint Lamvinus is certainly worthy of its stellar reputation. 819 characters01001111, May 16, 2014

Pours a super bright almost neon purplish pink color with a massive fizzy pink head that recedes quickly. Lots of vinegar on the aroma, berries, vinous notes, and an interesting mint leaf that I get from Geueze and Faro sometimes. Really nice. The flavor is sweet berries and wine, vinegar, sourness, some dry oaky presence, and maybe even a little vanilla. The fruit doesn't overpower here which is nice. Light bodied, spritzy carbonation, dry finish with some wine like warmth on the way down. Beautiful beer. 573 charactersBMMillsy, May 10, 2014

***1200th review on BA***
A: Pours a deep purple reddish color. Initially a tight bubbles pinkish hued head. Then somewhat still.
S: Dry oak. Chalk. Vinous.
T: Dry oak. Tannic. Fruit is there. More delicate than any American wild ale on the sour flavors.
M: Lighter highly carbonated medium 337 charactersinlimbo77, May 08, 2014

The aroma has tart red grape skins, berry notes. Some musty funk and barnyard. A good combination of red wine, fruit, oak, and funk. Reminds me slightly of the Kriek.
The flavor follows with that big tartness in the front. Tons of red grape peel and berry skin. It then follows into that funk and oak notes. 
The fruit is slightly less obvious in this. A wonderful drinking lambic. 468 charactersdar482, Jan 22, 2014

2010 vintage.
Pours a hazy orange-red with a foamy off-white head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace slowly drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is sour with malt, grain, grape, fruit, funk, and acidic aromas. Taste is much the same with sour grain, grape, and fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of acidity on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp and dry mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is quite sour but refreshing to drink. 617 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jan 06, 2014

12/12/13 – Served in a Duvel tulip glass
A: Pours a sparkling cranberry body with some pinkish and purple tones to it. Light murkiness to the beer. Good half finger width or so of sudsy froth. Khaki soap look with some very active carbonation and light swaths of lace sticking to the glass.
S: Smells primarily of lightly soured red grape skins with a soft backing of tart raspberry. Vinous and mildly acidic with some balsamic notes. Musky earth and oak rounds out the nose. Not incredibly potent but has a nice red wine quality to it. 
T: Red grape and wild berry come together much like a Rosado wine. Raspberry permeates throughout complimented by a nice puckering tartness. Fairly sour yet balanced with a modest amount of acidity. The approach is pretty flawless. No vinegar bomb here. The beer is very light and dried out by some oaky tannins. Touch of lactic funkiness there with some earthy mineral water. Nothing I would call barnyard or horsey. Any alcohol flavor is completely masked. Impressively crafted. Delicate and light with an aggressive tart and sour quality. 
M: Very light in body with a high amount of spritzy carbonation on the palate. Fair amount of puckering tang. Light astringency and very dry with a nice crisp at the finish.
D: I don’t have a ton of experience with Lambics at this point but this is one is undeniably superior. Has a natural soda feel with a great balance of flavors. Delicate yet tart and mildly sour. Unlike any beer I have had before. 
A real treat and one that I will only come to appreciate more with time. 1,669 charactersNugganooch, Jan 02, 2014

Pours a beautiful garnet hue with an effervescent,white head that quickly dissipates. Nose is somewhat subdued - tart, suggestions of cork and acetic acid. Taste is a bit musty with grape skins, cranberry and tannins. Mouthfeel is light-medium in body with a carbonation just shy of lively and a dry finish. Overall, not my favorite offering from Cantillon (I anticipated a little more fruit); however, a wonderful lambic nonetheless. 513 charactersJwale73, Nov 24, 2013

A- Pours a hazy, raspberry colored body with a 2 finger, fizzy, light cherry colored head that reduces really quickly and leaves no lacing or retention. 
S- Tart sour grapes, funky barnyard, red wine, cherries, citric acid, acetic acid, oak, and an old mustiness that blends very nicely with these aromas. 
T- Starts off pretty tart, but not sour, with dry fruity notes, specifically grapes, cherry skins, and citrus rind. The follow through is subtly funky with fermented fruit and oak, wine barrel notes. The finish is woody and tart. Very nice
M- High carbonation, refreshing and quenching. 
St. Lamvinus was awesome but I wasn't expecting anything less of this Cantillon masterpiece. Glad I got to try it, can't wait to try the other one in my cellar in a couple decades ;) 934 charactersgcamparone, Nov 10, 2013

Aroma is of fruit and funk. Not incredibly complicated and it is very acetic in aroma.
The beer has notes of grapes and fruit. It is very effervescent and it tickles your tongue.
Mouthfeel is typical for a sour beer.
Overall a tasty beer, the acidity is sharp and like vinegar and the funk really increases as it warms. Crisp, Acidic, Fruity, Brite. 454 charactersLeeryLeprechaun, Oct 27, 2013

A - Bright red with a burgundy red color. Clear warm body that looks like liquor. White head that sits on the edges 
S - Tart lambic with gueuze like sourness, light blue cheese funk, red wine, tannis, and grape skins
T - Tart lemon peel and lambic up front. Blue cheese, funk and really light red wine presence in the middle. Tart cherry near the back end with war head tartness and light oak to it
M - Tart with a dry finish to it with a slight juiciness from the wine.
O - This is another solid lambic from Cantillon but it's not my favorite one. The wine is there and add some nice presence but it is a bit overdrawn but the tartness and is lacking on the funk. All of that said it is still great just not one of my favorite. 746 charactersjeonseh, Oct 20, 2013

What awesome timing, having a grape-imbued lambic while standing next to a wine connoisseur. Regardless, this stuff pours a lightly-hazy fuchsia topped by over a finger of pink-ish foam. The nose comprises tart blue raspberry, light sour cherry, sour grape, a hint of grapefruit zest, and a light smattering of funk. The taste brings in more of the same, with everything showing off some powerful sour chops. This is kept in partial check, though, by the funk, which, though relatively mild in its individual expression, also blends in nicely with its acidic surroundings. The grape character is pronounced, but not overt. The body is a light-leaning medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, sticky finish. Overall, another damn fine fruited lambic from Cantillon, one of the highlights of a night that included quite a few ridiculous sours of various styles. And I'm happy to say that the aforementioned wine aficionado was also impressed by this offering. I was not surprised. 1,012 charactersTMoney2591, Sep 28, 2013

Vintage 2010.
Poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: medium purple bodied beer with a reddish hue. 2 fingers of white head with a purplish tint. Drops down to a a thin cap and eventually no head.
Smell: Mildly tart grapes. Moderately funky and its that trademark cantillion funk. Simple yet awesome nose on this beer!
Taste: Funk forward with a mild almost moderate sourness. I would say about a 3.75 - 4 out of 10. Nice red grape flavor without tasting like a wine. I think that the beer has just the right ratio of funkiness to fruity flavors of red grapes. Very nice!
Mouthfeel: On the high end of a light bodied beer; almost medium bodied. Carbonation is on the low end of moderate. Really smooth drinking sour. Just a touch on dryness that right where it should be.
Overall: This is the probably the best grape sour that I have drank. I was very pleasantly surprised by this beer. 934 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Sep 21, 2013

A - moderate deep raspberry-juice pink, effervescent head.
S - tart, funk
T - really quite sour and puckering on first taste, but once the taste buds settled. back into Cantillon-std sourness. Then add hints of tinned raspberries (without their sweetness) into a complex vinous palate.
M - lively, zesty, refreshing.
O - yep, another great Cantillon. Difficult to write about these, similar in so many ways. And I know the bottle states serve warmer, but I prefer colder... 537 charactersheygeebee, Sep 15, 2013

Deep solid cherry colored body, orb glowing, with a little hint of pink throughout. Slight pink collar and thin ring presented. Looks like a jewel.
Fantastic bouquet on the beer. Great notes of light sweetness of cherry, bright funk and dry peppery action. Good chewy sense of malt (wheat?), subtle and balanced, with a nice effervescent and clean quality. This looks like something good.
Palate comes with a great champagne crispness but a decent malt depth to carry forward. Carbonated pepper and mild sourness. Tart fruit action of red raspberry and cherry, with subtle aromatics. Tastes like dusted funky fruit in a bowl, and champagne. 
Overall a subtle yeast funk character and chewy texture to match with floating funky red fruit in a champagne glass. But it's beer. It's a winner and one of the most enjoyable Cantillon beers I've had. 908 characterssmakawhat, Sep 15, 2013

A - Opaque medium purplish-red colour with one finger of raspberry red head.
S - Sour/vinegar notes with grape and oak.
T - Tart and slightly sour. A very light vinegar-like sourness. A big grape musk flavour is present, as expected and some oak/woody notes add another layer of complexity.

Color: Brickish Ruby

2012 bottling (bottle date is 11/21/12, ABV is 5%)
Pour is magenta red that gets darker and murkier with each pour. Pink head becomes a thick ring. Nice colors.
Smell is great, berry and red grape is somewhat tame but there at a good and noticeable level. Lemon, feety funk and oak, nice mixture overall.
The fruit in the taste is lighter, but mostly gives off notes of tart red and green grapes and lemons. Funk, farmy earthiness, farm and oak are a bit more powerful but it is all kept at a nicely subtle level, making this more easy-drinking than your average Cantillon.
Smooth and well-carbonated, nice amount of puckering tartness while still remaining very drinkable.
The first time I had this I wasn't as impressed, it comes off as maybe a bit too subtle, but this really is one of better Cantillons I've had. Love the drinkability and the fruit/funk balance. 933 charactersChico1985, Aug 23, 2013

4.53/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Kevin R for bringing this to our tasting - Cantillon is always a treat. Saint Lamvinus pours like a garden of rubies with indigo hints. Good clarity all around, with a pink tinted head that makes no attempt to be quiet as it fizzles and eventually fades into nothing put a lavender collar around the crimson brew.
Cantillon's brewery is crawling with critters and they are some of the best critters in the world. You can pick these critters out of any line-up if you have even a semi-functional nose. Funky barnyard, musky cork, sweaty articles of expensive clothing, and a trifecta of dirt, earth, and must. Often imitated, never duplicated - no one does funk like this.
Vinous are present as well, like this was a well aged Cheval Blanc; dripping-wet oak barrels, sour grapes, wine-like acidity, and hints of vinegar in the back end. Grape, tannin, grape, tannin, sour, sour, funky, funky. The nose on this is simply beautiful; As with most Cantillon, I'm having a hard time getting my nose away from the glass long enough to take a sip.
One sip and Cantillon drops it heavy like Saint Lamvinus was Skrillex and grapes were the bass. Boom! A vinous explosion on the palate; tart, sour grapes, mild and bitter acidity, faint cherry skins, heaps of woody oak, and the funk of one thousand barnyard floors. Horse, cork, hay, sweaty feet, and grapes like you wouldn't believe.
Saint Lamvinus masters the art of making a beer that resembles a wine while keeping it accessible to people (like myself) who actually are not big fans of wine. It's that mouth clenching, ass puckering sourness, that stomach ripping acidity, and that nostril curling funk. Effervescence is big; plenty of carbonation with a fading, ghostly mouth feel and a sharp, dry finish.
Cantillon does it again, and I can't say that I'm surprised. These are the beers you hear about when you first start getting into craft beer. All your buds talk about this "Cantillon" place like it's some kind of holy grail for beer, and eventually months and months go by and you finally get to try one, and all of a sudden you're talking about it like you're some kind of sour expert. This shit is excellent; why does it have to be so far from me? 2,220 characterstectactoe, Jul 18, 2013

Crimson red with good clarity. Left the bottom third in the glass.
Musty grape and grape must with a high note of tartness, funky Brett-y-ness, and vinous notes. So ripe, yet tart. Unreal complexity. Oak, lemon rind, wet hay, and sweaty sock.
Super-serious. Sour, but not rifingly so. A bounty of red wine grape, lemon peel, stale bread heel, black currant, wet hay, and a finish of perky spice and wet sock funk. So palatably delicious and somewhat smooth and held together. So refined. Musty and funky and sour. Great feel from the carbonation, which isn't too much. So good.

I'm going to be honest, I'm not great at describing beers. But this one is amazing. It's one of my all time favorite beers. My absolute favorite in its style. If you're familiar with Cantillon, think the Zwanze, but more red wine, particularly a right bank Bordeaux, than white wine. Perhaps the reason I love this so much is that it is a perfect blend of Bordeaux and lambic. I've had almost every kind of Cantillon beer and loved them all. They are fantastic in different ways. But this is the one they really got right.
One hell of a beer, especially if you moonlight as wine snob. 638 charactersDreizhen, Jul 09, 2013

From a 750 into a wine glass
Bottled 21 November 2012
Lambic with merlot grapes
APPEARANCE: Pours a one finger, looser, fizzy, pinkish-white head with decent retention. Head fades to a ring and wisp. A dark red, carmine color with lots of active carbonation. A ring remains but leaves no real lacing down the glass. Really fizzy head, but the color is quite beautiful. 
SMELL: Some grapes on the nose, with tart lemon, funky notes, oak, and some light acidity. A touch of vinegar. Nice stuff. 
TASTE: Grape sweetness and tart lemon sourness up front, with oak and some acidity at the swallow. Bold finish is sour with sweet grapes adding some balance. Lemon tartness, oak, some acidity and light vinegar notes linger nicely. Enjoyable for sure. 
PALATE: Medium-light body with medium carbonation for the style. Not quite creamy enough, goes down slightly coarse and finishes dry and puckering. Tart acidity lingers. 
OVERALL: This was alright, but the feel kept it from being all it could be. The nose was enticing and there were good flavors in there as well, but a creamier and smoother feel would have helped this be top class. Still, an enjoyale fruit lambic worth checking out for sure. Cheers! 1,246 charactersJeffo, Jul 06, 2013
4.69/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.7575cl bottle of the recent 2012 vintage purchased at Brasserie Cantillon for on-premise consumption in Cantillon taster glasses, 7/4/2013.
Aroma: Very sour and acidic, light scents of grape sweetness complemented by a nice but not quite too heavy earthy funk. There is a nice oak hue in the background as well. It makes me think of a sour red wine. Drinking this at the brewery I think makes for a nice complementary effect as that distinctive "Cantillon funk" smell is reflected very well here.
Colour: Darker ruby red body, but not quite as dark red as a merlot would be. Pours with a light pink head that persists throughout the course of the bottle. Not much lacing. Swirls like a nice red wine.
Flavour: Absolutely perfect in my limited opinion. So much earthy funk especially at the beginning and the end. Acidic sourness, oak tannins and a moderately residual grape sweetness are all there and never go away such that by the end, it blends into a deliciously sour-but-sweet complexity that one comes to expect from grapes in general. So enjoyably interesting and complex, like a well-carbonated Bordeaux even.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, strong carbonation. Acidic but does not leave a particularly dry finish. A refreshing lambic that leaves my mouth tingling with sour funk on the back end. So easy to drink, which made me sad when we got to the end of the bottle.
Overall: This is as good as it got for my experience at Brasserie Cantillon. Having already tried the regular lineup, LPK and LPF, this one is my absolute favorite. There are characteristics of a tasty red wine here for sure, yet it tastes like a great lambic beer with the carbonation of champagne. It's just an awesome brew that I would recommend to anyone with the opportunity to purchase a bottle. If I get more of these, they are going into the cellar to be cracked on special occasions. 1,868 charactersStevedore, Jul 04, 2013

S: Quite funky and sour/tart up front along with a light sweetness from the grapes. Also get quite a bit of oakiness and earthiness
T: Starts off with a big blast of funk and sourness and then goes into the oakiness and woody/earthy flavors. Get some tannins in there as a result. The merlot grapes come through in the background throughout the entirety of tasting, providing a hint of sweetness. Finishes lightly sweet with a lingering funk
M: Medium bodied with moderate-high carbonation. Very acidic
O: Wow. What a brew. This blend is absolutely fantastic, especially with the nearly 2 years on the bottle. I suppose the funkiness has developed a bit (this one really opens up with a blast of funk/sour/tart) and the oak has also shown up more. Quite pricey (I paid $30 for a 750 mL bottle) but well worth the investment. This is a must-try 998 charactersBEERMILER12, Jul 04, 2013
4.27/5  rDev -3.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The colour is red, dark with a head that is light pink. The head disappear quickly. The beer is lightly effervescent. The aroma is funky, so good. It reminds me of the brewery... I feel like I'm at the brewery! This is typical Cantillon smell. The raisins are faint 'tho... or its too dominated by the funky... maybe its me that is overwhelmed by it... its so good. On the taste, its sour. A good sour. Love it. It start with some fruits and then it switch to the sourness.
Once the beer gets warmer, I get the raisins by some wines typical aroma. So easy to drink. This is an awesome beer! 591 charactersZorPrime, Jul 03, 2013

This pours a beautiful ruby red color with pink foaming. There’s a tart aroma, light and dry, which gets sweeter as it warms. It has a pleasing, rounded tartness. I keep tasting cherries, with a touch of a funky undertone. This was incredible, a real treat to try. 300 characterselNopalero, Jun 02, 2013

Appearance: Looks like a framboise. Appearance could not be better from my eyes. Ruby/pink hue amazing color with decent amount of carbonation. Appearance was my fav part of this, but I need to age the other '12 for 3-4 years to max out the taste. 
Smell: Grapes, slight acidity detected. Barnyard funk. Hay, really deep smell to this one. Had Blabaer yesterday, and I can tell this beer is going to be a contender. 
Taste: Lacing draws into your mouth followed by merlot grapes, a lot of earthy qualities to this beer. 
Mouthfeel: First thing noticed was the carb lacing, followed with the smoothness of this beer. Very enjoyable. The presence of the lacing definitely plays a factor in '12 bottle. 
Overall: I am really enjoying this one. As far as Cantillon, Saint Lam and Blabaer now are past Fou Foune for me. Saint Lam is artfully crafted, even more than Blabaer IMO. The balance of this lambic is intense. Opened DDG today too, and Saint Lam is more enjoyable by far for me. Can't wait to open the '08 for my brother's 40th!!! 1,095 charactersgueuzedreg, Jun 01, 2013

Score: 96
Bottled 10/18/11. Served in a Goose Island Chicago flag snifter and enjoyed on 03/04/13. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Pours a rose color with just under a finger of pink-white (faintly pink) head that totally settles. No lacing or retention, but gorgeous color. 4.25/5
Smell: Funky sweet-but-tart red grape is apparent off the pour. Has plum notes akin Slivovitz without the harsh booziness. Strawy grass, vinegar and a little lemon. Some raspberry towards back of nose as it warms up. Classic "Cantillon dust" too. Tangy acidicty apparent on nose. 4.5/5
Taste: Super tart red grape, raspberry, and sour dark berry flavor. Oak, zesty citrus and a little funky grassiness. There is a prevalent underlying funkiness that grows as the beer warms. That traditional "dusty" Cantillon flavor that is in nearly all of their sours is present too. Some lacto too. This bottle was a little heavier on the lacto character than others I have had, imparting some greek yogurt flavor. Maybe this is storage related? Has a sharp acidity in conjunction with the tartness, but not in a bad way. The acidity really complements the tartness well and gives the beer a little extra bite that dries out the gums. The finish is tart berry/red grape followed by residual lacto funk once the berry flavors fades. Nice and boldly flavorful. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Not quite medium bodied with a low level of carbonation. Has a high level of acidity and tartness. Imparts a dry, but not chalky finish. Finishes like consuming a less tart warhead candy. 5/5
Overall: Delectably sour. This is one of Cantillon's better beers. It is as good as Blaeber (although not as good as Fou Foune or Lou Pepe Kriek/Framboise in my opinion), but a fraction as "rare." Seek this one out with confidence. Wine connoisseurs should appreciate this one.
Cost: $35 for a 750 ml bottle. 2,003 charactersjegross2, May 02, 2013

A: Pours a vibrant red, with deeper purples mixed throughout. There is only a tiny bit of light-pink head that fades quickly.
S: The nose is red wine funk, mild grape skin, slight blackberry sweetness, and funk. It smells great.
T: The beer starts out with a good bit of wine and grape character. It's sweet yet sour. It's clean, yet funky. As the beer moves to the back end I get a a bit more lingering sourness and a touch of yeast. Really solid.
M: Medium bodied beer. It hit the palate hard, but transitions off nicely. It's tart and slightly bitter. It's drying in the back end.
O: Another excellent beer. I have through the roof to have been about to try this beer. I hope I'll have another chance to try it again in the future. 821 characterstrxxpaxxs, Apr 29, 2013

Acquired via online purchase!
Bright, slightly murky crimson and violet. Thin head of off-white/near pink. Spots of stick down the glass. Pretty
Lots more funk, grass, and barnyard in the aroma than compared to the flavor. Dried hay and grass, juicy berry and plump grape notes, and a bit of dank basement.
The flavor is more vibrant and fruit forward than the aroma. Lots of lactic sour presence, good, juicy, and earthy grape flavors, along with some of the musty basement character found in the aroma.
Medium bodied with moderate carbonation.
Fantastic, and exceptionally drinkable! 605 charactersehammond1, Apr 25, 2013

Pours a dark blood orange flesh color with a white head with tight lacing and bubbles. Cloudy fluid. 
The smell is quite complex with super fruit and lactic sourness. Lush oak richness. 
Taste is superbly balanced between sweet fruitiness and sourness. Full oak tannins create a puckering. 
Medium high carbonation and silky mouthfeel.
Overall, this is excellent lambing style. 428 charactersahalloin, Apr 13, 2013
4.6/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Body color is a translucent brownish garnet, pours with a good head that quickly dissipates to a ring. No lacing. 
Nose is classic Cantillon notes of old wood, spice, brett band-aid, fruit, and other funk. 
Tastes deliciously sour with tart red grapes, green apples and lemon with a wheat malt backbone and malt sugar balance. This one has been aged 4 years since it was bottled in 2008, so it may have lost some fresh grape taste, but it is still tasting delightfully sour and grapey. Finishes dry and lightly spicy with wood and grape tannins. 
Body is light and carbonation soon evaporates, providing a flat tart mouthfeel typical of lambics. 
Overall, this is a delicious drinking lambic beer. The addition of merlot grapes crosses into wine territory and thereby invites comparison to wine. As it gets flat in the glass, it starts to look like a rosé wine. But the main impression I get is the strong presence of brett, considered an infection by wine makers, but welcomed by lambic makers. No place to sort all that out here, but this is an excellent complex sour beer to sip while pondering the commonalities and differences between lambic beers and wine. 1,167 charactersBeerenauslese, Apr 12, 2013

A: Pours a brilliant, pinkish red with a finger of white-pink head. Excellent ring of retention which lasts the entire glass. Not much lacing to speak of.
S: Super funky barnyard notes with hints of oak, vanilla, raspberry, and cherry. Some of the funk recedes as the beer warms.
T: Raspberry, strawberry, tannic oak, a very nice moderate sourness, with a long, sour-warhead-like finish with slight sweetness and red wine. 
M: Medium body and carbonation with a creamy texture.
O: Exceedingly drinkable, the sourness is balanced with the fruit nicely. Oak and merlot grape flavors/aromas are much subtler than I was expecting. 658 characterspmarlowe, Mar 31, 2013

A: dull, oxidized purple color. Forms a small, faintly purple tinted whitish head. Little retention. No lacing. 
S: bright and acidic with strong grape skin notes. Smells like a fermented Concorde grape juice. 
T: taste is similar, that is it tastes like fermented Concorde grape juice. Vinous, but distinct from wine itself. Moderately tart, mildly acidic, grapy tannins. Getting a lot of grape skins. Finishes with a mild astringency. 
M: medium bodied, tart, mild astringency.

T:wow this is where this bee really takes the cake it is sweet sour and tart up front there is lot of fruit flavor of grapes and green apple it lasts all throughout the finish which is also very sweet

Taste: Lemon acidity, grape skin, oak, more barnyard funk, creamy lactic sourness, green apple. Sourness is medium.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied. Medium/low carbonation. Dry finish.

The mouthfeel is very tart and dry.

A-Pours hazy brilliant red of shade with a tight, thin white head. Head quickly dissipates and doesn’t leave any lacing. 
S-Nose is grape, oak, some band aid (this might be because I didn’t wash my glass from the last beer), lemon, and must. 
T-The flavor is where Lamnivus shines. It’s balance between the lemon and grape is superb, they complement each other perfectly. In addition, Lamnivus has some nice mineral characters as well as a good amount of must. 
M-Light mouthfeel, moderate acidity, prickly carbonation, and a nice enduring finish. 
O-One of the best fruit lambics around, I’m hard pressed to name many I would take over this. Really wish bottles weren’t so hard to come by. 750 charactersTnudish, Feb 17, 2013

Poured into a tulip glass from a 750ml bottle.
Best before: 12/2012
Pours a nice deep purple/pinkish color with a nice very light pink colored head. (4.0)
Aroma is delicious. Chalky yeast notes with some good fruit tartness. There are some great vinous notes. Wine, wine and more wine notes with some oak in the nose. (4.5)
There are some slight Chardonnay acidity to the brew with some deeper berry notes from the deeper red grapes. I’m not sure what grapes they use but I can pick up on those flavors. Some nice tart berry notes with some good woody notes are present with the great dry fruit tartness. This is a pretty tart lambic but with the addition of grapes there are some slight sugary sweet notes in the background. Mouthfeel is light and crisp with an extremely dry finish. (4.5)(4.0)
Very good lambic. Great vinous notes with tartness and dry tannins. (4.5) 901 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jan 01, 2013

Cranberry-tawny-colored pour, slightly hazy, with a minimal, fizzy head. Musty fruit aroma, grass, hints of acetic acid. "Something tells me it'll be sour." Pretty tart on the tongue, strong flavors of grape and apple skin, thin wine, horseblankety, but not overblown in that aspect, grassy and very dry; the intensity of the fruit tartness overthrew any acetic notes that might have been present, giving a good sense of balance. Medium body, again, crisp and very dry, a bit puckering, low to moderate carbonation, overall texture comparable to chewing on grape or apple skin. Pretty one-dimensional, but delivered what was expected. Not bad overall, and a good one to break open every once in a while. 733 charactersRifugium, Dec 13, 2012

Fizzy purple body is dark and ominous, supporting a thin layer of protective off-white head. Acetic fruits and bright, spritzy yeast dance among my nostrils. The marriage between soured grapes and oaky red wine barrels is perfect. Finishes clean and dry with just the right amount of puckering tartness.
We opened an '06 alongside this fresh pour and were surprised how vastly different the two were. This metamorphosis is unlike any other aged Cantillon I've tried: the other fruit lambics still typically retain some fruity characteristics as they age, but the grapes are totally gone in this bottle of Lamvinus. It's instead transformed into a cheesy, super funky, gueuze-like lambic with grassy, farmyard funk and high acidity. The color has even faded to a more amber color compared to the deep purple of the original.
Both are absolutely delicious; still hard to believe how wildly different they are. 950 charactersbrystmar, Dec 03, 2012

Pours smooth into a tulip, thin head develops as it pours and aerates. lacing quickly runs to the edges of the glass before disappearing completely. Beautiful red/pink color, appears clear until it accumulates, and becomes opaque.
Classic Cantillon smell, starts fruity and juicy before overwhelming barnyard funk overtakes it. Almost smells rotten. I love it.
Fruity and oak, dry champagne type of alcohol taste, not cloying at all but the natural grapes add a bit of natural sweetness. Sourness creeps in and overtakes the sweetness.
So totally smooth and crispy on the finish, coats the whole mouth with a puckering sense throughout. The longer between sips, the more I want.
Great beer. 745 charactersdasmusik, Nov 22, 2012

Taste is grape skin tannins, sweeter Merlot grapes, citrus tartness, lactic raspberry, sharply citric, tart blueberry and strawberry come to mind. High carbonation, effervescent mouthfeel. Full on yogurty lactic. 2010 and 2011 bottles are so good right now. One of my favorites. 570 characterstarheels86, Nov 13, 2012

Ruby red (almost plum) colored body with a thin cap full of tiny bubbles. Musty red wine grapes, barnyard, soft oak, lightly aged cheese, and lactic tartness. At first the nose seems real straightforward, but as you keep diving in, more layers reveal themselves. On the palate, sweet yet tart red grapes up front, with a mustiness coming out mid-palate. Barnyard notes through the middle with some oak before a final rush of cherries and grapes. The finish is crisp and dry. A long lingering tartness in the finish. The body is on the light side of medium with perfect carbonation. This lambic is a great bridge beer for the wine drinker. Loads of wine grape flavor with a moderate tartness. This could easily win over some wine drinkers. I found this to be delicious. The flavors are bold, and really release off the palate quickly to reveal this lingering tartness that satisfies the sour cravings. 946 charactersColForbinBC, Oct 19, 2012

750mL bottle poured into a snifter
Date smeared, but I believe it says October 2011
Thanks to RuckusDu for sending this one over in a trade.
A: Pours a hazy dark ruby red with 1/2 fingers width of light pink head, which is fizzy, dissipates away very quickly and leaves no appreciable lacing.  4
S: Smell is quiet funky, with a big tart presence as well.  Besides the huge barnyard funk, the accompanying sours characters include notes of sour grape, lemon, and sour cherry.  4.5
T: Much more tart than even the nose implies.  A wonderful degree of sourness!  Lemon-lime, sour apple, sweet cherry notes on the finish, the faintest hint of oak,  and a touch of a sea salt character. Awesome.  Not as many red grape characters as I anticipated, but great none the less.  I can't emphasize enough how sour this is, and I love it.  5
M/D: Puckering sourness, light body, and heavy carbonation come together to give an absolutely delightful, vibrant mouthfeel.  Crisp, refreshing, and high drinkability.  4.5
O: Overall, this was my first Cantillon experience and it was a treat.  Great degree of sourness, with enough other characters, notably barnyard funk, to keep it from being one dimensional. Very well done.  I highly recommend and would drink this again any chance I got.  4.5
Note:  I was a little concerned as when I received this from the shipping trade, it had clearly had some leakage with some beer seeping out and coating the outside of the bottle, even with the cork and cap.  When I opened it up a couple weeks later there was some fluid in between the cork and top of cap, and the cork was soaked through.  I was afraid it was going to be a flat mess or have some other unappealing character as a result.  Luckily it did not, so just a heads up if that happens to anyone else, dont fret!  Your nectar of the gods is likely just fine! 1,897 characterszac16125, Sep 08, 2012

A-Poured a beautiful, light claret color. Almost plum colored. Complex and very vinous looking. Not much carbonation or head to speak off. A little collar of white head hangs around.
S-Tart cherries and dark, supple fruit. A touch of vanilla and oak...again, quite vinous. A little funk, but not a ton that I could detect. No alcohol smells. 
T-Pleasantly tart, but really well balanced. The fruit flavors are concentrated and complex. I picked up cherries, green apples, and red wine flavors with a touch of oak. Not particularly funky or alcoholic.
M-Prickly carbonation, but beautifully balanced. Pretty dry from start to finish.
O-Really enjoyable. One of my favorite beers ever and easily my favorite of the style so far. 782 charactersspoony, Sep 05, 2012

A: Light ruby body with a large light pink head, which recedes to nothing quickly.
S: Horseblanket, fruit-laced tartness, a bit of cheese. Soft oak rounds it out. A fruity, acidic aroma comes out as it wamrs. Very funky.
T: Lots of woody funk and tartness. Gamey, tart wild berry. Soft grape sweetness comes out as it warms, integrating very smoothly with the lactic sourness in a juicy way. Very dry and sour, with the grapes offering the slightest bit of balancing sweetness.
M: Light with tingly carbonation.
O: This beer is very funky and sour, and therefore one must devote one's full attention to the grapes to see what they're doing here - adding depth without distracting from the intense character of the base beer. 764 charactersEtan, Aug 25, 2012

4.77/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52007 bottle enjoyed on 8/4/12 at Monk's Cafe in Philly. Served in a Cantillon stem.
Pour: Cloudy deel grapefruit (maybe close to ruby) with a finger of pink fizz that dissipates quickly.
Smell: White grapes and pear command the nose, with a light barnyard funk in the background. Funk is not substantial. 
Taste: Wow. White wine tartness, green apples, pear. All the fruit provides a fantastic crisp tartness. Barnyard funk is there but again, not strong. Little bit of tart cherry in the back. Tart pear and grape coats the palate.
Mouthfeel: Carbonation is fantastic still. Very refreshing and I could drink this all day.
Overall: An amazing treat. Fantastically delicious. I hope to get a bottle of this one day for sure. 729 characterscfrances33, Aug 05, 2012

A: reddish dark pink body with one finger head. Lots of bubbles
S: brett, citrous, oak. That's about it.

4.14/5  rDev -6.5%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750 mL bottle poured into a tulip. Bottle dated 11/21/2010, I believe. Tough to read as it's smudged.
Appearance - Murky/hazy pinkish purple. Not quite a burgundy. The head is gone before I even get a chance to look at it.
Smell - Acidic and musty grape smell. The fruit isn't a bright aroma, but rather a general aura of grape surrounding the lemongrass and other lambic aromas.
Taste - Sour, but not overly so. The grape flavor again isn't bright, but more of a background flavor cutting some of the acidity. Oak and tannins dry it out in the finish, but there's a deep musty character in the finish that comes across as a deep barnyard funk.
Mouthfeel - Heavyish, even though it really isn't. Lower carbonation. Drinks like a wine.
Overall - Not the most amazing fruit flavor I've had in a lambic, but it certainly doesn't detract from the beer. I feel as though the Cantillon lambic profile calls for lighter fruits, a la Fou Foune. 941 charactersAlieniloquium, Jul 26, 2012
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52011 vintage, 750ml bottle. Poured into a Lost Abbey Stemmed glass.
Pours a nice dark red hue, very reminiscent of red grapes and red wine, not unexpected after the barrel treatment. A nice off white head with hints of red races up the glass, definitely a lively beer, but recedes quickly and leaves behind no lacing. Immediately after the cork popped out, the air smelled of old toenails, in the best way possible. Once in the glass, huge notes of funk, musky grapes, wine, yeast, tannin, leather and more funk. The flavors mirror the nose, funk, cheese, horseblanket, call it what you want, its there in full force, lots of dark grapes, acetic acid, vinegar, wine, leather, plum, apple, massively complex and extremely intriguing. The body is spot on, super lively and crisp, effervescent, dances around in your mouth without being overly prickly, finishes juicy and is so damn drinkable.
Verdict: Far and away one of my favorite Cantillons. We drank this side by side with Vigneronne and Bruocsella and it was by far the winner. This might be bested only by Fou' Foune right now as my favorite loon, definitely one to seek out and enjoy with friends. 1,155 characterskevanb, Jul 26, 2012

A: Poured a hazy reddish/purple with a small pink-hued head on top that reduced quickly leaving a thin cap on top. Minimal lacing. 
S: Lots of dark red stone fruits, some grapes and a little cherry. Very tannic, with some wood and a definite sour/tartness. 
T: Fantastic level of sourness/tartness on the flavor profile. There is a bit of funk, but the acidity kind of cuts it. There is plenty more red grape, cherry, and red wine like flavors. 
M: Medium bodied with active carbonation, pretty much spot on. 
O: Extremely impressed with this lambic. Wasn't sure how I would like it compared to others I have had, but St. Lamvinus is outstanding. 708 charactersmdaschaf, Jul 23, 2012

Served into a tulip
A: Hazy ruby red with some purple and pinkish hues throughout the body. A small rocky and a bit fizzy soft pink head formed, but quickly dissipated into a thin cap. Minor, almost no, lacing present.
S: Huge fresh grapes, lots of tannins, ripe red fruits, cherry and red grape notes are over the top. The acidic and sour component is noticeable straight away, along with a musky funk.
T: Sour and funky up front with plenty of fruits coming through. More red grapes and sweet cherry, fresh oak and a nice dry red wine character. The tannins from the skins stand out leaving this well rounded and delicious.
M: Highly carbonated, bubbly and fizzy on the palate. Despite the lack of "pop" from the cork, this is classic Cantillon in its carbonation.
This was awesome, perhaps one of my favorite Cantillon beers to date. The grapes and red fruit flavor were a perfect match for the sour and funk that is all things Cantillon. 959 charactersShanePB, Jul 13, 2012

4.17/5  rDev -5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Beautiful pour. A light, clear purple, with a slightly rosy head that reduces nicely, leaving a bubbly film on top.
Smell is a mix of grape, merlot, and pretty strong barnyard funk, kind of haylike, and maybe a slight, slight hint of a manure-like smell? That makes it sound unpleasant, but it actually wasn't. What was a little disappointing was how sweet the grape smell was. Kind of reminded me of the over-sweetened grape juice I drank as a kid. Overall a nice smell, but the sweetness definitely loses it points.
Taste is much better. The barnyard character is toned down a bit, and the grape isn't as sweet. What sweetness there is balances the tartness nicely.There's some oak, some wine flavors, some tart red grape, a bit of the barnyard hay flavors, maybe a hint of lemon. Really excellent.
I've loved the mouthfeel on all cantillon beers so far, and this is no exception. On the lighter side of medium, dry, great carbonation, super smooth. What a delight.
Excellent beer. The smell is the weak point and it's still great, and the taste is just wonderful. Great balance of sweetness and tartness, with a healthy dose of funk. Very drinkable, great with friends. 1,176 charactersrodkin, Jun 28, 2012
4.22/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52009 bottle.
Beer is dark pink, somewhat reddish. A small amount of pinkish head fades quickly.
Most immediate smells are yeast and barnyard funk. Tart, rich red grapes right after. Quite a deep fruit smell. Nice malty backbone, some wheat.
Tart red grape in the taste, quite sour. Funky, a barnyard aspect running through which picks up most in the finish. A sweet, sugary flavour is there but drowned out by the sour. Not super complex but very good.
Light bodied, highly carbonated. A bit fizzy.
Overall, very good. Not the best Cantillon I have had but certainly really enjoyable. 589 charactersjrenihan, Jun 28, 2012

4/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 vintage. This one pours a lighter bodied dark cranberry red in color with a one finger slightly pink head. The nose is dry and musty with a nice amount of funk and acidity. The flavors are dry and tart and it has nice acidity. As a wine drinker, I must say that this has zero characteristics of a Merlot so it's nice to see the difference between the beer and wine. This one is musty as hell. It drinks light with nice acidity but I can't really like the flavor. It doesn't have enough fruit character for my liking. This is the best vintage I've had so far. The '07 smells like puppy farts in my opinion, as in "I just fed my dog too many rawhides" puppy farts. I definitely prefer this vintage to that one. 713 charactersaasher, Jun 19, 2012

Vinegar tang, grape skin, some lemon rind, a slight bit of funk and balsamic bite to end.

A- Pours a bright burgundy color, very slightly hazy, produces a thin white head that leaves little lacing. 
S- Big fruity tartness (cherry, apple, pear) layered over a nice yeasty funk of hay and must. Also very noticeable merlot and oak aromas.
T- Not as wine-dominant as I expected, the merlot seems to blend very nicely with sour fruit flavors, lots of cherry and grape-skin. Tartness is firm and balanced, has flavors of hay, light funk and wood.
M- Light-bodied, very smooth feel, just the right amount of carbonation, has an extremely dry finish.
O- A delicious beer, definitely one of my favorites from Cantillon, complex yet highly drinkable. 750 charactersWillCarrera, Jun 15, 2012

Cork pops with a nice hiss. Pours deep clear reddish purple with a surprisingly big pinkish beige head that shows decent retention.
Aroma is a great combo of oaky tannins, overripe red grapes JD an emerging funky barnyard character. There is a light acidity but it's not overpowering by any means.
Initial taste is a light acidity with a lot of oak and fruity red wine. The finish is really musty with some funk mixed with the oak barrel. Maybe some sugary sweetness underneath the sourness.
The mouthfeel is dry and fruity, dry much like a red wine in its feel.
This is one of those beers you take for granted in the chase for all the "rarer" Cantillons and 3F. It's fantastic, enough fruit to balance the acidity and funk. Big fan. 785 charactersgford217, Jun 06, 2012

4.2/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I've had this bottle for a while now, figured it was time to drink it. Bottled in late 2009.
Appearance: Pours a somewhat hazy rose color with a couple fingers of light pink head. Retention is very nice, lacing is limited, and it has a fair amount of carbonation. Nice looking lambic.
Smell: Lots of musty funk, some definite lactic sour notes, and some light grape-y notes. 
Taste: Lactic sourness and funk hits fairly hard up front, followed by some slightly sweeter grape fruitiness. That doesn't last too long as some more tartness and funk comes through on the finish. Not really bracingly sour at this point, but a pretty nice balance.
Mouthfeel/Overall: Light bodied and lively from the carbonation. Very nice feel in the mouth. Overall, I enjoyed this bottle quite a bit. Glad I have another one coming my way so I can really let it age and see how sour it can get. 877 characterszhanson88, Jun 05, 2012

4/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served from bottle into tumbler glass in Brussels. Relatively fresh bottle, ~6 months old.
A: No head. Cherry red color.
S: Funk is the dominant element in the smell, along with a fruitiness that is more akin to plums than grapes.
T: A mild taste, surprisingly (when I've had older bottles before, it was a lot more pungent and sour, I believe). There's a bit of relatively mild sourness at the start that fades away into a fruit juice sweetness, and a hint of bitterness/funk in the finish. 
M: The sourness is masked by the fruitiness in the taste, but my lips have a stinging sensation when I put down the glass. So, it's flat but fairly highly acidic.
O: A pretty strange lambic. Maybe the ideal bottle age is ~1 year. The one I have now seems too fresh and uninteresting, but if it is too old, it is very potent and sour. 831 charactersshleepy, May 31, 2012

Smells typical Cantillon. Some musty horseblanket with a lot of red grape sweetness.
Similar flavors. Lush red grapes with the underlying Cantillon funk profile. Very vinous qualities. A little tartness, but sourness is not extreme on this one. The fruit provides more sweet than sour.
Creamy mouthfeel with prickly carbonation.

With the cork pry, the bottom of the wood had a light purple stain on it. The liquid in the glass looks a dark ruby red with some trace amounts of faint purple. The liquid slides in nice with a light purple inch of foam that stood around for a bit than vanished, no lace, but small bubbles rising up.
Smell is all grape for the first 30 minutes or so. The merlot comes out really nice in this fresh bottle. Trace amounts of leather and some minimal funk at this young stage. I don't get as much 'Foot' as in older vintages, which brings out the grape even more.
Very clean grape taste here with some kinda fresh lambic that brings the merlot out even more. Not so much grape that it becomes sweet, just enough to get the wine flavor blended in with the lambic. Trace amount of leather and more funky taste as time goes on.
Yes, this is a Cantillon, and yes, it is sour, but not really sour, I would say kinda tart. This beer has a body that is in between light and medium with some low cab in the mix. I think 5 years in the bottle may bring up the sour, but will for sure bring out the funk more. Lamvinus is not the mouth puckering sour bomb that you may expect, but a well integrated beer resembling wine. This stuff is kick ass. 1,297 charactersBARFLYB, May 01, 2012

Poured into a matching Cantillon long stemmed tulip. The brew appears a dark ruby with a stained pinkish color cap. The head fizzes away audibly and leaves faint spotty lacing effect on the glass.
The smell is mildly like vinegar with some sweet accents of grape juice. Quite a wild and funky nose of earthy Brett and lacto cheesiness. Some mild barrel presence is noted across the back.
The taste is acidic with juicy grape flavor. A tannic touch of raw oaked quality mixes in with a bit of harshness complimenting the acidity. Lots of raw, earthy grape flavor is present which transforms gradually into heartburn inducing sourness. The grape touch to this adds a nice complexity and a wine-like appeal.
This brew seemingly strips all te moisture from the mouth. It is excessively drinkable with a medium body and modest to lighter level of carbonation. Throughout the experience, there was little to no alcohol impact. While not my favorite Cantillon offering, this is still good and something I would try again if I could get a very young bottle or something quite old for comparison purposes. 1,217 charactersstakem, Mar 28, 2012

Pours a translucent dark crimson with bright ruby red hues. Looks a shade lighter than cranberry juice, with a bit of tawny paleness to it. Small soapy/bubbly off-white head that slowly dissipates laving some light spotty lacing. 
Aromas begin with sour grapes and earthy mustiness. Then I get some vinegar, oak and with some acidic citrus and yeasty barnyard funk. Light stone/tropical fruits like peach and pineapple are coming to mind as well.
The tastes begin with plenty of lactic/citric acidity to go along with sweet and sour grapes. The oak and Brett offer up some nice tannins and funk as well. Not overly tart but def reminds me a little of a sour patch kid that has been left out and is getting a little stale and moldy. As it warms all the flavors really start to make themselves known; must, vinegar, earth and funk throughout, yet never overpowering or offensive. 
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium to low carbonation. Finish is dry and tart but not overly so. Oak and brett flavors linger ever so slightly on the palate.
Overall this is definitely one of the best, if not the best Lambic I have ever had. It hits right in my wheelhouse; funky, sour, tart, fruity, tannic but none are over the top or out of balance. Really one of the best beers I have ever had because the flavor profile is so straight-forward and yet so complex at the same time because each of the subtle flavors makes an appearance as you sample. Def worth trading for/seeking out and laying out a little extra if need be to obtain. 1,577 charactersclaspada, Mar 23, 2012

A - Poured a hazy dark pink with one finger of light pink head. Film of retention and spotty lace.
S - Grape skins, funk, and vinegar. Spot on for a Lambic made with grapes.
T - Quite tart with grape skins, vinegar, and what I could only describe as pink tart fruits. Definitely some hay and lemon candy as well.
M - Strong carbonation, dry tart finish and medium body.
O/D - A solid, flavourful beer that I enjoyed on a sunny afternoon. Very tasty. 526 charactersbylerteck, Mar 13, 2012

4.36/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had to crack one of these open. Just received from Mar02x in my first international trade. Fingers crossed that my side of the trade will find its way to the Netherlands in short order. Thanks Mark for sending me this beer.
A - Classic. Poured from a 2011 bottle into my Selinsgrove goblet. Belgium meets Pennsylvania. Beautiful plum/pinkish color with a willowy white head that quickly settles down to a white film. Interesting but you think that something this color would have to be sweet but you know what's around the corner.
S - Fairly aggressive with a sharp acidity and slight vinegar smell. All the usual characteristics in a classic sour present itself in the aroma. Obviously has a profile of wine in the aroma with a little more aggressive kick to it.
T - Sublime. Grapes, grape skin, some mustiness, and a fairly sharp acidic bite. In my mind, I was trying to compare and contrast this a bit to Supplication. Supplication obviously features cherries as the fruit whereas STL has grapes as its base, but I thought that they did cross paths in a certain way. Supplication is not as sharp in my opinion whereas the STL has a more sour bite but they are both divine. I think that this one is closer to the edge of being really sour. Any further and I am not sure I would enjoy this as much. Gives you the grapes and kick in fine balance.
M - I liked it. It has the right amount of carbonation to it but is very satisfying.
O - A great beer and worthy of its ratings. I am glad that I have a couple more to stock away for the summer.
Thanks Mark, let me know when my beers arrive and let's do it again sometime. 1,625 charactersBeerisheaven, Mar 10, 2012
4.33/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to foofaa for sharing. Served in a goblet.
Appearance: Pours a clear red color with two fingers of off white head that fades to a ring around the edge of the glass and leaves some lacing.
Smell: Quite funky with some fruit notes. I'm picking up herbal yeast, grape, and mild vinegar.
Taste: Tart and funky with lots of grape juice. Herbal and quite tart with a bitter finish. This is very good.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with smooth and tingly carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: This is a great sour beer. The fruit and tart flavors mix well with lots of funk. 573 charactersoline73, Mar 09, 2012

Aroma is tart, sour, unripe red grapes, vinegar, acidic.
Moderate tart sourness upfront, vinegar acidity. Follows through to the finish. Merlot grape fruitiness gives the finish some red wine characteristics. Slight sweetness.
Light to medium body with moderate carbonation. Bubbly crisp finish that is slightly dry.
Nice moderate level of acidic sourness. Merlot grapes add a unique finishing touch.

Bottled: November 21, 2010
A- Pours a two finger light pink head, really attractive color, ruby red/ maroon color, looks very appealing. 
S- Wow incredible, big funky aroma, cobwebs, musky, barnyard funk, sour grape skin, raspberries notes, nice oak characteristics from the oak casks, cannot wait to try this.
T- Wow so smooth, puckering at first but then mellows out, really impressive, I get the grapes upfront, barnyard funkiness, muskiness comes out, sour lemon notes come out as well.
M- Medium mouth feel, perfect amount of carbonation, sour, puckering, surprising clean finish. 
O- I am really impressed with this, the aroma was amazing, and I was expecting the taste to be really puckering but it was very mellow and balanced, I absolutely love this beer, definite gem from Cantillon. 867 charactersChriscrundwell12, Jan 14, 2012
4.73/5  rDev +6.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a tall 8oz flute for $9.00. 6% ABV. Sampled 8/13/10.
From the website:
"The grapes, of the merlot and cabernet-franc varieties, are soaked in Bordeaux barrels containing two to three years old lambic. The beer is not blended before the bottling. The foam is caused by the addition of a liquor which starts the fermentation."
A: One finger of bubbling head, lilac in color and quick to disappear. No trace of film, collar or lace. But the body has such a beautiful, hazy lavender hue that it doesn’t even matter. Gorgeous.
S: Vinous on the nose, with tart berries and sweet red wine grapes adding to the tannic quality already present from the barrel. A well incorporated level of hay and yeasty funk balance out the sweet aromas.
T: Other worldly. Honestly. Red berries and grapes take over the taste buds. This is one of the most wine-like beers I’ve ever had.
M: Perfectly effervescent, sour, lip smackingly tart with puckering acidity and boasting a fuller body than most lambics. Dry from middle of the palate on. A nearly complete flavor/mouthfeel experience.
D: I’m a big fan of St. Lamvinus on draft, and may even prefer it to its bottled counterpart. Very refreshing and extremely easy to drink. 1,226 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, Jan 14, 2012

4.75/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 52009 vintage opened in honor of my gf Kristin
 A- A very aggressive pour gave me a rather thin 3-finger head that faded quickly. The color of the foam was a wonderful light purplish-pink. The beer itself is a dark pink-purple, with interesting purple hues. A very pretty beer. 
S- The first smell to hit my nose is Cantillons distinctive sourness, but this time it is slightly refined with more musty funk layered about the aromas. Upon a further inspection, I am happily greeted by a deep layer of funk and its elements, lots of grape tannins and then some of the distinctive aromas of welchs grape juice followed by a the bracing sourness only found in Cantillon. 
T- Awesome! Leather funk, mixed into layers of lush Merlot with a slight creamy texture, unusually found in lambic. The finish is where the complexity shines, the grapes add another dimension to the oncoming and reoccurring waves of funk and sour. The funk in is this vintage is fantastic, the most refined Cantillon I have come across. 
M- Carbonation is on the higher side and adds a very nice contrast to the flavors allowing them to sparkle and deviate bewteen the complexities. A creaminess is also present and is not something I am used to experiencing within lambic. 
O- This is my favorite Cantillon and the best bottle I have had. The funk elements in this bottle are outstanding and more refined than the other Cantillons that I have had. Thus this is the most balanced Cantillon I have ever come across. I love the Merlot grapes, they are fantastic, the tannins really add some awesome elements and really allow this beer to shine and develop into just pure awesomeness. 1,653 charactersnas5755, Jan 08, 2012

4.34/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This poured out as a really nice looking pinkish red color with a fizzy light pink head on top. The retention and lacing were very minimal here. The smell of the beer gives off plenty of Merlot Grape aromas along with the tart aromas of the wild fermentation this brew has gone through. The taste of the beer has a tart grape flavor up front with a dry funky aftertaste that would probably interest most wine lovers to try this beer. The mouthfeel is thick and dry, not overly carbonated at all. Overall this brew was pretty good, I'm not sure if I would ever buy this one again mainly because of the price tag on it. I enjoyed having it though, and would drink it again if it was offered to me. 695 charactersKnapp85, Dec 22, 2011

Appearance: 4
Dark cherry red, semi opaque body. Pour with a white-pink head ½ inch that quickly dissipates to a thin ring of head with a clear flat middle. 
Smell: 4
 Prominent sour aroma with vinegar and mild barnyard funk. Quite pleasant. Also get notes of sweeter, dark fruits and tannin, red wine, with fleeting elements of ?cocca and ?leather. Faintest present of hops. One can definitely appreciate the addition of the merlot grapes from their distinct aspects they add.
Taste: 4.5
Extremely good. Many layers with sour and fruit. I’ll try my best to pick apart. Initially, a slight fruit sweetness (red grape in flavor/c pf merlot) with moderate soft sourness, with minimal funk and mild minerality. Midway through, sourness becomes more prominent with a sharp burst on the palate. Not vinegary in any way. Start to detect malt presence more near the middle to the end. Finishes with fading sourness and a faint malt sweetness and presence of grapes lingers on palate. 
Again, aspects of the merlot grape are easily appreciated in the taste. Of note, this is a two-year old bottle, and based on the brewery suggestion that fruit flavor fades after e first year, it would be interesting to try a fresh bottle.
Regardless, I find the beer a very interesting, somewhat complex flavor profile that is extremely well-balanced whilst still being very sour. Very smooth drinking
Mouthfeel: 4.5
Good mouth coating with appropriate thickness. Feel crisp and sour at same time. Quite enjoyable. Pleasant mild-moderate soft, but bubbly carbonation. Mild tannin/astringency.
Overall: 4.5
A great beer. The first Cantillon I have review since starting to get into sour beers. Incredibly refined and smooth drinking; in fact, amazingly easy to drink, almost refreshing. Really not that sour either.
Low abv at 5% is nice because it makes finishing a 750ml doable; does not seem to impact taste negatively at all.
Finally beginning to understand why everyone raves about these beers. Too bad they are pricey in Canada ($28/ 750ml)
Highly recommend 2,124 charactersEnemyWithin, Dec 16, 2011

S: extreme funk, smells like fungi, kind of grosses me out, but there's also wine grapes. There's something about it that makes me a little sick, like rotten meat.
T: taste is much more subtle, nice grape skin, green olives, but also that signature Cantillon yeast. White wine, or maybe even rosé. 
M: light-bodied, medium carbonation is well balanced to the taste.
O: Not the best I've had (especially from Cantillon) but still good, reminds me of Mediterranean food, like tapenade or putanesca sauce. Smell was really off-putting, I'm wondering if this bottle was infected. 669 charactersnickhiller, Nov 24, 2011

A: This could almost pass for a glass of wine (minus the carbonation). Beautiful ruby color, with a very thin pinkish head.
S: Rustic old wood aroma, with a definite wine backbone. Ripe cheese and grape mash. Love the classic funk.
T: Very similar to the nose. Slight sweetness up front with charred oak and fruit in the back. This is one of the greats! Great balance of sweet and sour.
M: Very light with just a whisper of carbonation.

A: pours a beautiful deep rose read with a finger of transient pink foam and brilliant clarity. No lace. Beautiful beer. Normally, some of the characteristics here would take away, but this appearance is simply stunning. Great looking beer.
S: Mmmmm. Spicy blend of yeast, dry sour, farm funk (the most I've smelled in a cantillon), lots of lacto. Nice.
T: Dry, puckering, tart and fruity. The fruit tone is really surprising provided the time in bottle. Plenty of signature Cantillon sour puckering flavors. Hints of white vinegar. Really nice.
M: Thin, moderately low carbonation allows for the tannic dryness in the beer to shine. Make me water and want more.
O: I really, really enjoyed this beer, but I think I might prefer some of the others from the crew there in Brussels to this one. 806 charactersharrymel, Nov 19, 2011

4.58/5  rDev +3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 52 oz. bottle pour into a wine taster at the Bruery Provisions on November 7th, 2011. #4 of a 5-bottle Cantillon flight. 
A - Profoundly unique coloration here. A blend of deep blood-red and accenting purple hues. Low carbonation, head, retention, and lacing. It looks like a solid red wine blend but with more character. 
S - Wow, far more funk than I anticipated. Thick barnyard mud. Manure. Wet hay and grass. Behind the huge brett layers are wine complexities. Red grapes, oak, almost a dark fruit component. 
T - Love it. Red grape sweetness blended with a vinous note at the front, immediately followed by puckering sourness. Great depth throughout the palate. Dry finish is more than adequate here. I sense a bit of warming in the back of my throat.
M - Light-medium body. Average carbonation. I'm finding Cantillon to be pretty damn consistent with feel. 
D - This beer has a sense of mystique to me. I know that I didn't pick up everything in that glass, but what I did grab I thoroughly enjoyed and found this to be as unique as anything I've yet encountered. Great stuff, would actively seek this one out again. 1,126 charactersAuracom, Nov 10, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5300
Appearance. Pours a hazy purple-red with half a finger of fizzy, thick, light pink head that fades pretty quickly.
Smell. Sweet red grapes and sour apples in a horse barn. Funky, sweet and sour ...in for a treat here, me thinks. 
Taste. Big blast of sour and funky brett. After a few sips, dry red wine starts to come through, especially in the finish. Barnyard funk is present from begining to end, but not overpowering and doesn't linger past it's welcome. Sourness is somewhat intense, but not to the point of tasting like vinegar. Very nice.
Mouthfeel. Medium-light body. Fine, lively and smooth, medium-strong carbonation. 
Overall. Fantastic treat. Elegant and full of flavour, but still easy to drink. Went through the first glass way to quickly. Luckily, I'm drinking this alone and have another glass left. ...Who says drinking alone is a bad thing?? If I had money to burn, I would drink this stuff often. 924 charactersRutager, Nov 10, 2011
4.53/5  rDev +2.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5From a 750 at Provisions,
A: Pours a gorgeous grape red with a soft white head, spotty lace.
S: As opposed to most fruit lambics, the barnyard dominates the nose here. Horse blanket and hay with that Cantillon funk.
T: Pretty, pretty, pretty. Delicious soft notes of grapes, passion fruit, plum and lilac. Very flowery, but maintaining the fruitiness at all times.
M: Medium-bodied overall, moderate acidity. Bright on the palate, very easy drinking.
O: If I had a bottle of this to myself, I could see myself finishing it in 10 minutes, it's just that good. I love good Right Bank Bordeaux, so adding Merlot and Cab Franc grapes to lambic makes sense to me. It certainly worked here. 689 charactersHalcyondays, Nov 07, 2011
3.67/5  rDev -17.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to TCGoalie for supplying this tasty beer. Enjoyed at a tasting party with TCGoalie, TCHopCraver, and zoso1967 quite a while back; just getting around to entering in some old audio reviews.
Appearance: Pours a raspberry color with lots of carbonation. Little to no head or carbonation. There are also some leg-like coatings running down the glass, similar to what you would find in a glass of red wine.
Smell: Lots of funky wild yeast type smells, with cherry, raspberry, and leather. Kind of a sting to the aroma and your nostrils get a bit of a workout if you stick your nose too far down into the glass.
Taste: This was extremely dry and sour like a handful of Sweet Tarts and Sour Patch Kids. The wine takes a back seat to the sour punch. There is some kiwi and raspberry there, but the face puckering aspect really dominates. Almost like sucking on a lemon at times.
Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied, good carbonation, dry, and acidic. Sour is the operative word for sure.
Overall: An interesting beer, but a touch too sour. There are some nice flavors going on there, but the sour aspect overwhelms everything else. 1,134 charactersBuckyFresh, Nov 06, 2011

Pours a ruby, violet color with a bit of head and a surprising amount of lacing. Very nice looking beer.
Smells of lemons, grapes, funk, oak, and vinegar.
Taste opens with a burst of grape, moving into waves after waves of sour flavors. Vinegar, lemon, cherry wash over the tongue with some hint of the brett funk mixed in. Moves into a grape/oak finish that mellows the sourness. This is a stellar beer and almost a vacation in a bottle.
Mouthfeel is spritzy and light, just what you'd expect from a cantillon.
Overall, this beer is stellar. I'm on the lookout for more. 688 charactersbs870621345, Oct 27, 2011

Lemon, grape, sweet cherry, tartness.
Grape definitely noticeable, especially in the finish. Medium amount of sour.
Same finish as a wine, leaves the same dry feeling in your mouth. The sour element makes this quite lovely.
Yum, tastes like you think it would - gueuze with grapes. I'd like to age one of these, bring out the sour a bit. 385 charactersptykozoon, Oct 27, 2011
4.48/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Shared with fellow BA’s at the CBS release. 2011 vintage. Taken from notes.
Appearance – Pours into a tulip with a beautiful hazy dark purple, reddish pink color. About a finger of slight pink head that dissipates slowly leaving slight lacing.
Smell – Grape skins and tannin, oak, classic wonderful Cantillon barnyard funk, tart berries, and slight cheese.
Taste – A wonderful puckering sensation from the acidity, red wine and tannin. Fruits such as light raspberries and grapes mixed with barnyard funk and oak. A slight tartness finishes up the taste.
Mouthfeel – Light to medium bodied, moderate carbonation, finishes dry.
Overall – A fantastic beer that was only slightly overshadowed by the 2003 Lou Pepe Framboise tasted almost directly after. Quite wine like and nicely balanced. Curious to see what a few years will do to the flavors. 860 charactersSpdKilz, Oct 27, 2011

S: you could definitely sniff out the Merlot grapes in the nose alongside the signature oakum funky character, some acidity and a slight amount of citrus as well.
T: the flavor was even dominated by the Merlot grapes, tons of funky horse blanket character, oakum accents and a touch of citrus.
M: the brew was light to medium in body with a low amount of carbonation which had a fruity, oaky, funky, and sour finish.

What follows is original "on tap" review from 2011.
Pleased and surprised when I walked into City Beer in S.F. (only the second time there) and found this on tap. What a rare treat!
Pours a dark cranberry with purple tint. Very short quick fading white head. Looks fresh and appealing. 
Nose is a really nice funk. The brett comes through and if you don't like brett perhaps one shouldn't be drinking these kinds of brews. This one shows greast "barnyard" "wet horse blanket" character with very nice undertones of purple grapes and hint of fruit. Told this can was fresh and expected a bit more from the nose. Nice but perhaps a bit disappointing. 
Mouthfeel was medium/light, dry and pleasant. Well balanced with good carbonation but did not have the bright character one might expect in a well made Cantillon. However, it als was not as tart as expected or desired, likely a result of its freshness.
Flavor profile was "acceptable"and "pleasant." These are not the words one wants to use (or the character of a beer one wants to taste) when tasting Cantillon. Light, pleasant unassertive flavor profile. Hints of grape, hints of green apple with very little tartness. Probably the least tart Cantillon I've ever tried. Pleasant but that was about it. Nothing to rave about. 
One loves that fact that this is rare to find on tap (at least in my experience here in California) and having any Cantillon is always a treat. All in all a disappointment from the Cantillon I've had in the past and I've had a great many. Candidly, the bottles I've had have much more character and distinction.
Kudos to City Beer and a great "bragging rights" experience. However, not a brew "to remember." 1,802 charactersGRG1313, Oct 20, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -8.6%look: 5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at City Beer Store - SF.
A - The beer was delivered in a 7oz flute and had a nice medium purple color to it.  Kind of what I would expect grape soda to look like.  Nice thin head topped the flute with a whispy witenagemot head.  The head fell quickly leaving behind no trace of lacing.
S - Definitely not the strong point of this beer.  It was very earthy, almost too earthy to the point of smelling like poop.  No kidding!  I had 4 ba's with me and they all agreed.  There was a definite sour funk present but the poop was strong with this beer.
T - The taste thankfully didn't reflect the aroma.  Nice vinous tartness.  Super tart.  There was also a very present earthy flavor that although similar to the smell was not off-putting.  I really enjoyed the flavor.
M - Super crisp, dry and refreshing.  Excellent spiky carbonation.  Like most Cantillon's this was a very well balanced and crafted beer.
O - Overall this was a great treat.  I was amped to see this on the tap list.  At $10 for a 7 oz pour it was a bit spendy, but it was a luxury that I would try again. 1,096 charactersdubinsky, Oct 15, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52010 bottle enjoyed at Deep Ellum. Served in a wine glass.
Pours a dark, ruby purple. It's surprisingly clear, like magenta-tinted juice. A half-finger white head leaves nice lacing around the glass.
Wonderful tart and vinous funk in the aroma. I'm not sure I'd necessarily peg the fruit character as grape-like, as there are definitely some cherries at work as well. A light citric acidity adds another sour element, but this is quite a sweet-smelling beer.
Grapes are far more present in the taste, with a very grape-dominant aftertaste. It's quite sweet, though certainly less sweet than, say, Zwanze 2011. Very tart sourness, bordering on mouth-puckering at times. There's a cheesy funk, not unlike horse blankets/barnyards/etc. It goes without saying, but the tannic quality is quite wine-like.
Here's where St. Lamvinus crushes it - the mouthfeel is the best of any Cantillon I've ever had. Lush and thick, with a perfect medium level of carbonation. Not unlike a Lambrusco, though it's a little more viscous. An absolute delight to drink.
Another wonderful expression of fruit from Cantillon. Very well balanced despite some extreme flavors at work. A shame this is so difficult to find these days. 1,210 charactersamphion1065, Oct 12, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5An 09 "bottled" vintage cracked and poured into my favorite chalice.
A small white frothy head sits on a murky ruby red brew. The head receds leaving a little ring of bubbles and very little lacing.
The nose on this is fairly sour and acidic with a fruity funkiness.
The taste is dominated by fruit, cherry and grape. The fruit immediately sours in the finish with a slight medicinal taste. All the sour and funkiness is definetely in the back and is a little subdued compared with other lambics from Cantillon. A nice medium to light body on this one.
Overall a pretty good lambic. It's not super sour or extremely funky but more balanced, if there is such a thing when it comes to lambics from Cantillon. This would make a good intro for those wanting to taste a more serious lambic. 789 charactersalpineclimber, Oct 11, 2011

Draft at Monk's Cafe - served in flute glass
Vintage 2008
L: Hard to say as it was quite dark in Monk's at the front bar; however, I'll go with bursting/bright raspberry. No head.
S: Different. Very, very different. Not in a bad way, but not like any other beer I've smelled before. Hint of fruit drowned by a very interesting funk - acidic, earthy, off...you name it. Maybe almost like wine, but I still can't figure it out.
T: Straight to sour from the get-go! Not overpowering, but definitely in your face. Hint of sweet and tart is well-balanced. Enjoyable considering I was expecting way worse.
M: Light, crisp, and dry.
O: Very well put together considering how nervous I was after smelling it. I have not jumped into this style very often; however, this beer tickles my palate to explore further. As such, I will =) 839 charactersspdyfire83, Sep 23, 2011
4.24/5  rDev -4.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served on-tap at Monk's on Zwanze day. This is the 2008 version.
A - Pours murky purple/red with a very small film of white head, dissipating down to nothing at all, leaving little to no lace down the glass.
S - Smells of acidic sourness, musty basement funk, merlot grapes; from the skins to the pulp, it is all in there; and some dry oak tannins. Smells like a funky merlot.
T - Starts off with quite a bit of sharp acidic sourness slowly giving way to a mix of juicy merlot grapes and their skins, damp earth, musty barnyard funk, dry oak tannins, and some faint fruity twang at the very end. The finish is a mix of dryness and sourness, lingering for some time.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Sharp, vinous, feel with plenty of pucker that lingers through the finish. This is quite complex, yet very enjoyable.
O - I enjoyed my glass of this one. Sometimes the combination of funk and grapes doesn't always work but it really does here. Yet another winner from Cantillon. 1,003 charactersorangesol, Sep 18, 2011

this beer pours a nice red color, I could not give you the exact shade as it was quite late and deep ellum is pretty dark inside anyways. the smell is acetic and sour right of the back with a little bit of funk in there but barely noticeable over the sour smell. the taste is sour with red wine notes and acidity a superb balance between the wine grape flavor and the sour lambic. the mouthfeel is light and mouth wateringly sour. overall this is the best sour beer i have ever had. 624 charactersrowingbrewer, Sep 15, 2011

Appearance: Pours a clear purplish-red with a soft pink head about a finger thick that fades into a thin lacing over the top. Very soft and elegant looking.
Aroma: Grape skins, fruit, blackberries, cherries, oak, subtle funk blended with tart fruity aromas, a real treat. 
Taste: Dark grape flavor, tart cherries, subtle oak character with a finish that is citrusy and clean. 
Mouthfeel: Light carbonation and light body with a slightly sour dry finish. 
Overall: I could easily see myself knocking back a few bottles of this; however, my wallet can't see that. 634 charactersjamescain, Sep 15, 2011

A: Beautiful color, like a purple to red hue that is quite brilliant. Nice ring of head and even some lacing. Really quite pretty, amazing what they can do with colors.
S: Classic Cantillon wild yeast and barnyard funk and very refined grape notes. Round oak meld and smooth out some of the funk. Not as aromatic as I'm used to from Cantillon, but this still smells quite nice and has a light wheaty malt berry/grape pie smell. 
T/M: Great dry old taste with a semi bitter fruit pit aftertaste with some nice tart white grape and light berry fruits. This almost seems like a slightly sweet fruit tart or pie with the crust. I also get a fruit tart burst at the back of the palate. Effervescent bubbles help lift the yeasty notes and funky straw to the fore to compete with the fruit. The oak also has a nice moderating role to make sure nothing sticks out too much. Nice dry finish as well.
Overall a great beer, definitely worth seeking out. 1,019 charactersDreadnaught33, Sep 12, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow, this is quite the gem, truly, looks like merlot, a little lighter, but brighter, prettier, good sexy meld of purple and pink. The head is pink, and a good 1"+ deep. Truly a masterpiece worth looking at. Solid purple grape aroma, usual suspects of dry lemon. 
Complex. Grapes, tannins, meld to produce a dry fruit presence, all the great sour flavor, none of it getting in the way of each other. A little bit of berry note to it. Just the right amount of tartness, substantial. I thought it was very clean, not barnyardy or horse blanket stuff you can read in almost every review. 
Damn expensive stuff, but sometimes, you or she is worth it. Normally, I think the year round lineup from Cantillon (and Fantome) was usually superior to the harder to gets, but this one seems to be the exception to the rule. 
Damn fine on a day at the end of summer, thanks Labor Day weekend 2011. This and 3F schaerbeekse in heaven.

4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to claaark for this one. 750ml capped and corked bottle into a Cantillon tulip. 2010 cork date. Shared with schen9303.
Pour yields a 1 finger powdery pink head with moderate retention that dissipates into a thick ring around the glass. Beer is a clear deep, pink-purple. Lacing is non-existant. Above average due to the amazing color. 
Nose is tart purple grapes, rotting wood, and a distinct, sharp cheesiness mixed with some cobweb notes. Very aromatic, robust, and fruity overall while remaining simple. Impressive. 
Opens cobwebs, plastic, grape tartness mixed with a juicy sweetness. Barrel notes emerge prominently towards the middle with a Brett dryness. Some wet straw at the end where grape characteristics re-emerge. Finish is tart and lemon-y. Aftertaste is grape, lemon, and wood. Complexity really grows and grows as this one warms. 
Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and silky in the mouth and puckering and dry going down. Dry finish with a lingering aftertaste. Perfect for the style and gets smoother and smoother as I sip and sip.
Really a perfect representation of the style and one of the best fruit lambics that Cantillon makes in my opinion. Only rivaled by Lou Pepe Kriek in Cantillon's normal line. Snatch this one up if you can. Amazing fresh and gets more and more graceful as it ages. 1,346 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 02, 2011

My first crack at this beauty. The color is a deep rose with a thin, pink tinged head. The aroma is fantastic. That signature Cantillon funk is very present but the aroma of fruit is also very evident. Very vinous in the nose. 
I'm trying to find the words to describe the taste of this beer but they escape me. Fantastic? Unbelieveable? Perfection? This beer gives you everything you could want from a traditional fruit lambic. Fruit character, check. Tartness, check. Funk, check. Complexity, check. This beer is amazing. Not quite as sour as most Cantillon offerings. An underlying sweetness from the grapes is evident and balances PERFECTLY with sour/tart/funky notes. Wow. 
This beer is perfectly carbonated. Mouthfeel is absolutely spot on for the style and ABV. 
Overall, a fantastic beer from Cantillon and maybe the best Lambic I've ever tasted. Absolutely amazing. 918 charactersBrew33, Aug 30, 2011

S - Lots of funk with some lactic sourness, hints of grapes and earthy notes.
T - Very similar to the smell. It's heavy on the red wine characteristics and this is where the bordeaux really shines. Lots of varying grape flavor. A fairly mild sourness through out with a very strong oak finish.
M - Very light and extremely dry. Absolutely perfect feel for a lambic. Medium-High carbonation.
O - One of the best lambics I have ever tried. 508 charactersSkiBum22, Aug 30, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Reviewed from notes-- still trying to get caught up!
poured into a tulip. Shared by yeahnatenelson. This was an 06 vintage.
A light peachy pink color. Little head of off-white bubbles, nice legs, average spotty lace.
Smells of charred oak, red grape skin, a strange hint of cranberry pomegranate. Smells really fucking sour, and if I may sound like oreo for a second-- smells really fuckin awesome.
The taste hits all the notes I found in the nose-- very light sweetness up front before the red grapes and charred oak and vinous notes take over. This is tasty fo sho. Lots of flavor, and that charred oak note works insanely well as a counterpoint to the intense sourness.
The body is medium/full with a low carbonation level-- it isn't too low though. Just on the low level of being great. The feel has a tongue scrubbing sensation and the finish is extremely sour-- one of the most sour of the night. It pulls my cheeks in.
This beer is just really really good, and that's not just because I'm a cantillon fan-boy. 
Overall-- this is impressive. I could sip on this regularly-- if only it didn't cost $40 per bottle out this way! 1,136 charactersAleWatcher, Aug 28, 2011

A - Poured a beautiful pinkish purple/red hue with a one finger fizzy one head that fades slowly to leave a nice halo.
S - Excellent funk and light barnyard with nice sweet fruits (raspberries, grape, cherry). Just delicious, inviting lambic aromas.
T - Funky, fruity, raspberries. Nice sourness, nice tartness, good fruits (raspberry, grapeskin, etc).

4.07/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the Armsby Abbey
Beautiful light red appearance with a pink champagne-esque head that dissipated rather quickly. Looks very inviting.
The nose was funky to be sure, as expected. However, I got a very unpleasant smell that I can only associate with used diapers. Sounds horrible, and it kind of was. Unpleasant for me, and I don't really mind barnyard smell usually. Smell faded after a while but it really got me off the bat.
Tasted fantastic. Great Cantillon taste with oak and grape notes sprinkled throughout. Absolutely delicious and the nose didn't translate at all into the taste! (Thankfully)
Mouthfeel was as great. Good carbonation, though fleeting. Acid notes from the bacterium. Very pleasant.
Overall: Definitely recommend this beer. Gotta love Cantillon! The only thing that really threw me was the smell, it was unusually unpleasant!
Minor Edit: The nose didn't put me off from getting 2 pours of this. Just sayin'. 945 charactersAberration, Aug 25, 2011

Big fluffy head rises about the size of the beer but fades fairly quickly, rosy head fades semi quickly, hazy rosy pink maroon colored beer.
Nose has funk right out, funky brett or lacto, sour tart fruit, sour grape, cherry, nice lambic fruit, light barnyard, and a bit of a musty grape skin.
Taste comes on pretty sour, tart fruit, bit of cherry, some sour grape, light cabernet like grape skin, some light acidity and lacto funk, very light barnyard funk, light sweet sticky malts, light dry bready malts. Finishes tart fruit, dry, very mouth watering, little acidity, sticky syrupy too.
Mouth is med to a bit lighter bodied, decent carb, light lactic acid.
Overall awesome! Just friggen awesome. 723 charactersjlindros, Aug 25, 2011

App- A great mix of colors in this glass. Similar to the Framboozled, had a great mix of purples, reds and pinks but very little in terms of head/bubbles/lace or cling
Smell- This is a very well done beer from across the pond. The mix of citrus, tannin, barrel and yeast is amazing. I wanted to be elephant and stick my whole nose in the bottle.
Taste- This besides 10.10.10, is the most wine like beer I have had. I dont like wine but I liked this one. Very white wine but mixed with yeast and oak. The grapes added a layer of very mellow flavors mixed with the barrel to create a very dry tart/funk combo
Mouth- A light to medium bodied and a medium in carbonation. This was very dry and tart. A very signature Cantillon residual flavor.
Drink- I am not sad to say but more happy to say I am being a huge fan of Cantillon and want a whole ton more of it. This was simply a great beer. 986 charactersFosterJM, Aug 22, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +11.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5'06 vintage poured into a 6oz wine glass at Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia.
Pours a ruddy purple/maroon with substantial depth. A light coating of bubbles hovers over the lambic. Aroma is like nothing short of spectacular: earthy, cheddar, barnyard, armpit sweat, subtle red wine, acidic sourness. Incredibly complex.
The flavors mirror the aromas. The earthy and barnyard qualities hit you initially before allowing the sweetness of the grapes to push through followed by the tart and acidic finish. Finishes very dry despite having so many complex flavors complementing each other in perfect symphony. A true masterpiece among the spectacular lambics of Cantillon.
Mouthfeel is slightly puckering, but more comforting than the typical Cantillon sharpness and bite.
This is probably the best lambic I have ever had. Enjoyed this significantly more than the younger version I had a bottle of last year as all the flavors were more pronounced. Unbelievably complex. 
World class in every respect. 997 charactersvictory4me, Aug 10, 2011
4.45/5  rDev +0.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5on tap at monks during the cantillon mad monday - I tried both 06 and 08 vintages
Pours a deep reddish and purple color with some burnt hues, but with brighter cherry tones. There's a small amount of haziness, just enough to keep you from seeing all the way through. A thin white head fades out leaving little lacing.
Plenty of sourness leaps out of the glass into the nose, driven by merlot grapes with ripeness. Some earthy and oak elements, heavy funk and notes of acid. Definitely a red wine presence, although it retains a character I've come to expect from Cantillon. 
Biting sourness up front with grape and some cherry-like notes. Red wine character with oaky barrel flavors and some earthy, darker tones. Some funky hints, but more acidic and sour throughout. Finishes with some enamel stripping dryness and lingering tart dark grapes.
Medium bodied, nicely carbonated, dry and prickly on the tongue, lingers for an extended period. A wonderful fruit lambic from Cantillon with great sour character but still enough flavor to carry the aggressiveness. 1,064 charactersxnicknj, Aug 10, 2011
4/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this beer on tap at Monk's at their Cantillon event today. The beer poured and looked much like a red wine would. It was a deep purple red color with no head to speak of at all. The aroma too, mirrored a red wine, but was less intense and had a bit of a vinegary thing happening along with a bit of mild funk. The red wine thing continues in the flavor. This beer very closely mirrors a lighter much more pleasant and enjoyable (for me anyway) version of a merlot. Very good beer, but not necessarily one that blew me away. 527 charactersAgold, Aug 09, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750 ml bottled in 2010 shared by cenzo. Thanks Vince. Pours a bright cherry red with small white head that has decent retention and leaves a bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is a light brett funkiness, red wine grapes, light tannins with a bit of oak as well as a bit of cherry. The initial taste is quite sour with a little bit of sweetness and the red wine grapes coming through. A bit of oak and cherry are present as well as some lactic acid. The standard Cantillon barnyard funk is present in small amounts as well. The finish is dry with a light tannic astringency. Light to medium body with a really good slick mouthfeel. Low to medium carbonation. Another great Cantillon beer that I would be happy to drink anytime. 729 charactersjethrodium, Jul 31, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed at the Flying Saucer.
Bright ruby body, thin white head.
Smells like great wine mixed with brett. Funky red wine, that's all I've got. Like a soured bottle of wine a customer might return at a wine shop.
Grape juice, merlot, sour apple, green apple skin, sour cherry, tart raspberry, bright acidity, and on and on. The balance of rich fruit, wine and acidity is amazing. Not overly sour, but the tartness is there and adds perfect balance. 
Lush, but highly carbonated.
One of the most balanced and complex lambics I've had. The merlot grapes really lend something special. I think this would be better with more age (bottle says 21 November 2010). Allowing the brett to do its thing and develop more wild character would take this to a whole new level. I liked the Cuvee de Champion, but this is clearly in another league. 836 charactersBradLikesBrew, Jul 29, 2011

September 2010 bottling 
A: Pours a light red wine, reddish-purple color. The head has a lavender tint that dissapates into a thin ring. Light lacing and active carbonation.
S: The smell on this had me giddy. It smells like a much more complex merlot. Merlot grapes are predominant with some cherry-raspberry-currant mix in the background. Plenty of barrel influence(oak, wild yeast, damp wood,etc). 
T: At first this seemed bracingly sour but that wore off quickly. I'm glad my taste buds adjusted so I could appreciate all this had to offer. Ripe grapes and wild yeast dominate the flavor. There is a nice sweet and a hint of cherry. I get some vanilla that goes along with the sweetness that builds as this warms. The acidity is light.
M: This has a medium body and zesty carbonation. Its dry and refreshing at the same time.
O: As expected this beer is very wine-like. This a very complex beer that deserves a lot of time and some room temperature enjoyment.
Best fruit lambic I've had, probably my favorite cantillon to date, but I still have a hard time believe its worth that price; That said I'm not sure I could pass this up if it was sitting on the shelf. This is a real treat, glad I finally got to try it. 1,269 charactersschwaeh, Jul 26, 2011

A- Nice ruby red in the pour- everyone commented on the vibrant color. Simply glowing in the light. Nice rosy pink head in the snifter, not much in the wine glasses. 
S- Sweet jammy grapes. Marmalade and some mild funk.
T- Signature cantillon funk comes on strong but is wiped away from the grapes. Very grape-y. The fruit is nice- tartness is a wonderful contrast to the funk, and there's enough sweetness to really make this mellow all-around. Nothing sharp or too wild about this. The grapes are too sweet as it warms.. too far in to wine territory for me. 
M- There's too much grape skin flavor pulling this in the direction of wine. I know that's the idea behind the beer, but I'm not sold on it. Perhaps with time the grapes mellow.
O- Good, heck, pretty damn good maybe great. Too pricey though, and Cantillon has better fruit lambics. I'll be passing on this one in the future. 957 charactersShogoKawada, Jul 24, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Nice ruby huge to a light magenta. It has micro bubbles with wispy lacing. It looks like a majestic wine cooler. If bartels and james won the lottery and went all high brow, this would be the result.
S: Huge tart notes with great strawberry, cherries, sour currants, and bitter grapes. Granny smith apple skins are there as well. This smells incredible.
T: It has a crisp raspberry tartness that mellows into a smooth sweetness like a melted fruit rollup. It has a sour finish to it that imparts an incredibly refreshing dryness. This is the best Cantillon that I have had to date and it is the best Lambic that I have ever had. The vintage helped mellow it incredibly, even if it was only 2 years. The fruits interplay with the tart notes perfectly.
M: It is incredibly light and juicy with minimal coating and chardonnay dryness that just stings and crackles in a fantastic way. The carbonation is like an army of diligent effervesence that makes sure the bitter notes are imparted with incredible efficacy. Again, just amazing balance all around.
D: This makes Consecration look like an imperial stout and Lindeman’s look like candy syrup. It is leagues above all other sours and lambics that I am familiar with. I could drink this in a boat, with a goat, green eggs and ham; etc. You could drink this with any food, at any location and it would be well suited. I feel that this could give white and red wine equal competition with pairings because it is so original and dynamic. I can’t imagine how blaeber could improve on this model but I am anxious to try.
Narrative: Vitus Tanneen had been in some sticky jams before but this time, this time certainly was noteworthy. The walls of the trash compactor closed slowly, pressing the wine refuse closer into the chamber. The aluminum walls reeked of sweet grape skins and sticky notes. If not for the impending death, this would be an almost pleasant situation. “Well Sir Knuckles, looks like we are in a PRESSING SITUATION!” His friendly companion, Sir Knuckles, was an astute howler monkey with no penchant for puns. “WREE EE EE EEEK!” Sir Knuckles gestured imposingly to a hatch covered in sticky grape residue. “Well Sir Knuckles, this is one top that I have no hesitation to pop.” Using a wine opener, Vitus deftly unsealed the hatch and emerged into the bay area sunshine. “NOT TODAY KENDAL JACKSON! NOT TODAY!” He spun and his velvet tails swung after this athletic frame with the poise of a man, a man almost killed by grapes. 2,515 charactersSubpoenaDeuces, Jul 22, 2011

Served lightly chilled poured into a tulip wine glass.
Bottled 21st November 2010
Sours are quickly becoming my favorite style, really looking forward to this one.
No pop as the cork is removed. I hope this one is ok carbonation wise. 
Appearance: Good lord, what a colour! St. Lamvinus pours the most stunning crimson (first pour is clear, subsequent pours result in a yeast haze) with a small light pink head. While the head doesn’t last long, it is expected from the style and with such an amazing colour I just can’t bear to knock any points off. 
Smell: Hmmm, I did expect this to be pretty full of grapes but my first sniff tells me that funk might just be dominant. I guess that’s a good thing though, since I LOVE lambic funk. Superb balance between tart fruits and funk. The funkiness dominates overall, with: Musty cellars, old books, cobwebs, cheese (much stronger than in other lambics I have had), hints of sweat, hay and lovely woody notes. Having said that, the fruit is far from forgotten. Red grapes (I couldn't tell the variety though), red wine vinegar and sour cherry skins are present throughout and every now and then I get a blast of over ripe red grapes and just the tiniest hint of raspberry.
Taste: Ah yes, nothing like the mouth-puckering sourness of the first sip of a Cantillon! After 2 sips my mouth is used to the sourness and I can begin to appreciate the amazing complexities in the beer. Sour, fruity, funky - what more could I want? 
The flavour is huge and so complex that any description seems to be very inadequate. Guess I’ll just have to try. 
Red grapes (I would be closer to guessing merlot in the flavour than the smell), sour cherries, red wine vinegar, oak, dusty, farmyard, sweat, foot-like cheese (sounds dreadful, but works so well), old books, the list goes on. 
Mouthfeel: Just lighter than medium bodied with typical lambic (Perfect!!!) carbonation. I am very glad carbonation is not an issue like I first thought; it would have destroyed the beer. The medium-low level of fine, slightly tingly carbonation works beautifully with the sourness. 
Overall: Superb, one of the best beers I have had. The only improvement I could suggest and it's only a small one - a little more grape aroma would have been nice. Though maybe a fresher bottle would have delivered. Still a beer I will most certainly buy again! 2,395 charactersThehuntmaster, Jul 20, 2011
4.39/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5After getting my throat (and later my ass) torn apart by a '10 Kriek, I've decided to give this a go to see if history repeats itself. 2008 vintage.
3.5 A: Lightly hazed plum color. Just about two fingers of barely pink soda pop head that falls quickly and leaves no lacing.
4.5 S: Already I know I'm in for a much better experience. Tons of vinous grape with blueberry and blackberry just behind and perhaps a touch of cherry to round things out. Lots of musty funkiness with barnyard notes as well. Small oak contribution. Good balance between fruit and acid. Good bit of fruity lactic acid with just a hint of acetic acid. Very nice.
4.5 T: A good bit of sourness in this, but the acetic acid isn't overabundant. Again lots of grape with nearly as much cherry. The berry twins have taken a bit of a backseat in the taste. Plenty of barnyard and musty funk. This is loaded with tangy lactic acid. Complex and well balanced.
4.0 M: Lighter medium body. Good active carbonation. Lightly creamy and smooth.
4.5 D: Good beer. Definitely sour, but not intestine twisting. After the Kriek yesterday I had a few rounds of the quick step, but I don't imagine there will be an encore performance tonight. Solid all around. 1,220 charactersDavoleBomb, Jul 20, 2011
3.79/5  rDev -14.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Bottled on October 27th 2009, imported to Calgary, purchased by TCgoalie, brought back to Grand Rapids and eventually transported to Traverse City where he, TCHopCraver, BuckyFresh and I all did a group audio review that I have turned into what I have posted here.
Cantillon Saint Lamvinus pours a bright red color that is very unique. Not necessarily a fruity color, though we decided raspberry red was as close as we could describe it. The pinkish head disappears almost as fast as it appears despite the significant amount of carbonation. This does not leave much lace, but it almost has “legs” to it like wine.
The aroma is quite vinous with plenty of character from the grapes coming through. Really the wine aspect of the aroma is second to the ever present sour and funky lambic aromas. Together they create a very enjoyable bouquet though.
Perhaps I am just not as into sour as some, but this beer was damn sour. It is extremely dry with lots of acidic sour and funky basement notes. The wine really plays second fiddle in the flavor and I cannot pick up a ton of the merlot notes. There is a definite citrusy pithy sort of character and also kiwi.
The mouthfeel is on the lighter side of medium with a pretty invigorating amount of carbonation. This beer is so dry and acidic that it is an amazing palate cleanser.
Overall I have to say that this beer just had a bit too much sour going on for me. It was pleasant in the aroma, but really dominated the flavor. I wish it had a bit more balance, but then again it is possible that the age had mellowed the grapes and let the sour shine through more. It was definitely quite the experience to drink this beer though, especially in good company. 1,710 characterszoso1967, Jul 18, 2011

Pours a red wine colour due to merlot grapes, and a lovely pink head forms.
Smells tart, very grape/wine like.
Tastes like a lambic, with the characteristic sourness, yet the addition of the merlot grapes adds a tartness to the flavour, making it positively lip smacking. 
Overall a delightful drink, crisp, tart and sour, perfect with a tomato spaghetti dish. 414 charactersCwrwAmByth, Jul 15, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +12.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52009 bottle courtesy of the ever-awesome ericfb18. The brew pours a luscious blood-red hue, although it is fully translucent; it is capped with a thin wisp of encircling white froth. The nose is pure Cantillon funk; delicious and complex. Notes of bushy mixed berries, acidity of the acetic persuasion more than lactic, tannic oak, and an overall unbelieveably delectable and well-rounded flavor make this one of the best beers on Earth. The wine and grape is there if you look for it, although I feel like the fruitiness could just as easily be cherry, raspberry, blueberry or a berry melange. The most succinct way to describe the flavor of St. Lamvinus: This is what I thought Blabaer was going to taste like. I am struck by the fullness of the fruit flavor; it is not mere nuance, the taste is big and jammy and unabashed. The feel is full and creamy for a Cantillon (a la Blabaer), and has a wonderfully dry and mouth-watering finsh. Overall, this is about as good as a beer (or any libation, for that matter) can be. 1,022 charactersktrillionaire, Jul 15, 2011

Bottled Nov. 2010.
Pours dark red, bourgeney-ish, thin head.
Classic cantillon smell, sour, farmhouse funk. Some sour fruits smell, sour cherries.
Taste is very sour, taste the cantillon lambic, again some sour fruits, some red wine aftertaste. Great mouthfeel, good carbonation. 
The only downside is that I didn't get the huge grape flavor I was expecting , to me the lambic flavors overpowered the grapes.
Very drinkable and refreshing. 507 characterslanbewardin, Jul 11, 2011

A - Pours a beautifut deep blood red with a ring of white bubbles.
S - Lots of the standard lambic sour and funk. Huge leather and oak/wine presence. The oak is a lot stronger with this one than most of the sours/lambics I've tried. Overall, a really complex, subtle and pleasant aroma. However, at the very end there was a really odd finish - almost an olive like aroma.
T - Incredibly smooth for a lambic. Tart, but not puckering. Not as tart as I expected, which almost made this one seem a bit watery. Very complex - lots of wine influence - grape skins. Again, same issue as the nose. The tail end of a lot of sips finished with an overripe avocado/olive taste. Not pleasant. I'm not sure if it was an old/bad keg or what. 
M - A bit undercarbed. Medium bodied and coats the mouth very impressively. Similar to wine - vinous. Both crisp and thick. Really impressive.
O - I'm glad I've got a bottle of this set aside as I imagine there was something off with the glass I had (at least I hope that's the case). Can see the potential for this one to be amazing, and am looking forward to trying it again. 1,141 charactersreadbaron, Jun 18, 2011
3.83/5  rDev -13.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks Rich (phillybeer7779) for procuring a bottle of St. Lamvinus to share--I appreciate the effort it took to obtain this treat. This is a a very expensive beer, retailing for $30-40 USD, and very hard to justify purchasing without a group of beer geeks that understand what it is and to share it with. I'm glad Rich brought in a bottle to share with our tasting group.
The beer is lightly carbonated with a quickly dissipating head that leaves just a ghostly halo of pink foam. The beer is a dark bloody purple and almost transparent with a rose tint. The beer smells a little funky but not nearly as much as some older aged gueuzes I've had. The grapes are present in the aroma, but that pedio and lacto acidity dominate the nose. The beer is surprisingly mild. I was expecting a tongue curling acidity, but this is just mildly sour with some astringency from the wine grapes and maybe from the oak barrels. The grapes give a little bit of fruity sweetness and contributes to the thinner texture of the beer. I was definitely expecting more lambic and beer character with brighter acidity and livelier carbonation.
I was a little disappointed in this beer, but perhaps it just needed some more aging to bring out the lambic qualities I was looking for. 1,259 charactersSoonami, Jun 09, 2011

Don poured this beer, or should i say, half beer and half wine, in Westvleteren glasses. Nothing much to see after the pouring, no head of course, red to purple fluid.

3.65/5  rDev -17.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.58oz pour on tap at the Rattle n Hum.
Saint Lamvinus pours a deep burgundy. I could mistake it for red wine, except for the thin layer of raspberry head that crowns the beer. The nose consisty of dark fruits (cherries and plums), acidity, and a bit of barnyard funk. The red wine notes should be the base that everything plays off of, but they are just a bit too far in the background to really carry things though. The funky aspect of the beer comes through a bit more in the flavor. I've heard funk sometimes described as being musty , but this is the first time I've personally tasted it. It tastes like I imagine the air in a long abandoned room would. It's a bit overpowering, blocking out the more tart edge and fruity notes from the wine grapes. It's amazing to contrast the mouthfeel here with the Cuvee des Champions I just had. This one comes across as bit more rich and full, though that may be more a function of a much lower level of carbonation than any increase in the body. The overall effect though is a certain dullness to the beer. Saint Lamvinus smoothed out a bit as it warmed, but it remained a class below my favorite sours/wild ales. 1,157 charactersaxeman9182, May 26, 2011

Served in a white wine glass
A: It pours a deep aubergine color with zero clarity. There was a pinkish-white head that left little to no lacing.
S: The nose is full of barnyard funkiness; dirty hay, musty blankets and worn leather.  There is a distinct horsiness that gives way to a deep red wine grape aroma.  The grapes appear hauntingly from the back side saving the beer from rotten diapers.  There are hints of oak from the barrels but it is very subtle. 
T: The grapes assert there authority in full force.  As they slowly recede there is a strong dirty funkiness that grabs the palate and holds it hostage (in a good way).  The funk eventually lets go and the beer finishes very tart and bone dry.  The brew is full of lovely vinous qualities. 
M: Light bodied with some bubbly carbonation.  It is very champagne like in feel.
O: I found this brew simply phenomenal. It is a style bender that shows a profound depth that wines can only dreams about. Cheers! 1,003 charactersNeffbeer, May 24, 2011

Pours a crazy purple color, similar to the label on Welch's grape jelly. Immediately, it makes you question whether it's beer. No head, but visible carbonation bubbles line the bottom of the glass. Smell is quite clean. Hints of wild yeast, but in no way as powerful as most lambics and particularly weak for a Cantillon. The taste is smooth, almost like a perfect blend of wine and lambic. Grape comes through as well as the wild yeast. Sour, but not the typical puckering that comes from the top lambics. Very light bodied. Wonderful lambic particularly if you want something more mellow and smooth. This is one even a none-lambic drinker could get on board with. Tremendous. 750 charactersBlanco, May 24, 2011

S: There are strong aromas of sourness in the nose.
T: Sourness dominates the overall taste and continues to persist through the aftertaste, although it isn't quite as strong as the smell. There are notes of grapes and vinegar in the flavors.
M: It feels light-bodied on the palate and has a low to moderate amount of carbonation. There is some dryness in the finish.
O: The beer isn’t that difficult to drink because it doesn’t have an “in your face” type of sourness. 572 charactersmetter98, May 23, 2011

But that doesn't matter. This beer made me shriek for sheer joy upon its sight. Good goddamn it looks amazing. Smells funky, a little grape and berry action. The taste is barnyard, a touch of grape, tannic, woodsy. I was surprised I didn't get more grape out of it, merely hinting, but that's not a terrible thing. I'm just accustomed to grape sours tasting more vinous. This had a bit of that quality but was definitely more lambic than grapebeer. Good stuff. 581 charactersdragonWhale, May 22, 2011

Pours a dark purple/plum color with burgundy/blood red edges when held to a light. Completely opaque with a half finger off-white head that immediately fades leaving no lace behind.
Sweet vinous aroma with a very prominent dark fruit/red wine character. Nice earthy funk with subtle barnyard horsey notes and a prominent earthy oak barrel presence. Bursting with dark fruit, especially grape, as well as some currant and dark cherry.
Full bodied with a tart, mouth puckering sourness that lingers throughout over the sweet vinous and funky barnyard notes into a sweet, slightly dry finish. Bursting with vinous dark fruit, especially the grapes. A perfect marriage of wine and beer. Slight acidity in the finish with a lingering acetic vinegar presence that leaves me drooling for more. This beer is incredibly quaffable considering how funky it is. Perfectly balanced. 900 characterscorby112, May 22, 2011

A- a small fizzle around the edges upon arrival that diminishes very quickly to a mirror finish. Beautiful glowing magenta in color with surprising clarity. 
S- grape flavored fruit roll ups in a good way and a good sour and funk behind. More subtle then some I've had but very clean. 
T- red grapes with lots of the must that rolls into a nice funky sour hit. Oak is mellow but lends a nice complexity to the whole. On the sweeter side with the very ripe grapes really stealing the show. There's some lemon juice in the mixed with the tartness. 
M- about medium in body and very lightly carbed but its is of the hand pump and there's still a good bit of bite to it. Very tannic and dry, you can feel the grape must on the palate.
O- this is an excellent lambic and on cask its a dream. Glad to have had it this way and can't wait till the next time. Not as sour as some but very complex and at the same time very easy to enjoy even quaffable. 984 charactersoglmcdgl, May 21, 2011

S: Lots of funk with some lactic sourness, hints of grapes and earthy notes.
T: Slightly sweet and sour with lots of barnyardy funk. The grapes are a great addition to what is surely a stellar lambic by itself.
M: Nice slightly acidic tingling with moderate carbonation, finishes dry.
O: Another great lambic from Cantillon, great all around, really drinkable and refreshing. Definitely one of my favorite sours. 658 charactersAzurescens, May 19, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 750 mL bottle split with Sully62601 at the Amesbury Alehouse. Poured into a wine glass. Served chilled from the refrigerator but allowed to warm over about the course of half an hour. 
Appearance: Reddish maroon in color. Plenty of carbonation, but pours with a slight effervescence and not much of a head. 
Aroma: The funk notes are definitely noticeable and are a bit stronger than I expected. Notes of wood tannins, vinegar and a touch of fruit.
Taste: The Cantillon sourness is a bit muted at first bt really shines through as the beer warms. Big horse blanket and barnyard funk notes play a strong role here too. Some really nice wood tannin and vinegar notes in there as well. Definitely comes close to replicating a nice red wine at times. The lactic sourness really hits nicely after all the oak, vinegar and funk. Nicely balanced and easy to drink.
Mouthfeel: Nicely carbonated and very refreshing. Very light in the mouth.
Overall, another great offering from Cantillon I was thrilled to try. The lighter red wine and oak notes from the grapes and barrels make it a bit more balanced and subtle (but still just as complex) the other offerings by them. Definitely recommended. 1,204 charactersGosox8787, May 16, 2011

Medium carbonation with nice Cantillon funk and lots of aging potential. 333 charactersalampear, May 14, 2011
4.06/5  rDev -8.4%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - pours a maroonish cherry red without any head to speak of
S - Smells of tart citrus with a bit of stale mushroom and funk and some cab soaked oak. A lot of Brett as it warms.
T - citrus tartness, but not nearly as sour as other sours I have tried, upfront. A bit of funky barnyard and light mushroom overpower the citrus/sourness on the front of the palate.
Finishes with a nice spicy cab vinous flavor. A nice grape / vinous flavor lingers after it is all said and done.
M - decent body-more full than I was expecting and goes down nicely
D - pretty solid fruit lambic from Cantillon. I was hoping for a bit more from them but this is another solid beer nonetheless. Given it's price point I think I'll go from something else by these guys next time but still pretty awesome. 784 charactersbirchstick, May 14, 2011

pour was a dirty ruby red with no head. some of the pours had about an inch of ruby head and some had none. no lacing or retention.
very complex on the nose. heavy red wine and bordeaux, fresh grape, and sufficient amount of still vinegar. light oak.
very similar to the smell. heavy on the red wine characteristics and this is where the bordeaux really shines. lots of varying grape flavor. a fairly mild sourness through out. a very strong oak finish.
very flat and smooth. light puckering sourness and a very dry bone dry finish.
quite delicious. lots of red wine and grape flavor and mild sourness just make this so drinkable. quite different from the aged version of this. 752 charactershooliganlife, May 13, 2011

Sour aroma with a sweet grape bouquet. Oak aromas with a little bit of vinegar. Really nice balance between tart and sweet on aroma. Sweet port and cherry flavor with an underlying cellar must to the flavor finishes nice and tart.
Nice light body with crisp carbonation. Overall this is my favorite of the regular cantillion offerings. I'll never turn this one away. 461 charactersBendurgin, May 08, 2011
4.36/5  rDev -1.6%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Served in an Allagash chalice with a giant rose colored head. The body is a nice plum color.
The aroma yields lemongrass and a bit of wooden smells.
The taste starts out with a nice splash of fruit juice. There is a touch of sweetness in the middle, but the finish is full of sour lemon, making this feel very dry. I notice more grassy notes with continued sips.
The body and carbonation are both light.
This is one of my favorites. Keeps a nice balance while still having a strong Cantillon tang. 501 charactersandrewinski1, May 08, 2011
4.94/5  rDev +11.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5October 2009 vintage.
A: The beer shows a true red color, getting towards the purple a little bit. A bit opaque, good head retention (pure white) with very good lacing for the low ABV.
S: There is a LOT of funk in this. Very very strong smells of barnyard, hay and definitely horse blanket. Definitive earth-y elements to this. Then, it's all about the grapes and the lactic sourness. Good amount of wood tannins give the beer a very wine-like smell. Super strong smell.
T: Simply put, this is the best tasting beer I've ever had. The perfect balance of sourness (not as much as the Rosée de Gambrinus), fruits (aka grapes), barnyard funk, earth and wood tannins notes. It really is perfect. I really don't know what else I can add.
M: Very light and extremely dry. Absolutely perfect feel for a lambic. High carbonation (of course).
O: The best beer I've ever had. Nothing else to add. This is a beer that has been finely crafted throughout the generations. Although it might not be my favorite, I can objectively say this is the best crafted beer I've ever drank. Cantillon's almost "worship" of tradition is something that definitely paid off in the end. 1,163 charactersflipper2gv, Apr 23, 2011

A- thin red wine color body with a fuchsia head. Clear and attractive, head dissipates quickly. According to the draft list, the head is formed by the addition of liquor to the wort prior to kegging.
S- lactic sour aroma and red wine notes.
T- beautiful cross between lambic and red wine. Truly a unique collaboration.
M- a little thinner than my preference however very appropriate. Carb is light to medium. Body is interesting and fairly complex.
Overall this is a solid offering from Cantillon and truly an (expensive) treat! 563 charactersTheSupremeAJ, Apr 09, 2011

Despite what you may think, the taste of Bordeaux grapes is not present it. Found skin / grapes thereof in the strength of the bitterness of this lambic. The finish is tannic, oaky, slightly resembling the balsamic vinegar. Cantillon Lambic good but do not let the red grapes to express their full potential. 430 charactersThaCreep, Apr 08, 2011

Who can really tell these guys apart? Seriously, I feel that for the sake of whatever sanity that I have left, you guys are going to have to pick some sort of aliases to help a motherfucker out.
Anywho...this beer will appeal to any Ravens' fan as it has a great purplish hue with just a slight amount of foam that dissipates quickly. Looks good.
Smells very tart and funky with notes of grapes, raspberries, and oak. This beer smells just like a Cantillon which is always a great thing.
Taste is about as funky as couple of fillets of Atlantic salmon that have been forgotten in the bottom of a chest freezer for several years and now resembles a Chipotle burrito. Blankety and fruity with grapes showing they tart selves in a beautiful fashion that would make any Welches' lover just a wee bit hard.
Mouthfeel is spot-on for the style as it is light and moderately carbed. Thanks go out to the good doctor for sharing this gem. Recommended. 1,071 charactersLunch, Apr 07, 2011

Scent is tart, lightly vinger-like acidity, strong merlot grape and notes of dark cherry, moderate funk, only light hints of grahmn crackery malt. Firts sip brings the merlot wine grapes, evolves into a moderately tart, sour and acidic taste, but the strong fruit flavors cut through. Lightly funky and some sweetness. Medium bodied, low in carbonation, bone dry and slightly puckering. Quite the beer, glad i found it on draft as opposed to shelling out the local $45 per bottle price. 637 charactersrfgetz, Mar 29, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at The Trappist in Oakland during their March 25, 2011 Shelton Brothers sponsored event. 
Poured into a Cantillon tumbler style crystal glass. Color is a dark scarlet red, with brighter ruby reds at the edge of the glass when held up to the light. Half a finger of loose pink foam quickly dissipates to the surface, leaving minimal lacing. Some nice carbonation visible at the edge of the glass, streaming up vigorously. 
Nose is very vinuous, with sour red wine vinegar, astringent grape peel, light sour cherry, and sweet red fruits like cherries and raspberries and grapes. Earthy and woody funk, light oak and grassy funk. 
Taking a sip, the taste really follows the nose, very grapey and vinuous, some tannic and astringency on the tongue right away. Sweet red fruits help to balance the sourness and earthy funk. Finishes with sweet berries, grape peels and oak on the tongue. 
Light bodied and very easy to drink. Very mild sourness on this lambic, but lots of flavors to enjoy. 996 charactersnataku00, Mar 28, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Served on tap at Local Option in a snifter.
Appearance: The base color of this beer is a hazy cherry, with tints ranging from bright orange to walnut depending on the light. A very interesting appearance is capped with an light pinkish head. The retention is not amazing, but a ring around the beer sticks around for a while.
Smell: A fair amount of acidity in the aroma, tart grapes, vinegar, and some nice funk.
Taste: A full red grape flavor right from the start. The flavor is predictably tart, with an acidic vinegar roaming throughout. Some barnyard funk is present, although fairly modest. The sour flavor lingers after each sip.
Mouthfeel: Medium body, with crisp carbonation up front. The feel smooths out toward the end. Definitely causes the salivary glands to go into overdrive and creates a moderate puckering sensation, although this falls into the 'average' range of sourness.
Overall: I have been waiting to try this beer for a while now, and it did not disappoint. Due to the grapes, it has an obvious wine-like character, which is enjoyable. Whether it is worth the price tag, however, is debatable. 1,122 charactersKickInTheChalice, Mar 18, 2011

A: Milky, muddy magenta. One finger of fine, frothy, light purple foam. Hideous by any normal standards, and I wouldn't have it any other way. This looks epic.
S: Yup, that's a Cantillon, and yup, I love it. Barnyard, mustardseed, lemon, and cobwebs. Underneath the distinctive sour funk likes a subtle but distinct aroma of grape - skin, seed, meat and all. Perfect.
T: So sour, so good Funk, lemon, mustard, and tannic grape. Filthily funky, and absolutely delicious.
M: Medium body, high carbonation. Perfect.
D: Forever and ever.
Notes: This is by far my favorite Cantillon to date, better even than the justifiably vaunted Blåbær. The fruit complements the funk perfectly, providing a fantastic layer of complexity underneath the always-fanstastic (and, at 6 years old, intense) house sourness. I think I'm in love. 
On a slightly unrelated note, this beer was made all the more desirable by the fact that my sampling of it coincided with the spectacle of my friend attempting to shotgun a 32oz can of Cold Spring Moonlight. If there had been a can of St Lamvinus as well, I may just have joined him in the endeavor...

Poured blood red with a one finger off-white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained minimal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, sour, tart, very slight grapes, and slight acetic acid. The flavor was of sweet malt, sour, tart, grapes, deep dark fruit, slight acetic acid, and big citrus. It had a light feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this brew was quite excellent. I had this one sitting in the cellar since 2008 and finally got tired of looking at it and decided to crack it. Really glad that I did. The flavor was not only complex but quite excellent as everything seemed to blend very nicely together. It also had a great aroma that invited me in for more. I found myself drinking this one quite quickly. Good thing is is only 6%... An absolute must try for anyone! 904 charactersthagr81us, Mar 07, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52009 Vintage
Kind of a murky raspberry/peach color in my tulip with some bright white foam that had some staying power.
Quite sour vinous character from the merlot grapes with a bit raspberry lemon side to the profile. The grapes lie somewhere in between ripe red grapes and underripe green grapes. I generally prefer younger fruit lambic and at about 2 years old the level of fruit presence seems ideal. Has a very rich aspect of funk to it that's pretty animal like, sort of a leathery flavor. A really pleasing balance between sour and funk that keeps everything in check. Maybe couldve used a little more carbonation. Very drinkable. 639 charactersDspohn, Feb 26, 2011

Pours a deep amber with a light reddish/orange color. There is a small white head with some light bubbles rising up. Nose is very tart and a bit funky, there's a barnyard sourness that's uniquely Cantillon.
Taste is tart and tingly all over, very sharp and funky, but not over the top like some Drei Fontinen beers. There is a light grape flavor, but it's not over the top or very strong, and it's well balanced by the oakiness that's equally present. Mouthfeel is light, carbonated and a bit champagne-like. Finish is very dry and sour, just how it should be, fantastic beer! 659 characterskingcrowing, Feb 21, 2011

A: Pours a rather dark burgandy/brown color with significant haze and sediment, even when decanted. Has more of a head than I expected.
S: Ridiculously intense compared to other cantillon. Starts off extremely funky/vinegary. The only word I can use to describe this smell is vomit. Also has woody/spicy characteristics. I like my beers funky/sour. However, this nose is too much.
T: OK, the taste is significantly better than the nose. Amazingly complex flavor featuring strong oak, strong funkiness, vinuous wine flavors, tart cherries, red grapes, balsamic vinegar, and much more. Extremely dry.
M: Dry, tannic, great carbonation, relatively heavy body with a wine-like feel. 
D: The nose hurts drinkability a bit. However, the taste and mouthfeel really make up for it. I could definilty do a whole 750 or two no problem. 847 charactersmmercede, Feb 18, 2011
4.52/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5One of the freshest fruit lambics I've had from Cantillon. Bottled on November 21, 2010. Consumed on February 6, 2011.
Pours a bright, ruby red with reddish-brown hues and a ruddy pink half-inch head.
Fantastic nose: tart grapes; Cantillon barnyard funk; a tiny wisp of lactic acid. It leads tart and vinous, featuring merlot grape, sour apple and dark cherry. Then, damp hay and light oak, and a finish that combines the red wine components with the expected funk (like musty barn). Not as sour or funk as I had expected, which could be due to its youth. Greatly, potently grapey.
Fairly effervescent and lively, with a body on the lighter end of the spectrum. Finishes dry and tannic.
Really, really drinkable, though the tannic character builds as time goes on. I prefer the LP series to this, but not by much. A winner. 827 charactersVerecund, Feb 07, 2011

A- the pour yields somewhat hazy reddish colored body with pink highlights. there is a small pale pink head on top. the head lasts for a second or two before becoming no more than a crown along the sides of my glass. 
S- the balance between sweet and sour seems to come together here. it starts out with some red wine grape like sweetness and barnyard funk. there are soft acidic notes, but nothing over the top. some musty/earthiness at the end. 
T- the taste starts out with some of the musty/earthy funk that i could smell. the sweetness form the grapes appears next. man, this beer has some serious pucker power that after smelling it, seems to come out of left field. intense. 
M- light bodied with the expected low level of carbonation. very dry aftertaste. no trace of the alcohol.
D- the whole 750 would have been too much, so im happy that i had someone to share it with. intensely sour. im glad i tried this and would love to try it again. i dont think im in any rush to go out and drop another $40 on it though.

A: Pours a hazy purple-cranberry color with a thin white head that quickly reduced to a thin film.
S: Light, tart notes all around with hints of musty attic, sweet red grapes and slight straw. Pretty vinous overall. 
T: Follow the nose in the most wonderful kind of way. There is no acidic or vinegary flavors, just a clean fruity tart/sourness. Flavors are again, very vinous and similar to red wine, but sweeter. I get sweet fruits in the aftertaste. 
M: Extremely dry. Some gritty tannins are present, but for the most part this beer is really smooth. 
D: One of the better beers I've ever had, and probably my favorite lambic to date (even over Blåbær, my previous favorite). Thanks again Mike for cracking this one! 798 charactersscottfrie, Jan 29, 2011

Pours a cranberry juice color with a small white head that evaporates quickly from all the acidity.
Aroma is funky and sour with plenty of blue cheesy bacterial aspects aside lemons and unripe grapes.
Flavor is extremely characterful, even for Cantillon. Very sour but also quite sweet with rich winey grape notes and other jammy fruits. Very acidic, unripe berries and lemons. Tons of funk as well. Horsey and cheesy and musty. Some tannic/oaky stuff too. The whole gamut.
Dry finish on a medium, fulfilling body. What a classic. 750 charactersillidurit, Jan 17, 2011

3.87/5  rDev -12.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Finally reviewing this beer
Pours a cherry red. Almost like cranberry juice. No head but some champagne type small bubbles were rising. Color is awesome but the lack of head gives this a 3.5.
Aroma is the best part IMO. Very wine-ish with a funk. You can smell the merlot grapes for sure.
Taste is great. Tons of wine taste with a good funk. I wish it was a little more full on flavor and the sourness could be more but still an awesome beer.
Mouthfeel needs more carb. I understand what their trying to do with the wine grapes and stuff but I think it would be better if they were going for more of a sparkling wine.
Overall an awesome beer but pretty expensive. I would get it again but their too hard to come by and I don't think it's worth the effort. 760 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Jan 11, 2011

Appearance- pours into a red wine glass a cloudy hazy pale red with fantastic merlot/raspberry highlights. The head quickly falls off and a thin ring of white head forms a ring around the glass. It leaves a very thing lacing on the glass. 
Smell- first off is funky barnyard tartness from the natural infection and spontaneous fermentation. Then you can start to pick up on the oak wood and a slight essence of grape tannins. 
Taste- a mellow funk barnyard earthy goodness throughout. Grape tannins and oak slowly begin to emerge as you continue drinking. It has a dry tart finish. Very well balanced and a bit mellower than the other Cantillon's I've had the pleasure of trying. 
Mouthfeel- good carbonation crisp and dry light bodied with a smooth and dry finish
Drinkability- every sip has me longing for more....but it is mighty dry and tart so 1 bottle split between 2 people is plenty for one sitting. 942 charactersmyatomicpolygon, Jan 04, 2011

Pours a gorgeous red/purple. Looks like a crown jewel sitting in the glass. 
A soft funky aroma dances with the red wine grapes and mild oak notes. Nothing is out of place here. 
Taste is on point for a Cantillon Lambic. The sour/funky component is present, but less intense than in other Cantillon offerings. The "sour" part of the beer meets a *very* slight sweetness perfectly, with the oak giving subtle yet essential tones to this beer. This is truly a masterpiece. 
This beer is well carbonated. Light bodied, yet slick. Bone dry lingering tart finish. I can't find any flaws. Far, far above average. 
This beer drinks like the finest wine or champagne. A joy to behold. I am glad I made it part of my New Years Eve 2010 celebration. Pricey? Yes. But do yourself a favor and try this one if you get the chance. 947 charactersmondegreen, Dec 31, 2010

Pours a cloudy ruby color with hint of pink and purple, a finger of head on the pour. Nose is a beautiful beautiful horsey funk with a pleasant earthy characteristic to it, light sharpness from the acidity.
This is a fantastic beer as all Cantillons are but I was surprised by the level of acidity, expecting it to be one of the tamer ones. Beautiful bretty funk mingles with particularly heavy wood and earth notes, almost feels like chewing on a barrel. Light grapey sweetness, hint of tannins, and then a really tart acidity that sucks your cheeks in on the first sip. Man, I love me some sourness but this feels like I will pay for it later, hurts the drinkability a bit.
Still, this is a finely crafted lambic - the wine barrels nicely integrated so as to showcase both the barrels and the base beer. Funky and sour, fine bubble carbonation - gladly have this over a champagne for any fine occasion. 979 charactersritzkiss, Nov 21, 2010

Eggplant tinged ruby red color. Thin rose colored head sputters itself out quickly. Nice color though and not atypically lacking in retention for the style.
Aroma is phenomenal. Musty wine barrel and balsamic vinaigrette complexity. I feel like I can smell the earth where the grapes where grown and sniff each drop off rainfall that kissed the vines. 
 But I don't. Taste is funky grape sour, with what I can only think of as a taste of...um, antiquity. If I had a better grasp on lambics I'd try to delve deeper. But I don't.
From my rootin' tootin', down home malt and hops beer heart this is more wine than beer. So far my exploratory journey through gueze and lambic land has been interesting. Not sure its for me but I think this particular blend may be the turning point. 850 charactersdonkeyrunner, Nov 14, 2010

A: Pours a beautiful ruby red color. A half finger of a pink head that dissipates quickly.
S: A strong red wine element from all of the grape elements used in this beer. Also a little bit of a funky barnyard aroma.
T: A bit sour but not excessively so. A very complex beer. the grapes are obviously a strong flavor element here. Nothing overwhelms though. This is extremely well balanced. Some notes of lemon, red wine, funk and berries all interplay together wonderfully.
M: Perfect. Carbonation is spot on. The finish is smooth and dry.
D: Fantastic. This is one of the best beers I've ever had. I now regret not buying every single bottle that sat on the shelf of my local bottle shop. If you ever have a chance to purchase this beer...yes, it's worth it. 821 charactersCaptinRedBeard, Nov 09, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Review no. 400. Wow.
750ml, dated October 2009. 5 percent ABV. Purchased in Germany.
Bright, light purple hue with shades of pink. Scant layer of head persists, minimal lacing throughout.
Aroma is tart and funky, though not as pungent as most Cantillon. Grapeskins, minerals and light alcohol.
Flavor is excellent. This is a satisfyingly sour beer without going overboard, as many of the Cantillon brews do, in my humble opinion. There is plenty of ripe fruit with a mellow grape presence. More of a non-descript fruitiness. Dry. Big acidity excites the palate, but does not make me pucker. Bretty flavors are present, blending nicely with the bitterness. Nice and dry finish. The mouthfeel is light, but the carbonation is spot-on spritzy, with fine bubbles. 
I'm no Lambic expert, but this is a very well-balanced beer, probably the most drinkable and enjoyable I've had from Cantillon. Quite a treat. 908 charactersdasenebler, Oct 14, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +9.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750mL corked and capped bottle poured into a stemmed glass. October 27, 2009 bottled date. 
(A)- Pours a hazy blood red ruby color that produced a great pink effervescent head that dissipated quite quickly to transparent white bubbles. 
(S)- A dry, yet has some tart dark grape aromas with a mild creamy woody oak vanilla accent typical of wine barrels. Mild funk too, so very wine-like. Has a very subtle lactic earthiness at the end. 
(T)- A wonderfully acidic sour woody oak and grape fruit profile. Very wine-like as the smell, but has that dry, mildly lactic sourness and funk to remind you what it really is. Tasty and complex. 
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. A really perfect balance of acidic sourness, and dry woody fruits; nothing overpowers the other. A great character and feel because of this.
(D)- Yet another winner from Cantillon. A great seamless balance and feel to it. A nice acidity too. I would be curious what age will do to this. Quite drinkable for the style. Just everytime I have this it seems to get better and better in my eyes. If only this was easier to get my hands on (and perhaps a bit cheaper) would this be near perfect 5's. Superb both fresh and with some time on it! 1,221 characterssweemzander, Oct 11, 2010

A pours pink out of the bottle and it sits in the glass with a deep ruby red glow nice color for sure, head fizzes out pretty quick but from my limited understanding that's on par for the style
S quite funky, I expected much more of a fruity wine smell, it did have a little bit of a fruity wine thing going for it with some vinegar but the barnyard funk is in control and that's fine with me 
T still big funk and much more from the grapes, not so much a wine flavor but a sour cherry and purple candy taste that's quite nice. Big earthy flavors to go along with it, a fair bit going on here on top of the heavy funk
M to say this was sour and tart would be an understatement, big carbonation gives it some body and I think I'll be tasting it tomorrow the flavors stick to your mouth pretty well
D not something I'd drink all day but I had no problem drinking the big bottle by myself
this one was bottled a year ago and I'm very curious how the flavors change over time but I doubt I'll find out because this stuff costs big bucks. Great stuff though if you like sour funk 1,140 characterswordemupg, Oct 10, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A 750ml bottle @ the Beer Engine. Split with my wife to celebrate her birthday!
Saint Lamvinus is a good looking beer. Poured carefully into the provided snifter, it has a rosy hue with some red and pink hints incorporated. The head quickly recedes and is not really seen again. There's no real lace noted as well, but that's to be expected with Cantillon Lambic, especially when fruit is added.
The aromas of funky barnyard brett, acidic lactic sourness and grapes are very expressive and almost overwhelming. The brett is dirty and almost manure-like, the grapes are trying to peek through but are just barely there. Some vinegar and cobweb, basement and moldy cheese are also noted. Excellent and, if it wasn't just a bit overwhelming in the funk department, as close to a perfect authentic Lambic smell as I've encountered.
When I take my first sip, I totally get why this is so highly regarded amongst the Cantillon family of beers. The amazing sour funk is balanced by the flavor and sweetness of the grapes. This really does come off as a mix between a Lambic/Gueze and a sweet red wine. When the heavy sourness settles in and my taste buds become accustomed to the barrage, I get notes of herbs, lemon, mold, soap, barnyard leather, sweat, vinegar, and wood. An experience you need to be prepared for, this is NOT a casual sipping beer but, if you're ready to immerse your self in the Lambic, this is about as good as it gets. Slightly sweet, hugely sour, and funky as all get-out.
The body is medium with fizzy, active carbonation. The finish is sourness that lasts and lasts. It is pretty dry as well, and the dry/sour combo makes me want another sip quickly! But with this intensity, it just can't be considered excellent in terms of drinkability. For the price ($35 a bottle), this is not worth it over some other Cantillon offerings IMO except for the expert quaffer. But it's a very good beer and probably one every sour beer fan should try at one point or another. Save it for a special occasion. 2,015 charactersjampics2, Oct 10, 2010

Dec. 2008 vintage.
A: Bright purple color with a slight haze. There is but a wee head that fades quickly, leaving no lacing.
S: A noticeably different aroma than the draft serving. I detected more of Cantillon's distinct, funky barnyard scent in the bottled version. Aromas also consist of berries, grapes, oak.
T: Though the serving type altered some of the characteristics of this beer slightly, this is a world class fruit lambic nonetheless. Fabulous grape flavors, though more subtle than the draft version, wrapped in a sour farm blanket make for a truly delicious beverage. There is a nice tannic presence to the beer, as well. This is extremely well-crafted, with a myriad of flavors coming through. Balanced to perfection, I give this beer my highest recommendation.
M: Nice and tart. Lip smacking, puckering and fabulous.
D: A terrific example of what a fruit lambic can and should be. A another masterpiece from one of the world's finest breweries.
***
On draft at Churchkey in D.C.
A: Radiant purple hue with pink foam head.
S: Less funk and barnyard aromas than other Cantillon beers. Prominent grape scents from a few feet away.
T: Absolutely delicious! Cantillon sour grape juice, with just enough sweetness to create an amazing balance.
M: Lingering pleasant sour aftertaste. Awesome feel.
D: Perhaps the most drinkable of the Cantillon brews. Simply wonderful. It would be easy to drink this all night.
Serving type: on-tap

a - Pours a pinkish-ruby red color with two to three inches of fluffy white head and moderate carbonation evident.
s - Smells of tart raspberries, oak, grapes, light fruity malts.
t - Tastes of grapes, oak, wine, tart fruits, mainly raspberry and dark fruit. Definitely some great sourness to it, but not an insane amount; very enjoyable and drinkable.
m - Light body and low carbonation. At 6% ABV, a very easy drinking lambic/sour.
d - I liked this one a lot. I thought it taste great and was very easy to drink for a sour. The light body and low ABV made this a beer I felt like I could drink a lot of, and I'd love to again sometime. 710 charactersmdfb79, Sep 26, 2010

A: Pours a nice hazy, muddy red. Very vibrant in color with hues of red raspberry, bricks, and cherry tomatoes. A spritzy white head forms and recedes to a thin ring. Very impressive.
S: The raspberry funk is unparalleled. Sweet, ripe red raspberries coupled with cobweb, wet hay, red wine, lemon rinds, and hints of oak and vanilla. Sublime.
T: Sour, but not as sour as the kriek. Sour, yet simultaneously sweet, raspberries, dry oak, lemon peel, red wine, and awesomeness. Very balanced and dry.
Overall, one of the best Cantillon's out there. A tad expensive, but good for special occasions. 783 characterstreyrab, Sep 20, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This purple beverage, the 2009 vintage, trickles from the tap at Moeder Lambic Fontainas with a transient head. It exhales an aroma of blueberries, blackberries, black and red grapes, some pepper, and tastes, like draft Vigneronne, predominantly of fruit, with little of the funk or sourness that lurks in the bottled format. The keg imparts a thicker mouthfeel though, and the drinkability is unsurpassed by other grape lambics. 429 charactersalfrantzell, Sep 19, 2010

Special Thanks to Warriorsoul for recommending this beer when I finally began to appreciate this style.
Wow, really a beautiful beer. Bright Clear purple color with some tiny carbonation bubbles escaping to the surface. A light pink head forms, says hello and then vanishes. You are left with a pink ring of foam around the edge of the glass.
Aroma is delicate but very inviting. Some acidity, earthiness, certainly some vinous qualities and a bit of wood.
Flavor is much more delicate than I would have ever imagined. I find this to be much more refreshing than I had ever imagined. Certainly some grape, some subtle sourness with tons of wine like qualities. Just a touch of funk in the background that adds a nice complexity. Finished quite dry.
Very light, crisp, refreshing and dry. Picked the right day to enjoy this as it's hot and sticky outside. Cuts through that quite nicely.
I really enjoy this beer. I am sure I can think of an occasion to enjoy another bottle.
Well done. 1,097 charactersReagan1984, Aug 29, 2010
4.08/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42007 vintage. When I popped the cap the cork had a purple wet residue all over it. The cork was wet and soggy and broke apart when opening. 
It poured a nice purple-lavender color that was very hazy with sediment floating around. It had an off white head that did not stick around. Nice oily legs. 
It was an okay smell, a smell that filled my nostrils with very specific wine grape, sour fruit, and a little wet dog. It has been about three years since this thing was made so I imagine the smells have declined a bit. 
It had a great taste, a very strong vinous flavor that paired well with the funky flavor that only Cantillon can capture. Specific grapes were tasted in this, it had a very bold flavor that was very enjoyable. It was less astringent then expected, but still 'juicy' like the 2009 Fou Foune I had a while back. Even with this many years on this bottle it still captures a great fruit flavor. 
Very good Cantillon fruit beer, but I think I enjoy Fou Foune a great deal more. I need to try a more recent vintage in order to get the full experience.

A: Pours a surprisingly clear, and beautifully bright garnet red color. A slightly white/pink head forms that gently rises to a finger. The foam recedes to a ring, but sticks around throughout.
S: That great funky Belgian yeast is up front and center. Funky barnyard and horse blanket is just awesome. Vinous grapes that is up front. Tart, lactic acid lingers, but it is not dominate. 
T: Follows the nose. Tons of funky, horse blanket aromas. Musky, vinous grapes. Just as you think the flavor is gone, sour and acidic flavors come out that are great. Again, the sourness is never over barring. Vinous grape is the dominate flavor, with the sourness hitting much later on. I love it.
M/D: A full body that is perfectly crisp, though creamy at the same time, dry, and refreshing. Very textured. So easy to drink. I can never get enough of this.
A great beer that I have enjoyed several times, and every time is a treat. Because of the vinous character, this is something that could appeal to wine drinkers as well. One of those beers that is more of an experience than anything, and an experience I am glad to have at every opportunity. I can't recommend this enough. 1,318 characterschamp103, Aug 16, 2010

T-tons of sweet that plays throughout the drink, lots of red grapes and strawberry notes, a fair bit of brett lies in the middle with just a hint of leather to it, the back adds notes of lemon that seems to dry the mouth. the sweetness, as mentioned, holds throughout but is balanced and kept in check nicely.
M-this is smooth and creamy on the palate with spot on carbonation and a great medium to light body to it with a semi drying finish.

S - Fair amount of acidic grape with some tart aroma from some ripe cherry. Hints of woody/oak aroma.
T - Vinous grape and cherry is dominate. Good amount of tart and acidic flavors. Some red vinegar type of flavors as well. Very much like a wine with typical lambic tastes as well. Slight oaky and earthy taste. Slightly puckering finish.
M - Medium to light body with lots of carbonation. Spritzy, tingly feel with a puckering and slightly drying finish.
D - Fairly drinkable with a fair amount of sour/tart puckering flavors, but these aren't too strong. Would drink it like a wine.
Notes: Bottled 18 Sep. 2008. Very vinous beer that would make a good substitute for wine. Slightly puckering and sour but it isn't absurd and is still tasty. Definitely a unique tasting beer that is worth a try. 937 charactersFreshHawk, Aug 10, 2010

Color is a dark, clear rose red with a wispy pink head that fades quickly to thin ring and no lacing. Aroma is dry, oaky blend of red grapes and non-acidic funky sourness. The flavor is surprisingly less fruity than expected, dominated by a subtle dry sour with merlot undetones. Body is very full and smooth with mild carbonation and a long lasting Pickering sourness.

A: Cloudy red body (pickled apples) topped with a small loose pink head that quickly dissipates leaving no lacing and only a ring of bubbles around the glasses circumference.
S: Classic lactic sour aroma with the grape only mildly noticeable in the background. Could have more nuance and depth.
T: About what I would expect from a merlot infused lambic. The grapes linger in the background much like the aroma, withe the lactic sour dominates. Not much depth. Needs *something* that I'm just not getting.
M: Light to medium carbonation and a light body that still retains a presence. Obvious sour sensation on the tongue, but not overpowering and does not linger. Crisp.
D: Needs food to enhance the experience. The beer is crisp, light, and interesting, if not deep. Ultimately not able to stand on its own with regard to session qualities.
O: At $35 a bottle I expected much more from this selection. It is good, and obviously a cut above your typical lambic, but not great. I was disappointed. 1,049 charactersdpnelson1978, Aug 02, 2010
4.1/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Bottled in 2003, according to the cork. Pours a dark strawberry red with an absolute minimum of head. What head there is dissapates almost instantly to a thin ring, but can be easily refreshed to the thinnest of layers. All as expected.
S - Yep, it's a Cantillon. Aroma fills the room. Funk, slight solvent, cherry and other red fruit, tobacco, leather. There's more there, but everything is so integrated it's hard to distinguish.
T - Delicious mellow sourness greets the palate initially. The flavour of the wine moves forward in the middle along with citrus peel and the aftertaste is still refreshingly tart, but has a slight edge of tobacco. Again, the flavours are all very mellow and well integrated, quite possibly due to it's age.
M - Light to medium mouthfell with perfect soft carbonation. It doesn't need any more spritz, as the sourness takes care of cleaning the palate.
D - Cantillon continues to impress. Not as mouth puckering as their other beers that I've had. It's possible that the age had taken the edges off prominent aromas, flavours and carbonation and mellowed this into a absolute beauty. Incredible easy sipper. 1,147 charactershaz77, Jul 18, 2010

Pours dark ruby with pale pink head, very little of which lasts more than a millisecond.
Aroma is of cranberry, lemon, grass and oak.
Tastes like sweet grape and cranberry jello followed by a dry aged bitter hop finished. This is incredibly complex and changes significantly with warmth.
Nice and dry finish, but this carbonation is too sharp for me. I'd like it a little smoother.
Overall, one of Cantillon's best. Drinks incredibly easy and I'm glad I finally got to tick this one without buying a $40 bottle. 539 charactersChrisPro, Jul 18, 2010

M: It definitely makes your face pucker. Decent.
D: Once you get through the tartness, it goes down decent.
All in all, this was a decent brew. Very interesting for a sour. It seems with these types of brews, that you need to have a very strong stomach. I'd say this could be a good conversion brew into the sour field if you like grapes or wine. 744 characterssteve8robin, Jul 07, 2010

S - nice bretty funk up front with barnyardy aromas taking the front line and blending in well with the grapey, fruity, winey aromas behind it.
T - Flavor follows the aroma closely. Barnyardy with grape and red wine flavors. Sourness is less intense than other Cantillon offerings, but still very noticeable and a bit puckering. Really good and well integrated flavors. Very good overall.
M - light to medium bodied with ample carbonation. Noticeably sour and a bit puckering, but compared to other cantillons...pretty tame. Funkiest, most distinct barnyardy aromas and flavors I've ever experienced.

S - Not as much funk as I would expect. Clean and tart, you get a nice lambic taste, with a subtle but deep grape smell. A little bit of wine wood influence comes.
T - Get the deep grape taste, but without a horrible phenol and weird funk that I thought was coming in this. Quite tart, nicely sweet, deep fruit flavor, some cherry and a nice wine wood influence comes through.

Poured into a tulip. 
I could not find out the vintage; this was aged for one year in my cellar under proper conditions. The cap was rusted and there were streaks of crusted beer running down the neck, but there is a pop when pulling the cork out indicating good carbonation. 
The beer has a beautiful color, hazy, somewhere between pink, brown and purple, if you can get the idea; the long lasting foamy cap is pinkish, or something closer. 
the pleasant, and pungent aroma comes readily out of the glass, keeps changing, and getting more interesting by the minute. 
Acidic, fruity, musty, among others.
Body feels close to medium, with nice carbonation; it is easy to drink and refreshing, but the complex taste invites to a very slow enjoyment of this great beer. 
It is mostly bone dry, acidic and tart, but not quite puckering.
Layers of fruitiness add to the flavor without making it sweet; tannic notes add to the experience. Sourness, vinegar, and more fruits, keep coming up. It is hard to tell each individual taste apart, but they blend nicely together, and the overall flavor is absolutely great. 
Despite my lack of ability to truly expose here all the nuances of this beer, believe me, it is a great one. Something to be enjoyed slowly, over and over again. 1,317 charactersbrdc, Jun 02, 2010

Aroma is tart, funky, and definite grapes!
Flavor is fantastic...lots of grape, a good amount of tart, carbonation is middle of the road. Light and crisp mouthfeel. The opening flavor is lemon like...but quickly reduces to a sweeter yet tart grape. A very good Lambic from Cantillon. 567 charactersShadesOfGray, May 26, 2010

M: Again well carbonated. Super dry.
D: I think this was a big miss for me. This is the second worst cantillon I have had and I love everything they put out. For the price though it just did not do it for me.

This beer pours a slightly hazy, ruddy bronzed amber hue, with three fingers of puffy, loosely foamy, and mostly fizzy pale pink head, which scatters quickly, leaving virtually no trace of lace in the vicinity of my admittedly hastily-chosen chalice.
It smells of tart, indistinct citrus acids, farm-bred floral funk, earthy yeast, limestone chalk, and well-oaked, grapey red wine. The taste is another lip-puckering experience, the generic fruity acerbity overwhelming at first contact - tart red wine, deconstructed - grape peel and berry skin, a mild grainy woodiness, and pronounced tannins. After the expected acclimatization period, and some warming, the soft wheat and barley grains become apparent, with some other earthy, woody orchard fruitiness - cherries and under ripe nectarines, mostly - alongside some tame funky, earthy yeast.
The carbonation is clear and present, but quite fine, and certainly no danger (but it does make you actually think about it), the body medium-light in weight, but strangely full-seeming, with an egregiously smooth fruitiness, and not even within approach-shot distance of being cloying (acids, yo!). It finishes a twinge off-dry, the tartness abating a fair bit, the wheat malt dusting itself off, and more cherry wine notes popping up to party.
My previous exposure to beer blended with red wine (from Japan, at that) did not leave me expecting too much from this. Sacre bleu, it sure is nice to be surprised! This is a revelation, a lovely, fruity, and tangy beer analogue for the claret set. As a fan of contrasts in flavour, this works oh so well, and I'm suddenly craving some chocolate cake as an accompaniment, and pondering the Pinot Noir version of this. 1,904 charactersbiboergosum, May 22, 2010

Bottled 11/18/2008. The beer pours a reddish-brown-amber color with a white head. The aroma is very tart with some oaked notes. The flavor is tart grapes with some oak. The tartness is very intense but it is not overwhelming. Light-medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. This is a great sour ale that was worthy of being beer number 1500.

4.65/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottled 27 October 2009. My bottle says 5% ABV.
Dark red bordering on purple while it is being poured, but appearing cherry red in the glass. Generated a finger of pink head, that falls to a thick cap fairly steadily. Pretty nice to look at.
Aromas of wood, wine and tart cherry all whipped together. A certain underlying mustiness that is unique even amongst the wild ales/lambics I've had in the past.
First taste made me say "wow" out loud, as a fairly aggressive tartness/sourness was right up front. Next notable impression was the slightly sweet grape flavour that finished the first mouthfull. Oak flavour carries much of the middle. Peach comes to mind within the tartness, along with cherry. Flavour is massive and complex, each sip opens up more.
Very natural feel to the carbonation, it comes across as very fine but quite active. There is a certain fruit juice type weight and feel. Quite good.
This is a pretty amazing beer, meant to be savoured, and every aspect of it supports that. This could easily become my "special occasion beer". 1,055 characterselricorico, May 09, 2010

T: actually a pretty light taste. Light fruitiness, obviously grapes and some good, but not heavy tartness. Definitely Brett in there. 
M: Light as expected. Some roughness from the tart and some tingle from the carbonation.

Thanks to bnieman's dad for sharing this expensive beer on his b-day!
A - This beer is majorly carbonated. Evidence comes from a large "pop" exploding on the cork release. A big puffy pink tinted head appears on top of the clear amber-pinkish color. Low retention but it leaves small bits of lace and a hefty ring.
S - St. Lamvinus is bursting with a funky nose of oaky wood and a massively funky barnyard and horse blanked Brett scent. The only thing keeping it from perfection in aroma is a burnt rubber hint that arose from a swirl. A small kiss of red grape is there too but not a prominent factor at all.
T - The flavor is almost overpoweringly tart with strong red grapes with a massively funky oak, horse blanket, and a hint of burned rubber on the finish. Strong acidity and bitterness as well. The funk overtakes all of the other things to the point of destroying any typical "beer" malt/hop flavor.
M - Very light-bodied and extremely tart with a crisp acidic finish and an overpowering funk to it.
D - It's pretty drinkable for how insanely funky it is. At 5%, it's easily drinkable in that regard. You've really gotta like funky Brett beers to enjoy this one. 1,306 charactersBeerFMAndy, May 02, 2010

2009 vintage into CCB snifter.
Pours a light layer of fizzy pink head. that fades down instantly. Color is a raspberry maroon purple. Very dark and hazed.
Aroma: Sour grapes and oat. Very sour. Horse blanket and funk. Some cherries. Very tart.
Taste: Not very sour at first, but then all of a sudden it hits with sourness. The grapes show, but there seems to be some fruits as well. Nice oak flavors. Tart and mouth puckering. Horse blanket and funk with some leather show as well.
Mouthfeel: Sour and tart. Nice mouth puckering goodness. Medium bodied with a lower amount of carbonation, but not bad for the style. Ends a bit dry.
Overall, a solid beer. Very nice sour from Cantillon. I could drink a lot of this but unfortunately it is too expensive. No vinegar flavors or that medicine flavors that I get out of some lambics here. Very drinkable.
Edit: had the pleasure of drinking a 2005 bottle in 2016 and this beer holds up so well. Great dark grape and fruit flavors all around. Not too sour. Not acidic. Just great lambic flavor here.
2005 vintage consumed 7/2017. White head. Ruby  red with a burnt orange hue.
The grapes are still developing nicely and it still isn't overly sour and tart. Very fruity. Tannins. Tons of grapes. A bit of lemon acidity. Cantillon funk. Wet oak. 
This is a very nice bottle. Sour and tart but not over the top. Complex. 1,424 charactersmothman, Apr 30, 2010

Wonderfully complex and appealing nose...very typical Cantillon smellls...funky with a bit of brett, leathery and musty...tart and acidic, a bit vinegary with a bit of sweet grape fruity aroma...
Nice and tart as expected. A bit of a drying, bitter grape skin feel, more dry than other Cantillons. Woody and musty, great lactic sourness with that familiar Cantillon funk...
Light bodied and highly carbonated giving it an even airier feel. Crisp and so delicious...way too easy to drink... 771 charactershawks10, Apr 30, 2010

750 ml bottle split 3 ways, 2008 version.
Pours a nice ruby amber color, with a nice off-white head with surpringly good retention and light lacing. Fine carbonation.
The nose is sour, just as it should be. Very vinous and acidic. Fruity and tart. Light funky notes, with wet hay and other barnyard aromas light, but present.
Taste is just excellent. Very vinous, sour grapes, very wine like. Tart and acidic, sour and funky. It's the perfect combination of all things lambic. If this isn't the best lambic out there then I want to know where it is.
Mouthfeel is light, acidic and mouthpuckering. Goes down sharp, leaves a tingling on the tougue. Drinkability is fantastic, this went way to fast.
The only reason I've never had this before is the price tag. I now completely understand why it's priced the way it is. This is a fantastic beer and one I will definitely be buying in the future. Thanks Kevin! 1,082 charactersMistofminn, Apr 27, 2010

A: Beautiful amber color with a thick white head that settles slowly and leaves lacing unlike I have ever seen in a lambic.
S: Barnyard and oak are dominant, along with scents of fresh raspberries, tannic grapes, and straw. Malt is non-present.
T: St. Emilion and Pomerol make their presence known. Grapey, tannic flavors dominate, and they are accompanied by the funk, barnyard, and a distinct sourness associated with the brett. Cantillon made something special here. Taking traditional Lambic, and blending it with the finest grapes in the finest growing region in the world.
M: This beer has some body. Flavors sting the tongue and last for ages. It's finish is almost like a first growth Bordeaux. 
D: GET THIS BEER! Cantillon's finest, and may be Belgium's finest as well. Price is no option. Go out and pick up a bottle if you can find it. Very drinkable and unique. 995 charactersWYVYRN527, Apr 23, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Decided to pull this bottle out on Saturday night and share it with a few friends. Cantillon has been an obsession of mine since doing the brewery tour last fall, and Saint Lamvinus was perhaps my most anticipated offering by them, as I was intrigued by how the merlot grapes would be integrated into the lambic.
2008 vintage.
Pours a light ruby with a small white head that soon fizzled away to a fine film, leaving a few spots of lace clinging to the side of the glass. Unmistakably Cantillon in the nose, this delivers musty cobwebs, freshly squeezed lemon juice, tannic red wine and damp oak. Quite complex, deep, and a pleasure to nose.
This is far milder in its sourness than most Cantillons - either my palate has become desensitised or this is one of their most approachable brews. What really marks it out, though, is its incredible smoothness. All the elements of the flavour are perfectly integrated and married to a great body. Musty funk leads off, before giving way to juicy big red wine notes, a spicy woodiness, and finally a fresh lemon juice finish, which both quenches and dries.
Undeniably a world class beer, but not my favourite from Cantillon. Its really a testament to the quality of a brewery when they can brew something of such excellence yet you can still think of several beers they do better! Obviously this is a must-try for all lovers of lambic, and would be an interesting one to try for wine drinkers too.
This bottle was kindly sent to me by Pier-Luc - thanks for the great hookup on the Cantillon! 1,538 charactersbobsy, Apr 20, 2010
4.88/5  rDev +10.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A huge thanks goes out to Treyrab and cooljosh, two extremely generous BAs, who splurged on this 2008 bottle in thanks for my hosting them for our epic tasting. Split 5 ways, and poured into lambic glasses.
Once in the glass, the body is a hazy mahogany-tinted ruby. The rosy body is capped by only a thin layer of fine bubbles on top, while under the surface, tons of champagne-like bubbles cling to the edges of the glass. They hold on only briefly before rushing towards the surface, feeding the wispy foam that sits just below the rim of the glass, allowing me to swirl and bury my nose in the glassware...
The nose provides pretty much everything I dream of when I think about lambics. There is a big bacterial and vinegary sourness, coupled with a big bretty and cheesy funk. The Bordeaux character is somewhat muted, which is the only thing that I think can be improved. I don't know how this is fresh, but with age, it's phenomenal. 
The Bordeaux that was unfortunately lacking in the bouquet comes through nicely here. It is followed quickly by that cheesy funk from the nose. Wine grapes seem to dominate the middle of the flavor profile. The sourness moves from the funky cheesiness to a mildly acetic sourness. This is one of the most well-rounded sours that I have ever tried. The flavor is absolutely insane for a relatively low-gravity beer. The earthy finish is incredible and catches me almost by surprise. Nice and woody, it really rounds out Saint Lamvinus in a perfect way.
Despite the notable carbonation immediately following the pour, the texture and feel of this beer are that of a decidedly low-carbonation level. There is a sourness that flows through the entire body upon drinking. I am sorry that I only had 5-6 oz to enjoy, as I could have enjoyed the whole 750mL bottle myself over a two-hour time span.
Make sure this is consumed at cellar temp. You don't want to miss a single aspect of this phenomenal brew. 1,945 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Apr 15, 2010

Served in a stemmed wine glass
Bottled: 25OCT06
Absolutely gorgeous appearance. Definitely one of the prettiest beer I have ever laid eyes on. The crystal clear, garnet-hued liquid was capped by a bubbly, bright white head that quickly fizzled to a clingy ring of froth.
The aroma was quite unique, yet still true to the style. Funk and must dominated the nose. Super complex and intriguing. Grape-y with sweet/tart, vinous notes. Oaky, leathery and slightly sour.
The taste was exceptionally smooth and graceful. Overall, it was very similar to the aroma, except perhaps more tart. Musty and cellar-like with lots of crisp, funky complexity. Vinous and slightly fruity. Earthy, muscat grapes would be my best guess for the grape variety used to flavor this lambic (although this was not the case). Oaky and woody. Lemon notes appeared in the dry, tannic, somewhat acidic finish. As the beer warmed, the funk seemed to intensify.
The mouthfeel was medium bodied with crisp, lively effervescence. Creamy and smooth on the palate.
Although this beer retails for upwards of $35 a bottle, it is worth every penny. The wine comparisons are obvious. However, to the best of my knowledge, no $35 bottle of wine displays the complexity or the elegance of Saint Lamvinus. Every beer aficionado should have the opportunity to sample this at least once in their lifetime. 1,421 charactersDamian, Apr 13, 2010
4.58/5  rDev +3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I have had this before on tap but this 2006 bottle was an incredible sour and worlds beyond the draft experience. I split this among three snifters. Yes you want to share this one. It had a light white bubbly head that disappeared fast and left a thin ring of bubbles around the glass. The color of the beer was a beautiful reddish peach in color. I expect this was from the age because my tap pour was much more burgundy. There was definite signs of barrel ageing to the appearance as well
The aroma was that incredible unmistakable Cantillon funk. The first time you smell it you will never forget it. To say this brew was sour would be understating yourself . This is one of those sour patch kid type brews but with out any sugar to balance it . I had this while smoking a fine cigar and the flavor just cut and cleansed the mouth at every sip. It was not to say so sour that it came off a vinegar but it was more like eating a hand full of sour grapes or a tart piece of fruit. The carbonation and the mouthfeel reminded me of a fine champagne.
This is a great brew I loved it but I do think it takes time to appreciate a sour and the age of the bottle greatly changed the flavors from the glass that I had fresh also at $35.00 a bottle its not cheep. It was a great experience and one I will love to have again but not something I expect every day. Another hint is you have to split this bottle with someone who will appreciate it. There is no way I could drink one bottle myself one glass was enough at a sitting 1,520 charactersjoepais, Apr 11, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5At long last, St. Lamvinus. Due to the ongoing Cantillon shortage I actually had never had this until recently. Pours a dark purple with a slight cloudiness, no residual head, but lovely color from those grapes undoubtedly. Aroma is nicely funky and uniquely Cantillon and Brussels in that respect. Fairly dry floral character with some fruit/grape sweetness. The taste has that wonderful Cantillon funk to it, plus grape skins and floral notes and a dry finish. Medium bodied with a full carbonation, dry yet refreshing. This is a real tasty brew. While American brewers are putting out amazing things, they will never quite be able to do a beer like this. 657 charactersvacax, Apr 10, 2010

Aroma is musky, malty, yeasty, oak, hint of the grape and acid. Flavor is much the same with the grape coming out in the finish. Great body and carbonation. Finsh is like flavor and medium in length. Clean finish but not really a session. This is a beer for the true lambic afficianado minus the fu fu. 425 charactersdrpimento, Apr 07, 2010

This one pours a lovely, pink garnet, color. It has some very nice ruby red tinting. The two-finger head of loose foam has a pink cast to it. The retention is okay overall, but good for the style. Lacing is minimal, but has a touch of stickiness to it.
A very light amount of barnyard funk is noticed. What stands out though, is the presence of red grapes. The sweetness of the meats, along with the tang of the skins. A mild swirl brings out a burst of oakiness.
This smells very fruity and inviting.
This is quite a tasty beverage. It absolutely has a certain touch of 'wine-ness' to it. The merlot grapes are very flavorful. There is a nice amount of funk going on, but it comes across as very balanced. There is definitely a touch of tangy sourness to it, which combined with the oak notes and the merlot grapes, make this one finish very dry.
The body is medium, closing in on full. The carbonation level is high. It has a very sharp and crisp feel to it.
The low abv (5%) lends itself to easy-drinking. The acidity level though, would probably lend itself to heartburn. It's very tasty and to those who like sours, in general, it's delicious and very consumable. 1,235 characterscoldmeat23, Apr 06, 2010
4.83/5  rDev +9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Beer on draft, I was shocked when this was on draft at Churchkey, promptly ordered. Beer was purple and cloudy. Had no head and carbonation was low. There were a few bubbles but they failed to generate any lacing. Looks really interesting, kind of like grape juice.
Aroma is sour, citric with a hint of acetic, perhaps a little lactic in there as well. There is a slight sulfur aroma to it.
Minimal front flavor, beer is light in body. Drinkability high. The tartness gets you, its grapey and slightly sweet but in a sour and sweet sort of way. The flavors develop better on the back palate than the front. Its a great beer. There is not a lot of body to it and there is nearly no carbonation in the mouth. I really enjoyed it. 729 charactersdrabmuh, Mar 16, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Church Key last night. Fucking expensive at $16 for a 10oz glass($13+$1.50 tax+$1.50 tip), but it was worth it.
The pour is great, a pretty reddish pink with a thick white head that recedes to a collar, leaving no lace. The nose is just outstanding. Plenty of vinous character with the red wine grapes being fresh and vibrant. Apart from the vinous character, the grapes also impart a faint cocoa/tobacco character to the nose. The lambic base is equally impressive with a musty aroma, some funk and a pronounced sourness. Funk is quite restrained.
The palate quite vinous with the grapes lending a lot of flavor and depth. The sourness is immediately apparent, with the acidity working really well with the grape. The funk character is rather low, just mildly musty, though I suspect that the fruit is obfuscating just how much funk is present. Drying and mildly tannic on the finish with a clean sourness and lingering vinous character, this is exceptional stuff. 976 charactersDefenCorps, Mar 16, 2010

Thanks to sleepydave for bringing this one over!
Pours a vibrant red/grape color. Mostly clear body with a big, fizzy, pink head that quickly dies off. 
The aroma consists of ripe, juicy grapes, vinegar and bits of cherry and raspberry. Quite fruity.
Juicy grapes from the aroma come across the tongue along with some nice vinegar tartness to induce mouth puckering. Moving beyond the grapes are sharp cherry notes, some acidity and a dry finish that leaves a light taste of straw and cheese. Grape skins and dried cherries come out as well. A juicy and tart flavor profile.
Mouthfeel is light with spritzy carbonation. Decently tart with a good body full of fruit juice.
Drinkability is very good for this lambic. The sourness is definitely there, yet this is an easy drinker and quite refreshing.
Overall, this is a great sour. I really like the merlot grapes both for the beautiful color and the flavor. Nothing really stands out, but everything is very well done. I'd love to have a bottle of this to sip on a lazy summer afternoon. You really can't go wrong with Cantillon. 1,107 characterssisuspeed, Mar 13, 2010
4.43/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Received as a birthday present from my lovely and craft beer appreciative girlfriend! Very excited to try this one as it doesn't show up too often around my area, bottled in 2008.
Appearance- Pours a very pretty shade of hazy crimson-tinged purple into my glass with about a half finger of fizzy white head sitting on top. As per the the style, the head fizzes out to a thin ring in short order. Little to no lacing left. What really makes this one interesting to look at is the beautiful shade of the beer itself.
Smell- Very vinous smelling with lots of dark grape mixed in with all the other scents. Quite a lot of funk as well before you're hit with the lactic tartness at the end of the whiff. A lot going on and I can't detect it all, but it smells quite good.
Taste- Never tasted anything particularly like this before. Up front, it is again very vinous. Tastes of tart grape skins, a mineral iron-like quality, and a surprising amount of oakiness from the barrels. The oak flavors lend a woody seediness to the beer that complements the vinous, wine-like qualities quite nicely. Finishes with a solid amount of funk and a prominent but not overwhelming tartness. Complex and delicious.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Mouthfeel is appropriate and adequately carbonated for the style. Drinkability is good as well, though I couldn't drink it all night due to the funk and acidity.
Overall, an exceptional lambic. Possibly the best Cantillon I have had to date, though I do really enjoy Rose de Gambrinus as well. Try this if you can get it, as it is a unique experience. 1,574 charactersboatshoes, Mar 13, 2010

Review based upon two 4 ounce pours I had, each served in a tiny wine glass at Novare Res' Valentines Day beer and chocolate pairing. The beer has an opaque plum/cranberry hue. There is no head or visible carbonation. It is a beautiful looking beer. It has a great fruity, funky aroma. It is slightly champagne-like. A mildly sweet fruit flavor is the first thing I taste. Tartness kicks in as I swallow and lingers briefly. I am definitely tasting wine-like flavors (red grapes, mostly), but all in a great funk wrapper. It's delicious. It has a crisp, dry light body. The tingly funk feeling is a great substitute for the carbonation bubbles you can usually feel in beers. There is a slight mouth coat. For a sour beer, this is amazingly drinkable. It really isn't all that sour. I wish I had a bigger pour! It is definitely a sipper, but extremely enjoyable. Personally, I can't see myself ever getting tired of this beer. It is near perfect. 969 charactersToasterChef, Feb 17, 2010

Gorgeous looking and elegant glass bottle. Multiple slow pours into wine glasses shared amongst family. Not too warm or hot and a little colder than room temperature.
A- Light red/cranberry colored beer. Champagne like bubbles and vigorous carbonation. Rose' colored head. 
S- Barnyard funk. Straw. Vinegar. Tart cherry and dark fruits. Sour grapes. Couldn't keep my nose away from the glass.
T- This one blew my mind. It was a lambic, yet so close to being a wine. Puckering sour grapes, fruit, champagne, funk, tart apple. Refined and clean finish.
M- Very carbonated, dry and pleasant. Fizzy.

Pours a beautiful wild cherry shade of red with a half finger of light pink head resting up top.
Smell starts out with a light bit of tartness and cobweb, surprisingly somewhat subtle. Grapes, wild cherries, notes of chocolate, light citrus, and blueberries all seem to play a part in what is a mixed bad of complexity. Not too loud, but nonetheless still sweet and decadent and inviting. Some warming opens this one up a bit more and exposes the beauty.
The taste is immediately gratifying. The grapes and very noticeable, but do not dominate the overall flavor profile too much. There seems to be some citrus fruit creeping through, as well as a mixed bad of berries and some of that classic Cantillon dusty attic taste. Surprisingly not very tart, but still just enough so to satisfy that craving for the pucker. Truly a stellar fruit based lambic.
This one is medium bodied with one of the lowest levels of carbonation I've experienced yet in a lambic. Not quite wine-like, but starting to lean that way. The finish becomes extremely dry after the first few sips, so much so that I damn near feel like I can't swallow it because my throat is a sand dune.
Drinkability is solid for the style. I know the price on this is prohibitively expensive for some, but if you are a fan of lambics or fruit beers at all then you owe it to yourself to try this at least once. 1,389 charactersalcstradamus, Jan 22, 2010
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Light red body with a pinkish fluffy head that fell quite fast.
S - Quite fruity nose; grapes, a bit of berry & hints of dark fruits along with the musky & tart notes common to the style.
T - Sour but not as internse as expected.
Probably a bit more fruity than the smell with lots of grape & berry flavours with an abundance of barnyard funk.
M - Fairly light bodied and dry. High Carbonation.
D - Not something for everyday consumption but certainly something I'd drink again. 482 charactersbrendan13, Jan 21, 2010

4.58/5  rDev +3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle. Squishy cork and intense funk escaping the bottle got to me, I let it air out about an hour before pouring. Beautiful red/purple pour with a pinkish white head. After the first big whiffs of the classic lambic sweat and barnyard aromas, I pickup some distinctly winey aromas, lots of grapes, dried cranberries and a bit of oak. Taste is still very lambic like with some earth and a grape/wine finale. Absolutely fantastic palate, this beer demands to be drunk. As I drink, the strong sour aromas and taste fade out and make way for all the fruitiness this beer possesses. 579 charactersLuk13, Jan 17, 2010
4.33/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at Capone's in Norristown, PA.
Pours a hazy deep ruby color with opaque orange highlights and wisps of tiny white bubbles on top. The bubbles dissipate fairly quickly leaving a glassy top.
Smells of mild red wine vinegar with good amounts of Concord grapes and hints of barnyard funk.
Tastes very good. The flavor profile is comparable to not-quite-ripe Concord grapes, that is the sweetness is underlying but light enough to allow other flavors to shine uninhibited. The vinegar is barely present, instead giving way more to the funkiness that comes in midway through the sip and carries through to a decidedly tart ending.
Mouthfeel is good. It's got a slick thickness with very light carbonation.
Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could very easily have a few more.
Overall I've been wary of the price tag of a bottle of this for a while and I'm glad I finally had the opportunity to try it on-tap. Very well worth the shot. 965 charactersglid02, Jan 11, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer was amazing. I did the tour of this facility when in Brussels and it was quite an experience. I highly recommend. If you are ever in the are check it out.
I have had trouble getting Cantillion in my area, so I bought several bottles last I found some. This grape fermented version was absolutely fantastic. It maintained the wonderful Cantillon sourness, yet added a sweet/sour tannin grip from the merlot grapes.
It truly is an experience to drink this. It is a sad moment when the last drop is gone. 513 charactersMightyCow9, Jan 05, 2010
4.52/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bottled 11-18-08
Pours a beautiful deep, cherry red with a fizzy purple head.
Mouthwatering aroma; leathery, vinous horseblanket, stinky cheese. Pure and in it's rawest form.
It's a fireworks display on the palate. Grapey, sweaty, leathery, oak tannins, and super sour cherry acidity. Light bodied, not as dry as some other lambics, but still has some dustiness. 
This was a great beer, but I wouldn't suggest opening one alone(don't know why you would want to), it could become a little overwhelming. One glass will suffice. 529 charactersbrownbeer, Dec 27, 2009
4.48/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Split this last night with a fellow BA, from notes. Why did I wait so long to try this one? 2008 vintage bought at DeCicco's. 
Pours a beautiful ruby-pink color with a white-ish pink cap. Leaves some sporadic lacing and little retention. 
Smells "dirty" according to a friend of mine. Funk all around, but this one isn't particularly cheesy. Leathery with sweaty gym socks from the 70s you found in the bottom drawer of a filing cabinet in your great grandmother's basement. Musty vag and red wine vinegar with some sour cherry. Vinous qualities are there for sure, combining with a generally acetic tartness seemingly from sour grapes. 
Taste isn't quite as funky as the aroma would have you believe. A sharp lemony acetic start breaks way to the grape presence which is noticeable, but not forward. Underneath, a sturdy layer of earth, mustiness and funk increase complexity leading to a dry finish. 
St. Lamvinus has a relatively low carbonation and is impressively drinkable for a beer of this intensity. I would consume it far more regularly if it were less expensive. 1,077 charactersIneedabeerhere, Dec 24, 2009
4/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 406 vintage on tap at Capones
A: Dark ruby-purple body. Tight bubbly head. Not much in the way of retention. Spotty, skim like lacing.
S: Sour cherries, oak, vinegar, burnt sugar, and grape skins.
T: More of the same. Nice sour cherry boldness, and subtle oak, sugar and grape skins. An everpresent vinegar component. Vinous notes toward the back end. Sufficiently tart.
M: Slick and smooth. Lightly carbonated. Lingering finish. Nice sour/tart puckering.
D: Nice, but doesn't live up to past experiences with bottled Saint Lamvinous where the flavors were truly sublime. Not sure if it can be chalked up to tap v bottle, or whether the difference is due to the vintage. 674 characterscallmemickey, Dec 20, 2009

A: Pours a nice dark crimson with ruby hues. Very minimal head. Looks a shade lighter than cranberry juice, with a bit of tawny paleness to it.
S: Not the best aspect of this beer--smells a lot like balsamic vinegar without much of the underlying fruit coming through. A tiny amount of underlying grape scent.
T: Quite tart with a bit of barnyard horse blanket. The vinegar from the nose is not nearly as dominant, and flavors of grapes, berries, and red wine come through.
M: Quite dry with very subtle carbonation.
D: Very high--every sip reveals greater complexity and no amount would seem to be enough. 664 charactersThorpe429, Dec 20, 2009

A: The best feature of this beer. Looks like cranberry juice, yet tastes a whole lot better.
S: Strong, flowery champagne-esque aroma.
T: Sharp and bitter, yet fruity at the same time.
M: Light on the tongue with little to no carbonation.
D: One of the defining characteristics of this beer. Can definitely drink the whole 750ml bottle in one sitting.
Overall, a solid offering from Cantillon and a neat one to have tried on tap. 520 charactershoppymcgee, Dec 19, 2009
3.9/5  rDev -12%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4had the pleasure of drinking this at Capone's for their sweet and sour draft promotion. this was a 2006 vintage.
Not sure if it was the glassware or what, but while this style normally has a very generous head, my glass had none. there were some small off white bubbles clinging to the edge of the glass. The color was nice, a bit hazy reddish brown color. the smell was rather interesting, rotten grapes, funk, fruity/cherry. Cherry funk would describe it in a nutshell - but the funk is not a normal 'brett' funk - but something else.
The taste is interesting to boot, but interesting in a very good way. the beer continued to get better with each sip. not nearly as much funk in the taste as there was in the nose. tart cherries, subtle funk. great balance, somewhat soft, not overpowering. tartness was a decent level and nothing to scoff at. would be interested to try a more recent version to compare and out of the bottle as well. Glad I had a chance to drink this one. 978 charactersHophead101, Dec 15, 2009
3.9/5  rDev -12%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5I had this ontap today at Capones, it was a 2006 vintage. The beer was a pretty purple red hybid with a thin little head. The nose was sour, almost like a cherry vinegar. There was a depth to the flavorss, cherry, oak and vinous flavors combined with an almost vinegary sourness. A very dry beer that took me a while to finish. In the end this was a bit too sour for my palate. 377 charactersbonkers, Dec 10, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52008 bottle - Pours a cloudy carnelian red. Confession: I looked at the Wikipedia "list of colors" page & that was the closest hue. The nose features cherry, oak, and subtle funk. Upfront fruity flavors, slightly sweet but giving way to understated tartness. Definitely pronounced sour notes on the sides of the tongue. Oak emerges on the finish, with some lingering tart citrus flavors. 
There is no shortage of flavor levels here, yet their combination is incredibly nuanced. A masterpiece from Cantiillon. 509 characterssteeltown71, Dec 06, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Many, many thanks to ampzilla for this bottle. I looked for this one for a quite a while. Thanks, Andrew.
Saint Lamvinus is certainly an interesting shade of red. It's not quite pink, but far from scarlet. It lies somewhere in between. It's clear and looks a little orange or copper when held to light. A light pink head tops it off and reaches a finger and a half deep. Active carbonation causes it to evaporate to a surface covering quickly. Lacing was light and stringy. 
The nose is incredibly deep and smells excellent. It's kicked off with a very strong oak aroma that is predominant throughout. That alone gives it a ton of character right out of the gate. It is quite musky and earthy. Grapes are very prominent. It smells like red and white varieties were used. It's very vinous and does bear some resemblance to wine. A vinegar-like scent emerges late, but isn't exactly subtle. It's quite complex and smells delicious. Alcohol is not noticeable in the least. This is one delicious smelling Lambic.
There's certainly no dropoff in the flavor. Wow! This is excellent. It's a little sweeter than I expected up front. The unique blend of red and white grapes tastes excellent and is somewhat sweet. That sweet flavor works really well with the earthy and musky flavors. It is a little vinegar-esque. Nice and tart. Not quite mouth puckering, but certainly tart. The collision of the sweet and tart flavors produces a very refined flavor that's right up my alley. Definitely tart, but not too tart. Oak is the x-factor that adds a ton of character and depth to the flavor. It's the perfect complement to the vast array of flavors present. Alcohol, while not strong, is almost impossible to pick up. It finishes a little tart and very dry. 
Saint Lamvinus has a body that's svelte and very smooth. It seems more substantial and creamy with a little warming. Carbonation is active, but the bubbles feel light. It goes down far too easy. Did I mention how smooth it is? Drinkability is nothing short of excellent. I'm not the biggest Lambic fan in the world, but this is amazing beer. I've got a 750 here and it simply isn't enough.
Saint Lamvinus is one of those beers that achieved legendary status and it certainly deserves it. I'm always somewhat skeptical approaching Lambics, but this one delivers in a big, big way. I'll never have a shred of doubt about a Cantillon beer ever again. This one's damn near divine. The flavor is so complex and delicious. It truly is a special beer. If you don't have this beer available in your locale, it's well worth seeking out in a trade. Find a bottle. Thanks a ton, Andrew. 2,626 charactersprototypic, Nov 28, 2009
4.16/5  rDev -6.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Popped the cork - it tried to break on me, but I got it out without incident. Vintage 2007 per cork. Poured into a Rochefort chalice a beautiful violet, perfectly appropriate for a red grape lambic. Some bubbles, but not overwhelmingly fizzy.
Aroma is not too different from a Lou Pepe Kriek or Framboise. Green viney aroma with some cherry and wood - indeed, I think this smells like an Oude Kriek rather than a grape lambic. Doesn't smell as much like a glass of Merlot as I thought it might...which I suppose makes sense as this is half the ABV of a typical Merlot so you're not getting the full-bore aromatic intensity of a wine. 
Wow, now this is what I was after. Quite vinous on the palate. Very woody, definite tannic presence. High acidity - high sourness. Very, very sour, and bone-dry on the finish. 
Feel is spritzy, like a wine cooler, only far better than any wine cooler out there. 
Cantillon usually doesn't fail to disappoint, and this is no exception. If you're into vinous, wine-like beers, this is well worth the occasional indulgence. High-priced, but this is a time-and-space-intensive brew, so it's understandable. 1,145 charactersPatrick999, Nov 09, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thank you to Olieipa for opening this on friday. review from notes. 
poured into brewery tulip at just below cellar temp. a burgundy/purple pour with a half finger of lavender head. that falls flat leaving a slim layer of haze on the top. some splotchy lacing but only a bit. 
smell is a combination of musky wood, cork and leaves, slight wisps of sour grapes. at first the smell is off putting but as i continue to leave my nose in it and let it warm a bit i like the smell more and more.
taste has a slight pucker enough to be enjoyed but not slap you in the teeth sour. the grapes really come into play here. sweet and smooth. i could have sworn that i got a oaky hint here and there but it might just be my palate playing tricks. a nice go between of beer and wine. I would definitely use this to bridge the gap between wine drinkers into craft beer. 
overall I am very glad I had the chance to try this and would not mind trying it again. Thanks again mike. 966 charactersMauerhan, Nov 03, 2009
4.08/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 750ml bottle into a Bruery tulip glass.
A: Pomegranate/reddish grape color that supported a somewhat decent off white colored head that I found a bit surprising for a limbic. On the other hand, the lack of lacing was apparent...which I usually find in most beers within this style. 
S: Tons of wood! Like my buddy described, similar to what you would find in an old wooden cabinet thats been closed for quite some time. The grapes come off very wine-like and the sour qualities are subtle, but noticeable at the same time. 
T: The merlot grapes really come through and the sour punch is very mild. Kind of reminds me of a sparkling wine, but in red form. The wood is still there as well, but seems to be much more subdued than the smell originally indicated. 
M: Nothing too out of the ordinary. Nice light and mild carbonation followed by a medium-like body. 
D: 5% ABV and a very nice flavor profile...enough said. 
Overall: A great sour, but unfortunately...not the best I've had. A must try. Cheers! 1,021 charactersOlieIPA, Oct 31, 2009
3.7/5  rDev -16.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Served to me blind by laituegonflable.
Pours a deep pink-red colour, tending to very pale at the edges, with a filmy head of white bubbles. Little carbonation present, even though it was served in champagne flutes. Colour is nice for the style, otherwise a little disappointing.
Pretty sour lambic character on the nose - tending almost towards barnyard funk. Little fruit is present, except those that evoke acidity - lemon and green apple. I'm expecting a riproarer on the tongue.
Wow, much more subtle than I would have expected from the nose - certainly not teeth-clenchingly sour, but a marked acidity leavened by touches of tannic grape must, a light bubblegum character, and a crisp, dry finish. It does feel a little thin - it has neither the strong, pungent acidity, nor the sweetness to be truly full-bodied, but it's not a bad drop all up. Mouthfeel is crisp, but the thinness is present here as well.
Still, this is a pretty refreshing sour ale. It just lacks a little something to me - the fact that I can't pick what is in it implies that the fruit characters are what is absent. Not bad. 1,106 characterslacqueredmouse, Oct 20, 2009
3.92/5  rDev -11.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Pours a rude red colour, minimal head. Slow but decent carbonation. Leaves some pleasant beige lace in lieu of head, patchy but decent. For what it is, pretty good, yeah.
Nose is fairly sour with acrid qualities, but a distinct fruitiness akin to red grape tannins, with some cherry character on there as well. Sourness has a woody aroma as well, oaky mostly, and almost takes on a smokey quality. Pleasant nose and nice complexity.
Taste is quite sour, quite bitey, affair, with some vinous grape acid on the front descending into a dry tartness that has elements of citrus and yoghurt cultures in it. Overlying it all is a nice grape element, very vinous. Aspects of light bark, dark cherry and a lacquer kind of character comingle for an impressive and quite enjoyable palate.
Nice tingle on the mouthfeel, an unusual viscousness without being particularly syrupy. Leaves very dry though, and frankly the dryness is one of the reasons I prefer beer to wine.
Very drinkable overall, like a good young wine. Bit of an acidic linger but otherwise pretty decent. 1,065 characterslaituegonflable, Oct 20, 2009

Oak, berries, and some barnyard in the nose, as it warms you get more funk and some leather.

Dry and clean, with a slight puckering finish. 335 charactersnoeldundas, Oct 15, 2009

T= lots of great sourness. Really great grape flavor with a little wine in it. Soooo smooth and delicious. You can get a little barrel in it but not much as it warms the sour calms down and the full grape barrel flavor comes through more and more.

A - Pours dark reddish with a light purple hue. An off-white head fizzes up on a semi-aggressive pour and quickly slows down until a thin layer of white bubbles remain on top.
S - As soon as I opened this one up, the barynard must hit me in the back of my head. Lots of cheese, horse blanket, and tart, nostril-opening sour. 
T - A nice tart/sour funk mixed in with some dark fruity notes. A nice blend of the awesome funkyness, some oak backbone, and fruity sweetness. Not quite as sour as I was expecting, but the sweet grape notes really make up for that. I am digging this.
M - Light bodied and fizzy carbonation reminds me of a gentle champagne. Smooth and refreshing, really covers the palate well and finishes dry.
D - So easy to drink and so damn good. I really dig the funk, grapes, and oak mixed together. A perfect combination worthy of it's top 100 rating. 916 charactersSean9689, Oct 09, 2009
3.81/5  rDev -14%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5This stuff is finally available in Australia. Good times. Bring on Iris!
Pours a cloudy rose pink with a vigorous pink-tinted head. Wonderful to look at. 
The nose on the fruit lambics is never as complex as the likes of a gueze, and this is no exception. Red wine vinegar at first, a bit of iodine and funk, dry champagne kind of thing but not much grape character. 
More vinegar that other Cantillon lambics, IMO, but less of an assualt on the palate somehow. Tart apple & grape peels up front. Definite tannic red grape qualities, oak and a far more noticaeable sweetness (or illusion thereof) than any other traditional lambic I can think of, before the typical insanely dry finish. 
Mouthfeel is lively, with a little stickiness. It's not as refreshing as other Cantillons, IMO; not as bracing up front, and a bit too much residual sweetness in the finish. It hurts the drinkability just a bit. Still, I haven't had a Cantillon I don't love and this isn't about to change that. I wish this was on the wine list at my favourite Italian restaurant. Splitting a bottle over dinner would be the way to go. 1,110 charactersParrotshake, Oct 08, 2009

It pours a dark ruby red almost purple, with a very light pink. Not much head or lacing but it is surprisingly clear.
The aroma is very tart and funky and overwhelming from the start. Distinct horse blanket, tough to pick out any particular fruits. Its almost too strong in a negative way.
The taste is very light compared the aroma, the only traditional tart you get from a lambic is at the end and even then its still a light tart. There are notes of blackberries and cranbberries.
There is an ok mouthfeel nothing special and its drinkable for a lambic just becuase of its lack of s strong sourness. 651 charactersjrallen34, Sep 15, 2009

S: Blueberries & a bit of grape are steamrolled by barnyard & sourness, fades a bit as it warms
T: Grassyness with much tart apple, a touch of sour elderberry around the edges up front. Dry apple cider, much tartness & sweet tarts do battle as this warms, the tart wins, with just a whisper of booze hiding in the background. Finishes bone dry with a hint of raspberry tartness followed by puckery sourness
MF: Light/medium bodied with much effervescence & mouth puckering tartness, plus a bit of wetness
Drinks pretty nice, I am very up & down on sours, but this one is living up to its world class tartness, which today I like/love. The sourness is done right, I don't think I'm drinking salad dressing unlike some others I've had. Sour freaks must try this, I'm a malthead & I still liked this a bunch, many may hesitate at the price, but got a deal at $25 a bottle (only one there). Not an every day beer for me, but if your want to get your Lambic freak on, this is your huckleberry! 1,146 charactersrusspowell, Aug 26, 2009

A: Pours a beautiful ruby red with chestnut tones, although it's kind of hard to see in the dim light. The head is a pink hued cap with short retention and no lacing. I guess that's expected in this style. 
S: Barnyard funk, vinegar, earth, hugely tart grape / red wine, and oak. Really blasts the nose. 
T: Works over the mouth, too! Leads off with tart, red vinous flavors and balancing bitter tannins. Barnyard and hay in the mid-taste, but the vinegar really begins to kick in and make for a beautiful combination of funky and sour. The finish is neatly dry. 
M: Fine-bubbled effervescence that keeps the taste crisp and lively. Still, there's some residue toward the end of the taste that builds up and makes the beer mouth-coating. I never enjoy this in a beer, particularly in one with strong flavors. 
D: I enjoy drinking this, and I wouldn't turn it down if it were shared again. I just haven't really picked up a love for Cantillon and have no strong desire to seek it out [yet]. 1,096 charactersArbitrator, Aug 23, 2009

A: Dark ruby red with a little haze going on. A dirty white head that stuck around for a while.
S: Funky and sour! This is one amazingly funky smelling Lambic...but I love it. It also has a tart raspberry smell too. But it was the funk I was really looking forward to. 
T: Absolutely outstanding. The tart and sourness just stuck to the inside of my mouth as I wanted to savor every little drop.
M: It almost felt sticky inside my mouth. But I think it was because I wanted to savor it. Medium carbonation.
D: Saint Lamvinus drinks so easy. It's smooth and the alcohol is hardly noticeable.
Overall I enjoyed this very much. I had never heard of Cantillon until I saw this on tap and asked about it. Now I check it out on BA and come to realize it's in the "Top 100". What a treat! 838 charactersBigAl723, Aug 07, 2009

Light brownish/red in color. A vinegarish sweet/sour smell, slightly cider-like. Not overly sour, but a nice mix of tangy fruit flavors. Hints of several fruits especially apples and pears. Very drinkable and refreshing with essentially no alcohol presence whatsoever. 326 characterswebmanspidey, Jul 25, 2009
4.43/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Mine was bottled Nov 18, 2008, and I served it in the brewery's flutes.
Ruby color, very bright and clear. There is a fine white mousse when I pour it - it seems they got the carbonation just right.
The smell is pretty tame for a lambic, letting you get some depth behind the slight funk. Smells a bit cidery, with hints of cherries and vanilla.
It seems that they used a very smooth batch or blend of lambic for this. The sourness is very light, and there aren't any offensive tastes in the mix. Tart apple and cherry, for sure, a bit of ripe peach flavor.
Mouthfeel is crisp, light, and refreshing. There is a light carbonation, and a light sour pucker.
Very drinkable, especially for a traditional lambic. 713 charactersbrc, Jul 23, 2009

Poured chilled into a wine glass.
A - Red plum hued w/ subtle translucent quality. The bubbles of white appear and recede moments later leaving a ring of beads around the glass
S - The aroma pops out immediately with the smell of wine skins and fruity sour aromas
M - The mouthfeel is what I expected and more, light sweetness devolves to a highly acidic almost vinegar-like feel. A puckering quality like lemon when biting the flesh off the rind
T - A exquisite complex blend of sweet eclipsed immediately by a tart granny smith flavor mix w/ a mild fresh red berry flavor- possibly currant or red raspberry. The flavor is acidic and tannic with grapeskin elements but also the alcohol mildly affecting flavor. Mainly red grape and possibly some boysenberry under the sour and gentle funk 
D - A good flavor experience for me, so lush and highly drinkable. The hybrid of lambic and wine grapes and the very light feel for the 6%. The kind of flavor you want to sip, it has so much going on that it refreshes as you savor it. 1,173 charactersSlatetank, Jul 19, 2009
4.42/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Got a glass of this on draft during Puckerfest at Belmont Station. Served in a tulip glass, the body is a pretty orange color with rose highlights, topped by a wispy, thin, creamy layer of head. Aroma of wine grapes, peach, some general tropical fruit notes, and a good dose of sour, all with an underlying layer of booze.
 Palate is not overwhelmingly sour up front, but has good notes of wine grapes and ripe white peach. The tartness takes over after the swallow, with a sour, fairly boozy finish that has a touch of astringency. Body is just about perfect to convey the flavors here - more creamy than bubbly, it provides a substantial base that allows the fruit flavors to linger but never overpower the sour. This is a more approachable offering than the gueuze or other Cantillon beers, but is still deliciously complex. Well-done. 838 charactersElGordo, Jul 17, 2009
4.63/5  rDev +4.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I had this at the Cantillon brewery in Brussels, served by the man, himself, Jean van Roy. This was an exceptional treat in a non-exceptional town. 
Poured into a large, oversized wine glass from a bottle that didn't even have a label on it yet - beautiful light color, like a Beaujolais, it seems to sparkle and radiate an energy all its own. 
Smelling this is pretty amazing. Given that this is Cantillon, I was ready for sourness and pungency, but it really is like smelling an incredible red wine.
The flavor of this beer is not from planet Earth. It is like a perfect union of wine and beer. The flavors take an incredible amount of time to reveal themselves completely, but present here are traces of kriek, juicy grapes (both colors), tartness, grapefruit, apple, and a lingering astringency. Doesn't get better than this.
Drinking this beer in the brewery, from the brewer himself, is one of the great beer experiences of my life. Mr. van Roy was friendly, intelligent, and very passionate and confident about his beers. I hope that this brewery stays in business for centuries to come. 1,098 charactersraoulduke37, Jul 12, 2009

4.82/5  rDev +8.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750 ML bottle at the brewery in Brussels while on tour there 3 days ago by Madame Cantillon, Granddaughter of founder of Cantillon brewery. Purchased it for 8 Euro (about $12 USD). Poured into two snifter like clear glasses with "Cantillon" written on the side. Met fellow named Dan from the U.S. while sampling this beer.
A Rose colored red cloudy body with minimal light colored (light pink and purple hues) head. Very nice look.
S Sweet softened grapes smell, both red and white grapes. Gone is any of the bitter Kriek smells of other Cantillons tested today. The smell is simply divine. I took my time smelling and re smelling this to savor it. It cannot be improved IMO.
T Great explosion of various types of grapes over a minimal Kriek like bitter in the background. This is the closest beer to wine that I have ever tasted. It takes all the goodness of the grapes (their soft, drinkable sweetness) and complements that with a balanced bitterness that keeps it a beer. A work of art.
M Moderate with the grape sweetness and Kriek like background all happening at once. Lamvinus has a nice dry finish as well, again like a wine.
D Very drinkable. My wife and I shared the 750 ML bottle with our new friend Dan but we easily could have shared it between us and drank another one. 
Notes: What a treat to have this beer at the brewery! 1,358 charactersadamette, Jun 30, 2009
4.1/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a bottle at Abe's Cold Beer for $25. Honestly, this was a good beer, but not my favorite Cantillon. It poured a grape-juice colored purple-red with a short head. The beer drinks like a very dry red wine and isn't quite as sour as a lambic or gueze, but it still certainly on par with the good fruit lambics. I think the grapes here have overpowered a lot of the funkier elements, making this beer reminds me more of their framboise. I'd say this beer is worth a try if you can afford it. 497 characterstempest, Jun 28, 2009
4.68/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Mahogany / cranberry / glowing amber with pink edges. Head quickly fades, little lacing.
Smell: Balsamic vinegar, red wine vinegar, oak, bit brown sugar, funk, strong acidic aroma
Taste: Deliciously sour. Red wine vinegar, oak, balsalmic vinegar, funk, lemony acidity, leather with a nice mineral character
Mouthfeel: Grapes add just enough sweetness to keep this from being bone dry; wish it had just a hare more lasting carbonation. The tannins probably add a good bit here as well.
Drinkability: Give me this over wine any day - delicious! I really appreciated the 6% as well. 595 characterscraytonic, Jun 27, 2009

served in the nifty, klokk roeland-branded, stemless snifter
cranberry color. slight haze. wispy layer fades to just ring. pink lacing always slides back down, but is quite pretty to look at between each sip.
aroma: nice funkiness peeks in, punctuating the fruity grape and vinegar tones
taste: woody notes. tart grapes, mild funk and vinegar. acidic and dry finish.
light to medium body, with tart acidic texture. nice light tingle of carbonation lifts everything off the tongue.
aroma and flavors are actually not as complex as the bottle. but the carbonation here seems to be more delicate. the unique snifter glass really helps with the presentation as well. 791 characterschinabeergeek, Jun 27, 2009
4.33/5  rDev -2.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4A: The color is reminiscent of the pulp in a red grapefruit. Hazy. Slightly off-white minimal head that settles into a nice little ring of lacings. Very good aesthetic qualities. 
S: Pleasant qualities of red wine with tart fruity aromas (grapes). Beneath, the Cantillon signature smell lurks - Wet hay, matured cheese and yeast, rather funky. A delightful and edgy smell.
T: Plenty of tart fruit flavors with a prominent but subtle character of grapes. Noticeable taste of fruit pits. A light sweetness balances the tartness and the acidity that is gaining momentum. Not very funky, but there's definitely a taste of hay. In general, the taste have some similarities with a tart fruity sparkling wine. Subtle note of wheat, basically no barley. The finish is sour with notes of grass, earth, nuts and fruits. 
M: Light body, very tingling in the mouth due to a lively carbonation. The finish is slightly dry. Excellent.
D: A fantastic lambic, a real work of art. The character of a sparkling wine this one showcases is fantastic. Highly recommended. 1,054 charactersricke, Jun 07, 2009
4.08/5  rDev -7.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A birthday bottle for my wife that I chose on a whim, a bit pricey but the occasion warranted it. I figured that she loves lambics & wine, so....The bottle poured a brighter than expected purple with pink edges to a light pink head that dissipated quickly & left a wee amount of lace afterwards. The aroma had a sour vinegar and wine-soaked cloth quality. The flavor definitely evokes the merlot, but is more complex as it shifts in even one sip from a tart & sweet cherry to vinegar sour and then changes to a flat but bright, crisp wine. The body is light, bubbly and easy to drink. A very interesting beer, but definitely worth it. 634 charactersselecter70, Jun 05, 2009

S - Mix of red wine vinegar, barnyard funkiness and grape juice. The vinegar and funk are the mroe dominant aromas with an excellent balance given by the sweet juice aromas.
T - Rather sweet initially with the taste of the grapes coming through very strong. An acidic and sour taste quickly comes in and balances the sweetness. Hints of red wine vinegar as well. An excellent balance of sour, funky, fruity and delicious.
M/D - Light and crisp with excellent carbonation. A touch dry and leaves the mouth somewhat puckered. Easy drinking...an excellent beer and certianly worth the $30 at least once 782 charactersckeegan04, May 26, 2009
4.19/5  rDev -5.4%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I've been interested in trying this one for a while. According to the label and cork it was bottled in '06. Quite a bit of rust under the foil and on the metal cap.
Poured a murky reddish color with a very small pink head which left no lacing to speak of. Looks a lot like a cloudy glass of wine.
Smells of tart cherries and vinegar, both balanced nicely.
Tastes just as it smells, tart cherries and vinegar. Once again, well blended and pleasing. Reminded me a lot of their gueuze. No sign of alcohol. Very refreshing.
This Lambic felt much like many others in the mouth. Somewhat on the thin side, yet with a nice cleansing effect. A perfect warm weather beer.
This is one of the better sour beers I've ever enjoyed. Another solid offering from our friends at Cantillon. 777 charactersJBogan, May 23, 2009
4.3/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at The Publick House in Brookline, MA.
An interesting reddish color that looks a lot like wine, but that comparison dies with the big, fluffy, light pink head that crowns this body. Although it looks like it might have some staying power, that big head disappears quickly and doesn't leave any lacing behind.
The smell is earthy, a little cheesy, and the aroma of grapes, pretty much like wine, dominates.
The comparision to wine is pertinenet in describing every facet of this beer; in my opinion it is a beer/wine hybrid. My first sip I said, "this tastes like wine." A variety of grapes make this tastes like a mixture of different wines, and a good, strong, earthy flavor provides a backbone. This earthy taste is the bridge between the wine and beer flavors palate wise, but also because it is a characteristic I have found in both beer and wine. Sure enough, after you get past the fact that Saint Lamvinus tastes like wine, you will notice that it also tastes like a lambic with its puckering tartness. Along with that tartness is a sizeable musty flavor. 
The mouthfeel is one area where Saint Lamvinus doesn't really compare to wine. Very slightly puckering and with only a medium body. Somewhat dry finish.
This thing went down really fast. Sure, I only had an 8oz pour, but even considering that. This lacks the sour punch that other cantillons have, and this is one I think could spend some time in the cellar. Overall a fascinating beer, but I don't know that I will ever pay 40 bucks for a bottle of it. 1,529 charactersHojaminbag, May 08, 2009
4.47/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This 750ml brown, corked and capped bottle comes at 5%abv.; bottled on 22/11/2007, BB 12/2009, served cool in a large tulip-shaped wine glass.
A: the colour comes more like a strawberry-flavoured lambic, light purple-ish or dark pinky red, slightly translucent on top of very fine carbonation in action, while the thin, pink-ish white foamy head settles in time to a rim.
S: the pungent sourness of Lambic ale with all the typical trimmings (funky musts and tangy, old grapefruit peels) mingles with an aromatic main body of (merlot) grapes, with a clear gravity of lambic base, while mildly sour strawberry notes and salted citrus peels lag behind closely. A deep sniff reveals the depth of French oaks endowed by long oak-ageing, a hint that had already been given away by the cork's inner side as soon as the bottle was opened, actually; simultaneously, the richer note of fresh grape juice (hinting at fat, juicy grape flesh!) is accommodated in the middle. Overall, a true harmony.
T: supremely, if not brutally, tart/lactic-sour, funky, as well as nobly, intensely savoury (for an beer, that is) upfront, dominated by the lambic base where merlot grapes seem to have melted, with only the sour fruity bits wandering around... but, hang on, as the beer slips through the tongue, the Merlot-elements interact/converse with the remnant bit of air in the mouth almost like a true fine wine, generating a delicate whiff of oaky-wine aroma. Also, the tannic & oaky touch of a typical lambic ale expands from the middle of the tongue towards b/w the teeth, as the aftertaste turns semi-dry and tannic, showing lingering hints of mustiness in the end. 
M&D: the texture is quite "stimulating", due to the level of musty tart-iness vis-à-vis the delicate carbonation, while, at 5%abv., this ale seems to taste "heavier" than normal thanks maybe to the tannins brought about by the red grape skins. All in all, this is another very very good novel-lambic invented by this uncompromising brewery, although personally I think the white-grape counterpart ("Vigneronne") has the upper hand for the finesse in aroma and overall. Just finished the whole 750ml bottle in an hour and I still can't have enough of it - really quaffable for a lambic! 2,238 characterswl0307, May 03, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Part of a sour tasting. This stood out as one of the best of the night.
The beer is a beautiful pinkish grapefruit color with a large white head that slowly recedes.
The Brett is very apparent in the aroma. Notes of horse blanket, musty barnyard, and wet dog are strong. Adding to the superb brett character are the tart grapes that have vinegar notes with some acidity. The aroma has a hint of sweetness.
The flavor also has a lot of musty barn yard Brett to it with some tannin and a little vinegar. The grapes are slightly sweet and very tart, mouthpuckeringly so. I'm looking at my notes and the next word looks like fatsick. I think that should read fantastic. Other flavors are of oak and a hint of citrus to add to the funky grape flavors. The finish is dry, sour, and tart.
Light - Medium bodied with a medium level of carbonation and a very dry mouthfeel. A superb beer. I'm very excited that a new batch should be around soon. 940 charactersHopHead84, Apr 13, 2009

Smell: Wonderful aromas of fruit. Hint of deep mexican coffee smell. Downwind from the barn. Wood, dirt, earthiness, over-ripe strawberries. 
Taste: Taste of fruit turns into tartness that covers up any trace of alcohol. Strawberries. Pomegranite.
Mouthfeel: Very tart. 
Drinkability: Taste like they took cheap champagne like a Pol Clement and poured it over pureed ripe strawberries so you have the essence of a sparkling wine. You don't get strawberries from merlot usually. A rose of merlot in beer form. Enjoy if that's your thing. 
Pair with chocolate - flourless chocolate cake. Caramelized Pear salad. 644 charactersLauraAlberts, Apr 12, 2009
4.39/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Had this on-tap at Sheffield's sour night. Served in a Cantillon mini-tulip glass.
A - Judging by the other reviews it sounds as if the bottles have significantly more carbonation. The pour I got looked like it was a cask ale - just a bunch of big bubbles that stuck around for a while. The color was really nice - mostly transparent purple-red.
S - Sour cherry, Merlot, tart pink lady apples, sour green grapes, gooseberries, and hints of wood, funk, and musty barn. The smell is incredibly potent too.
T - The taste smooths out a lot of red wine flavor, and pushes the sour apple and cherry flavors up to the front. There's also a restrained sour grape-skin aftertaste. I feel like I don't have the necessary descriptors for a brew like this one, and that red wine loves would find all kinds of interesting things to say. It was definitely interesting and delicious though.
M - Dry finish - a bit of cotton mouth starts to happen. It's very smooth and thin-bodied, but doesn't come off as watery. The negligible carbonation is unfortunate, because because it starts to come off a syrup-like after a while and makes me feel like I want to brush my teeth.
D - Mild aftertaste, low ABV, cask-style texture. The only thing that keeps this from a perfect score is the outrageous price. It tastes wonderful, but at $40/bottle in Chicago it's too expensive to have regularly. Hopefully it pops up on-tap a little more often (albeit slightly more carbonated). 1,458 charactersMasterSki, Apr 10, 2009

Pours a very wine like dark red with minimal head. What is there is a crown. 
Smell is surprisingly subdued from what I was expecting. Grapes, a little vinegar. 
Taste is very good, not nearly as sour as kriek, nice mix of sour and grapes. Good, great even, but I'm a little shocked at how high this is rated. 
Mouth is where a lambic should be, relatively thin and heavy on the carbonation. 
Very easily drinkable but I don't think I'll stop back here due to the price. 571 characterssonicdescent, Apr 08, 2009

A-Bright dark pinkish red brown color, 3/4 inch bubbly off white head that stays around a long time, very nice lacing for its style
S-Wild yeast, cherries, dark fruits, red grapes, sugar, tarty aromas, rubber, lemons, roses, oak, and plenty of funkiness
T-Starts out with a big sour grape flavor, more fo that and other tarty and sweet fruits in the middle, finish is acidic and dry with a huge tannic character, gets even smoother as it warms and more fruit comes out including a nice citrus profile, really enjoy the grapey funkiness in this one, great yeast strain used in the barrel, mmmm
M-Dry, sweet, =tart, funky, and very acidic mouthfeel, light to medium bodied, tons of carbonation, taste lingeres a very long time
D-Could have a few more of these easily, it is six percent and does even taste that, refreshing and crisp, goes down with very little effort, very light overall, just the acid will eventually catch up to you
I have always thought long and hard about buying a bottle of this when I see at Holiday Wine Cellar but the thirty dollar plus price tag always scares me away, now it will not, this is truly a great brew from Cantillon and I would like to have more as soon as possible, worthy of its hype, recommended 1,384 charactersFloydster, Apr 02, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5It's always a pleasure to sit down with such a prized beer. The lure and legendary status of Saint Lamvinus makes is appetizing and intimidating.
The beer bursts with fragrance before it even settles into the tulip glass. A billowing head of light burgundy color rises with an airy and musty quality. Vineous (as merlots should), tart, and acidic notes give a little perk to the brow and a twinge to the jawls- surely sour, astringent, and sharply acidic. Berries, grapes, and plumbs are all represented well in the nose, along with a woodsy, dusty, attic-like, musk that gives the unusual character that only brettanomyaces can.
Much more fruity and less sour to taste as it seemed by the smell. Expansive flavors of vineous merlot wine, but with the body and carbonation of a typical lambic to differentiate it from the true wine character. Again, the tartness of the wild yeasts give the beer a lot more complexity than is usually found in red wines. Berries, grapes, and plumbs dominate with a close back-up of apple cider vinegars and a cork-like wood taste. The musty, dusty, attic-ey notes don't carry over to the taste; just stopping at the nose. Still, a briney-Orval taste brings a somewhat salty-metalic taste that adds complexity rather than distorts it.
The blend of yeasts have cut through the barley malts and reduced them to nearly that of heavier red wines. Still, a mild malt flavor gives a bit of weight, maltiness, and substance to keep it from ultimate thinness. Still, acidic to cut through and residual sweetness. Pleasantly astringent all the way, giving a clean, refreshing tartness that challenges the palate but never overwhelming it.
Ok, the beer falls a bit too far on the wine side of things for me. I appreciate the clean, well-attenuated malt and fruit blends but the beer doesn't leave the malt backbone that I appreciate most. The first sip led me to beleive that this 750 mill. session would be laborous and tiresome but after 45 minutes, the glass is dry. Very drinkable, the beer evaporates on the tongue and leaves a powdery, fruity finish. Understandible why this beer ranks among the best. 2,133 charactersBEERchitect, Mar 31, 2009

The beer is hazy, kind of muted pink reddish colored, with an off-white head tinted just a little pink. I guess it's kind of stereotyping but this really smells like a funky barnhouse. I'm not sure I can smell anything grape-like, but I get earthy mustiness and a little vinegar. This lambic is not as sour as I expected but still has a little mouth pucker after each sip. Mostly it's funky and dry, maybe a little fruit but I couldn't nail the exact ingredient without reading the bottle (Bordeaux grapes). Light bodied with low carbonation, addictive and tasty. 649 charactersTurdFurgison, Mar 21, 2009

Body is crisp and acidic with a delicate carbonation and a tart, dry finish. A well blended lambic that would pair well with a fine aged cheese. 493 charactersrye726, Mar 05, 2009
4.57/5  rDev +3.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I have had this brew at least a half dozen times but have failed to review it. Thanks to FooFaa for giving me another opportunity.
A-Deep,blood red raspberry with a thin off-white ring that retained well but left no lace.
S-Sharp sour tartness with deep wood/tannic astringency and a mild aroma of sweet red grape sweetness. A bit of dry erase marker in the background.
T-Tart red grapes combine with astringent tannins and oak notes. A bit of fruit sweetness sneaks in after the wave of sourness passes you by. A perfect combination of tart, sweet and dry....DELISH!
M-Medium-light body with a bright tart sharpness. A sour one for sure....but not an all out puckering assault!
D-Without question my very most favorite Cantillon I have had the pleasure of trying. I love the near perfect combination of flavours, fruity, tart, dry, WOW! I really love this beer....I just wished it wasn't so rare and so expensive. The beer equivalent to a wine spritzer. 959 charactersDeuane, Mar 05, 2009
3.97/5  rDev -10.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750ml bottle into tulip on 3/4/09. Thanks to FooFaa for sharing.
A - Poured an opaque raspberry-colored body with thin ring of off-white head and no carbonation or lacing to report.
S - Aroma is sour and tart with woody notes and grape sweetness. Nose features a strong, prominent paint thinner/magic marker character with a mild astringency. 
T - Very oaky and woody character with definite merlot-esque qualities. Some grape sweetness, but this mostly smacks of sour and tart fruit with a bit of astringency.
M - Medium bodied and softly carbonated with a light syrupy texture. Extremely sour and tart on the palate. Prepare to pucker up!
D - I found this to be more drinkable than the Lou Pepe. This is a very nice sour lambic overall with a predominant oakiness and an abundant fruity tart character. 809 charactersffejherb, Mar 05, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Picked up a bottle of this from Discount Liquors in Milwaukee for $27.99. Not cheap but I'm expecting to love this!! This is officially my first brew from Cantillon and I'm overly ready. I feel like it's my first time. Drank from a wine glass as directed on bottle.
Bottled in 2004 with some obvious leakage under the foil and a soft, slightly damp cork.
Appearance- Pours an absolutely beautiful crystal clear pinkish red with a perfectly delicate, perfectly soft lightly colored pinkish white head. The cap and collar remain the entire time but somehow not much lacing is left behind.
Smell- Wow, the funkiest brew I've had the privilege of sniffing to date. Cheesy and sweaty dirty it smells as if this brew hasn't bathed in 5 years. The mustiness is very earthy and mushroom like and this become more apparent as it warms. Vinous and sour this bad boy has a lot going on. Cidery with sorts of a balsamic or, probably more appropriate, red wine vinegar like aspect that I love. My mouths a watering.
Taste- Now this is a treat!! Super acidic and tart from the first sip, a vinegary sort of dryness just engulfs my entire mouth. The grapes are light and fruity and play a bigger part in the taste than the nose. Supremely sour and puckering at first but once your mouth adjusts this thing becomes smooth and funky. Murky and earthy the horsehair is way lighter in the taste than the nose but it's still moderately (and perfectly might I add) dirty. Finishes with a sort acidic vinous bite that is slightly fruity and lingers for quite some time.
Mouthfeel- Light to medium feel with sharp aggressive carbonation and dry finish. The beer is very quenching and it sticks with me.
Drinkability- The first drink really socks ya in the throat. Once you acclimate though it become VERY drinkable and hella enjoyable. The balance between funk and fruit is almost perfect and after smelling the beer I would have never have guessed. Absolutely fantastic brew that I'm o-so-glad I payed the price for. Can't wait to dig into more of these Cantillon brews in the near future. 2,069 charactersyounger35, Feb 25, 2009
4.7/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Pours an interesting shade of lavender coming close to purple. There could be a hint of brown in there as well. Head is minimal and only covers the beer with a thin pinkish cap. Retention is hard to gauge given the amount of head. More lace is left around the glass than expected. 
S - Aroma starts out sour with hints of grape and cherry. They quickly fade to reveal a funky wood aroma that really catches the nose off guard. A little more barnyard than expected. Old wet hay and wood stand out more than anything. Comes back to subtle grape and yeast at the end. Starts to become just a tad metallic as it warms. 
T - Sour grape punches the taste buds immediately. The sour feel goes away to reveal one of the most delicate tasting brews I've ever had. The barnyard that was present in the aroma is very subdued in the flavor. Touches of hay, belgian yeast, oak, and apple all have a showing throughout the flavor. It all comes back to an absolutely lovely grape flavor that is hard to describe in the words of mere mortals. The flavor of this beer works great all around. 
M - Lighter bodied with a carbonation that reveals itself at each passing sip. Minimal but good for this particular brew. Finishes a little tart and dry. Very clean given all the flavors. 
D - Drinkability is very good. Alcohol is hard to pick up over the other flavors. Everything comes together in this brew to make something very special. I would say the nose could use some work but the flavor really takes over and you really just forget about the aroma after the second sip. Cantillon really hit on a gold mine with this beer. Highly...highly recommended. 1,645 characterscsmiley, Feb 21, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +5.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours out a perfectly hazy red, almost a light purple. There was very little head. I poured it slowly, of course, but using the same procedure with any other wild ale has given me an inch or more of head. The smell is kind of hard to pick up on with such a small head, but I can get this oxidized red wine scent immediately. Definitely a good, strong wild yeast character. The taste is what really shines. There's the standard wild ale, the tart, sour candy sitting on top of a lighter bodied red wine. Kind of a vinegar taste, really a great example of a lambic, though I've never had one with grapes. The mouthfeel is right on, none of the chalky tartness, not overcarbonated, great. And I sped through this one, loving every drop, and it may not hit me too hard at 6%. I know its expensive, but don't give it a pass if you can afford it. 840 characterstaylorhamrick, Feb 15, 2009
4.5/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks go to Mudpuppet for trading me this one.
Bottled in 2007. Poured in a big wine glass at 56F/13C.
Deep hazy red-magenta color, ring of whitish froth, blots of lace.
Intoxicating aroma. Powerfully sour, fruity, and complex. Plenty of fresh juicy red grape juice, with apples, sour pineapples, wood, moderate funk, red wine vinegar, a touch of smoke, and indescribable wonderfulness.
Tastes plenty sour. Fairly dry, with just a touch of balancing sweetness. Big complex fruity woody web of flavors. A bit of vinegar, not too much. Long tart woody finish.
Low carbonation, but there are enough tiny tiny bubbles to coalesce into something surprisingly creamy on the tongue, and there's some nice astringency too. Very drinkable and refreshing.
Great great beer. 770 charactersBeerzebub, Feb 11, 2009
4.03/5  rDev -9%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4The cork says brewed in 2007. I say this was $34 at Julio's with the Wild Six discount. 750 ml corked and capped. No pop of the cork whatsoever; slight redness on the inside of the cap. Well, here it is, review #500...
Pours a darker Rose red with slight wisps up top - really no head at all. I enjoy the blue/purple translucent tinge topping this effort. Body is surprisingly clean - only mild haze. Slightly viscous.
Well, there's a raspy veneer on the nose. Really, it's a bit of a wet paint smell. Actually quite a bit of it. There's some perfumish acidity from the Merlot specimens. Let's see what happens to this.
Man, the clean sourness of this deal is stellar. Huge Brett lemon funk is positively electric. The husky tannins of the grapes come out in taste where they were not on the nose. Oak is huge and has that dry splintery feel. The wet paint briefly comes back so it's a little weird but it fortunately exits quickly.
I'm trying to figure out the palate with this. There's a hint of funk here and it's very disconcerting. It's really all over the place. Electricity, tang and funk and this weird paint thing. Huh.
For a style that's very difficult to drink this does OK. Sip over an evening...interestingly I enjoyed this with a leftover beef stew, courtesy of the beautiful bride. It really balanced the overall meal out well. This one's a real trip. 1,371 charactersIBUnit63, Feb 03, 2009

4.55/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4More things kept coming up from the cellar during our New Year's bash... props to Jason for saving me the $30 to try this. Undetermined vintage 'cause I forgot to look!
Pours a red, hazy blood-orange color. Thin, pretty, the 3cm head stays and stays. No lace. Smell is intense, wild funk, not quite barnyard, more citric-acidic, gueuze like. Some brett here, oak dryness, sweet and tender grape tannins, tart, strong, aromatic and mouth-watering.
Shockingly good, St. Lamvinus wallops my palate with a host of aggressive flavors! Sour lemon citrus funk is first, followed by a strong supporting cast of red grapes, woody barrel, a sharp dryness reminiscent of red wine (surprise!), and a lingering fruit-sour interplay in the finish that is just sweet enough to take the best of the sour edge off. The lambic-sour is forward, while the red grape and everything else is on the perimeter. While I was expecting a stronger wine component, to say this is anything short of exceptional would be an understatement.
Mouthfeel is thin, finely carbonated. Finishes very dry and citrusy-funky, while those grapes dance over the tongue.
Like many beers of this type, 6 ounces is more than enough... or so I thought... now my glass is empty and I crave more! Help!
If you like Lambics or sour beers of any type, you should try this beer. If you like those AND enjoy wine, you must get this at all costs! You now know where your next $30 will be spent. It is absolutely worth the price, just know what you're getting into.
St. Lamvinus is exceptional, bold, and another world-class sour beer from Cantillon. 1,600 characterskkipple, Jan 03, 2009
3.02/5  rDev -31.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2.5A: Pours a flat amber hue with not fizz at all. Flat in the glass, with the appearence of a glass of wine.
S: Very vineous, winey, with a touch of oak and red berries.
T: Oaky goodness up front with a big blast of sour. Cherries and raspberrys stand out. It is very muddy, and earthy with tannic fruit skins standing out. The finish is almost like a bad vinegar.
M: Medium in body, flat.
D: Not really. I usually like a small serving of the style, but this one just did not do it for me. It a too much vinegar flavor going on and the flavors did not seem to meld well.
It is not one I will revisit at the price it is offered. 630 characterstpd975, Jan 03, 2009
3.58/5  rDev -19.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Had at Falling Rock Tap House during my Denver trip last week. Served in a 750ml bottle ($62) that Roberts and I split. Poured into a snifter. It's bar lighting so hard to nail down the color but looks to be ruby red. Some carb but no lacing. It had a small head that quickly settled to a thin collar. 
The aroma was very funky. It was a heavy barnyard/manure smell. Almost smelled like a sewage plant on a hot day. Not saying that to slam it but it was that funky and had that distinct an aroma. Was a bit off-putting. Roberts disagreed with me on the aroma and didn't get the sewer smell. We pretty agreed on every other beer that weekend so odd that we were so off on this one. I couldn't get past the sewage connotation so really impacted the aroma score for me. The taste fortunately didn't taste anything like the smell. It was moderately sour and had a light finish. Was expecting more from it. The mouthfeel had a good carb tickle.
Overall, it was a good but not great and not a top 100 in my opinion. For the price ($62), it was definitely not worth it. Wouldn't mind trying again to see if we had a bad bottle or something but only if someone else is paying ;-). Can't really recommend unless you can get a free taste of it. 1,236 charactersTexIndy, Dec 15, 2008

Poured a slightly hazy purpley red. It's a light plum color with a thin thin ring of white bubbles that doesn't hang around too long. 
Aromas is very vinous, full of loads of berries and new oak. Funky, sour, but also some sweetness. Blueberry, raspberry, some cranberry, Acai. Clay earth. Red Wine Vinegar. Really great nose. 
Taste is tart. The lambic taste really expresses itself here, where as on the nose it is much more wine like. Pucker inducing at times, but very refreshing...super dry on the finish. Barnyardy and funky.
Super complex and amazing beer. I wish we had brought back a few more bottles of this. 690 charactersDaggerEyes, Oct 12, 2008
3.99/5  rDev -9.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured this unique beer from a 750mL bottle.
A- The pour reveals a plum-red beer with medium carbonation that moves up the side of the glass. The off-white / slightly pink head dissipates into a nearly non-existent ring that sits on top throughout consumption.
S- There was a smell of sourness with slight fruit after tones.
T- Do not serve this beer cold! Initially, all I could taste was sourness everywhere. However, after I let the beer sit for awhile a tart fruit taste developed that made it ever so much more enjoyable.
M- Smooth with the perfect amount of carbonation. Although the tartness made my mouth pucker up at points, there was some mysterious force that kept pulling me back for more.
D- Given the tartness and the low alcohol content, I could definitely drink this beer for a while.
Overall, a very unique beer that is definitely worth a try! The acidic quality offers an interesting mix of beer and wine composition. Maybe I will let the next one sit in the cellar for awhile. 1,001 charactersrhinos00, Oct 09, 2008

Poured into a tulip, it sits more like a wine than a beer. Smell is a mix of sour tartness, hints of fruit, and a bit of funk. The taste is outstanding. Some funky and sour flavors hit up front and last throughout. The merlot grapes used in this brew are present as well, adding shades of wine to the overall flavor profile. Mouthfeel is well carbonated, and has a nice sour bite to it. Overall, this is a fantastic brew, and worthy of its reputation. Definitely not an everyday brew, but worth breaking out from time to time. 604 charactersYonderWanderer, Oct 07, 2008
2.34/5  rDev -47.2%look: 4 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2A clear, purple red beer with a thin head and very little carbonation. 
Smell is very acidic and has grapeskin tannic notes. This is a real crossover between wine and beer, although it's smell leans far more towards red wine. 
Taste is mouthfuckering sour. Very astringent like eating on a grapeseed. The taste is only wine. The sourness reminds of the lambic, but other than that the beer is just an acidic wine. 415 charactersAbsumaster, Oct 05, 2008

S: Sour yet sweet, with a distinct barnyard scent. Lots of berries and some fresh herbs, with some other fruits also making an entrance (grapes, dark cherries). 
T: A truly great lambic. Lots of berries and grapes, with an acidic finish. Very tangy and funky. Lots of great lambic character. A touch of merlot/bordeaux on the aftertaste, but not as much as I expected.
M: Soft and slightly chewy. Medium bodied. Acidity provides a nice, mid-palate tingle, but it finishes clean.

Pours a cloudy garnet with a thin, wispy head that disappears in seconds. Cherries, grapes, oak, red wine, and vinegar on the nose. Sour grapes & cherries hit first, with oakiness and sweet fruit flavors following. Very rich & complex. Tart for sure, but not overpowering, with the sweeter side providing a nice balance. Finishes crisp & dry.
This is the kind of sour that American brewers are trying to emulate. Easily up there with the best. 474 characters0110x011, Sep 10, 2008

Pours a beautiful glowing ruby red color with a stark white head that has a tiny tiny touch of pink to it. Nose is super duper tart with alot of brett funk and sugar. Taste follows. Tart and funky as hell with a ton of wild flavor and puckering sour taste. some great fruitiness towards the end of the drag. Very dry finish. Mouthfeel is great and wonderfully dry with ample carbonation for the style. Drinkability is the best I have ever had for the style. A wonderful offering from Cantillon, and one I would love to have a couple bottles of in the cellar. Awesome lambic and one I certainly recommend to any sour beer enthusiast. Now if they could just make it a little bit cheaper! 743 charactersAKBelgianBeast, Aug 10, 2008
4.22/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle dated 2004
Pours an interesting mixture of colors. Seemingly pale red, or dark pink, with some deep amber hues as well. No real head on the initial pour, but a thin bubbley coating resides on top of the beer.
The aroma is incredible. Quite pungent. Big notes of Brett, making your mouth water just from the suggestion of tartness. Some tones of oak, slightly vinous, and slightly floral as well. A little bite to it as well.
Taste is fantastic. Not nearly as sour as I had assumed, but quite tart indeed. Some vinous qualities, light and refreshing berry. A nice tartness with a touch of the oak. Just tremendous and quite impressive.
Mouthfeel is just shy of medium bodied, and carbonation is almost nonexistent.
Drinkability is insanely high for the type of beer this is. Alcohol is low making for easier consumption, but the flavor is quite good and the tartness is not overwhelming. Makes for quite an experience. I much prefer this to say Cantillon Iris. 971 charactersGoliath, Aug 09, 2008

Poured into a wine glass. dark ruby color with almost no head at all. Aroma is very vinous with lots of sour funk. Tastes how you would think it was going to taste. Lots of lactic sourness some barnyard funk and lots of red wine taste. Puckering mouthfeel, crisp body. It's hard to draw the line here.

Some spaced out carbonation bubbles floating up the side of the glass. Smells of old red wine, soem funky earthy smells, and some sour cherries. Tastes something like tart, sour cherrie and apple wine. Some lite fizziness, but not much. Some grape in there as well. As it warms, I get more tart red wine flavor. Great lambic mouthfeel and probably the most drinkable lambic I have had. 506 charactersDrDogbeer, Jul 29, 2008
3.78/5  rDev -14.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3A: deep raspberry red and black cherry in color. No head even on very aggressive pours. Looks like fruit juice, if it weren't for the visible carbonation bubbles.
S: Intense is one word for this beer! had a vinous wine essence even before decorking by smelling the cork. Definitely deserving of it's puckering qualities. This is a sour, vinegary, funky beer, almost completely overwhelming the fruit, which I can't really pick it out in aroma.
T&M: moutfeel has adequate carbonation for my liking. This is one sour beer where the aroma is almost completely inline with the flavor. Musty, sour, vinous, somewhat dry. Fruit flavors are definitely muted and pretty much completely overwhelmed by the tartness.
D: I think this would nicely compliment a dessert or equally tart salad, or maybe even a minced dish of sorts. 1 glass is all I could handle. 
Powerful stuff, but overall for the style, top notch. 907 charactersjulian, Jul 27, 2008
3.11/5  rDev -29.8%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3On draught at Belmont Station's Puckerfest, served in a flute glass, Saint Lamvinus is a chill hazed purple with a thin white collar. Very pretty color. 
Smell is pretty muted, some sourness with a vinous tang. 
Taste is also pretty muted sourness, a bit too heavy on the wine for my taste, slightly rubbery, with an acidic bite. 
Mouthfeel is dry and slick, with a medium body. 
Drinkablity is wasn't to high for me, with to much wine and not enough funk. Still, I assume this barrel isn't aged beyond the brewery, and will probably grab a bottle at some point to stash for a few years. Maybe not worth the price of admission by the bottle though, it was $7 or 8 for a 10-12 oz pour at Belmont. 699 charactersccrida, Jul 18, 2008

a - pours a hazy, deep brownish burgundy color, smallish bubbly white head with no retention or lacing
s - really funky horsey aroma, barnyard really dominates, strong notes of strawberry, grape and sour cherry, some tannins from the barrels are noticeable
t - big barnyard funkiness, tartness and sourness up front, a little leather and oak, midpalate and the finish have a nice fruitness, some red grape, strawberry, and sour cherry, lingering sourness and some tannic dryness on the finish with little to no alcohol detectable, very well integrated all around
m - light-to-medium bodied, moderate carbonation, quite drying on the palate
d - while this is tart, sour, and dry, it still is pretty drinkable as long as you're a sour lover, I got through the 750 no problem
Really good beer overall. The wine barrel aging adds a nice dimension. Great drinking experience, but it's hard to justify the $35 price tag. 971 charactersWeisGuy, Jul 17, 2008

Tastes dry and sour with nice sweet malt to balance. Berry fruity is dried out, but quite prominent. Some brettanomyces horseblanket character is present, but just one player in the complex nature of this beer. Clean dry puckering. Fruity flavor despite the driness is quite impressive accomplishment. Strong carbonation helps clean the palate. Wonderful drinkability. Light fruity dry crisp, yet leaves a lingering berry and horseblanket. 651 charactersmentor, Jul 06, 2008
4.72/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Jastack for the brew.
For me, this will be a day long remembered. Isabella Proximus, Jahva, Gordon, and now Cantillon Saint Lamvinus. Truly epic.
Pours a hazy reddish pink brown. Yes, all those at once. A half inch or so of white foam quickly vanishes, leaving a thin white crust behind. 
Smell is the familiar sour funk with a tart, acidic red wine background. The taste is more varied, with the familiar sour apple/pear funk overlaid with chardonnay grapes gone funky, and a wonderful effervescent soury champagne-esque/dry mouthfeel. Have I mentioned "sour" enough yet? If not, here's one more: the beer is sour.
One of the greatest beers I've ever had, and the vinous/oaky characteristics are truly sublime. If I hadn't tasted Isabella Proximus earlier today, I might actually be even more glowing in my review than I am. But, so it goes. 856 charactersOverlord, Jun 29, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: A hazy but clear reddish-purple, beautiful in color. An inch or so of head rises and quickly dissipates, in the usual Cantillon fashion.
Smell: Intense funk from a mile away; barnyard, sweat, parmesan cheese, damp basement - it almost overwhelms the fruit, but not entirely; there's a note of grape beneath it all. Once the nose becomes accustomed to the funk the aroma takes on an almost soured red wine quality. This is definitely one of the more intriguing Cantillon beers. I should add that the last pour from the bottle (with sediment) had the most hilariously intense aroma of funk I've ever smelled.
Taste & mouthfeel: Utterly dry, sour and acidic with plenty of dry vinous flavor to balance things out. The lambic base is fairly dominant here, but the character of the grapes and barrel shine through just enough to give it depth beyond your average lambic. The marriage of lambic and red wine grapes makes for a profoundly dry mouthfeel. 960 characterslargadeer, Jun 27, 2008
4.77/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5So here we are. I made it to review number 1000. It has been an interesting voyage to get to this point, and that number seems huge, especially in a year and a half's time. But alas I have arrived. So the question then became, what do you have for such a big number. Now you can get all crazy looking for the rarest and most sought after beers out there, however to be honest I have had a lot of them, and I decided to go for something, that while not being common, certainly isn't rare, but was something that I had wanted to try for a very long time. Being a fan of the sours, I knew this one would be a doozy, and since it is quite pricey, and not available to me locally, I felt it would make a good choice to go for the big number. A very nice, classic looking Cantillon 750ml bottle, wrapped in black foil with corked. I let this one come up just a touch above the fridge temperature before I opened it up and let it breath. Served in a brand new Terrapin glass( Thanks Ding) I felt ready to go for it.
Appearance - The pour was beautiful. A deep pinkish color, almost rose with a good amount of haze was dropped into the glass. Holding it up to a bright light really just let it shine through, the color was wonderful. A small crown of off white graced the top for just a few moments before setting down and leaving it open and bare. There was some side glass lace initially, but after that faded it was all pretty smooth and clear. The carbonation was apparent as it bubbled up toward the surface ever so gently throughout the session.
Smell - The aroma on this one was almost indescribable. It had that classic farmhouse funk to it, which naturally you expect to see from Cantillon, however there were some subtle differences between this and the others I have had. The sweet smell of grapes was percolating through on here, and as it warmed became easier and easier to pick up in the smell. It was not overpowering as the funk aroma was, but rather, just light enough to let you know there was some depth to it. Tart sour grapes stole the show, with hints of cherries and a wet hay back.
Taste - The flavor was beautiful, really these beers are more like works of art. It started out with a subtle dose of chardonnay like grapes, slightly sweet, but with the acidic touch to them. Beautiful work here, with a deep, resonant funk to it that just lingers on for what seemed like years to be honest. Subtle touches of cherries and grapes dropped in with this, really working the taste buds. As it warmed it just continued to evolve. It is so hard sometimes to try and describe that flavor, and I refuse to use the sweaty and other somewhat derogatory comments to describe it, and funk is a good thing in this case. Enormously try and tart finish just left you begging for another sip with an almost vinegar like finish to it, wow that was really damn good is the final thing running through your head.
Mouthfeel - This had one of the best feels it could have. Just a hair shy of being a medium bodied ale, the carbonation was enough to keep it very lively and the perfect balance of profile, never feeling thin, or watery, but rather just being very tight and crisp. A wonderful addition here for sure.
Drinkability - You really cannot get much better then this. The flavors were so complex, the ABV virtually non existent, lively feel, I mean what more can you ask for. Its not filling, and it keeps you engaged. I really could have had another on of these as soon as I finished the first, it was just that good.
Overall this may be my favorite of the Cantillon beers I have tried so far. It was just a touch shy of the Beatification in terms of being the funkiest, most sour thing I have ever had. I mean this was just delicious. I a, glad I was able to finally acquire a bottle of this as it was more then worth the weight. I have yet to get bored in this style and I wished more people were able to get into it. So complex and so rich, this is definitely the one to seek out. Well deserved of its reputation and something I would always pick up if I saw it! 4,074 charactersmikesgroove, May 30, 2008

Pours like a cranberry spritzer with transluscency and a bubbly appearance. Smell is fruity, sour and acidic and slightly funky and sweaty. Taste is very fruity with some grapes, and red fruit like notes. Tart grape, and cranberry come to mind. Smooth and lightly thin in the middle and finishes dry. Carbonation is light but sufficient. Very unique and enjoyable. 418 charactersJDV, Apr 06, 2008
3.03/5  rDev -31.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3It's probably inappropriate for such an avowed sour hater like myself to review this beer. I did the best I could with it, but I absolutely cannot understand the attraction of beers such as this.
Had on tap during 72 hours of Belgium at Max's.
The beer pours a beautiful cherry red color with very good head retention and lacing. Alas, if only this beer would taste as good as it looks. The nose is quite complex, bordering on the bizarre. I get aromas of camel, dog sweat and barn yard. I guess that's a good thing if you're a gueuze/lambic lover. On the palate this beer is flat out undrinkable. The over-riding flavor I get is vinegar and sweaty socks. This is just disgusting. Mouthfeel is decent, but the sour in this beer is just overwhelming. No way I can drink the stuff.
Not my idea of a good beer. Trying to drink something like this is just absolutely no fun. Thank God I only got a very small glass (which even then I was unable to finish). 955 charactersJohn_M, Apr 02, 2008
4.97/5  rDev +12.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer rivals Fou Founne for best Cantillon ever. I had it at the FARMHOUSE in Emmaus, PA. 
Smelled strongly of grapes and typical Cantillon funk. 
Poured with almost no head, leaving a thin, foamy ring at the top of the glass. Hold it up to the light. A deep rose color. 
Basically, this is one of the best beers I have ever had. The initial taste is all grape sweetness, which slowly gives way to a beautifully balanced acidity. And the almost indescribable Cantillon funk. I remember being on the Cantillon brewery tour, standing in the barrel room, and inhaling the atmosphere. I don't know how they do it. They bottled that smell, and the residual taste it leaves in your mouth. It's damp and musty...old wood and hay. Like the basement of an old house with bad insulation. It transports you. 
There's not much else I can say about this beer. I think it was from 2003. One of the best. 893 charactersDaveHS, Mar 28, 2008

Served in a 12 oz. tulip glass. It's a juicy deep red with purplish tones to it. No head at all this time, virtually still. Wonder if this is an unblended keg...
Aroma is mildly tart, not the exaggerated sharpness or funk i've come to love from Cantillon. Slight vinegar note, but mostly tart grape juice. 
Flavor is mild compared to other Cantillons, subdued juicy tartness with a slight pucker. Very light wild element, minor cider character. Clearly defined wine grape flavors, without much wood to balance. Easy to sip or gulp, at the price, i'll be sipping. 630 charactersemerge077, Mar 25, 2008
4.5/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured a slightly cloudy purplish-red with a rocky pink head.
The aroma was bursting with sour funk, vinous grapes, and citrus notes.
The flavor was tart and sour. The flavors of tart grapes were bright and punchy. The fruit bleneded well with complex brett funk, lacto, and pedio sourness with a slight, but pleasant cheesiness faint in the background. The grape flavor was more on the concord side of things, whereas Vigneronne has more of the white grape flavor if ya know what I mean...
The beer had prickly carbonation with a light mouthfeel. The beer finished very dry and had a mild astringency that complemented the sour charateristics.
A wonderful lambic with some amazing fruit flavors blended in. While this is an outstanding beer, I'm not sure it beats out Fou Foune in my ranks of Cantillon sours. 814 charactersSacoDeToro, Mar 17, 2008

A- Poured from a 750ml bottle that was gross around the foil. I think this is normal with Cantillon. Pours a reddish-pink with no head.
S- Funky! I get definite barnyard and horsey nose from this. I also get grapes. Odd but interesting.
T- Really nice lambic. Some definite lacto and pedio in this. There is some bretty character in the background though. You get the grape fairly strong. Not as sours as others but medium sour.
M- Higher carbonation which is right for this style of beer. Thinner mouthfeel.
D- I like this beer a lot. Not overly sour and quite drinkable. Really nice lambic from Cantillon. 657 charactersMudpuppet, Mar 16, 2008

de Dolle and what's that other brewery? oh yes, that Westvleteren trio of super-beers :-)
But a word about Cantillon who are right up there with the very best of the Belgians.
Yes, the lambics and gueuzes are an acquired taste but one I will always be grateful I acquired. 
 I was lucky enough to attend Cantillon's open brewing session on March 1st 2008 and even luckier to come home with a bottle of St. Lamvinus and it's brother Vigneronne. The Vigneronne remains untouched but I have just finished off the St. Lamv and I'm stilll smiling!
These really are a masterpiece in a bottle, I love the unrelenting sourness and the slight fizz and the fruit without really being too fruity plus those strange farmyard smells that are so often mentioned. Our Cantillon guide mentioned (I believe) that there are 10 species of Brettanomyces yeast known and 9 of them fly into their beers via the Brussels air during the overnight natural wild fermentation. 
Possibly the best thing to be done with a Merlot grape ... 
I urge you to investigate if you haven't already!! 1,227 charactersHabanero58, Mar 11, 2008

Smell is wicked, grapes, fruit, citrus acidity, wine, sulphur, wheat, cherries, funky barnyard, really complex. Taste is crazy, very tart, cherries and concord grapes, oak, vinegar, citrus, bread, wheat, fruity acidic finish.

3.82/5  rDev -13.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.52006 vintage, poured into tulip
A- hazy, muddled rose pinkish/purple. Head of 1 finger recedes very quickly, minimal retention. Not expecting lacing due to it being a lambic, and it doesn't give any. Later pours increasingly murky due to sediment.
A note on appearance- this should be poured into a champagne flute. Anything larger made for a murkier pour, allowing for more sediment to flow in, muddling it up and taking away from the appearance, and I did pour into a flute later on.
S- Lambic yeast strains in evidence. From a distance right after opening, smelled of concord grapes/Welch's grape juice (the insanely purple kind). Little note of hay/barn/must, may be the yeast again. 
T- Tart, but not bracingly so (rose de gambrinus is FAR sharper). Still, there is a sharp bite. Might imagine it as a truly tart/sour sparkling rose wine, with minimal sweetness from the grape character and that quickly is overtaken by the acidity and tart, dry finish, very keeping in line with Cantillon's other brews.
M- light bodied, carbonation is present, fizzing on the tongue, heightening the acidity. 
Overall, I had higher expectations, which was very affected by the high price, and so admittedly, a bit unfair. I ran the gamut of food pairings (cheese, meats, sweets) and came up with hardly any pairings that were neutral at best. (Perhaps a very fresh, sweet, cow's milk cheese or HEAVY chocolate dessert may work? I did not have these available to me at time of tasting). Taken as an apertif, this has more appeal- it is excellent for opening taste buds for later food/beverages with its sharpness and fruit character, and is most definitely for sipping. But unfortunately, this is a fairly price prohibitive beer and for my tastes, did not justify itself. 1,766 charactersABCJiugui, Feb 19, 2008

Slightly sour, slightly sweet, and a nice floral fruit taste. You get a nice pucker in your throat that adds to the experience of the beer. If you have a chance to try this beer, I would highly recommend that you do. 489 charactersAsher1982, Feb 08, 2008

750ml bottle, capped and caged. bottled 2004. sampled jan 11/08.
pours slightly hazy orangey pink with a big fluffy white head. the head drops fairly slow and leaves spotty lace.
aroma is excellent. as soon as we started to pour you could smell it - fruit and funk. bit of lemon. lactic sourness. horse blanket. leather. light sweetness, but mostly as fruit. light acidity. grape and raisin. there's a bit of a minty herbal character hiding in there too. really interesting.
taste is great. lemony sourness. big funky horse blanket blast. barnyard funk. i still get that minty herbal character here, and i like it, though the other tasters don't really get this. bit of lemon. light fruity sweetness. nice wine character, white more than red. touch of vanilla. light acidity. bread and crackers. bit of grain. no trace of alcohol. bit of other citrus too - light grapefruit, tangerine, and orange.
mouthfeel is good. medium-low carbonation level. medium body with a fairly dry finish. sour, but not acidic.
drinkability is great. excellent depth. great funky sourness without acidity. no trace of alcohol. nice balance between the funk, sourness, and other character. curious how other vintages compare. i'll be on the lookout for this one. 1,304 charactersgrub, Jan 14, 2008

They got to live (and gave me a few $$ for beer because we talked about my love for it) and I got to try Saint Lamvinus on cask. Life is beautiful. 
On cask at Spuyten Duyvil in Brooklyn for their special event for lambics and brett beers. 
I have reviewed this before on the bottle. So forgive me if I don't get too detailed with the review and choose to just enjoy it a bit more without thinking too much. 
Pours a clouded ruby red. A small ring of white head lines the top of the glass. Nose is straight up lambic funk. Taste brings the funk still. Mild sour attributes. At least I think they are milder than they were on the bottle. I am not sure if the cask has something to do with the rounding out of that, but who cares. There it is. Mild sweet tones off fruit and grapes. Obvious, but still slightly subdued grape characteristics there. Oh to hell with it. As you can see from my scores, I think this is as good on cask as it is from the bottles. A joy to be able to have on this special occassion. I'm sorry you weren't there to be able to enjoy it with me. 1,164 charactersRblWthACoz, Dec 31, 2007

This bottle comes from my buddy jeffkrenner, thanks bro!
Served at cellar temp and poured into my Triple Karmeliet glass.
Appearance is good. Cranberry juice colored brew taht started off with a big soapy head off of the aggressive pour then quietly thinned out to nothing. Carbonation is evident yet not strong.
Smell is very good. Lemony, sour, tart funk. Fruit sweetness is there yet subtle and in control with the wild yeast and juicy lemon taking the front.
Taste is exceptional. Tart unripe light fruit with a fantastic subtle sweetness. Fruit is much more pronounced in the flavor compared to the smell yet is beautifully balanced by the tart funk. Oak is very big in the finish. Large flavor here without being over the top in any one department. Extremely balanced between tart and fruit. Crafted exceptionally well.
Mouthfeel is exceptional. Starts off juicy and finishes with the perfect level of dryness. The bottle i had in Belgium was more fruity than this but i seem to prefer the dryness of this one.
Drinkability is exceptional. Give me more is the only thing I'm thinking as this bottles dies.
Overall: One of, if not the best, lambic beer I've ever drank. Hefty price tag but well worth it every once in a while. 1,311 charactersKingG, Nov 29, 2007

I'd been wanting to try this for a while as I love Cantillon's brews, but it is quite spendy. Looks like cloudy pinot noir or unfiltered pressed cherry juice. Thin, wispy head. The smell is winey with cherries, sour aromas, and some funkiness. Woody bitterness at the end. Taste is somewhat similar- sour, bitter, and complex. Slightly funky bitter finish at the end. The mouthfeel is sharp, tart, and refreshing. Very drinkable, and although this is somewhat sour and funky, I find it less so than many of the other Cantillons. This one is winier and more delicate. All in all, I think I slightly prefer the slightly more robust products from them- though this is mighty fine. 812 charactersGeorgiabeer, Oct 01, 2007

tastes of a tart electric onslaught that has a thin honey beneath it along with a pinch of salt and a great cranberry character. There is also a sour dough bread that is hiding beneath. The finish leaves me with a great lingering dirty funk.
Feels light but dense with an ultra fine carbonation.

Strong apple cider with orange and lemon peel. Sweet Tart dryness attacks the nose. With repeated shaking I get a dark cherry aroma.
Taste sour grape skins, orange peel and sour green apple with just a hint of sugary dark cherry candy.
Mouthfeel is excellent. While the carbonation goes away quickly, the fruitiness bombards the tip of the tounge and excites the rest of the mouth with a heavy aftertaste of sour apple/grapes.The oilyness stays with the mouth for quite a while.

4.9/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5It's been said that in conceiving Florence's breathtakingly beautiful Santa Maria del Fiore cathedral no one had ever seen a building that looked like the one they wanted to build - its design was a matter of ambition and of idea. Likewise, before the masterful artistry of Cantillon's Jean Van Roy I doubt anyone had ever tasted a beer like the one he wanted to brew. 
But I doubt even he could envision what would come of this experiment - using Bordeaux barrels to age Merlot and Cabernet-Franc grapes with 2-3 year-old lambic. Indeed, its result is something of a beer marvel... 
375ml bottle found at the Bier Circus in Brussels. Bottled October 25, 2006 and list a "consumer avant fin 12/2009". Beautiful bottle art. How I savoured this...
Saint Lamvinus is graced by a most pristine colour, the beauty of which I can't easily describe. Something of a dark violet or eggplant purple. It has a strong, bright ruby shine and such pristine clarity. My eyes widen as I think to myself in French: "sa brille!" A short, only occasional stream of bubbles float up and contribute to a bold - but minimal - outlining ring of head. 
The aroma is enchanting, ambrosial, downright divine. Lightly acidic and plenty full of tartness. The grapes cut sharply through the lambic. The merlot is so fresh and fruity! There is a certain softness imparted from the grape that plays so well with the underlying tartness of the lambic. This is not only incredibly balanced but also incredibly interesting as well as delightful. It easily elevates itself above even the best of malty barleywines, roasty Imperial stouts or fresh and hop filled double IPA's. 
The mouthfeel is very sour but very graceful too. If one could only stop themselves from slowly savouring they would also realize it is quite refreshing! Every sip coats the mouth in sour grapes, a sensation which lasts all throughout. It is both soft and tart, dry but juicy, both sour and sweet - no part of the palate goes overlooked. It's also lightly acidic and slightly sugary, causing a real pucker. The blend, however, is perfect - a character of sharp tartness in the lambic and a fruity, luscious bouquet of wine grapes in the taste.
The taste, by the way, is out of this world. The merlot grape I found most predominant. It is very fruity. The grapes tend to impart flavours of other fruits also: grapefruit, passion fruit, lemon/lime, berry, plum and currant. Chalk full of fruity phenols. The flavours linger so gracefully, allowing them to truly be savored with every sip. They have lasting power. 
It is incredible what flavours are captured from these grapes. The taste falls somewhere between the tasty "purple" flavoured grape candy/juice for children and the "Chateau OhLala" Grand Cru Vintage of a fine Bordeaux. Even experienced wine connoisseurs might wonder at how such flavour could come from a grape. 
For me, I myself marveled at how such beauty could come of a beer. It is more than any hype, rarity or price tag that makes this special. This, to me, is the summer sun. When the cold, dark nights and never ending, harsh months of Canadian winter become relentless I will think of the Saint Lamvinus. I will remember the rare occasion I had of trying this beer, under an (equally rare) pristine blue Bruxelles sky in August. I will remember and smile. 
At the conclusion of my notes there is a small part that reads:

I'm in love,
I'm in love" 3,455 charactersbiegaman, Aug 21, 2007

The painting of a branch of grapes on the label is both minimalist and surreal, very cool. There was some leakage through the cork when I popped the cap, you'd think this is a bad thing but Ive seen it before in Cantillons and the beer always tastes fine. 
The pour reveals a enigmatic reddish pinkish color with a lightly pink head. The head quickly becomes a miniscule ring that emits very little lace. Streams of tiny carbonation bubbles are visible in abundance. Lambic smells burst out of the bottle with this one. Some musty damp barnyard mingles with cider and some tannins. the taste follows suit with plenty of earthy brett flavors, some cidery and sharp flavors and loads of puckering sourness. A spectacular balance comes from the expanse of fruit flavors in tow. Very ripe grape flesh, bitter grape skin and assorted berries and citrus in the background. It reminds me of a good full bodied red wine. The finish is long and complex with biting acidity melded with fruit sweetness. The mouthfeel is very lightly carbonated and somewhat viscous, something Ive noticed in many lambics. 1,274 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Aug 01, 2007

Just a quick plug to try his establishment. I was saving this beer for a special occasion. Nothing special was on the horizon, so I broke down and drank it after holding it for a month. A 750ml bottle, with the label stating it was bottled 25Oct2006. Poured into a tulip glass, it was an amazing ruby red color with a touch of orange. A small head quickly dissipated, leaving a very still beer. It had a fruity aroma which seemed mostly cherry, and was also on the musty side (I mean that in a good way). Pleasant fruity taste, but what really was really striking was the degree of tartness. I've had other lambics from Cantillon that were nowhere near this tart. A wonderful, smooth beer. Great to drink, although I couldn't do a steady diet of lambics. Share this with your wife or significant other. 937 characterslordofthewiens, Jul 28, 2007

I've taken style into account when granting the appearance score.
My lambic experience is still limited. Having said that, it's hard to believe there are many lambics this vinous. That's understandable given the addition of red grapes. One source gave the breakdown as 40% Cabernet Sauvignon, 40% Merlot and 20% Cabernet Franc. Also prominent are red wine vinegar, oak and musty-earthy funk. My salivary glands are already beginning to squirt.
Cantillon Saint Lamvinus tastes like the perfect marriage of beer and wine. Even though lambics are anything but typical beer, the comparison still holds. It's much more lambic than wine (obviously) since grapes are only used for flavor and sweetness, not character. In other words, there's no red wine in the world that's this acidic, puckery, funky and dry.
I find full-bore versions of this style to be a little too aggressive to suit me. The addition of raspberries (Rose De Gambrinus) or grapes (in this case) tends to contribute just enough underlying sweetness to take the edge off the sharp, biting acidity and the saliva-sucking dryness. Any number of foods would match up perfectly with this beauty.
Since I have so little experience with the style, I'll have to trust my instincts when it comes to the mouthfeel. It's light, with a sneaky suppleness on the finish of the finish. I also enjoy the brisk, fine-bubbled carbonation that gives the beer a festive mouth presence.
Cantillon Saint Lamvinus is a unique beer from one of the world's most unique brewers. I'm not sure I have the chops to completely break it down and appreciate where it fits into the pantheon of great lambics, but I sure do love the inspired attempt at beer-wine fusion. This is a beer that is meant to be consumed with gusto and a beer that deserves to be celebrated. 2,126 charactersBuckeyeNation, Jul 24, 2007
4.26/5  rDev -3.8%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This was the second lambic beer I have tried, although I had a hard time deciding if this was a wine or a beer. It looked beautiful; it had the color of wine (a rich burgundy red) as well as the head from a beer. The taste was nothing but strange. It was dry-ish like a wine, but it was well balanced and had beer attributes. My palate was very confused the whole time as it was trying to decide if it was drinking merlot or beer. I enjoyed the drink overall, and I had no trouble drinking it since I like the dryness of wine. A very balanced beverage. 552 characterssmcreator, Jun 30, 2007
4.6/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I had previously tried this beer in bottle a year or so ago. Now on tap. The beer was served with no head to speak of but with a vibrant red hazy body. The nose was very Cantillon as expected. Nice and earthy with a real vinous quality to it. As if the nose was not enough, the taste gives you even more. There is a sweet but yet very sour, barny punch to this beer. It all works out very well if you are a fan of lambics and very sour ones for that matter. Just really really tastey and pleasing to the taste buds. 515 charactersggaughan, Jun 02, 2007

Pours an amazing deep pink-red, with a very mild head on top. Nose is quite sour, a little sweet fruit too. Taste is similar; this beer is incredibly sour, a hint of sweet raspberry deliciousness as well, but overall a quite not-sweet beer. Interesting, and respectable for what they've created, but not one I'd go out of my way for. Feel is full and tasty. Overall, a beer that one should try at least once, just because it's so out-there, but not one I'd enjoy more than every once in a long while. 595 characterssoupyman10, May 19, 2007

Pours a clear deep ruby color with little head.
Doesn't smell like vinegar, but you can tell this ones going to be tart. Fruit of the vine and cherry
The mouth feel is light, tart, and crisp, with a bit of tartness that lingers towards the front of the tongue.
The flavor is a mouth full of SweetTarts.

4.85/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5First things first, a beef with the presentation: a beer of this caliber should have a bottling date. From the bottle, purchased at the Map Room for $40, there was absolutely no indication as to whether this was a 2001, 2002, or 2003 vintage. It didnt reduce my enjoyment of the beer but I would have liked to have known for future reference.
As for the beer itselfCantillons St. Lamvinus is perfect.
Appearance: Pours into a white wine glass with a strong effervescent surge that leaves a ¼ inch, lovely pink head. The head dies off quickly but the body doesnt disappoint. St. Lamvinus presents a deep, sexy purpled pink body. Color is not dissimilar to New Glaruss Raspberry tart. St. Lamvinus is much deeper, however, and not particularly cloudy.
Aroma: Barnyard funk and vinegar balance flawlessly by sweet grape juice. Light amounts of cobwebs and dirt, oak tannins, and wet leather are found too but at the end of the day one has more of an impression of absolute cohesiveness then individualy unique attributes. I carry away a sense that is now possible, against the odds, for a beer to offer much, indeed most, of the character of a rabid geuze without offending. Likewise, I now see the possibilities of using grapes as a primary component of beer without creating a concoction that is either cloyingly sweet or overly wine like.
Taste: All of the attributes of a fine Bordeaux blended without defect with the entire range of excellent properties of the best lambics. 
Mouthfeel: Spritzy and medium bodied. Astringent front, balanced center, lightly dry finish. Defining of balance. 
Drinkability: Undoubtedly one of the most drinkable beers I have consumed to date.
Was it worth it? Yes and noTo try once, it was absolutely worth it. To drink regularly, I would have to say it would not be. For my dollar, I would take Oude Beersel or Hansens kriek geuzes on a regular basis over this. Still, I have to admit that a beer so well crafted is most certainly deserving of its high price. God bless Cantillon for this. 2,059 charactersDaPeculierDane, Apr 12, 2007

The taste was tart fruits. The feel was amazingly light dry with a great tart finish. Quite a wonderful beer, it really let the gueze come through and left the fruit to accent the beer.

3.47/5  rDev -21.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3A wine glass served at Capone's.
A: The ale has a a slightly hazy, dull red color that has some brownish notes darkening it a bit. The pour is the last of the keg and the head is gone to a far away place, making this ale look still as water.
S: The aroma is an amalgum of funky barnyard and intense sourness with a bit of grape sweetness.
T: The sourness of the beer is intense, coming across like a slightly sweet vinegar. As the sourness fades away, a dry red grape emerges adding a slight sweetness. Finally, some green grape tartness seals the deal before returning to intense vinegary sourness.
M: The mouthfeel stings, preventing anything big from emerging. Having had a bottle and a tap serving, I am not seeking this beer out as part of my standard rotation.
D: The bitter acidity is too tart to make for a reliable drink. 835 charactersakorsak, Mar 30, 2007
5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sampled at Capone's in Norristown, PA on 2-21-07. This review is from notes taken that night.
APPEARANCE: An incredibly cool Ruby red-purple color. Very very cool. The thinnest collar rings the small wine goblet it came in.
SMELL: Very strong aromas of red wine and barnyard funk with a hard hitting vinegar tartness.
TASTE: Extremely tart (which is a good thing!) Flavors of grapes, wine, cranberries explode in your mouth. The finish is, well, non-existant. The flavor just doesn't end. Even 5 minutes later, the strength of my most recent sip is still almost as intense as the moment it hit my tongue. Absolutely amazing!
MOUTHFEEL: Despite the lack of any head, the carbonation is great. The very fine bubbled carbonation is perfect for this beer.
DRINKABILITY: Given the price and the variety of the taplist, I really only planned to have one before moving on to other beers. But I cannot turn another one down. I MUST have more of this beer. It is simply stunning.
I am very hesitant to give anything a perfect 5. I certainly have not done it yet. But from the very first sips, I knew that anything less would not suffice. So, well done Cantillon! Saint Lamvinus gets my very first 5.0! 1,210 charactersjmalex, Mar 11, 2007

A: Hazy, dark cranberry juice red. Tiny, bubbly, pink head that recedes to a faint skim and unbreakable ring.
S: Pleasant aromas of tart fruit and red wine.
T: Tart and bitter fruit, with a healthy helping of red wine flavors. Lurking in the background is a smooth malt backbone that acts to balance out the pucker inducing tartness and holds it all together.
M: Effervescent, tart, thin, and bitter. How lambics should feel.
D: Allow this to come up to temp and just have a grand old time sipping on this. Awesome! 574 charactersGbVDave, Mar 03, 2007
4.62/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Delivered to the bar in a short wine glass, the flat ruby body was mainly clear. Beautiful color! Just a thin collar of white was seen at the first moment, but there was no foam beyond that. An underlying carbonation was present though, and it gently tingled on the tongue.
The aroma offered a brash nose of sweat and manure, a vivid, vinegar and vinous sour-tartness, some deeper earthiness and mineral character, and some sharp, hard, "foot-like" cheese.
The flavor was intensely tart, with all of the barnyard and sweat character of the aroma, but less intensity. The mustiness and barnyard was wrapped within a fuller, non-descript fruit tartness... suggestions of grape and cherry, perhaps from the wine barrel. Metallic and mineralish within. Initially puckering, it finishes just as dry, but short-lingering. Utterly intense! 838 charactersNeroFiddled, Mar 03, 2007
4.59/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Capone's in Norristown. Considering I wrote the descriptions for the tap list last week, I should hope that people won't mind my notes looking similar to the brief descriptions seen in the restaurant. In any case...
Appears a ruby reddish toned pink with a small, bubbly head that quickly fades into nothing. No lacing is left and the spider legs are very faint when tilting the glass and brought back to center.
Smell is of tart, sweet raspberries, barnyard funk, rubber, wildness, light horseblanket, and oak.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with vinuous notes and oaky vanilla pushing through the raspberries and wild funk.
Mouthfeel is tart, medium bodied, vinuous, sweet & tart, dry, slightly acidic but mellow. 731 charactersweeare138, Feb 26, 2007
4.25/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I had very very high expectations for this beer. I have become a huge fan of Cantillon, as they have never let me down with any of there sour Lambics or Gueuze. I nearly acquired this before. I had it on my order but due to the huge price I removed it from my list and made room for 6 or seven other beers in it's place. When I changed my mind and decided to pay the price... it was no longer available. Thus, I was very excited to find this beer on-tap at Capones. Talking to another friend who had it in the bottle previously he thought the bottle was better than this tap version, true or not my wife and I both enjoyed it. I bought a growler for $45 at Capons Restaurant in Norristown PA. It seemed a better deal than the $30 for a 750ml. I also shared the beer with many of my friends. [In retrospect I should have been a selfish bastard because my wife and I *really* liked the beer, more than many of my friend, but I like to share so ... =)]
Appearance: Pours an attractive red color with a small pink head and little lacing. 
Smell: WOW! Acidic Lambic berry tartness and vinegar in the nose. Sour cherries sweet-tart candies, and some dry vinous alcohol. 
Taste: This is a dominantly sour beer but it has a small element of sweet sugar like a candy before the tartness takes over. Berry and cherry and sour grapes blend together in a sour flavor that is somewhat vinous, and that has a notable alcohol element undisguised, and the leaves you with the dry lingering aftertaste. The sour flavor carries over into the long linger dry aftertaste and leave you with more sweet-tarts on the cheeks. As a fan of dry wine, my wife found this a familiar sensation.
Mouthfeel: This is so dry and yet, active with sharp sour interplay against cheeks and the light carbonation snap-crackle-pop on the tongue. It is pretty rough across the tongue in a beautiful sour Lambic fashion. And I love the bone dry finish.
Drinkability: As it warms it actually becomes a bit more rough. The acidity becomes even more pronounced and the tartness forcing the pucker becomes more and more intense. If you want to avoid that, Then it is best to drink this shortly after opening, and boy it does go down nicely, but I recommend sharing it, despite the $30-$40 price tag. It is a lot of sour. Personally, I love it, I could handle putting it in my kegorator, if I was interested in spending the $450 for a quarter barrel keg. 2,424 charactersPhatz, Feb 26, 2007
4.11/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I had it on draft at Capone's in Norristown, PA. It poured a strawberry-red color, and while it looked thick, the texture was fine and smooth. The tangy grapefruit flavor prevents it from going down smooth, however. The sourness forces you to hold it in your mouth and that's when other flavors become apparent. I tasted some light berry and grape notes that gave a slight sweetness to balance the sour. The smell is not sweet, as it had a strong, funky barnyard odor. This is not a fruity beer for framboise fans. This one is perfect for Cantillon and geuze fanatics. Let it warm up and the flavor will be very enjoyable. 622 charactersStoutHearted, Feb 23, 2007

Red winey looking with no head or lacing to speak of. Funky mix of fruit and barnyness on the nose. Flavor of tart raspberries, with an underlying funky sourness.
Sourness was a real detriment to the mouthfeel. It reminded me of late night heartburn after daring a Thai street vendor to "bring the pang!" drunkenly when ordering penang gai.
Overall, ordered this one first since it was the highest listed of the Cantillon. At least I didn't get robbed for a full bottle of this one. 582 charactersUmbra, Feb 20, 2007

Hazy, ruby red grapefruit juice in appearance. Small, pink tinted, otherwise off white head.
Hard to get aroma in bar, but Belgian funk and sour cherries came through pretty well.
Taste was TART! Cherries and some other fruits. Bit of sweetness hiding in the middle. Floral notes at end.
Light to medium in mouthfeel. Fairly strong carbonation. Very drying.
Second try at the lambic style, and quite drinkable for a hop-head. I enjoyed it, and it was even better with my lunch (mussels). I am going to have to explore this style a bit more. 596 characters, Feb 16, 2007

Smell: easily detectable sour and tart tones, red grapes, and a hint of barnyard muskiness.
Taste: the initial taste is strong on the sourness, but after the tongue adjusts to the initial shock, the complex flavor profile shines. Sour cherries and wine grapes, tart citrus, barnyard and earthy tones, and some very mellow bitterness. Dryness abounds.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied. Crisp and dry throughout, and the aftertaste is long on the pleasant sourness. 
Drinkability: this is a strong flavored beer that is a slow sipper. At $29 a bottle, drinkability is lower from a financial standpoint, and the flavor profile is unique and is as far from a session beer as you can get. Absolute great beer worth shelling out the money for at least once. 864 charactersGavage, Feb 11, 2007
4.62/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5So here it is, review #1000. I had to treat myself to my first Cantillon product. I enjoyed this one with my wife Piera and Amit (who was visiting from Singapore).
Ruby red with garnet highlights and a light haze, the foam was a vibrant pink and quite fluffy. As the head settled to a thick ring, there was a bit of lacing, but nothing that really stuck. Incredible, complex aroma. There was strong barnyard funkiness, the distinct smell of horse, and a little vinegar. Also thrown in were light tobacco notes, some tart fruit, and a vinous character (like a merlot or burgundy). Very tart flavour, like raspberry seeds with a bit of sour cherry thrown into the mix. Puckering. Some earthiness became evident as it warmed, with notes of leather and barnyard increasing. Sweet grapes gave it a bit of red wine quality as well. Crisp carbonation to start, but this faded quickly to a gentler texture mid-sip. Nice body with significant dryness. I really enjoyed this and I'm glad I have some more Cantillon bottles to try out soon. There was a lot of complexity if you looked for it, but on the surface was a wonderful tart beer that was quite drinkable. 1,153 charactersDrJay, Feb 11, 2007

I usually can't really handle the sour cantillon beers because of their acidity, but this was too good an oppurtunity to pass up. I poured a beautiful red rasberry color into a glass that resembled one used for champagne. No head on this one really. Smell definitely had that baryard funk found in most Cantillon beers, with some sweet tart smells going on as well. First taste was huge on the sour notes. The second sip however, revealed a circus of fruit lying behind the initial sour notes. I think the fact that it was cask conditioned may have mellowed some of the sourness of it a bit. Mouthfeel was simply awesome....the more you let it swish around the mouth, the more intense flavors you get. One glass was enough for me...I would have liked more, but I didn't want intense heartburn, so I switched to something else. Simply a delightful beer. I'm not sure I would shell out the forty bucks for it, but who knows. Well done Cantillon. 1,043 charactersjamie2dope, Feb 09, 2007

Aroma: As a wandering through an antiquated stable, and a dalliance with dark cherries at harvest-time.
Taste: Begins with a brief moment of ancient sharp cheese. Dark cherries lie entombed beneath a ghost ocean of lemon juice and vinegar, with spectral emanations of dark grapes. With each taste begins an odyssey of tartness, with its penultimate destination an archipelago of piquant sourness. 
Mouth feel: Replete with velvet fullness, with an arid desolation at the terminus.
Drinkability/notes: Quite sublime in its excellence, to experience it is to shuffle, however ineptly, towards greatness. My thanks to my friend and fellow BA HardTarget for his generosity in sharing this superb, rare, and costly fruit Lambic. 924 charactersPegasus, Dec 02, 2006

That's officially the most I've spent at a store for one bottle of beer. I paid more for others but that included shipping.
Pours a nice dark ruby red to purple, almost plum color with a light wispy head.
Smells of hay, horse blanket, earthy, grassy, lot's of different berries, grape fruit and a hint of grape.
Taste is incredibly complex. Tart, sweet and sour all in one. Like sweet tart candies. Strong taste of berries, grapefruit, slightly winey taste.
Mouthfeel is dry, carbonated and very refreshing.

5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I let this warm to around 45º F and served it in one of my New Belgium glasses.
Appearance: Pours a hazy maroon with orange tints arounf the edges. A foamy, purplish-white, half-inch head tops the beer, before fading to a somewhat persistent ring around the edge of the glass.
Smell: Undisturbed an acidic tartness is predominant with light medicinal phenols, light hints of grapes and a light funkiness. Upon swirling the characteristic Cantillon earthy/funky/barnyard aroma becomes very dominant.
Taste: Sweet and tart grapes are evident upfront. The fruit is noticeable without being overdone or overpoweringly sweet. A strong acidic tartness appears in the center and mingles with a light residual fruitiness. The finish has a savory funkiness with a hard-to-place mouthwatering quality. 
Mouthfeel: Light-bodied with prickly carbonation. The finish is very dry.
Drinkability: Delicious, the light fruitiness provides a nice balance to the strong tartness.
Overall: A fantastic fruit lambic, the fruit is present without being overpoweringly sweet. There's also a nice strong tartness and funkiness that I like. This beer is definitely worth my first 5.0. 1,178 charactersEPICAC, Sep 03, 2006

Appearance: Pours a murky purple brown color, almost no head, except for a ring of off-white foam around the glass.
Smell: Big sour and fruity nose, very malty, with cranberries, strawberries, raspberries, and a dose of citric.
Taste: Very smooth, yet tart, this has a nice flavor from the grapes. Maltiness dries, acidic, this has much in common with wine. Very good, but I am not sure it is worth the price tag.
Drinkability: This is probably the last time I will ever get to try this beer, it is just to expensive, but also very delicious and drinkable. I can appreciate what Cantillon does, they are very good at the craft of lambics. 723 charactersTastyTaste, Aug 16, 2006
4/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 407/29/06 Purchased at Plumpjack's in San Francisco, CA.
Presentation- 750ml bottle. Capped and corked. Bottled in 2003. Poured into my Duvel tulip.
Appearance- Murky plum colored pour. Very very slight spritzy head which evaporates almost on contact with the glass. Slight and spotty lace left behind. Seems the norm for a lambic.
Smell- The wet horse blanket and wet hay scent really comes out as it warms to room temp. A bouquet of fresh assorted berries as well.
Taste- Hmmm, taste is pretty good, but I found grapes to be one of the tastes that was hardest to find. Just a touch of grape flavor, but mostly cherry and raspberries. Sour, but not the punishment that most beers from Cantillon carry. Sour enough to make it a very slow sipping beer though.
Mouthfeel- Super dry, very very light carbonation kick. After it warms it's smooth as silk. Sour as predicted and long lasting aftertaste.
Drinkability- Wasn't let down, but I wasn't really blown away either. I was expecting a bit more out of a $32 bottle of beer. Still a pretty good beer, just not willing to dole out that much money again for it. Am a novice at matching beers with cheese, but a cheese expert said that Pierre Robert cheese (brie like) would pair nicely with it. I really didn't see it though. It did pair really well with dried cherries though...wow, did it! 1,355 charactersGClarkage, Jul 30, 2006
4.52/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This beer was tasted in a wine glass from the 750mL capped and corked bottle. 2003 vintage.
This beer pours a rusty maroon with a thin white head and no lacing. The smells gives off the aromas of grapes along with some sourness characteristic of a lambic. The taste was fantastic. It hits you immediately with its sourness but turns into more of a sour grape taste mixed in with some granny smith apples. The mouthfeel was right on. Perfect body with nice carbonataion. Overall got to be one of the best lambics out there. Nice job to Brasserie Cantillon for brewing such an exceptional and unique beer. 606 charactersMSchae1017, Jul 10, 2006
4.97/5  rDev +12.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The beer was served in a flute. The beer was the 2003 vintage.
Appearance: The beer has a clear red nearing burgundy coloration. The beer has ample carbonation. The beer has no head except a thin white film. The beer gives no lacing.
Smell: The beer has a very good sweet and sour combonation. The beer has plenty of sweet grapes and apple. The beer has a pleasing funky "blue cheese rind" smell. The beer has a earthy grassyness to it. 
Taste: Wow! This is a wierd beer. The beer has a commanding sweet and sour assault on my palate. The beer is loaded with fruityness (apples, cherries, grapes). The beer has that oddly pleasing yeasty funkyness. The beer has a bit of a acidic taste. This beer is well done.
Mouthfeel/ Drinkability: The beer has a very commanding sweet and sour smell and taste. The beer is light bodied. The beer is oddly refreshing inspite of the acidity. Dam this was a great beer! The beer is a bit expensive $30.00 but what a treat. The beer was very hard to put down. I had to make myself wait during the second pouring of the bottle for it to warm up. The beer went very well with semi sweet dark chocolate. 1,146 charactersnlmartin, Jun 23, 2006

Very complex smell and taste. Smells or granny smith apple, tart cherries, musty grapes and a pleasant "funky yeast" smell. Taste as smells with the apple and cherry predominant and slight vanilla taste. Very nice mouthfeel, feels thicker than what one would expect. The taste is initially sweet then becoming sour and then sweet on the backtaste in a very nice way. This is possibly too drinkable. The alcohol is used exceptionally and I wanted more and more. Note: This pair very nicely with dark chocolate. 623 characterslaintringulis, Jun 19, 2006

slightly hazy raspbery-reddish amber with half an inch of pinkish head. lace sticks in thick clumps and rings.
traditional Cantillon aromas with tart apples, rindy bitterness, and funky cheese. slight hints of juicy sweet concord grapes and even some slight unripe cherry aromas; very reminiscent of their kriek.
taste initially hits with a slight grape sweetness, which is quickly washed away with a nice puckering tartness. powerful if slightly one-noted. light-medium body with a spritzy tight carbonation. underwhelming only due to the price (this is the most expensive beer i've ever had). there's really no off-notes and it comes through as tart, refreshing beer, but i can't see ponying up the cash for another for a long while. 791 charactersPrufrock, Jun 13, 2006

Smell was grape popsicle and soda, without the sweetness. Moderate round, woody balsamic vinegar scent and a touch of vanilla.
Taste was a pleasing grapey acid bite that made my mouth water. The aftertaste is a woodsy-bitter zing that lingers.
Mouthfeel is dry and acidic that made me salivate for another (small) sip.

Pours as a noisy aggressive fizzy offering. Body of bubbles and fizzy rising alka-seltzer appearance. No head cap to speak of. A ruby red jeweled hue.
Mouth watering sour scents with a touch of funk and wild breezes of metallic notes and copper. Olfactory overdrive of mineral Earthiness. 
First swigs: Tart & dry sour sipper. THen the disection of this Cantillion creation can begin. Mostly a kriek aspect despite the grape label. Middle of tart dry white wine aspects. Ephemeral aftertaste of unripe raspberry. Actually, when you eat a tiny grape off of the vine, that is what this exemplifies: tiny green grapes. Loads of Granny Smith apple load up the finish. Clean 
Feel is thin and gently carbonated. The pucker is surely present. 
Last swigs: Dry Earthy ephemeral unripe white grape. Cantillion brews are so tough to discern. The sour acidic pucker takes my best palate all the time in the world to soak in. Cleanest finish.
Beer is good. Happy sour tart beering. 1,107 charactersblitheringidiot, May 02, 2006

The beer, after the removal of the black foil, crown & cork from the 750ml green bottle it sets in the flute glass a beautiful dark ruby with a bit of purple, the head is minute, the color and off white, WOW, I can smell berry tartness from two feet away. Nose is acerbic, with hints of grapes, cherries, musk, also to me the odor of damp and old moss covered oak, a plethora of aromas in this nose. First taste, WHAM, a pungent mouth puckering sourness, with just a tiny bit of sweetness, top is light in feel. Finish is dominated by the tartness with a bit of the berries and grapes coming through, vinous, and absolutely the driest aftertaste Ive ever experienced. My oh my what a brew this is, and I must say it was worth the wait and the $44.00 I paid for it.
Note: As I was enjoying this great beer, I was thinking what would go good with it to make a perfect Sunday Afternoon, so I slapped in a great Jazz CD (Monk's Dream), and opened another precious gift a Cuban Cigar, I was in Beer/Cigar & Music Nirvana! 1,270 charactersGusler, Apr 23, 2006

2002 vintage
A- When I peeled of the black foil the cap is very rusted and corroded with a black crust. The cork underneath has micro-bubbles oozing out of the middle forming a tiny layer of beer. When I pulled the cork it was all soaked through and a fine mist of beer covered the table with a pop. 
This beer pours a raspberry red hazy body with a good strong carbonation. The head is a thick pinkish foam with peppered with little black specs from the bottle. The head soon dissipates to a mass of bubbles in the center of a thin ring around the rim. 
S- The earthy smell of decomposition comes through with some strong notes of barnyard. There is a faint vinous dark red wine note in the background. The strong aroma of pigs comes through more than any other barnyard note. 
T- There is a nice tartness that makes me pucker on the first few sips but then starts to blend with some sweet red grape notes which remind me of raspberries. The finish is a dry earthy quality that has a big fizz to the taste. As it warms a bit there are notes of plums in the fruit. The bright fruit taste hangs on the tongue after each sip. With the next glass the flavor changes more and more with each sip. The flavors of fresh red wine grapes of the wine with a faint mellon note before the taste of sweettarts comes through in the finish. 
M- This beer has a light mouthfeel with a champagne fizz in the texture. 
D- This is an interesting fruit lambic but I thought the aroma was a bit one-dimensional and I didn't get the depth and complexity out of the fruit that I was expecting. 1,619 charactersrhoadsrage, Mar 14, 2006
4.62/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5served far too cold at the Monk's Cafe, Philadelphia. I let this sit 50 minutes (eating and drinking in meanwhile) before pouring. Pours dark orange with 15% active head which fades quickly, leaving next to no foam. I was not shown the cork for this bottle, so don't know the vintage.
Smell is a powerful classic cantillon nose, musty sour odor which is is more concentrated than I have found in their other lambics or gueuzes. 
Taste is a strong attack of the above, but it fades quickly. It feels somewhat one-dimensional, but given that this is a single aged lambic that is not surprising - this is not a blended beer. It is enchantingly sour but I would like more prolonged taste and/or finish. Not sure what effect temperature issues may have had on this.
This beer has all of the classic taste elements that make cantillon THE traiditional lambic, but in this bottle they were not comprehensive. Just for the nose and front end of taste I would buy as much of this as I could.
Follow-up 4/8/06 After trying this at Monk's Cafe, I sourced some separately and tried it, wondering how the temperature issue at monk's had impacted taste. This bottle, cork-dated 2004, is very similar to the one reviewed above. maybe a little darker in color, less musty in nose, a LOT more carbonation, but the same issues with short taste and finish exist. This does seem to be a characteristic of lambics (this is a blend of 2 lambics AFAIK) versus complexity found in gueuze. 1,476 charactersdogfooddog, Mar 13, 2006

Aroma: bracing, yet invigorating, a blast of cherries and grape, twisted by sour...musty, rank, and deep...liking it...a deep well, dominated by fruit. Delectable.
Taste it, already! Oooo! Weeee! Owww! Bold, huge, fat puckeration,...ooo, ooo, ooo! Takes hold of the mouth and doesn't let go! A blend of dark fruits, cherries, and berries, and grapes. Luscious. Sour and flavorful. Mellows a touch, gets easy as we go, gets easier to take..
Not for everyone, but a particular treat for demanding palates, constant play on the tongue that is rewarding for some, punishing for others.
Hard to compare this to anything else on earth. Far beyond any other lambic, a definitive sui generis classic.

This beer has a beautiful red color. There is a head, but very little retention. No lacing to speak of. Small, constant stream of bubbles near the side. Reminds me of champagne. When it gets lower in the glass, more brown colors come through.
Taste and smell have a lot of typical Cantillon funky notes. Fruit flavor peak out at the end, but I would be hard pressed to identify them as Bordeux grapes unless I knew they were Bordeux grapes ahead of time.
Very drinkable, but I like Cantillon funkiness. I've had this before with more grape notes and less funkiness. This shant be the last time I try this one out. 638 charactersGeoffFromSJ, Feb 13, 2006

Aroma is sour with some touch of sweetness. Taste is quite a surprise with less acidity then I would have expected from Cantillon with a nice balance between the grapes and the lambic. Carbonation is quite strong and body is quite light. Well balance tart and sweetness with the grapes less dominant then expected. Probably one of the only Cantillon that I wouldnt mind drinking a whole 750ml by myself on a hot summer day. 514 charactersPhyl21ca, Feb 06, 2006
4.03/5  rDev -9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750ml purchased at Yankee Spirits, Sturbridge, MA. Black foiled cap (extensively rusted) and cork. Cork noted bottled in 2002.
Poured into a Rapscallion glass, formed a 3/4" light pink head above the clear red brew, and it seems to glow when held up to the light. Head lasted pretty well, with minimal lacing. Aroma is barnyard tart, and apparent as soon as the cork was popped. Quite pervasive. Taste is super tart from the get-go, seems to shock the tongue in the middle, then you cross the hump, and it closes with a very dry grape tinge. Mouthfeel and drinkability are par for the style, although I admit I was hoping for a bit more depth in the fruit character. A nice treat, but I concur with others that the price is somewhat prohibitive. 748 charactersppoitras, Nov 11, 2005
3.9/5  rDev -12%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5750ml bottle. Bottled in 2003.
Beautiful pink/rose color with a white head that didn't last very long, but left some lacing on the glass. Aroma is very "Cantillon-like" (at least from the 3 other Cantillon brews I've tried). Pungent, tart, sour aroma with hints of grapes. Flavor is dry..Acidic, tart flavor and very wine-like qualities. Fruit flavor is complex and lingers forever on the tongue, as the harsh taste nearly numbs your tastebuds. A little sweetness to balance the astringency wouldn't kill these things..but maybe that's just me.
Too tart for me, regardless of the style. Doesn't live up to the hype, as far as I'm concerned, but that would be damn tough to do. The harsh acidity may taste fine to some, but it doesn't impress me.
The bottom line..it's not worth the $35 per bottle. 802 charactershero27, Oct 30, 2005

Nose is exceptional, bretty, good farmstable with lots of oak, dry hay and that sweaty horses in the back. Good sourness and obvious grapejuice make it and overall most impressive nose. Taste is sour but after getting used too most impressive too, giving grapes, oak, dry bitterness and sourish aftertaste. Yes this goes all the way and good carbonisation witch is high but fitting making mouthfeel IMO perfect too. Greatly enjoying every sip of it and wished wy girlfriend wouldn't like it so I could enjoy the whole 750 just by myself. 625 characterspaterlodie, Oct 20, 2005

750ml, capped and corked 
Pours with a murky pinkish purple body, fizzy off white head, retention isnt great
Smell, thick winey grapes, some sherbet fizz, slight whiff of cherries. Tart acidity on the nose, slightly funky but very slight.
Taste, sharp tart citrus, almost puckering, followed by a whack of warming rounded red wine grapes. Slight warming merlot alcohol on the finish. Zesty grapefruit throughout also. Some acidity throughout, lots of red wine vinegar type flavours
I'd had a few real lambics and gueuzes before this and they all impressed me, this did also. It grew on me, at first i wasnt overly impressed, i thought the body was very thin and the flavours a bit one dimensional but as you have a few more sips, then a few more it becomes a much more flavourful and deep beer, great stuff. A grade A lambic, but not something i'd drink everyday 882 characterscypressbob, Aug 10, 2005

Vinous, burgandy grapes, funky brett, and stinky socks aroma. Smooth but tart taste. This is very much wine like, grapes, light sweetness, and finishing with that signature tart Cantillon taste. Lots of tart lemon present in the taste. A very nice fruit lambic and one that I looked long and hard for. 399 charactersegajdzis, Aug 05, 2005
3.41/5  rDev -23%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Pours a pink/red/cranberry. Little light pink head, with some large and very small bubbles mixed together, disappear rather quickly. A small amount of very fine bubbles could be seen with a light swirl. Bacteriology lab smell dominates, with just a hint of sulfur and grape. Taste is acidic and tart. Thin to moderate mouthfeel. Tart, and more tart no real grape, fruit, or any other flavors of note. The sides of my tongue were screaming, while the rest had nothing to focus on. Rather one dimensional. Dry finish. If you are looking for only tart, acidic character then this is for you if you are willing to pay the $30 price tag. Much more interesting Lambics (including other much less expensive Cantillons) out there for a fraction of the cost. 
If you are new to Lambics and expecting or looking for Lambics with a balance of tartness and sweetness, look elsewhere. Also do not assume that since there are grapes on the label, that the product will taste anything like grape. 
I enjoyed it, but nothing special. 1,021 characterssacfly, Jul 18, 2005
4.3/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52003 
The liquid was lightly hazy, purplish-pink in hue with a dull ruby-sunshine highlight. The head was white in color; the bubbles never really formed much of a head. At its most put-together moment the big bubbles gathered momentarily and created a head of a half finger. Head retention was poor, the foam rapidly faded to a soapy collar, largely naked in the middle. Sadly there was no subsequent lacing. I really enjoy the color of the liquid and for some reason those big, unsocial bubbles really caught my eye. The incompleteness of the head was intriguing. This is an attractive beer. 
The nose is fruity tart and funky with a woody, oaky, winy, bacterial aroma. The fruitiness is distant but rounded and soaked in vinegar. Dark grapes. Orange peel. Lemon zest. Spiced apple. I detect a kiss of wheat bread and raw yeast. At room temperature the bouquet has a hotness to it that really adds depth and it made my eyes water. However, I still find the potency to be too tame. I also expected more articulation from this beer. The D.O.C. once asked, Is it funky enough? I have to say no. Inviting, it is. Spectacular the bouquet is not. 
The palate is better then the nose, thankfully. In fact this is very tasty. I love the tartness with the potent acidic. Red wine notes are lovely. There is oak-woodiness with like a lactic, bacterial twang. This beer is lip-smacking good. The fruitiness is akin to a crazy-ass vinaigrette with cherries, orange peel, lemon zest, dark grapes, and red apples. The finish is well rounded, tart, and mildly funky but not all that long. It is long enough so I dont forget what I just swallowed. I want cheese, now! Fruit too. Overall this is damn tasty. Dry. Very refreshing. 
Around medium in body, moderate carbonation but the bubbles are active enough to create a zippy mouthfeel. Solid mouthfeel, very good actually but it is not earth shattering it is missing something, what Im not sure but it works nevertheless. 
This beer is very good. However, at $35 a bottle this is a beer that I most likely wont be purchasing again. In fact I needed an excuse to validate the expense. My 1000th review on BA seemed like a fitting reason. And so I make the purchase a few months ago. I split my bottle with my girlfriend; it was a lovely experience (considering she is a Belgian rookie). I am happy I tried this rare gem but it really wasnt as great as I would have liked, regardless of the price. I have no complaints well, I do wish the nose was louder and deeper and I do wish the palate had more malt. Regardless, I found this beer to be drinkable, likeable, and something I would say is worthy a try. 2,671 charactersbditty187, Jun 29, 2005
4.85/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is quite a wonder of a beer. Just totally unique. Definately something you should try at least once, and then treat yourself to once in a while when the money comes in. I bought this one for $32 at Premier in Buffalo, and I don't regret it. As I didn't want to drink this one hunkered down in front of a computer, I drank it outside in the breeze, and am reviewing from notes. 
Appears a dark purpleish-red color, with a bit of your typical beery-amber color coming through, though it's taken over with the more exotic colors. Fairly brash smell, sharp and stinging, sour, and with hay and horse blanket hints. I don't usually use that adjective (horse blanket), and I usually think that typical lambic "funk" is more of a sweaty sock smell, but this one I have to admit is particularly horsey. Taste is all over the place, but comes together in a really subtle yet complex way. Whereas some labics taste blatantly like a particular fruit (rasperries or cherries, for example) this one has more of a blend of fruity tastes. Grapes, and grape skins, fresh from the vine, yes, but also hints of dark cherries and other fruits. There's also a great fresh wood character in there, that was particularly enhanced by drinking this beer outside, which I highly recommend. Everything about this beer was so fresh, it just feels like you're blending in with the grass outside. That sounded a little hippyish, but that's how I felt when I drank this beer. Super dry mouthfeel makes it all come together. Really a world class beer here, living up to all the hype. Though hype really isn't a good word here, and doesn't fit the beer. The Saint Lamvinus is simply a delicious beer, from one of the world's most distinct breweries. Enjoy it. 1,733 characterstwelvsies, Jun 17, 2005
3.73/5  rDev -15.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 2Presentation and Appearance  Big 25.4 oz bottle, with black foil, a cap and a cork. Im a little concerned that the top of the cork is wet. It pours a magnificent clear crimson in my flute, with a creamy light pink head that has pretty good retention due to the carbonation.
Smell  Sour and yeasty with loads of mixed fruit. It smells similar to the other Cantillon fruit lambics that I have had. Vinegar mixed with wine is the best way I can describe it. Lamvinus really has a lot going on here, incredibly complex stuff.
Taste  Sour, but not as sour as many lambics. The yeast is strong, earthy and musty to balance of the sourness. This is as close to a wine as it is to a beer, with its mix of fruity flavors. Grapes are the main fruit flavor, but there are notes of passion fruit, strawberries and cherries. The more I drink the less I taste the sourness and more the fruit comes out.
Mouthfeel  Pretty light with high carbonation. The sourness makes the sides of the mouth tingle a little adding to the mouthfeel.
Drinkability and Notes  While I respect this beer, the exceedingly high price and sourness make this a one time purchase for me. I enjoyed this but not that much more than the standard Cantillon Kriek. If you have some extra money kicking around, and you love lambics, particularly those from Cantillon, pick one of these up for a special occasion. 1,391 charactersOldSock, Jun 16, 2005
4.67/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Capped and corked 750, cork dated 2003 - This is my 3rd bottle of this stuff that I've been able to enjoy. The first 2 bottles were dispersed during a couple of parties I had, one of which a certain few special BA's were there for and coaxed me to open one up.
This one was shared with just a few friends and I was finally able to sit and write my review notes.
Appearance is of a dark cranberry juice mixed with a splash of grape juice. Has some lively carbonation lineage along the sides. Crunchy threaded bubbles of foam decorate the top in a dusty pinkish white. Very active and popping and light amounts of lacing in thin strings. Shrinks down fairly fast as its surface smoothes out some then to a nothing-like misty haze on top and a thin collaring.
Outstandingly strong aroma, which is nothing out of the ordinary for Cantillon. Lots of brisk and lively sour-tartness fully dancing amoung a floor of acidic fibers. Whole mustard seeds, sharp white cheese, dirty barn floor hay, and vinegar all add to a vineous strength of sour stuff tickling the nose. Like a red wine on lambic steroids.
Taste is no different. Tons of tickling sour-tart-acidic stuff. Vineous vinegars, layers of highly sour bread grains, old cheese, puckering sugars, and lambic yeast all make for a big effect of smooth and delicate dryness. Each sip brings another layer of dryness after the tart stuff clears a path. Not as funky as the smell eludes too. What I found unique and mcuh more to my liking about this compared to other Cantillon's I've had is that this was much more easier on the palate to control. It reminded me of a Saison with a kick of extra sour dough breads, yeast, and an addition of grapes.
Feathery medium/heavy dryness and tart supplied, multi-layered, acidicness keep this sucker pretty tongue tingly and cheek-scraped dry. One of the things I couldn't quite get used to was its overall dryness. The sour stuff leads right into it and it takes every corpuscle in your mouth prisoner as it ghostly leaves all sorts of weird cottony-tart left overs. Again, like a grapey saison.
Drinkability is OK, takes a good while to get used to. It has a nice saison quality to it that I tend to like over the other true lambics that Cantillon is known for. Think of it as a vinegar spiked red wine blended with a saison. 2,330 characterstavernjef, May 31, 2005

The aroma was very much lambic with a distinct acetic sourness and some rubbery phenolic aromatics. The aroma was fruity with light grapeskin and seeds. The barnyard aroma was mostly sweaty and oaky with some bad cheese thrown in for good measure.
The flavor was sour but not overly so. The flavor dried quickly on the palate leaving a distinct grape flavoring. The flavor also contained a grape skin and grape seed flavor that were neither overdone. The flavor also contained some mishandled cheese flavors that melded well with the other flavors.
The finish was dry with lasting grape and sour flavors long into the aftertaste. The body was medium and fine. 
A very expensive beer for no more complexity than it exibited. Based upon the reviews this beer had garnered I expected more. The place where this beer excelled was drinkability. In no other aspect could I take it beyond good.
750 ml corked and capped bottle. Bottled in 2003 on the cork. Above and on the cork was some thick brown liquid. Purchased at Green's in Atlanta, GA for $28.75. Most expensive single bottle of beer I ever purchased. Perhaps it should be sampled fresher, but without ripping off the foil, there was no way to know the age till the top is popped and the cork was extracted. 1,397 charactersGCBrewingCo, May 28, 2005

An aroma of lambic elements, with a definate red wine character to it. The flavor is a very traditional non sweet lambic with a good deal of sourness to it without overpowering it. The body is medium light and slightly heavier than most lambics. The finish is quite astrigent with some if the winelike sourness present. This is a very outstanding beer. 502 charactersWildman, Mar 14, 2005

Beautiful looking hue of scarlet. With a dash of that cranapple juice look to it. This fucker literally radiates. There's a bubbly light pink froth that caps it off quite nicely. It recedes to a thick, bubbly collar that leaves sporadic clingy lace. 
Aroma is quite nice. Soft notes of vinegar, mustiness and barnyard funk are complented nicely by some purple grape sweetness and wine characteristics. 
I find that this lambic really finds a happy medium between sour and sweet. It's got that horse blanket and farmyard funk going on. And the acidic properties, acetic acid, etc... but to a lesser extent than most Cantillon offerings. On the flip side, this beer also has a touch of grape fruit sweetness and red wine. And it's an interaction that works to perfection. 
This beer is Bone Dry. Sahara Desert Dry. And the carbonation is ever so subtle. The body is about medium or so. And this beer leaves you wanting more, sip after sip, until it is gone... 985 charactersBighuge, Feb 06, 2005

The flavor was very much the same as the aroma predicted. Strange tart/sour character with a great background flavor from the grapes. Very complex. There's a lot going on here. Very enjoyable.

It really draws you in and keeps you wanting more and more. The taste is amazing. Lots of sweet and sour, with some funkiness. Dry grapes smashed under a horse's saddle. The complexity almost made my head explode. The mouthfeel had sizzling carbonation that just popped on the tongue, unlike any other beer I've experienced. The drinkability was through the roof.

The liquid pours a beautiful rosey ruby color with a finger of spritzey head that immediately fallst to ring the beer with large bubbles. This one is very wine-like in the color, somewhere between a blush and a dark red. The nose was true to the Cantillon form. Funky, sour, acidic, but with a nice fruity grape coming in behind the funk, smelling so damn good. The flavor. What can one say about liquid nirvana; something so awesome that I would be happy to drink exclusively for the rest of my life. What struck me most was how mellow and smooth this was. I've had a few of the Cantillon line, but this was every bit as funkey, but much more mellow. Still sour and acidic and tart, but not puckering. The grape flavor hits secondarily behind the initial burst of sour and acid, but it serves to polish this beer like the finest diamond. The feel was a weak moderate to moderate, wtih a light, dancing bubble on my tonge. Nothing that got in the way, but enough to know it was there. Awesome balance on the pucker factor. Wow...wow, wow, wow. If there is anything left to say about the drinkability that can't be drawn from what I've already said, I don't know what it would be. Hunt this beer. Drink this beer.

Surprisingly still in appearance despite the bold effervesence on the tongue. Sour nose with an especially vomitous, bile-like aroma. Ah, lovely, lovely Cantillon. Pressing deeper, one is hard-pressed to evade the grape skin and cranberry redolence present under the initial funk. Fruity cranberry sweetness and mild bitterness blend nicely with a potent sourness. It's quite sour, though I think of their fruit lambics, this is more nominal and par for the course (meaning consistent, not poor) than it is exceptional. Spectacular beer. 616 charactersmarburg, Oct 20, 2004
4.62/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52003 edition had at the Moan and Dove. Deep pinky brownish cherry body. Almost no head, but theres that mysterious cloudiness I love in some bottle-conditioned beers which just seems to make the color complex. Huge aroma, very clean, balsamic, lightly farmy and surprisingly pretty sweet. Floral sweetness, dessert sauce, red wine-ish.. This defines classy. Field notes. Complex woody oak-like character. On the tongue, you really taste the grape skins out of it. Acidity level is masterfully controlled. Just the right lactic bite. It evolves into a malic fruitiness, passes through a moldy temporary state and finishes very leafy with remarkable mouth puckering properties. Cantaloup, pomegranate.. Big mouthfeel, full bodied, moderately carbonated, perfectly fitting imo and enhances global flavour deployment. Dryness hits you up and leaves a toy of an astringency with which I spent several minutes experimenting sips of water. What can I say, water tasted just sooo good after a sip of st-lamvinus. A beer that will haunt my memories for a long while. Post taste actually doesnt last all that long, but I still found myself trying to suck out the remaining flavours out of my tongue, like struggling for the last red grape of a whole harvest. Unique. This is to sip with respect, not that its not drinkable. 1,319 charactersRastacouere, Oct 12, 2004

Appearance: Cranberry juice red, with zero head.
Smell: Like cabernet Sauvignon, but with that recognizable Cantillon touch.
Taste: Not as sharp as the other Cantillons I've sampled, it has a more subtle flavor. The raisin cuts down the usual dryness. It's like wine, but with an acid finish, and with good carbonation. 
I wouldn't pay the ~40 US$ price tag I saw at a few stores in the States, but if you can get one from the brewery at a very reasonable 8 euro, don't hesitate. 532 charactersGoldorak, Oct 11, 2004

4.8/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Well after trying many of the Cantillon offerings I was ready to see what all the hype was about this brew. Pours a cloudy ruby red with a skimish white head that leaves no lace. Aromas are of a typical lambic, but almost a little more subtle. There was the classic barnyard, pungent sourness / tartness and just a slight slight hint of grape. For flavor this beer was just incredible. Smooth and well rounded this beer starts off sour and tart, but it just doesn't overwhelm the pallate like most Cantillon's. There was only the slightest hint of grape flavor and just a little carbonation, but it was enough to just add a little extra something to this beer. The Saint finished a little acidic but not overwhelming like so many other lambics, with just the right amount of sourness to keep this beer very drinkable. By far of all the Cantillon's this is the best, just well textured, good balance of flavors between the tartness and sourness, and the acidic fruit flavors. Though it may be a bit pricey, if you see this around, its definetly worth the pick up. 1,062 charactersbigbeerdrinka, Aug 05, 2004
4.5/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Alright lets see what the commotion is all about.
Magenta.
I always find it kind of redundant to describe the flavors and aromas of a lambic. I usually don't feel like writing down "snake skin, farmhouse, cobwebs, leather, barnyard" and so on and so forth because almost every spontaneously fermented beer possesses these qualities. The difference between the best and the worst are how the flavors mold together. That being said, the aroma on the Saint Lamvinus is subtle. The sourness and traditional Gueuze qualities are toned down by the addition of the grapes. Complex. 
This is a really finely tuned lambic. Incredibly soft and mellow on the palate. The Cantillon lambic qualities are there providing everything in quotes above :) and the addition of the grapes provide an incredible flavor. Mouth puckering and simply to die for.
I understand now. 866 charactersCrosling, Jul 21, 2004

The aroma was very strong, very traditional Cantillon with slight hints of grape. The pour, while plenty vigorous, resulted in no head, merely a brilliant hazy red, semi-viscous liquid.. Little to no carbonation, but an excellent prickle during the swallow. Unlike many other Cantillon lambics, it was completely smooth and perfectly balanced, no overwhelming acidic or sour bite, just enough initial lambic traits, then smooth and satisfying. Wow a traditional lambic with this perfect of drinkability; I could have sipped on it all night. For any lambic lover, worth spending the time, energy, and money to obtain a bottle. I dont believe it will be a revelation for anyone who has enjoyed other Cantillon lambics, but a very, very nice addition to their line. 886 characterstruthbrew, Jun 09, 2004

The smell is the lambic sour mixed with a slight bit of dry wine tart. The taste is a more mellow sourness than other lambics (ie, no face puckering), and the wine grapes add just a bit of tartness, body, and a more complex depth. Mouthfeel is nice and smooth. As for drinkability, this is a lambic that I could session with almost all day without my mouth going numb.
Well, this is the first beer that I had as a college graduate. It's been a long, strange trip, but it's been worth it, and I'm glad that I learned to persevere throughout it. I want to thank ngandhi for sending me this rare bottle and for all of his kind thoughts and words of encouragement as I was preparing for this wonderful day. I also have to thank all of my BA friends that I've met and have yet to meet, and I wish you well at the AOBF and whereever else you may be, and just wish that I could be there with you (though I hope I am in spirit). Finally, I want to thank my family and friends...without their support and their love, I wouldn't be drinking this beer on one of the happiest days of my life, and I have to raise a toast to them. 
As for the lambic, this is easily the best lambic in the world, and I hope that someday I'll be able to reminisce about my good 'ol days here at school with another glass of this. Cheers to Mr. Jean-Pierre van Roy for this masterpiece, and I know that I will have this one again. 1,513 charactersbeergeek279, May 08, 2004

4.05/5  rDev -8.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottled in 2003...
Appearance: a beautiful cassis-red (deep purple-red), a bit hazy, no head at all, thin film of bubbles
Aroma: the usual Cantillon lambic nose (lactic sourness, a bit of sulphur and hay), a bit fruity but not out-right grape-like
Flavor: up front lemony sourness with a grape juice overtone, corky and a bit woody, enteric bitterness, sulphur, finishes dry and tart with a soft wine-like aftertaste... very nice
Mouthfeel: strangely full-bodied, low to no carbonation, slight warmth
Overall Impression: A "cross-over" beer for oenophiles? This one is quite young with lots of fruitiness and low carbonation. Very soft, but also a wine-like full body. No reason why this couldn't be the replacement for a nice Cabernet or Pinot.
As usual, I made my girlfriend (now my wife) try it. She didn't like it, but I poured a small glass for her and told her she could just sit and smell it. About 15 minutes later she was over to the bottle to pour a little more in her glass! She said it tasted good with dark chocolate. Go figure!
Update (July 2008): Just tried the second of my 2003 S. Lamvinus bottles. As expected, the fruitiness of the grapes is gone, leaving the tartness of the lambic. The aroma is a lemony sourness with red wine vinegar and hints of sour socks and creamy goat cheese. The flavor is quite tart, but not overly lip-puckering. Hints of cork, mold, grape skins, popcorn, and an enteric bitterness in the aftertaste. I asked my wife to try it, too. She remembered the aroma, but grimaced at the sharp sourness. 1,548 charactersGreenCard, Apr 18, 2004

5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Opening Notes: Geez, where do I begin? First off a big thanks to NGandhi for this ultimately rare, and pricey ($40+ a bottle) offering from the traditional lambic masters @ Cantillon. The presentaition is subtle, yet beautiful. A 750ml bottle which has a black overwrap, a crown and a cork. Like other aged Cantillon offerings the overwrap is rust-laden, the crown cap, is rusted to death, and the cork is really in there. The rust is gently washed off, the crown cap is pried off and the cork comes out flying with an immense rush of carbonation. Have I just released a beer genie from his bottle?, I ask myself...Note to those "in the know" this is a late 2002 vintage that we are dealing with here...
Appearance: The pour is extremely effervescent, and even noisy! a deeply turbid purple-ish liquid glugs slowly out of the 750 and into one of my best Alba wine glasses. The colour settles down to a deep reddish/pinkish liquid with a small pink/off-white head, that shimmers, fizzes loudly, and than all but dies, leaving only the slightest trace of a head, in the form of a white ring. This colour combination is very reminscent of the extravagent Alba red raspberry wine that I drank the other day. This is truly a beautiful beer to behold. Hold it up to the light and transport yourself to another dimension!
Aroma: The aroma is simply to die for! All of the traditional Cantillon gueuze/lambic aromas are here, and they are enhanced by the addition of the Cabernet-Franc and Merlot grapes from the Libourne region of France. This smells musty and earthy, with hints of leather, horse blanket, sheep, cobwebs, freshly packed dirt, cemeteries/graveyards, other various plants and animals, funky yeast, old barns, stewed shoes, and the general drunken monks, funky skunks, and dirty old drunks. However, the aroma is bolstered, and softened by the character of the different grape varieties that are added to this lambic beer. How can something this good be made so simply, and in such an old-fashioned way? That is a question that I find I ask myself often when I contemplate the greatness of Cantillon beers. Note to self: pick up some Saint Emillion and Pomerol wines soon!
Taste: The taste is what you would expect from a traditional Cantillon lambic offering. Oh wait, it is, and it isn't. The aromas ring true in the taste of this brew, but there is also much more here, than there is in any other lambic beer that I have ever sampled. By soaking the grapes in old French Bordeaux barrels full of lambic, Van-roy has really added a new depth of flavor and character to this offering. The taste is sharp, vinous, and acidic up front, with the classic acidity that one expects in a Cantillon offering. This acidity is than backed up by a new vino acidity that rides in on the coat tails of the previous acidic punch. It's a Cantillon, 1, 2 punch. After the acidic rush ends, the grape flavors mingle on the middle of your tongue. It is hard to describe all of the flavors, but to me it is very reminscent of a spring evening in a vineyard. Or when you ate perfectly ripened graps in your backyard as a child...Finally the finish really blends together the best of the French wine world, and the Belgian lambic world. The acidity makes one last charge on the back of your tongue, leaving a sweet and sour sensation and a bit of an alcoholic tinge on the front of your throat...until, Finally the grapes reappear once more to smooth out everything incredibly well. This is definately the easiest drinking Cantillon out there.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel of this masterpeice is also perfect. It is sharp, acidic, and effervescent at the beginning of your glass, but by the middle of your glass, it has changed. The mouthfeel morphs into a subtle rolling, gentle carbonation, that puts all of the flavors in your mouth and blends them together into one wonderful melange of ecstacy. Just take a sip and airate it through your teeth, swirl it around into your cheeks, and all of the tiny crevices in your mouth. Do you feel that soft, gentle, rolling carbonation releasing itself throughout your entire mouth? This is exactly how a lambic beer should feel. The mouthfeel is absolutely dead on.
Drinkability: The drinkability you ask? Well it was OK. No, no it was not OK, it was PERFECT! This stuff is so well balanced and so easy to drink, that if I was a King, I would demand to have this as my daily drink. I could easily drink this beer all day and every day. The flavors are just blended so well. Combine that fact, with the perfect and heavenly apperance, aroma, and mouthfeel of this brew, and you have the best drinking lambic ever created.
Final thoughts: Thank-you Mr. Van-roy, you are truly an artist and a master creator of traditional lambics, and I am grealty indebted to you. This is easily the best lambic, and probably the best beer that has eveer passed my lips, and I owe it all to you. 
Closing Notes: Get this beer any way that you can, it *IS* most definately worth it!!! 5,014 charactersfrancisweizen, Feb 04, 2004
4.95/5  rDev +11.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Where do I begin? Ahem, OK, Cantillon Saint Lamvinus. A beer I've been looking forward to for quite some time. The holidays, of course, bring out the best in everyone, and in this case, a bottle from my stash of 2002 Saint Lamvinus. Yeah, it was worth it.
Deep pinkish-purple color with a lighter pink-hued head. Simply beautiful. 
Musty nose emitted further aromas of leather, citrus, and earthiness. Deep and omnipresent aroma keeps one's attention all the way through.
Flavors range from typical traditional lambic notes of citrus zest and earth with a characteristic, profound acidity that lingers indefinitely. The Merlot and Cabernet Franc grapes used in the production of this lambic, however, share different flavor profiles to this beer and, in turn, soften (but certainly enhance) it. Some tannin from the Pomerol/St-Emilion-derived grapes appears in the mix and provides some definite acidity to the all ready acidic aged lambic. Almost indescribeable. I hate to sound like too much of a fan of Cantillon, but after sampling this beer, it's hard not to. Deep, eccentric and truly original. 
Lively, carbonated and acidic mouthfeel is wonderful. Not acidic enough to peel the skin from the roof of one's mouth as it seems a bit softened, but lovely nonetheless.
Drinkable like you wouldn't believe, once you have the palate for these traditional fruit lambics, you will never go back. The question that everyone seems eager to ask, however: is it worth the price? Well, if you're a traditional lambic fiend like myself, most definitely YES. I look forward to seeing how some aged bottles come out in a few years. This beer clearly has the acidity and structure to fare well in a cellar. Hard to describe, but a delight to drink. 1,753 charactersJon, Jan 05, 2004
5/5  rDev +12.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Vintage Bottled 2002, Sampled November 24, 2003.
It is with some trepidation that I open this bottle. When I peeled off the foil covering the top of the bottle, the cap was badly rusted and there were streaks of crusted beer running down the neck, as well as a small amount of fresh beer leaking from the cap. Since I was not going to get another one of these in the foreseeable future I let it settle down in my dedicated beer cooler.
There is perhaps a hint of a hiss as I pop the cap off the 750ml bottle; hopefully this beer is not too far gone. The cork feels very moist and is obviously fully penetrated from the beer, a slight acetic smell emanates from the cork. Well I go for the cork pull. The cork pops out, and yes, there is some carbonation here. Perhaps it wont be as bad as I thought.
I pour the beer and low and behold it is very well carbonated. The carbonation produces a couple of inch thick pink to light purple colored head, which, lasts longer than I was expecting. The beer itself is a reddish/ light purple color, quite hazy as well. There is a definite acidic aroma that emanates from my glass. It is sour, though not intensely so.
As I take my first sip I note that there seems to be a large amount of body to this bone dry Lambic. I wonder if the grapes have added some structure, as I was expecting it to be quite thin. The grape character is certainly here, it is under the sourness, there is a bit of tannin here from the grapes. There are some berry notes, which compliment the lemony acidity, it sort of underscores & picks the beer up. As I peel the layers of this beer away I note that the berrygrape like flavor is definitely here.
As this beer warms slightly the wine grapes really start to pick up, especially in the finish. I get an austere vinous slightly tannic ending. The Lambic sourness definitely dominates, but this beer is infinitely better and more complex than the Cantillon Vigneronne. The typical suite of Lambic flavors are here; leathery, musty, and sour. Aromas of cat piss, musty cellar, citrus, vinegar, it is just wonderful to sniff away at. I must get more of this.
A Lambic on its own, when made properly, is incredibly complex. The Cabernet Franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, and the Cabernet Merlot grapes just bring this to a whole other plane of existence. This has got it all, and the grapes did not thin out the body of the Lambic like the Muscat grapes did to the Vigneronne. This beer has convinced me to brew a grape-Lambic, perhaps a syrah.
Well I just finished my first glass of this wonderful beer; luckily I still have a second one yet to savor. In my second glass the sour aroma has receded a bit. The Brett character has become a much more noticeable, accompanied by some enteric notes as well. The aroma is just wonderfully complex; I could just smell this beer forever. So, I take an extended moment to do just that which leads to some ruminations on my part. How can something that is described in such negative terms (enteric, sweaty  leathery  horse blanket, vinegar, barnyard, etc.) be so wonderfully enticing? Well I dont know, but I truly love it. The taste is again sour up front, but the body and finish of this beer is where the grape character shines. Dont get me wrong, dont read too much into my description, this is by no means a wine, definitely a beer, definitely a Lambic, but the marriage of wine and beer is pure genius in the form of Lambic. The complexity here, I never would have guessed that grapes could add so much to the complexity of a traditional Lambic product. Unlike most fruit Lambics (including many that I really enjoy, even most Cantillon products) the grapes take nothing away from the Lambic character, they only add a whole other dimension that intertwines and picks up the character of this Lambic.
No one else should try this beer; I sincerely believe that it is all meant for me. No one else will be able to appreciate the stunning complexity and subtlety that is this beer. After reading this I am sure that anyone else trying this will be let down, so dont get it, seriously, Ive got dibs on the rest.
On a serious note, I really would not recommend anything less than an 8 oz serving of this (and a full 12oz would be adequate, but a 750 would be much better). This beer is just far to complex and needs, nay requires, deep contemplation and time to savor and explore this nectar. Please deeply explore this beer if you get a chance, it is well worth it.
Stunning, contemplative, world class; these are all words that just do not do justice to this beer. Please Jean-Pierre, make this a regular beer in your line-up. 4,674 charactersGueuzedude, Dec 09, 2003

Old Bordeaux wooden barrels are partially filled with a connubial mix of Merlot & Cabernet-Franc grapes, then filled with 2 to 3 year-old lambic. The resultant offering is then bottled without blending. Expensive ingredients & the small batch sizes, make this a *very* rare offering from Cantillon. It is not often that this beer is seen, let alone tasted.
It pours with a strong effervescence in the glass; indeed the fizz is quite audible as the surface literally effervesces for about 30 seconds, or so, whilst contributing to a 1 deep, light pink smooth head. But sadly this soon dies completely, leaving only a thin ring on the stunning deep turbid matte red surface. When back-lit, the beer resembles the red grape juice that many home-brewers use. It should do, the grapes used actually color this most amazing lambic. 
A deeply pungent, acetic, vinegar nose that screams Cantillon & releases lambic-pheromones in such huge quantities, that my raised lambic-testosterone levels almost cause premature ejaculation. My nasal hair tingles as the acidic vapors enter the nostrils. I reel with sado-masochistic delight as I inhale deeply, again & again. Gorgeously astringent, eye-watering & incredibly nose puckering.
Mouthfeel is, as ever, spritzy. A dry fruity beer whose inherent carbonation waits until it hits your tongue until it decides to release itself from its liquid captivity. Rolling this lambic on the tongue has almost masturbatory overtones.
The taste starts with an experience of complete astringency. A Sahara dryness persists, the usual lambic sourness is off-set by the sharp vino-contribution from the Merlot & Cabernet-Franc grapes. A fruity middle exudes a winelike character that is heavenly. The finish has a Bordeaux-lambic ending that lingers. A juxta-posed Fine Wine-Lambic mixture, that works, but neatly sums up this beer. 
Quite simply a Grand Cru of the Fruit Lambic World.
A truly traditional Esoteric Grape-Lambic. Only the Masters at Cantillon could ever consider even doing this, let alone pull it off with such incredible orgasmic finesse.
I am truly not worthy & forever indebted to yen157 for this offering, your Sainthood is in the Mail. 2,534 charactersTheLongBeachBum, Mar 20, 2003
