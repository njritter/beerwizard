4.58/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours an opaque orange with two fingers of white head that foam up quickly and retain well. A few patches of lacing left behind. Aroma is orange, mango, and clementine with a residual citrus sugar. Honey, and flower hops round out a lively aroma. Flavor profile is very similar with notes of orange, mango, and tangerine. Honey sweetens the already citrusy-sweet flavor. Flowery hop notes with a slight bitterness finish out the flavor profile. Mouth feel is smooth, and velvety with a medium-thick feel. Overall, a naturally-sweet tasting DIPA that drinks smooth and tasty. Big aroma, with a flavor profile that nearly matches. 
Served in a 12oz snifter. 656 charactersHarrison8, May 29, 2017

So good. Taste is very smooth, peaches and vinous flavors. Nice malt finish and hop bite. Dry on the finish. Very fluffy and creamy mouth feel. Lots of sediment in this can which is the first I have noticed in any of the Trilliums I have had. But still simply awesome. 379 charactersGambyt20, May 26, 2017

 A: nice fluffy white head. Body is a bright yellow with a pretty good haze to it.
S: honeydew, mango, peaches, pineapple, a little herbal as well
T: tons of juicy ripe stone fruit a little light sweetness. Mangoes, honeydew peaches so juicy and fruity. 
M: medium carbonation with a good medium to fuller mouthfeel.

4.89/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured 5/17/17 from a 32oz growler that was filled at the brewery on 5/15/17, into a tulip glass.
A: The beer is a bright gold color, with a short off-white head that fades quickly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains strong grassy hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with a strong fruity citrus sweetness that is quickly followed by a strong grassy and dank hops bitterness. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and provides a great balance. The after-taste is hoppy and sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean for the style.
O: Extremely tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, nice kick, excellent representation of style, this is a top-tier 2IPA to drink for a long time. 798 charactersTheManiacalOne, May 18, 2017
4.37/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A: Poured from the growler into a Duvel tulip. Body is hazy golden with a small ecru-colored head.
S: Nice nose - fruity. Tropical fruit (think pineapple) and stone fruit (think apricots or ripe plums).
T: As a DIPA that falls on the lighter side of the DIPA spectrum (at 8.5% ABV), this beer is surprisingly malty, with a fairly big, sweet, malt foundation. Followed by pineapple and citrus peel and some apricot as well. Flavor is pretty intense and deep. 
M: Thick, full in body and heft; feels a bit syrupy at times. 
O: early sips made me think this was better than the Double Dry Hopped Fort Point that I'd had immediately prior, though after a while I changed my mind on that conclusion. Still, this is really, really good stuff. 740 charactersKendo, May 17, 2017

L -- Aerated pour produces two fingers of solid white head over a muted orange haze. Lots of sediment/floaties. Some retention and no lacing
S -- Mosaic hops have a really interesting aroma. Very little citrus, a good amount of pineapple/mango, and a unique combination of bubblegum, blueberry, and Concord grape. Barely any maltiness, but the booze is a little sharp
T -- Sharp boozey kick upfront leads to a mild honey sweetness and cracker-like malts against hop fruitiness and a white wine-like grape flavor
F -- This can might be a little too fresh, since the yeasty booziness makes my mouth tingle. Robust yet drinkable for the ABV. Dry, puckering finish
O -- Mosaic hops are an enigma, for sure, but I much prefer what Trillium is doing with galaxy hops. At $22/4-pack, this one doesn't rise to the top of their brews

4.9/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Like grapefruit, pith and juice and alcohol too. Oh wait, I only wish there was booze in my grapefruit cause I'd spend a lot less on beer. This is the good stuff. Each sip builds on itself to a fruit explosion. I've had a few batches of cans and some on draft at the brewery and I loved it all. If there was a cost addendum to the rating, that would hurt my overall score. I do know how much these hops cost though, so I do hope they keep their contracts and push out this beer again. Great work as always, and very much worth the drinking experience! 551 characterskool-aid, May 13, 2017

typical of N.E. IPA's is a hazy yellow/orange hue, fuzzy white head .  Smells of peach, apricot, citrus salad, and gorgeous mosaic hops.  Tastes sweet peach, gives way to the citrus and hop explosion that all blend well on the tongue, nice amount of carbonation that makes this a nice mouth feel, but really easy to drink.  Great warm weather beer, easy to crush, even at 8.5% 394 charactersJshbrown40, Apr 27, 2017

hazy orange
smell - floral, apricot, peach
taste - really complex - fruity upfront - lemony, definitely herbal and floral off the top of the sip.  bitterness comes through but mild, dry but at the end there's a sweetness to it along with a pretty big punch of booze
feel is medium, nice bubbles, a nice dry feel to it - its refreshing but you get the heft of the double
overall really enjoyed it.  only the second trillium i've tried but i think i liked the other one more than this (DDH A Street).  much different than i expected it to be, its lemony and herbal, a little bit tart, a little astringent.  overall quite interesting and different than most ive tried in this style.  glad i got to try it 728 charactersc_tails, Jan 23, 2017

aromas of lemon drop, candied peach, tangerine, grapefruit, blueberry, bit of vegetal/earthy spice, pine, weedy notes. this is a nice nose!! 
palate is orange and nectarines up front, mint, grass, lemon, grapefruit peel, resinous pine... touch of booze apparent as well. 
good but I was definitely a bit let down by this beer. a bit too much of the bitter and lemony notes, a touch of booze coming through, and a slightly thin and less creamy feel than id expect from a trillium ale. 601 charactersHyptochrons, Jan 19, 2017

Cutting tiles is one of my favorite Trillium beers.  Super juicy with a bright golden yellow haze.  About an inch of fluffy white head.  The typical grapefruit, apricot, peach notes up front with a mild bitter finish, but not over-powering. 343 charactersBasebol17, Nov 01, 2016

16oz can served in a teku glass.  Pours a *hazy* yellow.  Nose is incredibly dank, but cut by a prominent wild honey note.  This palate cuts the west-coast IPA base not with saccharine malt, but with mellowing honey.  This beer is incredible.  Absolutely world-class, and perhaps the best beer I've tried from Trillium thus far (which is saying a lot).  Simply incredible. 501 charactersLAp, Oct 30, 2016

4.08/5  rDev -9.7%look: 1.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4From a 16oz can, dated 10/11/16, served in an imperial pint/nonic.
Pours a mildly hazed golden-orange with a finger-and-a-half of short-lived foam and minimal lacing. The glass is awash in suspended chunks of whatever-the-hell-that-crap-is. It looks like shit or, at least, all the partially dissolved toilet paper that's left after you've plunged the toilet. Did I drink it anyway? You bet I did.
Nose of caramel malt and honey, sweet herbs and biscuit.
Tastes of peaches and honey, flowers, herbs, sweet cereal, soft and biscuity. Finishes gently with just a kiss of pineapple and pine needle bitterness.
Feel is no more than medium-bodied, soft and slightly chewy, brightly carbonated.
Overall, looks like crap, tastes fine. This was my third? fourth, maybe? can and I didn't notice all the floaties before now - maybe it was dark last night, maybe I poured this one too hard. Dunno. Anyway, if yours looks like a freshly plunged toilet, too, drink it anyway. 967 characterspapposilenus, Oct 17, 2016

Pours hazy pale orange with a half-inch khaki head that remains as a thick ring and leaves strands of lace. The smell is of grapefruit, orange, faint mango and a hint of pine. The taste follows with orange, grapefruit, peach, tropical fruit accents, a hint of pine and faint honey sweetness. Juicy and full textured with medium carbonation. World class.

4.01/5  rDev -11.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 416oz can, poured into a 12oz snifter glass. Enjoyed on 8.24.16, reviewed from Tasting Journal. 
The beer pours a turbid golden color, super hazy with almost no head, maybe a slim fizzy white line of bubbles with some nice lace. The aroma is nice, tons of citrusy hops, raw honey, sweet cereal grains, certainly a mosaic presence, pine, earthiness, lightly tropical with some mineral water. The flavors are good, earthy yet fruity mosaic hops, grassy, piney, dirty hop spice, raw honey brings out some fruit character that is fairly tropical and bright with some citrus and strong bitterness that leads to some assertive malt. The mouthfeel is good, heavy body, lower carbonation, very smooth and gentle but big and assertively dry at the finish.
Verdict: A nice DIPA from Trillium, really heavy and intense beer, tons of mosaic hops, which aren't my favorite but smooth and refreshing. Definitely a solidly good beer, but not really my favorite expression of hops, and the heaviness is a bit tasking at times. 1,011 characterskevanb, Sep 24, 2016

Not getting the stone fruits, so maybe age is coming onto play. Full bodies and average carbonation. 367 characterszonker17, Jul 07, 2016

L: 2F head with moderate retention, some lacing, and a little bit of a ring. Beer is a fairly hazy light gold.
S: Fruitbomb. Stone fruits like peach, plum, nectarine from the Mosaic hops and floral from the honey. Phenomenally great.
T: Juicy peach and plum with honey and the malts providing counterbalance to the bitterness. This is really fantastic.
F: Medium bodied, light to medium carbonation, very strong construction and balance. Long finish incorporating honey and dankness.
O: A complex, fantastic DIPA. Definitely go out of your way to get it. 698 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jul 04, 2016

Citrusy nose, dominated by tangerine
Tastes a bit spicy...I'm picking up some onion and peppercorn. Kind of a surprising flavor profile. Also some floral notes. Orange citrus. Not a huge malt backbone.
A bit of bitterness, and the alcohol is definitely present.
Interesting beer, but not up to the standard I have seen from other Trillium beers 397 charactersTrojanRB, Jul 01, 2016

4/5  rDev -11.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Lightly hazy amber gold--much clearer than other Trillium beers. A fizzy finger of head dies to a persistent bubble layer with a thick collar leaving spotty lace. There was a noticeable floater or two, which is surprising considering their attention to detail.
Explosive and vibrant aroma perfumes the room, it's just so citrusy. Sweet and spicy orange, lemon lime, pink peppercorn, rice pudding?, and wild mint. I just want to breathe this in all day.
Taste of pine and some spicy, almost hot yeast. Flavors of spiced orange, mint, green onion, and lemon lime soon follow up. The honey only shyly shows itself long after the finish, along with a little oat or light grain.
Artaic is frothier than it appears, yet is still a touch thinner than other Trillium brews. 768 charactersSabtos, Jun 28, 2016

To taste, the honey adds a slight sweetness, but not too much. Elegant, light, citrus - so easy to drink. Smooth finish. Overall, a nicely balanced beer that I would drink over and over again. 291 characterstbryant21, Jun 21, 2016
4.81/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Appearance: Orange and gold, a bit hazy. 
Smell: Haribo peach candy. Juicy dank citrusy hops, with just a touch of cut green garlic.
Taste: The honey is a beautiful undercurrent throughout, giving a surprising sweetness (instead of drying the beer out entirely) that ends elegant and dry. Juicy citrus and floral hop flavors, and some honeydew melon.
Mouthfeel: Lightness and elegance belie the ABV. 
Overall: So, so good. Would love to be able to homebrew as masterfully as this. This is a gem. 499 charactersMilou, Jun 21, 2016

Smell is slight citrus, not strong.  The wild honey balances the mosaic hops.  The finish is smooth with the honey flavor.  This one is better than the last batch with much less, maybe only a hint, of onion flavor.  Overall great beer.   I'll get this one again. 373 charactershasher, Jun 19, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a teku pint.  Label says 05/27/16.
A- Pours a semi-hazy medium amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a mostly full sheet of surface foam.  Resilient lacing leaves a thick solid ring behind.
S- Dank hop aroma and a solid dose of malt sweetness.  Noticeable hop fume.  Big note of grapefruit.
T- Great balance here as there's equal parts bitterness and hop flavor, good malt backing and very little notice of the high ABV.  The hops flavor puts forth notes of stone fruit, grass and more grapefruit.  Too easy to drink.
M- Sharp from the hops with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- This beer has less of the hop explosion I'm used to from Trillium.  While it's plenty hoppy, the balance of the malt comes more into play, almost like an American Barleywine.  Either way, it's delicious. 917 charactersImmortale25, Jun 16, 2016

A:  Sunshine yellow with 2 finger frothy white head. Lasting retention and leaving nice lacing. 
S:  Grapefruit and lemon zest mixed with a faint honey sweetness.  An almost floral quality to the nose. 
T:  Candied tangerines and peaches. Grapefruit and tropical fruits. Light hop bitterness but very well controlled. 
M:  Medium body with average carbonation and a soft pleasant mouthfeel.  Finish is a touch dry.

Big creamy foamy 1+ finger head fades slowly with tons of lacing, fairly hazy not quite murky honey orange pale color.
Nose big dank hops, tons of resin, orange peel, pine forest floor, earthy dank pine sap, little melon rind, some tropical notes, mild creamy malt.
Taste brings lots more earthy pine sap, very oniony and soapy, tons of resin and dank musty pine, mild orange peel, not much for tropical but a little, pretty much like an onion growing underneath a pine tree dripping sap on it in the middle of the forest.
Mouth is med bod, decent carb.

Taste follows suit with the honey sweetness (but not much, perfect amount) coming thru about 2/3 the way in. As it warms it gains complexity. You get more tropical notes at that point. Low bitterness and perhaps the slightest bit of alcohol taste. This is a very nice addition to Trillium's repertoire. Get u some! 339 charactersGabrielEVH, Jun 09, 2016

An incredible balance of all these flavors. Just enough bitterness. Really outstanding. Super soft mouthfeel. Bottom line -- definitly world class. I want more.

4.67/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This beer pours a slightly hazy golden orange color with a huge sudsy white head that sticks around forever. This is the least cloudy Trillium beer I've seen. There are thick, sticky, hanging sheets of lacing. The smell on this is unbelievable!! Citrus is the star, most notably grapefruit and tangerine, also some peach. There are strong notes of an earthy dankness as well as some sweet floral notes. The taste is the same, although slightly less amazing because the hop notes aren't as individually pronounced as in the smell, but instead an amazing cornucopia of flavors. The feel is medium and very smooth with a lightly bitter and sticky yet dry finish. Overall this beer is amazing. Up there with the best I have ever had from Trillium. Must admit I was slightly skeptical as the only other DIPA I've had brewed with honey is Hopslam, and that is a hot mess, but this beer was so elegantly and masterfully executed I am almost at a loss for words. 954 charactersCNoj012, Jun 02, 2016

The mosaic hops and the raw honey are a perfect match. The nose is very similar to a lot of their other ipa's, but the taste is what really sets this one apart, especially as it warms a little. The tropical/stone fruit flavors gradually give way to more dankness and a lingering floral note that is undoubtedly from the honey. Highly complex, absolutely delicious, and a joy to drink. For me, this is just about as close to perfection as you can get. 530 charactersbwrenn24, Jun 02, 2016

The aroma is very fruity. Tropical, with a ton of melon and fresh mango juice. Citrusy, with some tangerine and grapefruit. And there's some berry sweetness as well. Blueberries, strawberries. Wonderfully sweet. Back end is lightly grainy with the faintest hint of grass. Not getting much honey on the nose but the aroma is still wonderfully complex.
The flavor starts off with a burst of citrus. Orange, tangerine, and mild, musty grapefruit. The middle brings more tropical notes of melon, mango, and peach. Finishes lightly bittersweet and spicy with some pine and sticky honey.
The feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Very soft, but not pillowy. Goes down relatively smooth. Only the slightest warmth from the alcohol.
Overall, a truly fantastic DIPA that met and exceeded the hype for me. This beer has been my "white whale" for about a year now and I'm very happy I was finally able to try it. Mosaic is such a versatile hop and may very well be my favorite. Very well done. 1,128 charactersScaryEd, Jun 01, 2016

Aroma of huge orange, citrus, tangerine, papaya, mango. The aroma is incredible. I dont smell honey but I imagine it would show itself in the taste as it warms. Still one of the very best smelling beers Ive ever encountered, I could smell this all day.
Taste: first off, great mouthfeel.. not as heavy as most DIPAs but not thin either, its the perfect mix. not exactly pillowy but it is soft on the palate. 
Citrus heavy on the taste as well, reminiscent of Julius but not as clean. Just a tick below. 645 characterskalosjakar, May 28, 2016

4.68/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75L - almost syrupy looking orange, very glossy and deep. different than the usual haze trillium provides but very nice looking.
N -  The nose is honeydew melon and wildflower. pungent and wonderful.
T - the grapefruit and citrus tartness up front is balanced so delicately and perfectly with the sweetness of the honey on the back end. a very unique DIPA in this regard, as usually the bitter kick is at the end. 
MF - soft, light, very nice. perfect for the taste profile, even light for a DIPA of its abv. 
O - I AM NOT A ONE TRICK PONY! says trillium. indeed. this is a fabulous beer. fabulous. one of my favorites I have had from these guys, without a doubt. 665 charactersbeantown_hopster, May 27, 2016

Smell is a bit dank and almost a cannabis like.  Am also getting citrus and sweetness.
Taste is a bit sweet and citrus like with piney Hops on the back end.
Mouthful is light to medium and clean.  Carbonation is medium to high.  Finish is a bit dry.
Overall a tasty IPA, not as juicy as I would prefer but very crushable.  Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a entry level NE (juicey) IPA. 467 charactersSlack, May 07, 2016

L: Hazy golden yellow color with an eggshell white head. It's not turbid, but hazy enough to make it quite attractive.
S: Very dank. Green onion, guava and pineapple with some underlying honey. The clovelike spiciness from the honey is great.
T: Just the same. Plenty of vegetal onion quality and guava. It's very clean. The spicy honey comes in on the finish. It is subtle, but it makes it interesting. 
F: Medium light, somewhat creamy and effervescent.
O: I really enjoyed it. It's different and it's not a juice bomb, but it's the best example I've had of a hoppy beer with honey. 748 characterscultclassic89, Mar 26, 2016

Pours a bright golden orange with a translucent hue and a pillowy half-inch, bright white head that gradually recedes towards the edges leaving a soapy slick across the surface.  Great juicy nose on this beer - apricots, mango, a kiss of honey and a trace of something herbal/vegetal towards the back.  Taste consistent with nose; however, flavors are less prominent than suggested by the nose and there's also a crackery quality to the malt profile.  Mouthfeel is light-medium in body (but closer to light) albeit a bit thin, with a mild, even carbonation and a light acidity.  Overall, very drinkable but not sure it lives up to a 99. 698 charactersJwale73, Mar 19, 2016
4.18/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Consumed three weeks after bottling. Golden pour with light carbonation and a moderate head. Aroma of citrus, bready malt, light floral notes and alcohol. Taste of orange rind, pineapple, grapefruit, honey and tea. Great beer that I definitely enjoyed but less so than their usual DIPAs. Hard to see why people either love or loathe this beer - opinion seems to run the entire spectrum - when it's neither incredible nor average. My guess is that it's a great beer that's judged against expectations driven by scarcity and previous releases. Surprised by the 100 rating and also how it dipped from 100 to 99 after the last release. 631 charactersManapuaMan, Mar 19, 2016

I also called Trillium to discuss the situation at hand, and they didn't pick up, so I left a voicemail. Unlike Goose Island, they didn't return my call to talk about getting me a new bottle or refunding me for the terrible beer. I'm done with this brewery. This isn't the first time this has happened with their beer. 531 charactersWilliamIrwin, Mar 16, 2016

Look: Golden, a bit of haze.  It has a pure white foamy head that dissipates quickly.  A fair amount of lacing clings to the glass.
Smell: Somewhat floral, a noticeable sweetness, herbal, some citrus, lemony.
Taste: Floral, sweetness, some grassy notes.  Honey is slight, but noticeable, a bit of citrus, herbal and spice. 
Feel: Fairly light bodied, but still in the medium body range, moderate carbonation, easy drinking.
Overall: Great brew, I have had other batches, don't see the difference as others have recently mentioned.  I think this is one of their best brews, and I see why this draws the lines.  I did not get any onion or garlic notes in the aroma or taste. 707 charactersjhavs, Mar 15, 2016

This was my second bottle, as I wanted to have it sit for a couple weeks from bottle date.
Appearance is slightly cloudy, honey yellow. Soft white head that goes away rather quickly. Not many card bubbles running from bottom of glass. 
Smell for me is of some floraly honey sweetness, with a touch of fruitiness, not a whole lot. I get this kind of savoryness that may be what a lot of others are referring to as the onion/garlic, but it's not pronounced, but certainly there. The mosaics are present, but different in this offering. 
Taste mostly follows the nose, but the floraly honey is what I get first. Then some slight hoppyness which fades quick and is much more subtle that I like. 
Feel is actually pretty darn nice, extremely smooth, slightly creamy and no detection of the 8.5abv. 
Overall, I really really wanted this to be better, i waited in line for about 30 mins which, for this beer is about the longest I would wait. The batch seemed a bit rushed / adolescent, and i want nothing more for the next batch to be better. I would take congress st over this every day of the week ! 1,124 charactersSteve_Tkachuk, Mar 12, 2016

Doesn't have that Trillium flare, and is lacking the creamy mouthfeel of the New England IPAs I love. Much  more clear than most in the NE style. In any case, pretty delicious. I'd describe it as Enjoy By, but a bit more refined and with less sweetness. Happy to slurp this down, but will have to try again when they make a batch like the original. A bit disappointing, but overall an excellent beer. 488 charactersBMMillsy, Mar 10, 2016

4.59/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A pale yellow brew with a modest white head and just a touch of haziness. The aroma is incredible, the only thing I can compare it to is Pieces of 8 by Foley Brothers. It's one of the most complex aromas I've come across with dankness that's complemented by citrus and tropical notes. The taste is somewhat subdued, but is still juicy and introduces notes of white grapes, stone fruit, pineapple and just a hint of juniper or spruce. The feel is fantastic, despite being thin. So soft and well carbonated. I wish I could compare this to other Trillium beers, but I can't. That said, this is an amazing beer and I totally get the hype. I agree with some reviews that said it was thin, but that barely detracts from the excellence of this beer. I am super impressed. 764 charactersCayseyW, Mar 08, 2016

4.4/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Ok so my only conclusion was that this entire batch was off, smells like garlic and onions, looks thin, thin mouthfeel, no haze at all tastes like a watered down mosaic single ipa, not what I was expecting at all.  By far the worst of the 10 beers I've tried from trillium, I assume they will figure it out and the next batch will be great again, but this was a huge disappointment.  Updated 6/30, new batch much better, updated rating.  That last batch definitely was off, glad to taste the real thing. 503 characterstroupos40, Mar 06, 2016

While it certainly embodies the characteristics of a solid DIPA, I just assumed it would boast "more."  Where is the traditional haze one can expect to find in a NE beer?  Where is the creamy mouthfeel that I am accustomed to from these guys?  Great aromas and above average taste; definitely worth trying.  But I am perfectly content drinking the less hyped offerings from Trillium. 472 charactersDolphinsmarlins1, Mar 05, 2016

I was shocked to see the beer was not the MEGA-haze juice-bomb Trillium look that I've come to admire, but more of a light haze and golden yellow color.  The nose was what I expected, and the taste was floral, tropical fruit, some sweetness and a slight hop bitterness.  The beer is an absolute SNIPER, as I detected ZERO alcohol and polished off the bottle with the quickness of a session, only to be reminded that it's actually 8% ABV.  In summary, very nice beer, but I'll take the DDH stuff all day... 613 charactersTheBrewSherpa, Mar 04, 2016

However, I believe this is below par as far as Trillium beers go.  It lacks the signature Trillium haze.  Congress St., Vicinity, Fort Point and any DDH blow this out the water.   Hard to believe this is over 8%, you'd never be able to guess it was that high. 341 charactersMikeM417, Mar 03, 2016

L. Light orange golden in color. Light haze, not the usually trillium haze. Light 1 finger of head that retreats quickly with not much lacing. 
S. I am getting lots of green onion. I know a lot of people are saying to let it sit in the bottle for a week or 2, but since I got a growler this wasn't really an option. Getting some tropical, mango notes as well, but mostly it is masked by the onion smell. I have gotten this before in dipas but never this prevalent. 
T. The tropical flavors are a bit more noticeably on the palate, but still a good amount of onion. 
F. Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. 684 charactersDopen993, Feb 28, 2016
4.86/5  rDev +7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from the bottle into a mason jar.
L: Pours a honey yellow with a small white head. This does not have the appearance of a juice bomb like most other Trillium beers that I've had in the past.  Still, this looks quite appetizing. 
S: Massive mosaic notes come through in an invasive way. There's not much else by way of the nose. There may be a bit of that floral honey on the back end of the nose.
T: Once again, the huge mosaic flavors overtake my palate. There's a good amount of floral character from the wildflower honey, and the honey lends a smoothness to this beer that quite frankly scares me. I can easily polish off this bomber because it's so easy to drink.
F: This is easily one of the easiest drinking DIPAs that I've ever had. No alcohol to speak of. Also, the honey makes this beer so damn smooth that I've already almost drank one glass of this and I've opened it maybe 10 minutes ago.
Overall: This beer lives up to the hype for me. I wish I would have been able to go on Friday when Trillium was letting people buy a whole case of this. I might have to sit on my other bottle for a week or 2 to see if this evolves into something better. I highly doubt it though. Great beer from a great brewery and I wouldn't expect anything less. 1,261 charactersRichD, Feb 28, 2016

I don't get it.  It's not "haze for dayz" but a golden clear color.  Looks wise doesn't really matter to me.  Smell wise it is very nice but not close to the best of the best.  Taste ... maybe because it is so fresh from the bottling date but I can definitely get a garlic/onion taste in there.  I was expecting a super sweet beer from what everyone was talking about and I got a super smooth beer with almost no bitterness and a very small taste of honey.  Mouth feel was ok to me but not that creaminess that I long for.
Maybe this beer will get better with age (2-3 weeks) but as of right now I can't see what the hype is about. 684 charactersBEEPOP, Feb 28, 2016

Aroma of melon and tropical fruit typical of trillium but just way more intense than any of their other beers i have had.

Mouth feel on this is creamy and coats the mouth like no other hoppy beer I've ever had. Hazy as you would expect trillium beers to be, lots of citrus, orange, tangerine, mango, papaya, good malt backbone but not overpowering. This is just such a crisp juicy and floral IPA. 367 charactersHopislovehopislife, Jan 12, 2016

A big hop nose of peach and tangerine. A very original flavor including tangerine, nectarine, and mandarin orange. Thick and dank flavor, but with a smooth drinkability and mild bitter finish. The carbonation seems a bit low, and it seems flat as it warms, but it is so good it seems inconsequential. 395 characterstheIPAman, Dec 25, 2015

Pours bright yellow with nice foamy head. Great sweet and citrusy aromas are super bright. Taste really delivers with a big juicy and tropical flavors. Sweet honey taste without overpowering. Fresh mosaic hop flavor is present and works beautifully with the other flavors. Smooth finish, no bitterness at all. 
Amazingly, amongst some of the best DIPA I could get my hands on, Artaic was by far the best. I really haven't had anything like it, and I believe this batch is better than the first batch. I think it's the best IPA I have ever had 660 charactersDeshaies, Dec 11, 2015

L - creamy, golden honey with a nice head and lacing.  Beautiful beer.
S - bready, melons, some varying sweet juice scents, and potent honey.  A very unique scent but unique is common on all these rating categories.
T - sweet sweet honey!  In no way would I compare this to hopslam even though they have very similar characteristics.  This has so much more flavor depth and complexity.  The honey is on the front, middle, and back ends balancing with a variety of flavors through.  Flavors go from grassy, white wine, melon to more melon, a little mango and papaya, and a super malty backbone.
F - creamy, juicy, and malty.  A very unique combo in a great DIPA, but Trillium knows what they're doing, so it should not be surprising.  Very easy to drink.  It continues to shock me seeing this is an 8.5% beer.  It went down as easy as water.
Overall - this was a great showcase of a unique type of double ipa.  The combination of earthiness, honey, and maltiness would typically not sound appealing.  Trillium knocked this one out of the park.  So unique it's hard to compare it to any beer, but the more I rate it, the more I want more.  I will seek this one out again! 1,234 charactersrabbott2, Dec 04, 2015

A:	
Pours a hazy gold honey color with a big, pristine white, light and fluffy head that settles to a fat little cap.  Very good retention; varied splotches of lacing.  (4.25)	
S:	
Tropical fruit juice cocktail and sweet bread blended. Mango, some sugary melon sweetness, papaya, pith, weed.  (4.25)	
T:	
Sweet, fruity deliciousness.  Mangos, papaya, sweet dough, melon, honey aromatics, a little candied mandarin, a hint of herbal green hops at the end, but no resin, no pine, no bitter in the finish. (4.5)	
M:	
Smooth, light-medium bodied, incredibly drinkable, light soft carbonation, smooth finish.  (4.5)	
O:	
Excellent double IPA that is entirely too drinkable.  
Sweet and soft, not too citrusy, not too piney.  Probably the hoppiest beer I have ever had that didn't have some pine sap or some grapefruit peel hidden in there somewhere (it's there in the back  I think, but ripe tropical fruits are the main push it would seem).  A joy to drink.  Looks lovely with a fluffy virgin white meringue.  The smell and taste both are juice-like.  The flavor though takes it up a notch and is just a juicy mango/pot/honeydew/peach puree.  It is (and I hate the term) “crushable” without a doubt.  No alcohol, soft and quenching.  The most amazing thing about this beer to me and the reason I am bumping its overall score up a touch is that it is a single hop.  Not only that, but it is a single hop that I have tried quite a few times in single hop beers and it has never been anything close to this.  Wow.  Thanks KC!  
An excellent tropical IIPA if there ever was. (4.75) 1,641 charactersTheDoctor, Nov 20, 2015

S: Candy peach rings, mango, pineapple, honey malt and nectarine. Smells absolutely fantastic.
T: A good amount of citrus, with some tangerine and grapefruit hard candies coming through, mild resin, then a finish of honey, nectarine and a touch of pine. Slick and full but not heavy mouthfeel. 437 charactersnotchucknorris, Nov 09, 2015

4.47/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750mL bottle into a Treehouse tulip glass. Thank you Steve for picking this up, you da man.
Pours a slightly hazy golden body with a big  3 finger frothy white head that reduces slowly to leave chunky foam behind that sticks to the glass.
Aromas are very citrusy and tropical on the nose, dank and potent raw hops, some sweet malt, slightly piney, peach and grapefruit. 
Taste is very similar to the nose , the mosaic hops are distinct in both aroma and taste, imparting citrusy, grapefruity, resinous and raw hop notes with a light bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is OK, I actually prefer a more creamy, full bodied feel for a beer of this ABV and flavor profile. Medium carbonation.
Overall very well done as usual for Trillium, the Mosaic hop profile is very nice and unique to the other Trillium IPAs. 827 charactersgcamparone, Nov 03, 2015

Hands down, undisputed favorite beer of all time across all styles. Best beer I've ever had, so cool that my home state is putting out liquid gold like this. Awesome.

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a slightly hazy pale yellow orange color with good clarity and vision of bubbles coming up through the glass. 
Smell:  Tropical juice bomb, melon, canteloupe, resiny pine, citrus, biscuity, toasted, and caramel malts. 
Taste:  Hop juice bomb heaven.  Love it.  Nice malt backbone, light bitterness, and light chewy notes.  Very tasty and one of their best brews.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, tasty, crushable, light to medium bodied, a little chewy, and light bitterness.

4.49/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a cloudy applejuice color, with a huge, froth white head.
Smells incredible hoppy, while featuring a pleasant sweetness as well, resulting from the wild flower honey, accentuating bready malts, as well as the hops ripe fruit quality. Water melon blends into papaya and peach, together with a pleasant resinous note, tied together by luscious sweet honey. While being pretty intense as for the hop onslaught going on in this, the beer reveals a great complexity.
Drinks very soft, providing a pleasant mouthfeel with a medium carbonation. This leaves enough space on the palate for an aqueous quality, and prevents the honey from getting distracted by a too bubbly carbonation. 
Tastes of white bread with an aqueous softness to it. Wild flower honey and hops then become visible at the same time, challenging the palate in the most pleasant way, by revealing a great flavor depth adding to the initial foundation. The hops feature prickly kiwi, wet grass with just a leafy, skunky hint to it, juicy orange, which then gets amped up by pleasantly sweet honey and sappy lime peel at the same time. This creates a great flavor intensity, while remaining pleasantly drinkable, with an unusual, well fitting sweet peek to it, helping bready malts to balance the hops. Finishes with a slick honey warmth, completed by an intense lime bitterness, and an outstanding resin quality, with all flavors coming perfectly together. 
Fantastic double IPA with a great hop profile blending flawlessly into the honey, which illustrates the hops even more than it does the malts, which is particular unusual, as sweet and malty goes closer together than sweet and bitter. In this particular case though, the hops are that profound, that they exhibit not only grass and lime, but also sweeter flavors like orange and papaya, benefitting big times from the honey. The beers pleasant mouthfeel  perfects its appearance on the palate, by not only tasting great but also feeling great, without hiding its flavor intensity at all. 2,016 charactersaleigator, Oct 17, 2015

4.56/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally getting around to reviewing this beer after enjoying back on 6/6/15 thanks to the help of BA Shaggy9356. Luckily I have some notes to put some details to why I loved this beer so much--maybe my favorite from Trillium. Anyhoo, I enjoyed it out of a dark brown 750 ml bottle with a bottling date of 5/19, so about two and a half weeks old. Poured into a Speigelau IPA glass.
Appearance (4.5) - Pours a glowing golden amber color with a fair amount of cloudiness to the body, which allows the light to bounce off of it and create that radiant hue. I'm enamored with the way the curvature of the upper part of the glass is accented by the shading, going from a bright maize to a darker apricot in the shadows. At the very bottom, there are bright spun gold highlights where the light passes through with the least impediment. Atop the body sits a three finger tower of dense, creamy off-white head. The bubbles are tight and concentrated near the body but become a little more frothy and open near the top, making me wish I was about an inch tall so I could dive into the pillowy foam. Retention is excellent and the bulk of the head remains for some time before receding to about a finger of residual foam with swaths of sticky lace adorning the sides of the glass.
Smell (4.75) - I have my notes, but I'm having a hard time finding a good way to describe just how striking the aroma of this beer was to me. It was one of those situations where you stick your nose down in the glass initially to see what you're working with, but the desire to objectively note and catalog what you are smelling is overtaken by that desire to indulge in the primal enjoyment of the smell. Obviously, there is a bunch of tropical and stone fruit, as befitting a Trillium hoppy beer, but there is a fantastic herbal element of clover and yes, even hints of cannabis providing a wonderful counterpoint to the fruitier notes.  In many ways, it reminds me of the flagship beer of another Massachusetts brewer, but with more emphasis on the herbal side than the fruity side. I'm not entirely sure if I'm getting honey on the aroma or if those notes of clover are what I'm picking up.
Taste (4.5) - As to be expected, the taste follows the nose to some degree. Big notes of tropical fruit and herbal character, only now with a subtle sweetness that I can only assume is the honey. I'm pretty sure that honey will ferment 100% out of the brew, but every beer with honey I've ever had definitely imparts a natural sweetness that it's hard not to believe is the residual flavor profile from that fermented honey. I don't know what cannabis tastes like, but the pungency of that element in the smell seems to invate my tastebuds a bit. But really, all the other elements serve to commplement the excellent presence of nectarine and mango and guava. The stinky "in a good way" element only serves to round out the overall profile.
Mouthfeel (4.5) - Body is light, but not airy or watery--it still has enough heft to make for a fulfilling beer. Carbonation is moderate. And surprisingly, the overall feel is not as juicy as I might have expected given the presence of the fruit characteristics. There is a nice dryness witha  slight bitterness to the finish that pairs wonderfully with the sweeter profiles from the taste.
Overall (4.5), this is probably my favorite beer from Trillium, and that's not for lack of trying the others. This is the one that I finished thinking that I really wanted another bottle or three to drink right at that moment. At the very least, this is the one out of all of them that stood out the most in my mind. I'm not sure if that's from the honey, the extensive use of Mosaic hops, or a combination of the two. Either way, I really enjoyed this beer. 3,761 charactersLambicPentameter, Sep 30, 2015

Could be from being not being drank within 2 weeks of bottling or that its being a little higher in abv. I would love more still though! 394 charactersimyourhero21, Sep 26, 2015

Looks a dark translucent gold. Minimal white head. Aroma of honey, pineapple, and lavender. Plenty of sweetness upfront with hints of honey, vanilla, and tropical fruit, met with some tame earthy spiciness on the back end,  which adds a bit of complexity. Overall, this is a great single hop DIPA. Besides adding fermentable sugar, the honey does a nice job of balancing the sometimes volatile mosaic hop. 436 charactersSheppard, Sep 24, 2015

Slightly cloudy golden yellow with a small white head. Smell is dominated by candied peach, with a hint of lemon. Taste is sweet, peaches and tangerine, with a very light bitterness. Nice and light feel in the mouth, but a nice a lingering oilyness. Overall this is a well crafted, incredibly balanced beer. 373 charactersOneEye78, Sep 13, 2015

S: Amazing, smells like some delicious sweet honey at first, but then a great hop smell quickly fills your nose and you can pick up on some citrus/fruits.
T: Amazing, follows the nose almost exactly. The honey gives this beer a unique taste for an ipa. It has all  the delicious hop goodness with lots of citrus and slight pine flavor but the bitterness is balanced out by the sweetness of the honey. So once again, amazing. You get all the hops and instead of a caramely malt taste to balance you get the great sweetness of honey.
M: Where Trillium has always shined. I dont know how they do it but you get such a perfect almost creamy feeling from their beers, and the delicoius flavor lingers on your tongue just the perfect amount.
O: Amazing beer, the honey gives it a unique sweeter taste for an ipa. I wish it was easier to get a hold of. But Trillium, you are king. 1,085 charactersGinjaSlice, Sep 12, 2015

Pours a hazy orange in color with a finger and a half of almost frothy white head that fades to a thin coating and leaves sporadic lacing. Wonderful aroma and taste; honey, citrus and peach. Solidly bitter; the hop character here is solid and prominent but not overwhelming. Good mouthfeel, medium body and carbonation. Alcohol is wonderfully masked, very drinkable. 414 charactersmnj21655, Sep 10, 2015

4.63/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750ml into tulip glasses:
Appearance: Pours a bright, golden body with a touch of haze. Not quite translucent, but not totally turbid like some of Trillium's other pales and IPAs. Carries a thick, frothy white head that lasts forever. Tons of sticky lacing with each sip, especially if you let the beer sit for a minute between sips.
Aroma: lots of freshness. The dominant aroma, as it should be in any double IPA, is hops. Specifically, I get a lot of mango and stone fruit, with none of the soapy flavor that mosaic sometimes offers in my opinion. There is also a very subtle earthy, herbal scent in play here.....maybe it's the honey reacting with the Mosaic, but it smells grassy or flowery.
Taste: as expected from the scent, there is lots of fruit here to dominate the palate, with tropics like mango and guava being the most forward flavors. There is also a nice backdrop of sweetness, though not overbearing at all. I'd assume this is not from the malt, but from the honey. In any case, the beer doesn't feel overly sweet...a beautiful, subtle touch in an awesome double IPA.
Feel: moderate carbonation, with a somewhat soft mouthfeel. Finishes relatively dry to what I anticipated. 
Overall: a magnificent DIPA, which from Trillium is the norm. Seek it out and bury yourself in a bed of subtle hop flavor. 1,333 charactersTheElectricOne, Sep 05, 2015
4.64/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours hazy orange with fair carbonation and a two finger head.  Smell is sweet like honey and syrup, with citrus rind and floral hops.  Taste is hoppy mosaic with a light refreshing honey flavor that coats the mouth.  Real crisp bitterness here, but balanced enough to finish so light and flavorful.  This beer is incredible.  This bottle is from the second release and the staff stated it "may be the best beer they've ever made."  Hard to confirm that since every beer Trillium makes is fantastic, but this is pretty damn impressive and certainly elite. 555 charactersanteatr23, Sep 04, 2015

But I do have my criticisms, moving here from across the country 10 months ago -- so I do judge objectively.  Honestly, if it wasn't for the honey, this would taste absolutely terrible.  The honey is all the flavor.   Bitterness is too much for the malt.  Not up to Trillium standards.  Though I'm sure they'll brew it many more times, since the downtowners don't get anything better and buy it out immediately.  
This is why I travel 75 min to Tree House every week. 560 charactersakrz47, Jul 04, 2015

Smell:  Trillium nails it with the smell.  Sweet grapefruit, hops, and mango.  The perfect smell for a double IPA.  Impressive.
Taste:  Impressive.  Sweeter than the double dry hopped Congress Street.  This double is on the cutting edge.  The perfect balance of sweet grapefruit, hops, and mango.  Nice fade out in the finish. 
Feel:  Substantial.  Lower level of carbonation.  A little sticky in the finish...maybe.
Overall - I am drinking this right after the double dry hopped Congress Street.  I believe this tastes better, by a notch, but the double dry hopped Congress has a better look.  This is an awesome beer. 727 charactersmabermud, Jun 24, 2015

Pours a hazy medium yellow body, one finger white head, nice retention, a fair bit of lacing. The archetypical New England IPA appearance. Smells of sweet honey more so than malt, a ton of resin, citrus and passion fruit. The hops pop on this beer, barely restrained by the sweet malt and honey. Flavour is just as good; nice Mosaic hop presence with passion fruit and citrus; very nice balance of sweet and bitter here, and plenty of hoppy resins in this. Mouthfeel is great; medium bodied, soft, slightly undercarbonated but perfect for the style; not particularly bitter. Overall, excellent New England IIPA that is an upper echelon beer. 683 charactersStevedore, Jun 21, 2015

Pours a clear dark golden, not too murky like a lot of their other IPAs
Smell is pungent citrus, resin, green onion 
Great mouthfeel, the honey really lends a nice sweetness and balances it out beautifully.  
You get all the big flavors that I desire in a DIPA - citrus rind, more citrus almost like a sorbet and then some of that onion grass finish from the Mosaic.

Aroma is tropical fruit, typical trillium smell.
Taste is more tropical fruit and hints of honey with some bitterness in the finish. The sweetness and surprisingly mild bitterness make this one very easy to drink. 
Biscuitty mouthfeel.
Overall this is a great DIPA definitely seeking out. 341 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Jun 10, 2015

A word I can't help but use is "rich." It's almost too intense. Floral, fruity, piney. Hop oils are out of control. You get some floral wildflower honey, too. So damn smooth, creamy, hoppy. Never cloying or overly bitter. Perfect balanced and way too drinkable. Not sure what else to say. I would rather keep drinking it. Just bummed that it's a 750ml and not 2L or more. Wow. Yes, it's this good and if there is hype in the future, it's worth it. This is everything that every Double IPA should be. Cheers, Trillium! And massive thanks go to judkinst for snagging a bottle for me! 690 charactersGatch, Jun 06, 2015

Appearance - Hazy bright orange.  Medium white head and a chunky collar.
Smell - Smells a lot like Nelson hops to me.  Pungent grapefruit, orange, and almost an herbal  aroma to go with the tropical fruits.
Taste - Strong hops.  Again, tastes likes Nelson. Orange and tropical fruits.  Very sweet. Honey comes through in the end.
Mouthfeel - Soft carbonation.  Medium heavy.  
Overall - Excellent hop flavor, although the sweetness started to become a bit much. 503 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 02, 2015

Served in a snifter
Fantastic appearance. The beer poured a cloudy, tawny golden yellow and was topped by a one-finger tall, frothy, bubbly, bright white crown that faded to a lasting ring of bubbles. Large blocks of patchy, drippy lacing trickled down the glass.
The aroma was simply mesmerizing. Super hoppy and intense. Ultra fruity and juicy. Tropical fruits dominated. Passionfruit immediately smacked me in the face. Loads of papaya and guava. Orange notes also came through strong. Some mango was noticeable as well. There was a pungent, dank quality too. Almost a touch musty. Fresh weed definitely came to mind.
The flavor profile was super juicy and fruity. Citrusy and bright. Loads of tangerine, clementine and orange juice. Exotic tropical fruit notes came through strong. Guava, papaya and passionfruit were quite noticeable. Loads of peach and apricot as well. This was definitely one of the most peach-forward beers I have ever come across.  Touch of sweetness, perhaps from the honey.  Candied orange peel appeared in the semi-sweet, lingering finish. Hint of bitterness. As the beer warmed, the clementine notes really came forth.
The mouthfeel was medium-light for the style. A touch thinner than anticipated. Soft, supple, frothy and smooth on the palate. The liquid contained a crisp, lively, sprightly effervescence.
I am a huge fan of Trillium's cloudy, dank, tropical fruit-forward hoppy beers, and Artaic just might be their best work yet. The addition of honey, although subtle, added just the right amount of sweetness to make this beer dangerously crushable. Double IPAs rarely get any better than this. 1,733 charactersDamian, May 26, 2015

4.58/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bottle. Great artwork as always. Pours the signature Trillium hazy, murky but bright yellow orange. Lots of frothy, sticky lacing. Pungent, damp Mosaic hoppiness. The epitome of Mosaic hops. Grass, onion, plump citrus cornucopia, moss, guava, melon, papaya. Stemmy honeysuckle. Pastry malt sweetness. Flavor is very reminiscent of many other Trillium hop-bombs. It's like sucking on a mouthful of hop pellets. Dank and tropical Mosaic. Lots of sugary sweetness in both malt and honey. Doesn't blind you with bitterness. Honey seems to add a very full mouthfeel; or maybe it's the extra supporting malt. Finishes with a flavor of Mosaic hop extract. If you like the hop varietal you will fall in love with Artaic. It's another very Trillium-esque hop potion. They have a very distinct style of hoppy beer. Will continue to support these guys over in Fort Point. 860 charactersVelvetExtract, May 23, 2015

In fact it's a cloudy, golden honey like color in appearance. Thick, white foamy head that seems to dissipate slowly. Pine like hops combined with a smooth, honey finish. The hops seem to burst mid sip as well. Honey O' Hops…this is another winner!! Beautiful crisp, smooth mouthfeel, hops are prickly to the tongue. Medium amount of carbonation. The honey really gives it a nice balance. 501 charactersMA_hops, May 21, 2015
