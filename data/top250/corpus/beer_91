Smells of a pleasant tropical crispness, defined by orange pulp, tangerine and lemon zest, topped off by a chunk of juicy blood orange and  pineapple. Cakey malts, white bread crust and wet grass, together with a note of blueberry bush build up the subtle malt balance in this, creating a nose which comes very well together.
Drinks silk, incredibly soft with a nice, juice accompanied hop bite, which gets wrapped up by toffee malts with a prevailing, long lasting dryness on the tongue. Drinks very gentle with no indication of the higher abv apart from the noteable malt backbone during the finish.
Tastes of a nice lemon crispness, which gets a fruity quality due to fresh peeled oranges and wet grass with an immediate dry bite. The hop bite gets tamed by the fluffy, soft mouthfeel and bready malts, which turn cakey sweet during the mid palate. Develops a prickly kiwi sourness during the finish, soothed by blood orange and juicy, dry lemon with an ongoing, supportive malt foundation.
Not overly complex but well brewed with an awesomly soft mouthfeel and a pungent, well nuanced hop punch. 1,166 charactersaleigator, Nov 03, 2016

Orange-yellow and murky tone underneath a moderate white head.
Big aroma of pineapple, citrus, and spice and a white bread malt note.

Pineapple and grapefruit juice bomb mixed with some nice earthiness.  An incredibly enjoyable and balanced DIPA and one I will seek out again.  Not super familiar with the New Zealand hops, but I will seek out if they always make this great of an IPA.  Slightly malty to allow for a nice creamy beer but also very juicy and refreshing.

4.84/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a growler into a nonic pint glass.
Pours a cloudy golden orange color with a 2-finger fluffy white head. Nice retention and clingy lacing. 
The aroma is very tropical. I get a lot of papaya and mango, with just a slight hint of grapefruit and pine resin. Subtly floral. Beautiful aroma. 
The taste follows the nose, but brings a lot more citrusy grapefruit and tangerine flavors. There's a touch of lemon on the back end that gives this beer a very subtle tart character. The biscuity, slightly grainy malt is extremely subtle but present. Overall great balance on the flavor. 
The mouthfeel is just ridiculous. Perfect body with a perfect amount of carbonation. So creamy and so smooth. Lightly dry with a subtly bitter finish. Like drinking a perfectly fluffed pillow. 
Overall, an absolutely fantastic DIPA, and one of my favorite beers from Hill Farmstead. The flavors are extremely bright and well balanced, and the mouthfeel is absurdly good. Drinks like a smooth pale ale with all the flavors and boldness of a double IPA. 1,046 charactersScaryEd, Apr 07, 2016

5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is probably my favorite beer that I have had from Hill Farmstead. Nice and 2 finger head, with a gradient turbidity from yellow to orange. S&S#5 smells of strong citrus and tropic fruits. However, the taste is rather mild with some balanced acidic bitterness with balanced sweetness and full smooth mouthfeel. The bitterness remains in the middle notes but completely drops off at the end for a clean finish.The overall notion of this imperial IPA is utter drinkability as its stability between bitter and sweet is completely in tact. 539 charactersTrevor11, Apr 06, 2016

Taste just keeps the fruit flavors coming without any degree of grating bitterness.  Peach and soft pink grapefruit along with tropical vibe.  Super dry, conceals alcohol well, hops shine.  This is just super elite 1st tier double ipa stuff.

Their house yeast makes their beers so special, and it comes out strong here. You get some nice bitterness from the hops, along with tropical fruits, kiwi, some grapefruit.  Mouthfeel is great too, slight tartness on the finish. 330 charactersJordonHoltzman, Nov 04, 2015

I'm settling in to drink it all by myself so if I don't post again, send someone over to check on me.  Poured into a 12oz tulip, a gloriously murky pear colored brew with a big sloppy head that fades down to leave great gobs of lacing on the glass. The smell is of a load of tropical fruits spread out on a slab of white bread. Sharp and clean. Taste: 'Think grapefruit' nails it. Beautifully bitter from first impact right through to the lingering aftertaste. Dank, with citrus notes dominating, vanilla bread-iness and mineral astringency. Feel: Medium body, clean and smooth, slight fizzy carbonation ideally complements the sharpness. O: Not a super-complicated brew but who needs complicated? And who could be happier than me? I could have gotten a 750 but I got the 2L instead - absolutely-freaking-outstandingly-good beer coupled with good decision making on my part. 902 characterspapposilenus, Oct 31, 2015

I walk in and just ask for HF without even looking at what it was because I haven't had anything that wasn't excellent from HF. I hear some moaning going on at the other end of the bar and I find out I got the last pour.  The keg kicked.  First thing I think is damn - this is a great brew but I'm only gonna get one. But then the manager says " no worries - we always have another ready to go " well now were talking.  They wipe the board and write in " Society & Solitude #5.  I had #4 while in VT so I was pumped and it didn't let me down in the least.  Another home run from HF. Wonderful flavor that was deep and went on forever.  Great mouth feel. Light for a DIPA and very fruity.  Just wonderful.  I wish more spots would get brews from HF as the one is 40 minutes from me but hell - its worth the ride. 922 charactersnjcraftguy, Oct 25, 2015

Best consumed by OCT 17 2015
Served in a snifter
Beautiful appearance. The completely opaque, yellow ochre liquid was topped by a tight, creamy, frothy, inch-plus tall crop of bright white foam. A wall of soapy lacing clung to the glass. The head slowly dropped to a lasting film that was surrounded by a thick, clingy, bubbly ring.
The nose was pure Southern Hemisphere hoppy goodness. Super fruity and bright. Loads of tropical fruits. Musty passionfruit was quite apparent. Good amount of papaya too. Juicy orange and white grapefruit notes came through strong. Lots of lemony tartness as well. There was a crisp, dry yeasty quality. A touch of mango was also noticeable. As the beer sat, the grapefruit notes intensified and eventually took over.
The flavor was nearly identical to the nose. Uber hoppy. Nelson and Galaxy hop notes dominated. Super fruity. Loads of freshly squeezed tangerine and clementine juice. Good amount of lemony tartness. Hint of dry, rind-like pith. The lingering finish contained strong notes of white grapefruit and a hint of bitter lemon and grapefruit peel. Overall, super intense yet still balanced and drinkable.
The mouthfeel was flawless. Light and fluffy on the palate. Super frothy and highly effervescent. Creamy and slick. Almost cloud-like.
Society & Solitude #5 is an amazing celebration of New Zealand hops. Although this beer is supposedly brewed with American hops as well, the hop bill seemed to be pure kiwi. This is another incredibly flavorful and refreshing offering from Hill Farmstead that nicely straddles the boundary between IPA and double IPA. 1,706 charactersDamian, Oct 13, 2015

S: Citrus and malt dominate the nose. The aroma doesn't tip off the juicy nature of this beer. That said, it's still has a distinctly Hill Farmstead aroma that is super inviting.
T: I wouldn't call the flavor complex, but it's hugely delicious. Grapefruit and tangerines mostly come through in the flavor profile.
F: Beautifully balanced beer, it does lack the soft mouthfeel most HF beers have. The body is full, but delicate. 
O: Fantastic DIPA. Not a whole lot you need to say about this or most HF beers. 670 charactersCayseyW, Aug 30, 2015

Happily there are those that do.
This is a superlative beer. The color, aroma, taste, texture & enjoyment are all top notch. Rather than dissecting the overall effect/impression, I'l just say this is a very well balanced experience & a quality bevvie. 396 charactersseedyone, Aug 27, 2015

A:  A meduim somewhat hazy orange color with full on glass lacing that sticks forever.
S:  Loads of tropical fruits, some citrus and some fruity sweetness.
T:  I get a huge rush of tropical fruit and stone fruit.  Mango, peach, pineapple and grapefruit all really stand out.  A little floral and gassyness is there.  The fruity flavors turn somewhat sweet with some biscuit malt but the tropical hops pound down to the end with a bone dry finish.  Wow, what a beer.
M:  Full, coating, prickly but not alcoholic for the ABV.  Believe it or not, these drink super easy.
O:  What a fantastic DIPA from the Hill.  So glad I tried it, I might have to go back and get more.  Fantastic brew!  I'm getting a chance to try some of their rarer beers here in the Philly area and not one has disappointed. 866 charactersKadonny, Aug 25, 2015

4.1/5  rDev -8.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Another 750 ml growler into a tulip.  Should be special.
A - The same hazy, pale, straw yellow as all the HF IPAs.  A large, pillowy, bright white head sits atop the beer, and it is going nowhere.
N - Not a ton going on with the nose, actually.  A slight hop aroma with a bit of spiciness.  Lemon zest?
T - I'm not a big fan of New Zealand hops, but this is the best example I've had.  The hop presence dominates with lots of pine and fruit.  Not citrus; other tropical fruit, like peaches, pineapples, and maybe some mangoes.
M - Frothy and coating like all the HF IPAs.  Say what you want about how they look and taste, but the mouthfeel demonstrates how well-crafted these beers are.
O - Great stuff.  Not my favorite; that distinction still belongs to the Double Citra, but another winner. 798 charactersCraftFan5, Aug 25, 2015

3.88/5  rDev -13.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Pours a partially hazy orange that borders on burnt but isn't all too dark. Nose is composed of mostly light malts with little citrus to back it up. Taste is again centered around the malt profile which is bordering on pale ale and saison without the yeast character. Again not as big as a hop presence as I was expecting particularly with some new zealand varietals that often weigh down the dank. Blindfolded I would've never guessed DIPA, this thing is dangerously crushable and the alcohol is catching up to me pretty quick. Decent, not a great representation of the style nor the hype that surrounds what these guys are capable of producing. 646 charactersVetsPackage, Aug 24, 2015

Taste: lingering sweetness with a touch of alcohol, and lightly bitter for an IPA, Nelson hop taste, and orange
Feel: a little thin for an imperial IPA

A - Pours a signature Hill Farmstead cloudy, light medium orange color with a creamy thick white lacing ring.

M - Thick medium body, velvety carbonated creaminess mouthfeel, lingering citrus pine finish.

The flavors are an amazingly balanced blend of lemon, candi sugar, cut grass, pine tassels, and a bready backbone. Highlights of tangerine, basil, and hints of pepper.

4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured on tap at Three Penny Tap Room into a tulip glass.
Deep lemon yellow, with pale pineapple like glowing color and solidly opaque.  Excellent creamy topped head, vanilla bright white, thick looking and soupy with big retention.  Excellent looking.
Aroma though is quite closed.  Really hard to pick up anything even a malt bill or sweetness is not coming through at all.A faint dry pine barely, only after some sips does grapefruit become apparent.
Palate just gets explosive. Lightly juiced grapefruit aromas and flavors come together melding with a tropical rush.  Excellent mouthfeel  soft and full, with this wonderful sense of powdered vanilla sweetness on the finish.  Huge amounts of zesty oils of citrus, and once again more geared towards grapefruit.  Chewy and dense.
The way a grapefruit IPA should be, however it appears there is no grapefruit added to this which makes it more impressive.  Sort of reminds me of the grapefruit version of sculpin but more hop and bitter and less fruit forward.  Excellent beer. 1,032 characterssmakawhat, Aug 08, 2015

This one has New Zealand hops; love those, too. Poured a cloudy orange color. Aroma is a blast of fruity hops. A damn blast. Tangerine and grapefruit and other puréed fruits. Hops just flexing about with no regard for human souls. Doesn't necessarily remind me of New Zealand hops but I don't mind, it smells delectable. Flavor is very proud and strong. Pure hop immulsion. Hops are of orange, tangerine, lemon, pineapple and guava. So strong but still so smooth. Bitter but not an enamel stripper. I always love heading to VT in the Summer and gorging myself on their delicious liquid gifts. I had Society & Solitude 4 several years prior to this but I remember loving it and I feel the same about this one as well. 799 charactersVelvetExtract, Jul 19, 2015

4.29/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25It has that east coast look to it. Very cloudy, pale orange color with a bright white puffy head. The cap is not as big on mine as some of the other descriptions I have read, and disappears very quickly. I did open it a day past their best by date though. 
Aromas are somewhat sour orange. Juicy and piney hops that have just a hint of medicinal/green to them. Kind of musty. 
Taste like a combination of multiple fruits. Orange, pineapple, mango, grapefruit with orange being dominant. The sourness carries through from the aroma. It is grapefruit tart. The hops really seem subdued at first, but they keep creeping up on you toward the end with a piney finish and a bitterness that just keeps building. It is a lingering bitterness though. Very smooth. I dont notice any alcohol. Nicely balanced. 
I like the feel of it overall, but this is where I have my biggest complaint. I dont know if they use some sort of Belgian yeast, or variation of in all of their beers, but it is a bit crisp and sparkling to me. Actually more like brets. Not the biggest fan of that aspect, but if you take that away, it is a great texture. Full without being filling. Much like Heady and Sip of Sunshine. 
A fantastic ipa. The balance of flavors is world class. 1,250 charactersWesMantooth, Jun 28, 2015

Aroma of grapefruits, pineapples, mangoes, some pine and grass, really nice. Flavor is off the hook. Lots of bitterness here, but it gets your palate ready for the sweet pineapple and mango, along with lots of citrus fruits, and then a final kick of bitter dry pine. Finishes clean as can be (no surprise there for HF). Body is relatively light for a DIPA, but creamy with nice sweet malt backing. Goes down way too easy. This is fantastic. 552 charactersBMMillsy, Jun 10, 2015

My wife shared a small glass of it with me.    Like the other HF pale ales/IPAs I've been lucky enough to try, what sets this apart is the incredibly clean finish.   It's hoppy and juicy, but the finish is so amazingly clean.   It's a marvel how they are able to do that with their pales.    Bitterness and fruit from the hops come forward in the flavor.   An outstanding offering, one that is right up there with the best IPAs I've had. 544 characterstmbgnicu, Apr 24, 2015

Pours a cloudy orange hay color with a big white foamy head, good retention and lots of lacing.  The nose and taste both feature a beautiful boquest of hops, lots of floral and dry citrus rinds with a dry biting finish.  Not much residual malt sweetness.  Increadibly drinkable for the 8.1% ABV.  Delicous! 336 charactersmtomlins, Apr 13, 2015

Pours a beautiful, hazy bright golden body with a 3 finger white head that reduces fairly slowly, leaving blotchy lacing and some retention. Very nice.
Absolutely inviting on the nose.. tons of citrus, tropical fruit, mango and pineapple, hoppy and forward. 
On the tongue citrus dominates, orange, grapefruit, mango, pineapple, fresh tropical fruits. The finish is not bitter at all, just straight potent hops on the follow through and throughout, absolutely fantastic! Easy drinker, medium body and medium-low carbonation. 
Worth the hype. World class DIPA, plain and simple. 676 charactersgcamparone, Feb 18, 2015

Grapefruit and mango seem to lead the way. Taste is grapefruit up front that turns to bready malt mid-palette. The finish is a little resinous with a medium bitterness. Fairly light bodied for a DIPA. Soft mouthfeel, almost creamy.

Consumed 1/17/15
A: Lightly hazy, medium gold, with some tangerine and orange highlights - pours with a medium, bright white head, fades to a wispy cap, leaves a nice web of lacing
S: Very hoppy and very reminiscent of Society & Solitude #6 (reviewed earlier today), minus the Mosiac hop profile - dynamic citrus, with fresh oranges, grapefruit - citrus flesh and juice - nicely tropical, with some mango, pineapple, apricot, peach, and lime - very clean, classic Hill Farmstead pale ale malt base, pale grains, bread
T: Bright, fresh hops - ripe, fresh orange, grapefruit, ruby red grapefruit - juice and flesh - fresh apricot, mango, pineapple, lime, kiwi, and other fruits - so, so fruity, with floral citrus as well - sticky and resinous, with some bright pine, lightly spicy - moderate bitterness - pale malts and some bread at the base to round things out
M: Medium body, nice carbonation, finishes with lingering bitterness in the best way possible
O: Number 5. almost gets a 5
Hill Farmstead does some amazing things with hops. And this is one of the best DIPAs I have had from them. It's stupidly juicy and fruity. I hope to see this again. 1,215 charactersangrybabboon, Jan 18, 2015

A - Hazy lemon colored, stunning white cap constantly fed from a steady stream of 
carbonation.
S - Citrus central starts the event, ten the pines take over. The citrus is very forward.
T - What a delight, starts with that high level citrus, runs through the candy like lemon drop, finishes dry and deciduous. What a delight.
F - Beautifully constructed, the palate is gently coated, coaxed into believing this is some kind of elixir. The body is solid and present without being overbearing. The carbonation assists in the clean up. A dry clean finish begs for another pull/
O - Craft at its finest, a classic study of balance, and beauty.

4.6/5  rDev +2.2%750ml growler filled about 2 weeks ago.  Tulip glass.
A: Pours light straw color with two fingers of foamy but dense bright white head.  Opaque.  Very good retention and leaves behind an intricate lattice of lacing. (4.5)
S: Prominent white grapefruit, along with soft orange and tangerine, and a hint of melon and kiwi. (4.5)
T: Light citrus (grapefruit) and tropical and kiwi notes, along with a bit of sweet-tinged pale malt.  Very mild gripping bitterness on the finish leaves a wonderful impression.  Leans more towards a hoppy pale ale on the palate, as its light and the flavors are pretty restrained. (4.5)
M: Medium-light body and soft, medium-light carbonation. (4.75)
O: Tasty, subtle flavors make this exceedingly drinkable.  You could drink a bottle of this and not break a sweat.  I don’t think this will actually “wow” you, but it’s in perfect balance.  (4.75) 888 characterspmarlowe, Sep 11, 2014

There is batch variability with this beer: at its worst, it is still a very nice beer; at its best, certainly one of the most enjoyable beers from the Hill Farmstead lineup. 210 charactersrodmanfor3, Sep 02, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +5.6%From a bottle had at the brewery last week.
A: It's a DIPA, they almost all look the same: hazy yellow/light golden color with pure white head, lots of frothy volume, good lacing and retention.
S: Apparently this one has New Zealand hops, and all of the beers I had with hops from there had a lychee or gooseberry like aroma to them. This one follows the rule. There is a ton of lychee and sweet grapefruit coming out of this one with even a tiny bit of green grape. The malt is almost indistinguishable.
T: Right off the bat you get attacked by a strong bite of grapefruit rind kind of bitterness. Then, there is a strong wave of juicy sweet lychee, red grapefruit, gooseberry, green grapes and lime juice. Pale malts are there but wayy wayy back.
M: Super light and fluffy with minimal stickiness, perfect.
O: To me, this is better than Abner and puts it on the same level as Double Sunshine. Great great beer and a bit of an exotic twist on the style. Love it! 968 charactersflipper2gv, Sep 02, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.6%The beer comes in a hazy bright golden color.
The aroma jumps out of grapefruit, citrus peel, and lots of green grassiness.
The flavor follows with that tropical flavor in the front, grapefruit throughout, a hint of bready sweetness, and then onto a signature Galaxy grassiness and almost aspirin astringency. The beer is slightly dominated on the back end by bitterness.
Clearly still world class beer, but I prefer Abner and Societe and Solitude # 6. 455 charactersdar482, Aug 20, 2014

A) Pale cloudy amber-yellow with a two-finger head, significant retention, and plenty of lacing.
S) Very strong grapefruit up front from the hops. Some orange, lemon. Malts in background.
T) Grapefruit, orange, lemon, some tropical notes as well. A little bit of pepper on the finish. Dry malt in background.
M) Medium-body, medium-carbonation, dry finish. Unbelievable balance. This is fantastic.

Reeks of tropical fruits and pungent hops. Tastes like a funky hop/pineapple creamsicle. Mouthfeel is unbelievably dense and chewy despite it's extreme drinkability. Hops linger on the tongue for what seems like forever. Wow! This might be the best DIPA I've ever had. Highly recommended. 379 charactersbeerjunky413, Jul 29, 2014

4/5  rDev -11.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thank you Slatetank for sharing the spoils of your recent VT trip with me. Poured into a snifter, the brew appears a clouded pale yellow color with a firm white topping that persists. The brew plays the part well visually as expected.
The aroma contains notes of citrus with grass clippings, pine and herbal components. Some solvent alcohol and sulfur emerges with a swirl. This has a very fresh yet generic sort of hop bite that smells like pellet hops crushed up in my hands. 
The taste is bitey with grassy bitterness blending to pulp/zest/pith of orange. Some solvent alcohol pokes through the back end breaking things up. The taste of this is very familiar, though ive never had this offering before. 
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. A good brew thats fresh and enjoyable with a creeping amount of alcohol inclusion. I know, I know - cast your stones at me for not being a believer in the golden nectar that flows from the farmstead on the hill. From what ive had, their hoppy offerings just taste nearly indifferent from one another (in my opinion.) 1,092 charactersstakem, Jun 13, 2014

A-Hazy gold and yellow with a nice white foam.
S-More citrus than grapefruit, but the fruits were certainly were apparent.
T-Amazing taste, fruits are still present but the hops are wonderfully balanced.
M-Such a drinkable beer, the s&s are always some of my favorites and this was perhaps the most drinkable.
O-This was one of my favorites, glad I choose Blackback to post-up in during the beermageddon in waterbury so I could try this! 478 charactersTmyhre802, Jun 10, 2014

Pours a brilliant glowing golden orange, with a half inch head, and a good amount of sticky foamy lacing down the glass.
Smells like orange, grapefruit, a small amount of pine, and pineapple.
This one is so smooth I could die. Not bitter at all, just loads of fresh fruity hop flavor. Lots of citrus- grapefruit, orange, some lemon, a little bit of pineapple, and a tiny bit pine that doesn't add any bitterness.
Medium bodied, smooth, crisp mouthfeel, just an unbelievable mouthfeel, as is expected with Hill Farmstead IPAs. Goes down so easily. Medium pleasant carbonation.
Need I say more? Hill Farmstead strikes again. This was awesome! 693 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 30, 2014

4.34/5  rDev -3.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5This poured with a cloudy and dull yellow appearance but settled into a golden hue. The head had immense foam that was thick with great retention.
The nose is fruity with the scents of the beach. Cocoa butter, tropical fruit punch, grapefruit and even banana were easy to behold.
The taste is actually quite creamy with a a sweet caramel base. The flavor is complex after the initial sip with fresh cut grass, lemongrass, honey, lemons, clover, grapefruit and a piney herbal hop finish.
The feel is a bit astringent, slightly metallic but very light and easy with a decent amount of heft.
This is a beer where you can truly taste the art and craftsmanship of the the brewer. 678 charactersKYGunner, May 28, 2014
4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I had this from the 750ml growler courtesy of tenderbranson69, enjoyed chilled in a willybecker.
The color is golden lemon meringue with thick 2 fingers of rocky white head while a web of lace sticks to the glass with fine bead. The smell is great with lots of hops- tons of citrus and dank herbal aromas with some tropical fruit which brings to mind pineapple mostly. The feel is great -resinous texture of copious hop oils with light sweet malt and semi-dry finish with moderate carbonation -the alcohol is hardly detectable and bitterness only really increases in the end with low astringency throughout. 
 The flavor is wonderful with a bevy of fruit from the hops which seems tropical up front but the flavor verges on grapefruit and slight tangerine with more pineapple and herbal flavors continuing throughout the taste with only a slight sweetness of malt and gentle astringent tea-like taste with an almost spicy element toward the finish which is dry - tons of juicy and dank hop flavors which are fresh and vibrant. Overall one of the best Imperial IPA's based on freshness and pure hop intensity without being an assalt of hop bitterness, very fresh and intense with lots of Mary jane type similarities from the cousin in this. The smell and moutfeel with only a little grassy hints in the finish. 1,311 charactersSlatetank, May 27, 2014

Appearance: Pours a hazy light amber/yellow and leaves a finger of white, fluffy head that slowly fades.
Smell: Citrus hops, light pine, light peach. Very refreshing aroma.
Taste: Matches the aroma well: citrus, pine, hint of peach. Quite juicy which is really nice.
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium, slightly creamy body. Finishes really smooth.
Overall: Wonderful hop-forward IPA - the hops are really able to shine in this one. Really smooth for a DIPA. 573 charactersResuin, May 23, 2014

4.44/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750ml growler. Thanks Anthony. Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass on 5/20/2014.
A- Predictably (by now) hazy straw yellow body, effervescent two-finger white head with fantastic retention. Rings of lacing initially and as the beer goes down. Beautiful as always.
S- Pineapple, mango, passion fruit, some pine. A subtle but distinct Nelson-like spiciness. But this is a more fruit forward nose backed up by the smallest but sufficient pale malt toffee flavours.
F- Pineapple, passion fruit, citrus on the front end with a nice but subtle caramel malt backbone and a nice graininess hitting in the middle, finishing with a mildly bitter pine and citrus finish. Wonderfully complex, but it does remain a bit subtle.
M- Medium body that is incredibly soft and smooth as expected from HF pale ales. Not terribly bitter but a lot of pine and citrus character on the backend. Wonderfully drinkable without any hint of heat.
O- Very good DIPA, doesn't quite compare to S&S #4 or Abner/Ephraim for that matter, but this is most certainly still a true pleasure to drink. 1,073 charactersStevedore, May 21, 2014

A vigorous pour yields a glowing, hazy deep yellow liquid with a tight bone-white head, maybe two fingers high. Good retention and plentiful, sticky webs of lacing.
In the nose, massive displays of fresh tropical fruits. Copious pineapple, as well as ruby red grapefruit, mango, passionfruit, orange, and hints of pine resin and pale malt.
In the mouth, juicy grapefruit up front, with pineapple, mango, passionfruit, and lemon zest all playing supporting roles. Subtly sweet pale malt appears mid-palate, as well as something I can best describe as an almost Chardonnay grape-like vinous note. Finishes dry and slightly earthy.
Mouthfeel is excellent--creamy and lush, with good carbonation keeping the beer lively and easy-drinking. No hint of alcohol here at all.
On the whole, this was everything I had hoped it would be. A truly world-class beer from my neighbors in VT, and reason enough unto itself to make the 4-hour pilgrimage. I can't wait to try the rest of the beers I picked up from Shaun Hill & Co. 1,096 charactersLjudsignal, May 19, 2014

Nose is citrus! Orange, grapefruit and a little sweet grass. The malt peeks it's head out with a touch of sweetness on the nose. It drinks lovely. Not a hint of alcohol on the palate. Just beautiful citrus. sweet orange, sweet earth, a touch fo grapefruit and some grass. Finishes with a perfect bitter that does not reside too long and that reminds you to take one last notice of all that fruit. Malt is a bit of weight on the palate but has a sweetness that seems to come out of no where and so delicately. Drinks clear and fruity and finishes dry but with a bit of tartness to keep your mouth watering long into the finish.
Another fabulous beer from Hill Farmstead. 791 charactersutopiajane, Apr 21, 2014

Nose is juicy, tropical fruit and citrus, a hint resiny and oily in back. Light grain profile up front and some malt sweetness to balance. Taste has more bitterness than I thought it would, lighter body and softer carbonation. The grain is soft up front, hop driven. Citrus, pine fades to a more leafy herbal note, a strong grapefruit bitterness lingers with a fairly dry finish. 431 characterscpetrone84, Feb 11, 2014

Appearance: A pale and hazy orange/gold, with thick creamy head and thick creamy lacing.
Smell: Disappointingly weak. But what I do get is a lot of floral citrus and pine. Apricot comes through prominently too.
Taste: Lightly vinous, bitter, with creamy malts backing up piney hops. Believe it or not, I even got a prominent bubblegum flavor toward the end. Probably from all that yeast that made the beer so hazy. This was really delicious, and the vinous character made it somewhat distinct from the other IPAs I tried on my Vermont trip.
Mouthfeel: Thick and creamy, with a moderate level of carbonation. The beer seemed to stay forever.
Overall: I should have written this when my memory of the beer was clearer, but I do remember this being delicious, even with the weak nose. Glad I got an opportunity to try it. 914 charactersWTKeene, Feb 02, 2014

Pours a murky orange with a full, foamy and bubbly dirty white head that fizzles after a long fight but leaves a persistent, liana-like lacing. 
Unique aroma with orange rind, grapefruit, orange juice, sugar, malt, and beer bread.
Tastes of grapefruit juice, a squirt of orange and then some candy sweetness. Finishes off with a flowery, earthy undercurrent and lingering notes of spent grain. 
Medium and fairly dry. One of the most perfectly balanced DIPA's (or any big beer for that matter) I've tasted. Alcohol heat is nonexistent.
This is a precise and focused DIPA that makes you think you accidentally grabbed the fruit juice out of the fridge, until you start to feel a very fine buzz. And I'm starting to feel a lot less crazy standing in line for over two hours after driving half the day through rain and snow and sleet to get some of this magic. 884 charactersstephens101, Jan 19, 2014

Girlfriend and I walked into a small restaurant/wine bar named Sotto before our dinner at Trattoria Delia for a few before dinner drinks. Low and behold I see a single beer on tap and it's from Hill Farmstead. The bartender told me it was a DIPA and that I HAD to try it. My girlfriend took one sip and fell in love. We had 2 more glasses each.
A- A nice hazy yellow/orange color with minimal head.
S- Wow, did I just cut into a fresh grapefruit? One of the best smelling beers I've come across.
T- Absolutely amazing! Tons of tropical fruit notes, fresh grapefruit, citrus, truly a one of a kind taste.
M- Decent carbonation, not too bitter, definitely a beer you could enjoy multiples of.
O- Was pretty ecstatic to find this on tap in VT. This was one of the best beers I've ever had. 809 charactersTRFD803, Jan 14, 2014

A - A very light colored DIPA. Very bright with a bubbly white head.
S - Tons of citrus notes. Probably citra hops have a big part in this.
T - Excellent flavor. The citrus flavors match the smell. A perfect balance of bitterness and a mild malt background. Great hop presence. Flavors of orange, lemon and grapefruit.
M - Extremely smooth. So easy to drink. Perfect carbonation.
O - An excellent, refreshing DIPA. Definitely a different take on a DIPA than the ones I have had before. Definitely worth trying if you have the chance. 586 charactersRheaume17, Dec 28, 2013

Yellow-orange, very cloudy, opaque color. Hoppy grapefruit aroma. The smell on the beer is very solid. Very light on the palate, this beer goes down easy for being a higher abv. The taste is underwhelming, the first thing I think of is Alpine's Nelson, but this isn't advertised as rye. This is a very unique taste, but honestly not overly impressive. Probably due to the extremely high expectations, and a few days shipping in the growler. I'm hoping I get future experiences with other offerings from Sean, but this one didn't quite do it for me. A solid beer, but didn't live up to the hype for me. 749 charactersVeganUndead, Dec 20, 2013

Nice creamy 1 finger head fades slowly with nice soapy lacing, super hazy white peach colored.
Nose is OK, but not as phenomenal as I expected, bit of tangerine, mild resin and hint of tropical fruit, juicy fruit but not much, semi sweet malt. 
Taste starts a little sweet malty but mostly plain malts, then hops, mild tropical fruit but barely, little citrus and juicy generic fruit, hint clementine and tangerine, candied citrus fruits, but not much else. Finish is fairly dry, semi bitter with more of the mild citrus and tropical fruit, but not very strong either.
Mouth is med bod, little fluffy, fluffy carb.
Overall another little bit of a letdown. I wonder if these couple batches were missing the right hops, or something else going on as they are really busy with the expansion, either way not really up to typical Hill quality. I'll ahve to try this and the Amarillo again. 1,003 charactersjlindros, Dec 20, 2013

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice hazy golden hue with a creamy white head that leaves nice lacing and a thin blanket.
S - Aromas of genetic citrus, grapefruit. Okay, but not earth shattering.
T - Taste is better, nice grapefruit notes, both bitter rind and flesh. Faint tropical notes light malts. The finish is nicely bitter and lingers.
M - Mouthfeel is nice for the style. Sharp carbonation, drinkable.

A- Cloudy golden bodied into several glasses. Small one finger white head with decent retention. Falls to a small ring andlace starts with some webs at the top and is spotty further down.
S- Tropical hops and citrus hops dominate the nose with mango, peach, grapefruit, orange peel and tangerine coming to mind. Pretty much just hop domination in a good way. Juicy nectar goodness.
T- Follows the nose with more general hop intensity. Mix of juicy tropical and stone fruits with a ton of grapefruit in there too. Juicy notes of tangerine, mango, orange zest, grapefruit for sure. Pretty much just hops, slight sweets and fresh cracked pale grains.
MF- Creamy bodied with moderate carbonation. Light to medium bodied thickness finishes with a smooth but substantial bitterness. Feels nowhere near 8%ABV.
A half and half blend it seems of tropical and citrus fruits. Another superb use of hops from the farm up north. 1,002 characterscbutova, Dec 18, 2013

Bright and hazy orange pour into a snifter. A couple fingers or so of white head fall to a thin but full cap with great webby lacing. Classic IPA appearance.
Juicy citrus fruits by the bowlful, earthy weed, with light sugar cookie and bready malts. Nice without a doubt but perhaps could be more potent.
Great mix of grapefruit, peach, lemon, earth and dank, with biscuit and light caramel sweetness for malt backing. Low bitterness makes this seem subtle in a way though the flavors are excellent.
Absurdly smooth+soft mouthfeel, creamy even, and very drinkable for the ABV. Dry finish and low-ish carbonation.
All too drinkable. Great hop flavor, low bitterness and impeccable balance. 774 charactersChico1985, Dec 08, 2013

Had my eye on this guy, thanks Ryan! A hazy, glowing tangerine orange liquid gurgles from the swingtop. There's no seeing through the body of this beer but there are some golden highlights when backlit. A pure white head rises to a moderate cap and stays put leaving momentary drink lines down the glass. 
I can smell this beer while it sits on the table 3' from my nose. Smells like weed. When I smell closer though it's more grapefruit and Mandarin orange, pineapple and mango. The weed is still there but the grapefruit and oranges are bright and in your face. There's a touch of lactic quality to the citrus and a soft backbone of crackery malt. Very nicely done.
The first thing I notice in the flavor profile is that crackery malt, it makes itself comfortable through the finish. Citrus is the highlight, a mix of Mandarin oranges, grapefruit, that soft lactic sweetness again, that the more I drink the more reminds me of overripe pineapple, and good green on the finish. While the citrus is nice my favorite part of the flavor profile is the dank finish. The flavor doesn't snap like the nose but that'd be pretty hard to do.
I'd have to say the body is moderate but the carbonation leaves it feeling even lighter, which I appreciate in IPAs. The finish is nicely dry and while the bitterness doesn't hit you immediately it seems to grow long after each drink.
Society & Solitude #5...A damn fine IPA. Right in the alcohol wheelhouse I appreciate, bursting with juicy citrus, and drinkability off the charts. This would be a dangerous beer to have readily available. I'd love some more of this. Thanks again, Ryan! 1,641 charactersjoe1510, Dec 06, 2013

Taste is right in line with aromas. Delicious, refreshing citrus hops with very little bitterness.
Mouthfeel is lots of tiny tiny bubbles on my tongue, finishes clean.

Appearance: Hazy peach-tinged gold. White head starts off huge with loose large bubbles. Drops to a tiny wispy cap and small collar. Sticky lacing. Moderate carbonation on the pour. 
Smell: Juicy mango and peach laced with a hint of pineapple. Some backing oily pine. A touch of mint with some backing dank herbal notes. Malt runs a little bready with some mild pale malt sweetness. Nice and clean with some hints of yeasty esters. Fresh flowers. Leafy. 
Taste: Solid pine and pith bitterness up front. Juicy mango and peach follow. Soft pale malt sweetness with an almost powdery yeast finish. Hemp seed with some lingering mint. Nicely bitter. Some pith and bright tropical fruit. Oh yeah mango. Some nice backing pineapple. Warms nicely, offering a decent balance with an assertive lingering bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: Carries that distinct medium and creamy body I've come to expect from draft Hill Farmstead. Moderate carbonation. Slightly dry on the finish, with a juicy initial sip. Easy drinking, especially for the style. 
Overall: Build me a cabin and put this on tap and I'll go Walden. 
A nice, if slightly less than mind blowing beer from Hill Farmstead. I really dig the balance and the hop profile. Nicely bitter. Carries all the trademarks of a Hill Farmstead pale ale and that's a mighty fine pedigree. 1,359 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Dec 01, 2013

Smell is distinctly citrussy tropical with grapefruit, tangerine and mango coming to mind. I can pick up on a minimal amount of malty sweetness with few piney notes. Juicy citrus and tropical grapefruit, tangerine and mango explode on the pallet and remind me of what I think an ideal juicy citrus hop profile should taste like. Bitter pine is not up front for me, but does come through in the finish. I don't pick up on much malt here, but its just enough in the background to complement the hops yet not overwhelm or take anything away. I would say the finish holds a very mild bitterness to it that is somewhat toned by a creamy malt. Great creamy mouth feel that I have come to expect from HF- very drinkable. Overall its hard to beat this brew and I can personally think of very few that come close to the hop flavor profile! No question in my top 5 DIPA 951 characters80x2HopHead, Sep 16, 2013

A~ crazy glowing light yellowy orange that gets lighter towards the bottom of the glass. big fluffy white head with a ton of lacing.
S~ a lot of natural earth and grass. some citrus notes, grapefruit, mango, lemon, lime, etc... all followed by a lot of hop presence.
T~ follows the nose with way more earthy pine bitterness that over takes your pallet leaving behind the juiciest tropical blend that seems to linger into a... run on sentence hahaha! (into a...) delicious, mellow, all around perfect IPA.
M~ as smooth as could be. extremely nice carbonation and very refreshing. great summer brew!
O~ might be my favorite of the "regular" IPA S&S series, the black IPA comes first for me though! if you're in a happy, hoppy mood you can't get any better than this. i'm gonna call it a fruit beer/IPA lovers dream. 883 charactersSkrip, Aug 16, 2013

S - Juicy, grapefruit, pine, grass, lemon, earthy bread
T - Sweet grapefruit, dry pine, juicy fruits, grass, earth, mellow finish - hoppy but not too bitter
M - Smooth, frothy, medium body, full coverage
O - Perfectly balanced. Initially sweet smooth fruity grapefruit followed by dry piney hops/ touch of carmel and finished by a mellow hoppy pleasant finish. ABV is completely hidden. Excellent. But my personal favorite is still Double Galaxy. 558 charactersweonfire, Aug 16, 2013

A: Pours the typical yellow/orange color with a white rim - not a ton of head but a fair amount of lacing sticking to the glass throughout my drinking session.
S: Another lovely HF DIPA - plenty of tropical fruit, citrus, pineapple, orange... Small traces of pine/hop but I'd say this is pretty dominated by the tropical bouquet.
T: A lot like it smells however the lighter fruits really take it over, I feel like its a little more dominated by orange/mango versus your typical citrus bomb, its very delicious. The taste is very smooth, no harsh after-taste or lingering hop sensation. 
M: Light bodied, mild carbonation
O: I feel like a broken record but another job well done - I love the fruit on this one and particularly like that I'm getting a lot more Orange on this one. Delicious beer! 871 charactersBeRanger, Aug 11, 2013

Poured full haze glowing orange with rich, bright white foam. Good lacing. Nose is whipped cream, butterscotch, jackfruit, mango, and typical Nelson squashiness. Taste is richer than expected with whipped cream and heavy biscuit. Flashes of sugar and alcohol. Thick, dessert like finish. Saltwater, buoyant palate with a finale of grapefruit rind.

A: Golden straw yellow, hazy, bright white frothy head.... lots of bubbles, nice lacing on the glass.
S: As others say, loads of citrus coming from this....grapefruit especially...orange, light on the lemon, some floral.... I don't find it that grassy/piney/bitter on the nose, but slightly sweet.
T: Silky smooth, lots of grapefruit, but more sweet juice and not so much pithy bitterness, also orange and light fruits, peaches, nectarines, lightly floral, maybe some melon. Not really acidic enough to be called so tropical and not so bitter to be piney....though has a nice mellow bitterness to it. Underneath it has a nice sweet, light malt base and only slight alcohol on the aftertaste when it warms.
M: Extremely balanced, less carbonated than it appears, hardly any sparkle, not really sticky, just slightly drying.
O: Another fine HF beer.... like most of their beers, they don't blow you away in their over the top-ness, but in their perfect balance and drink-ability.... This is a fantastic DIPA... will it blow your top off like Heady.... personal, I don't think so... like so many of S.Hill's other beers, it's not about being in your face. What it is, is a perfectly balanced, integrated, sweet, malty IPA that you could drink all night.... Where Heady really plays up the hops to like 150%, I don't think I could drink it all night, whereas this reins everything in to the point that it took no time whatsoever to polish off the 750 growler... I'd say this has a bit of a more toned down Abner feel to it... on an aside, I'd really like to see more HF beers being bottled, as I feel that the quality of the beer gets lost a bit on tap and if anything, the beers are almost cask like... not really flat, but not really sparkling... anyway, not really a complain, just a rumination... 1,906 characters4ster, Aug 02, 2013

Poured into a HF becker glass.
A-Cloudy orange yellow color with a 2 finger fluffy white head. decent retention and amazing lacing. 
S-Grapefruit, mango, lemon zest, orange peel, some grassy notes, and a feint bready character on the back end. 
T- Huge hop aroma- more grapefruit and mango mixed with some grass and pine resin. This kind of tastes like Abner. There is a big bitter note mixed in with some caramel on the back end. No alcohol or other flaws that I can note. Very close to the perfect IPA in my opinion. 
M- Carbonated to the perfect level. You can barely notice it, indicating it is right where it should be. Dry, but not overly so. The long bitter finish encourages you to keep drinking.
O- Amazing beer. I think this is my favorite of the society series, and maybe of all the HF IPAs and pales I have had so far. Amazing hop flavor and aroma that smacks you in the face but doesn't overtake the malt balance whatsoever. I could drink a 2L growler of this by myself in a night easily, despite the alcohol. Can't wait to get more if/when it comes around again. 1,181 charactersjustforrazors, Aug 02, 2013

A: relatively opaque body. a straw orange color. head is slightly off-white. great retention and moderate lacing. 
S: a really rich mix. piney, resinous, smells a little bit like Fruit Loops. a pretty pungent hop character is the star here. cant tell if im getting any malt presence, think this is mostly all hops. 
T: a lot of grapefruit. ganja. super sticky. a decent amount of pine. bitterness is present. very much so. not finding a ton of balance between the grist and hops. however that is not the worse thing. great hop flavor, just wish there was a bit more balance. 
M: average. slightly mellow carb. full body.
D: pretty solid, but I have to say my world isn't being shattered here. good DIPA, easy drinking, enjoyable. 767 charactersJimmys, Jul 26, 2013

A: Pours a hazy yellowish color with some orange-like hues dancing through out the body. A white head forms on the pour and recedes to a bubble ring. Some splotches of lace are left down the glass.
S: Lots of juicy citrus fruits going on with this one. Grapefruit, lemon rind and some lime zest as well. Tropical fruits as well with some pineapple. A little orange pith dryness and some sweet cracker malts.
T: The taste is much more vibrant the nose. Tons of grapefruit and tangerine notes. Incredibly juicy and citrusy. Lots of orange, mango and peach with some minimal resiny bitterness on the finish. Light sweet malt profile is present.
M: Light bodied with a perfect carbonation level. Smooth and sweet with a slightly bitter finish.

The beer pours a hazy apricot color, hues of orange and copper with a finger or so of soapy white head, that has good retention and leave a small amount of spotted lace behind. The aroma is lovely, lots of citrus, grapefruit, oranges and tangerine, light floral character with a nice amount of bitter pine and soft, doughy grain. This is definitely one of the more citrus forward DIPA's I've ever encountered and boy is it lovely. Lots of juicy grapefruit on the tongue, fresh apricot and peach flesh, bitter pine and light hop spice with some wildflower and light malt sweetness on the back end. The body is juicy and full, lower carbonation than anticipated but enough to be lively, the finish is crisp and has a great dry kick.
Verdict: Delightful. Citrusy, fruity, juicy and all around wonderful. It's bright, it's vibrant and just what I want from an IPA, one of the best showings of citrus in a hoppy beer I've had to date. 981 characterskevanb, Jul 14, 2013

Classic cloudy yellow orange, unfiltered beauty,2 finger dense bone white head,carbonation difficult to see but spot on, tons of sticky lacing left behind.
Hop bomb aroma,very grapefruit rind dominated with some fresh pineapple juice in the mix, malts are completely in the background, very juicy nose, inviting.
Taste is right on time: Hill Farmstead has a knack for hop forward,small hand crafted batches that are the fancy of die hard hopheads. Tons of bitter grapefruit with a touch of pineapple, and an interesting yeast component. Alcohol is masterfully masked for 7.8% abv,dry bitter finish as one would expect.
Mouthfeel is medium, bitterness starts mid palate then steps to the rear where it hangs out for just the right amount of time. Slightly acidic character never interferes with the overall enjoyment or becomes overbearing.
Bright & bouncy hops flavors spank your palate like a fraternity paddle. HFS requires some effort to obtain (even for a Vermonter), yet the enjoyment factor is at the top of the scale
and comes highly recommended. The lines of excellence are becoming blurred amongst Society & Solitude #5,Double Citra, Ephraim, and Abner: well done Mr. H! 1,252 charactersHendry, Jul 12, 2013

Score: 92
Two-and-a-half week old growler that was brought to me courtesy of a good friend, and kept ice cold the whole time. Served in a Perennial tulip/snifter hybrid glass and enjoyed on 08/11/13.
Appearance: Pours a translucent golden straw color with two fingers of frothy white head that settles to a wispy coating outlined by a thick ring of head around the edges of the glass. Very good lacing, good retention. 4.25/5
Smell: Earthy spiced hops, orange peels, spruce, pineapple, grapefruit and a hint of white wine. As the beer warms, the earthy spiciness falls off and the tropical juiciness comes through more in the nose. 4.25/5
Taste: Quite bitter, less juicy-sweet than I would have guessed on the nose. Bitter pineapple/grapefruit and "hoppy white grape" up front, with orange rind and woody/piney hops on the finish. Spicy caramel malt backbone, has just a dash of onion-iness that complements the spice. The bitterness and earthiness linger, but do not "layer" such that they get overly intense. 4.25/5
Mouthfeel: Medium-light bodied, medium-light carbonation gives good life to the bitterness of the brew. Oily mouthfeel. 4.25/5
Overall: A well-rounded, nicely crafted imperial IPA with a good malt backbone, a pleasing bitterness level and easy drinkability, but it is not up to par with some of Hill Farmstead's better hoppy beers such as Society & Solitude #4, Abner, Ephraim or Double Citra. This brew is definitely worth seeking out, but it is not one of the "can't miss" beers in their portfolio.
Cost: $10 for a 750 ml growler fill. 1,664 charactersjegross2, May 02, 2013

4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Looked like an extremely cloudy, vibrant color yellow, not dissimilar to many American wheats or hefeweizens. White head, looked distinct and respectable. Aroma was out of this world, heavenly luscious tropical fruit aromas, this is the creme de la creme of new proprietary hop aromas coming out, this ain't your daddies C hop bomb (nothing wrong with that though).
Taste is replete with solid citrus and tropical fruit bursts, very juicy, the bitterness is very doable, fruit stripe gum kind of pleasantness without all the coppery bitter bite of bandwagon jumper double ipa fools in recent years. A distinct amount of peach to it. Malt aspect of the beer is only enough to keep the hops running in ridiculous amounts of flavor punch. Its light. Pineapple and peach together at last, with all kinds of mango, lemon and tangerine thrown in to round out the hop mouthfeel. Yowza! Typical for Hill Farmstead, the alcohol is nowhere to be found tastewise, its just a massively enjoyable beer. Extremely dry finish, this is just one of many beers to seek out if you call yourself a hophead. 
Massively awesome stuff. 1,114 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jan 20, 2013

I was lucky enough to have it on draft a few times, and had a few different growlers of it as well.
Appearance: Like most HF IPAs, it glows orangey-yellow with a fluffy white head. Glorious.
Smell: Woah. Grapefruit, flowers, springtime, sweetness, CITRUS, lemons, oranges, clementines. All that is good and holy in this world. Zero bitterness, just magical.
Taste: See above, only better. This would get a 6.0 taste if you ask me. Explosion of grapefruity hops. Wave and wave. Dry finish...leaves you wanting more. Just superb. Citrus, freshness, perfection.
Mouthfeel: sublime. Fluffy, creamy, yet sharp and dry. Love.
Overall: I can't imagine how hoppy beers could be better than this. It's separated itself from an already crowded of pack of AMAZING Vermont IPAs. Awesome stuff.
I will be waiting patiently for this to be brewed again. If I could have one beer for the rest of my life, this is it. Moreso than Rare Bourbon County, any Cantillon, Heady Topper, whatever. Tried a ton of em, this is No. 1. 1,051 charactersNumber45forever, Dec 18, 2012

I should note that sadly, this growler is almost 4 weeks old. I just couldn't pick it up until now. It's almost completely filled to the top and has been kept very cold until now, when I poured it into my Bruery tulip.
Appearance. Pours a very hazy honey-gold with two fingers of thick white head that leaves some great bands behind.
Smell. The smell is absolutely massive as I pour this into the glass. Big piney, floral hops with a bunch of yellow grapefruit and other citrus fruits. There's also some great, lightly toasted malts backing those hops and just a faint hint of stinky socks ...hey, that's what I'm getting.
Taste. Sweet yellow and pink grapefruits with some bitter rinds. There's a little orange and lime present ans well along with some nice lightly toasted light grains. There's a bit of juicy sweetness but the finish is dry. Just an explosion of flavour with a good amount of bitterness. Really awesome stuff.
Mouthfeel. Medium body with a medium amount of creamy, velvety smooth carbonation.
Overall. We have a winner here folks. The juicy grapefruit flavours along with that amazing creamy, yet still well carbonated mouthfeel is really something to behold. This has to be the best DIPA I've ever tasted, despite my early reviews of another being higher. I couldn't imagine this tasting any better despite the growler being filled several weeks ago. 1,460 charactersRutager, Dec 16, 2012

A:golden yellow honey color with bright white heavy head totally opaque 
S: when it is first poured it smells like a tropical hop paradise this pungency fades a little but it remains 
T: first of all it tastes mainly as described like grapefruit so tip if the cap to Sean there. It is tart and juicy with lots of hop bitterness in the finish but it tastes like a just ate a grapefruit with that harsh tart sour aftertaste that lasts for awhile 
M: smooth and somewhat oily with a light amount of carbonation that compliments the bitterness well. 
O: I really like this both as an ipa and because it tastes like grapefruit plus it smells amazing its a great beer if you can get a hold of it hill farmstead does it again I'm convinced they brew nothing but greatness 795 charactersPinknuggets, Dec 12, 2012

The aroma shows some Juicy peach and tropical fruit flavors. A little grapefruit rind bitterness mixing in along with some light notes of grapes. A little of the pale malts peek through. Very nice hoppy aroma overall. 
The taste shows a little more of the grapefruit rind and crisp grape notes to it at first. Peach and tropic fruit lead into a dry finish. Really great juicy and bright hoppiness to it. 
The mouthfeel is on the lighter side with moderate carbonation. Very good beer overall, loved the juicy bright hoppiness. Very drinkable and flavorful. 700 charactersbillab914, Dec 09, 2012

S: Healthy doses of pine needles, grapefruit and some orange peel. Very appealing and pleasant
T: An immediate grapefruit, pine resin meet the palate with a moderate dry hop bitterness. The malt bill is very light on this really leaving the hops to work overtime. Light booze, bigger pine and citrus notes keep the taste buds salivating. The finish is clean, a little sweetness, bitter and it has a drying but resiny duo thing going on. 
M: Medium bodied, almost light to medium, well carbonated. Very airy, pleasant.
O: Again, so nice, wanted a bit more body. Again, this beer is just so damn clean and tasty that i did not even care. Very well crafted beer. 855 charactersbarleywinefiend, Dec 01, 2012

A: Cloudy golden with beautiful white head and tons of lacing. I wouldn't have guessed this was a DIPA by the looks. 
S: Grapefruit, pineapple, citrus wonderfulness. I'm going to switch glasses after this one is empty so I can smell the empty glass after a bit. I have a feeling the residual beer will be fantastic for quite a while. One of the best smelling beers I've experienced. 
T: Not a ton of bitterness, very dry and leaves you wanting more. Very low level of malt but not lacking. No alcohol presence. Tons of citrus, mainly grapefruit with a little lemon/orange/tangerine. Tastes more like an IPA in my opinion but is super delicious.
M: Light and creamy - perfect level of carbonation even after the shipping.
O: Fantastic beer. I could drink this forever. One of the top IPA/DIPAs I've ever had. Hard to compare to Heady/PtE because it seems more like an IPA but I can't get over how fantastic this beer is. The HF hype seems to be well deserved. 1,087 charactersAnnArborJoe, Nov 26, 2012

Appearance: Very light in color, more yellow than orange, and pretty cloudy. Pours a really nice, three finger, pillowy white head with really solid retention. 
Aroma: Huge pineapple, mango, grapefruit and other tropical fruit notes from the hops pack a pretty aggressive punch upfront. A really hoppy, agressive nose. Lots of tropical hop aromas without much bitterness. LIght malt backbone is barely noticable and really allows the hops to shine. 
Taste: Big, sweet topical fruit notes of pineapple and mango upfront. Extremely juicy and fruity. Some citrus zest, particularly orange and tangerine, play nicely off some grapefruit and just a bit of hop bitterness. Slightly bitter, dry finish. 
Mouthfeel: Light bodied and nicely carbonated. Incredibly refreshing and easy to drink.
Overall, this is probably my favorite HF IPA. I had this side by side with Abner and I slightly preferred this. Incredibly juicy and fruity, with a great tropical hop profile. Refreshing, balanced and extremely tasty. I think this might be the single best IPA I've ever had. 1,202 charactersGosox8787, Nov 24, 2012

Pours a 1 finger frothy white head that dissipates slowly. Beer is a pale, cloudy lemon. Lacing is thick, layered, and patchy. Pretty beer.
Nose is aromatic as hell. Citrus, pine, mango, papaya and other tropical fruits. Real sweet, fruity and super appetizing. Real pulpy and grassy too.
Opens with a big citrus punch. Grapefruit, papaya and passion fruit along with a strong cane sugar backbone. Fruity hop bitterness comes in towards the middle to tie things together and balance the sweetness. Finishes with more mango, papaya, and other tropical fruit flavors. Aftertaste is pleasantly citrus. Very nearly perfect. 
Light bodied and well carbonated. Light and prickly in the mouth and on the tongue and aggressive and quenching going down. Finishes messy with a long, lingering aftertaste. Can't get enough of this one! 
Another very nearly perfect pale ale from Hill Farmstead. I'm convinced they churn out the best variety of consistently amazing ipas of any brewery around. 1,046 charactersSpeedwayJim, Nov 24, 2012

Beer pours a hazy orange-yellow with a thin white head. It looks like most of the other HF DIPAs, which is to say "perfect." I rarely care about the appearance of beers, but something about the sight of HF's hoppy beers is just so appealing and citrusy looking. Like most HF hoppy beers, this one has an incredible citrus aroma that just hits you in the face. Flavor follows the nose, and this one is just incredibly juicy. It's a wonderful balance of sweetness, hoppy and citrus fruit here that all comes together perfectly. The fruitiness of it is really what makes this one a standout. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with nice carbonation. Overall, another home run from Hill Farmstead. This is one of my favorite hoppy beers from them. It's maybe not quite on the level of Abner and Ephraim, but certainly right in there with S&S4 and Double Galaxy. Just awesome. 943 charactersstarrdogg, Nov 23, 2012

A - Pours a super hazy and is clearly unfiltered. Reminds me of a Wit beer the way it pours. The pour yielded a frothy, white head that quickly dissipated leaving behind some nice lace.
S - Holy Citrus Batman. Huge grapefruit and orange aromas. Pineapple and pale malt lend a biscuity sweetness to even out the aroma profile
T - Another awesome tasting beer from HF. Damn these guys! Huge citrus flavors dominated by grapefruit and some tart orange juice. I’m having a hard time picking out any other flavors given how citrusy this beer is. There are slight hints of sweetness in the middle, but it finishes off as tart as it starts. 
M - Although this was bottled probably a week ago, it arrived super fresh and very well carbonated. I would almost say it was mildly over carbonated for the style. The mouth feel was fairly thick and slick, almost creamy. The mouth feel of this beer is a complete opposite to what i was expecting at such a low ABV beer. Starts and finishes dry. 
O - Damn, these guys at HF sure know how to brew beer. I'm used to all the usual Northern California offerings and am blown away by the beers i have tasted from this brewery. I found this to be the most drinkable, almost sessioanable IPA i have ever had. I prefer their more potent Abner but would easily say this is the second best IPA i have had from them. 1,474 charactersdubinsky, Nov 13, 2012

Poured from a growler to a New Belgium snifter. Small white head, extremely hazy golden color. Basically opaque, cannot see through this beer at all.
The smell is where this beer shines. Grapfruity, citrus, pine, I love the nose on this. Best smell ever.
Taste follows the grapefruity smell. Bitter grapefruit, a msall amount of malt, a bit of pine and cirus on the finish. Mouthfeel is great.

Pours cloudy gold with a pillowy white head. As usual excellent retention and lacing. 
Smells like fresh fruit juice. Loads of mango, pineapple and grapefruit.
Starts off with a little bitter floral flavor. Cracker malts in the middle before finishes with a huge grapefruit rind finish. Do yourself a favor and let this one warm up a bit. It's good cold out of the bottle, but the tropical fruit juices really come through more as it warms and the grapefruit is delectable tart.
Good light creamy mouthfeel with medium carbonation.
Fantastic beer. Perhaps liked S&S #4 a bit more, but this is still delicious. About the only nitpick I have, is it took the beer a bit of temperature to hit its sweet spot. Absolutely love the grapefruit presence. 779 charactersjmarsh123, Nov 10, 2012

A - Pours a very cloudy and light yellow body. Never seen a DIPA so light, it almost looks like a murky berliner weisse or something. Massive white head forms with just an unreal amount of sticky lacing and retention. Looks perfect.
S - Mango and grapefruit juice. The smell is just so oily and juicy with a touch of dankness on the very end. One of the best hop aromas I have ever smelled. I typically lean towards grapefruit and tropical notes over the dank/resinous/piney beers so this is just right up my alley.
T - Bitter grapefruit and mango juice. Like drinking a glass of oily and super fresh citrus juice. The taste is just so perfect. Bitterness is intense but never overwhelming and the juicy citrus finishes dry and pleasantly. Again, perfect.
M - Medium bodied with light and prickly carbonation. Highly drinkable.
O - Heady? This just replaced that beer as my favorite DIPA. This is just too stupidly perfect. I could drink this every day and never lust after another beer. 1,110 charactersdavey101, Nov 04, 2012

Pours a fantastic, hazy yellow. Foamy, thin white head and great lacing. The head is dense, and looks like meringue, which foreshadows the lemony, grapefruit deliciousness to come.
The aroma is sweet, yet has a bit of a sharp pine bite to it. It's a bit mild, but does have just a slight booze presence as well.
The taste, however, has no booze whatsoever. This beer is just spectacular. It's lemon/pineapple/grapfruit profile truly mimics a holiday dessert, but the bitter finish reminds you that it's an potent IPA that you are consuming instead. There's just a touch of sweetness to bring out the flavors, but it's mostly a bitter bomb of pure citrus. The citrus combo is as clean as it is potent, however, and isn't harsh at all. Even the lingering bitterness just disappears from your palate, leaving you thirsting for more.
I tried my damndest to find a fault with this brew, but there really are none. It is dangerously drinkable, unbelievably quenching, and I would highly recommend sharing a growler with a few friends. It goes down quickly and easily. 1,170 charactersstonermouse, Oct 31, 2012

A- Pours a hazy slightly orange yellow with about a finger's worth of foamy head that recedes fairly fast and leaves some foamy layered lacing. Decent carbonation.
S- Grapefruit (when they said think Grapefruit they weren't kidding), orange peel, light lemon zest. Nicely balanced, nice aroma strength, and definitely pleasant.
T- Grapefruit, orange peel, light lemon zest. Nicely balanced fruity taste that lingers and finishes without much bitterness.
M- Medium bodied, nice carbonation, very smooth, abv pretty much non existent. Pretty much perfect feel for an IPA.
O- This was a very nice IPA that easily stands up to the SS4 that preceded this. Nice grapefruit presence with a light zest and pretty much nonexistent bitterness. I think this came out pretty much exactly how they wanted it to come out. My only major complaint is that it should be made year round. 958 charactersjaasen64, Oct 29, 2012

T: Grapefruit with lesser elements of pineapple and orange pulp. Bitterness is moderate in the mid-taste but nonexistent in the aftertaste. Pure citrus flavor throughout. There may be an element of sweetness during the taste, but the finish is dry, so I think that's just a mental trick from the fruitiness. 
M: It's worth noting that when I was serving this at a tasting, I proudly asserted that this was "only 5.6%." I think that underscores how [scarily] drinkable this is; it drinks like something much, much lighter and can be deadly in larger quantities. This is remarkably clean and dry, with no lingering bitterness, no heaviness, no detectable ABV... 
O: Hill Farmstead consistently churns out quality IPAs and DIPAs. This is no different. I prefer Abner to this one, but we're talking about incremental degrees of excellence at this point. 1,360 charactersArbitrator, Oct 17, 2012

Growler from Barry, thanks! Snifter.
A: Very hazy yellow orange with a frothy white head. Scattered lacing.
S: Spicy grapefruit with notes of mango, tangerine, and orange. Exceptional fruit profile. Perfumy floral notes with no malt influence. There's a little lemon in there.
T: Very dry with notes of lemon and grapefruit. Lots of rind as well as flesh. Upper moderate bitterness with no real sweetness to shelter the palate from the hop onslaught. Dry, bitter, juicy, well attenuated finish. No evident booze.
M: Lower medium body with upper medium carbonation. Sticky and dry mouthfeel.
Overall: A great addition to the Society & Solitude series. Very nice. 678 charactersHopHead84, Oct 14, 2012

Aroma is really quite fruity and pungent, lots of grapefruit, the hops are wet and sticky. Taste is fruity, not particularly bitter, very grapefruity - bitter and citrusy tart at once. Alcohol is not perceptible. Palate is lightly-med carbed with med body. Not my favourite from HF but definitly very good 360 charactersLuk13, Oct 14, 2012

And I got it just as it was starting to kick too, fortunately. Cloudy peach-yellow pour with a medium-sized white head that settled to a wispy layer of bubbles leaving some spotty lacing on the glass. Lots of fresh citrus in the nose, some notes of pine and tropical fruit. The taste reflects the nose in a tremendous way, lemon, grapefruit, pineapple, pine resin, grass, light biscuity malts in the background. Mouthfeel is crisp and juicy, light-medium body fairly bitter in the finish, slightly higher ABV essentially unnoticeable. Great beer overall. 
I really can't think of many other DIPAs as good as this...retaining all the hops, keeping a crisp mouthfeel with no malty/heavy body, and having the higher ABV so well hidden. 770 charactersRifugium, Oct 13, 2012

A - Big white foam settles to a thin cap, thicker collar, and spotty lacework. Murky peach juice color that is fairly light, but seems to be typical of Hill Farmstead's hoppy beers in this ABV range.
S - Smells like grapefruits. There's some citrus flesh, light grass, and a touch of orange zest, but this is heavy on ripe grapefruits. Not much malt character either, with just the lightest pale malt and vanilla wafer backing things up.
T - The taste is redolent of grapefruits too, with lots of citrus pulp and zest present. Moderate bitterness and a very restrained malt backbone - just a ton of bitter grapefruit flesh and zest. Perhaps a touch of grass in there as well.
M - Medium body, with pleasant active but soft carbonation. Very dry in the finish, with tons of lingering hop oils and resins. No perceptible alcohol.
D - Very easy to drink at 7.8%, with tons of flavor. I love the dry texture, and attenuated malt bill - Shaun can roll with the best West Coast Pale Ale brewers. I like this significantly more than #4, and I managed to crush the entire growler with a little help from the indefatigable Marie Curiosity. Hopefully Hill Farmstead revisits some of the best recipes from this series of beers. 1,296 charactersMasterSki, Oct 10, 2012

A - Very cloudy golden yellow with some orange in the centre. Half a finger of white head with moderate lacing. 
S - Massive hit of fresh grapefruit, pine and orange zest with a fairly noticeable but not overwhelming bitterness. Some sweet honey/caramel in the background. 
T - A bitter punch up front with one of the most pungent grapefruit rind flavours I've tasted in a beer. While most grapefruit-forward IPAs taste of fresh grapefruit juice, this one definitely tastes of the bitter rind, not the fruit. There are also lighter peach and orange zest flavours present with a lighter honey/caramel malt sweetness in the background. The finish is bitter and dry. 
M - Medium body; chewy with the typical HF IPA dryness that I love. Light carbonation. 837 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Oct 07, 2012

Hazy amber colored, very typical of HF. Medium head, good lacing. Tropical fruit heavy aroma, lots of pineapple and possibly malty sweetness. Light and hoppy taste with a finishing bitterness and a dominant fruity note. Crisp and dry feel. Overall it's not bad but nothing's great about it either.

a - Pours a murky, orange-golden color with one and a half fingers of fluffy bright white head and moderate carbonation evident.
s - Smells of oranges, citrus, grapefruit, pine hops, tropical fruits, lemon, fruity malts, floral hops. Ton of fresh hops and fruit; really an amazing nose for a hoppy beer. Perfect for me.
t - Tastes of oranges, citrus, lemon, grapefruit, tropical fruits, bready malts, pine hops, some earthy notes, and floral hops. Again, really amazing, though I think the nose had a little more to it. Still an amazing taste.
m - Medium body and low to moderate carbonation. Body is super smooth and insanely easy to drink. Not much bitterness at all for a DIPA. Near perfect mouthfeel for a DIPA for me.
o - Overall a really amazing DIPA. I also drank a Heady Topper and Ephraim tonight, and this is right up there with them as some of the best hoppy beers I've ever had. I think I like it a little bit better than S&S #4 as I find this less bitter and more drinkable. Perfect nose and mouthfeel to me, would love to have this one again. 1,158 charactersmdfb79, Oct 03, 2012

This bright, straw-colored body is lighter in color than I remember from other HF DIPAs. Delicate lace and head form atop the liquid which, again, departs from the thicker, often aggressively stubborn foam shown by their other offerings.
Taste and aroma are similar. Initial dose of lemon zest has spring in its step, yet this succumbs to the hoppy base midway through the drink. Fresh hops take over, imparting a bitter quality that isn't overbearing or imbalanced, yet doesn't quite capture the magic of their previous DIPAs. More hop resin at the end for a unique finish.
A crisp, clean, tasty brew that's sure to please many, but I'm still an Abner man. 696 charactersbrystmar, Oct 01, 2012

A: Hazy as hell golden orange color. About a finger of bright white head. Leaving some sticking lacing sheets. There is some yeast in suspension floating around. Again, so cloudy.
S: Tons of piney grapefruit notes. Very reisinous. Smells so inviting. Low malt bill. Hop bomb. Right in my wheel house.
T: Lots of crazy hop bitterness on tongue. Just really attacking it. Tons of pine and grapefruit. Hop bomb. Low malt bill. I like the lower ABV for a DIPA. Not as sweet with the lower malt too.
M: Medium bodied. Lighter than most DIPAs. 587 charactersinlimbo77, Oct 01, 2012

Society and Solitude #5 pours a hazy straw yellow with a medium sized, creamy head on top. The foam is slow to dissolve leaving behind a coating of lace on the glass.
The aroma is loaded with pine, grapefruit and lemon citrus. A touch of bready pale malt is also present.
Each sip of this medium to full bodied beer is oily on the palate with a good firm carbonation. The flavor has lots of lemon and grapefruit citrus as well as some pine. There's some bubblegum sweetness and a touch of bready pale malt found in the background. The beer finishes dry and bitter and slightly tart. Once gone the lemon citrus lingers on the palate.
This is a very tasty beer that's loaded with hop flavor, but the aroma fades quickly. 796 charactersWanderingFool, Oct 01, 2012
4.54/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Decided to crack open a 2 liter growler of society of solitude 5 that I picked from hill farmstead at the 2012 harvest fest. I really enjoyed trying this brew at the festival so my mouth is watering to tap into this growler
A- society and solitude pours a hazy tangerine orange body with a soapy white head of foam that laces the edges with marshmallow webbing. Very exuberant and glowing in my hill farmstead stemware. 
S- Ridiculous grapefruit blast that embodies the description of tropical oasis. Sweet and citric catapult of literal grapefruit bombs blasting the scent profile. S&S5 pushes your nostrils off a tropical island of a citric oasis
T- A sweet and sour compilation of the aforementioned tropical flavor. A bitter mouth cringing grapefruit flavor attaches itself to the palate while a sugary spectacle of flavor lingers on. There is a caramel flavor that is at the exit with flavor that suggests some piney resinous flavor contributing and therefore balancing the hoppy grapefruit too
M- carbonated and prickly deliciousness that flows all over the palate
O- The best way to summarize society and solitude 5 is to summarize it as a tropical grapefruit neutron bomb. Very enlightening and tropical brew that explodes and graffitees your palate with bitter sweet flavor. Again, here is Shaun Hill demonstrating that DIPA's can embody many different properties. Way to go Hill Farmstead! 1,404 characterslovindahops, Sep 30, 2012

T - Follows the nose quite well. Starts out with a nice sweet, juicy grapefruit flavor. Finish is dry and bitter grapefruit.
M - Really smooth, no alcohol. Medium bodied. The bitterness really builds as you drink it.

Pour: Completely hazy yellow-orange with a finger and a half of white soapy head. Head eventually recedes to film, and leaves solid lacing. Shaun Hill described this as "think grapefruit" - well this looks just like grapefruit juice.
Smell: Tangerine, mango, pineapple, and grapefruit explode from the glass. Malt? What malt. This beer is carbonated juice. This smelled perfect.
Taste: Tangerine and grapefruit BOMB. This beer is so juicy and fantastic. The citrus that bursts in your mouth every sip is incredible. A nice sweetness, but no substantial malt presence. I'm perfect with that.
Mouthfeel: This is so drinkable. Velvety carbonation, but the highlight of this beer is how the juiciness of the taste translates to the mouthfeel. Perfect again.
Overall: The best DIPA I've ever had. 898 characterscfrances33, Sep 26, 2012

A Pours a hazy light orange color with a pretty large white head. Lots of sticky lacing left all the way down the glass and lots of lively carbonation. Typical Hill Farmstead looking beer...
S Citrus bomb. Grapefruit, tangerine, orange and a light malt hiding out in the back.
T Follows the nose perfectly. Medium to lighter bitterness with lots of sweet grapefruit and tangerine. Sweetens up in the middle and rides out to a juicy finish. I'm always looking for the bitterness in IPAs and DIPAs but the citrus in this is crazy. and does NOT drink almost 8%.
M Medium feel with a medium amount of carbonation on the tongue. The finish is somewhere between dry and sticky.
O This beer was pretty unreal. It tastes like goddamn fruit juice with a small bitterness. These S&S's dont deviate from the awesome line. Thanks HF guys for having another top notch fest and making ridiculous beers. 922 charactersGushue3, Sep 25, 2012

Pours a mirky golden yellow color, white head, thin collar, spotty lace. Aroma is hop-forward without being over-the-hop, light fruity sweetness, some resin in there too. Flavor is grapefruit, pine, and citrus. Hoppy yet smooth...not a palate-wrecker...very well-done. Light toward medium body, good carbonation, oily hoppy finish.
Easier to drink then S&S #4 and I think I enjoyed this one a bit more as well. Very easy to drink for 7.8% and the perfect balance of hops to not kill me after one or two glasses. Great stuff! 623 charactersSean9689, Sep 24, 2012

A - Pours a fuzzy peach color with a nice one and a half finger tall white head, dissipating down to a light film, leaving spotty trails of lace down the sides of the glass.
S - Smells of strong grapefruit pith, fresh cut grass, pale malt and a touch of sweetness. The fruit / grass combo is killer, makes this one a joy to smell.
T - Starts off with the intense fruitiness, mostly grapefruit and other citric rind, slowly giving way to the grassy hop bitterness, pine needles, pale malt and a touch of caramel sweetness. The balance of flavors is great yet intense, hard to pull off. Finish is pretty dry, lingering long after the finish.
M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Fruity, bitter feel throughout with a but if dryness at the end of each sip.
O - Probably my favorite to date from the series. It has everything I look for in a DIPA yet it remains incredibly drinkable. Amazing work on this one Shaun. 958 charactersorangesol, Sep 24, 2012

Pours a pale, hazed golden amber with a dense, soapy white head that fades fairly quickly to a thin collar and some clumpy lacing. Aroma and flavor are like biting into a fresh grapefruit with a surprising lack of bitterness in the finish. Aroma is ruby red grapefruit, citrus rind and skin, not particularly sweet, artificial or juicy. Flavor has a little more sugary sweetness, but continues with fresh grapefruit notes. Pulpy in the finish with long lasting lingering acidity and no bitterness. Dry, crisp and balanced, body is exceptional for this series. I realize describing this as a grapefruit IPA makes this sound like 1 of N other beers, but this was remarkably unique and exceptional. 824 charactersyourefragile, Sep 23, 2012

Pours a cloudy orange-blonde with a two-finger head that fades to lacing in my glass. I was not expecting the cloudiness but perhaps it's there for a reason?
Spicy with a touch of pine and citrus in the nose. It tingles my olfactory gland, mellowing me out. 
Wow. It starts with a touch of pine that morphs into a tsunami of acidic grapefruit with a sweet, biscuity backbone. Something about this just feels so right. 
It's all in the mouthfeel. The hops fade and lead to a buttery, doughy, lupulin-soaked aftertaste. Wow. 
Sure, scoff at the repetitive use of "wow". I am very happy with this selection. 783 charactersBrad007, Sep 23, 2012
