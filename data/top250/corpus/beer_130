L - pours a dark paint brown with a beautiful mocha head. Mesmerizing honeycomb bubble structure. This'll do just fine in lieu of morning coffee on this north east blizzard morning. 
S - huge roasty lactose character bolstered by the booze. Iced latte and a walnut nuttiness. Almost has a bit of tang to it. 
T - drinks like iced coffee too! Sweet cream and more than a few sugars in this roast. There is some fresh, minty hoppiness present that tips this into "refreshment" territory. Mellow oak rounds out this wonderfully balanced beer. 
F - soft and supple. Not motor oil like you'd expect for a 12% stout, but luscious and creamy. 
O - all around great stout. Well orchestrated. Judging by some of the reviews (and what's written on the bottle) this gets better with time. Two years and not a trace of booze burn. Coffee wasn't as pronounced as I expected and the sweeter flavors started to come out, but everything seems soothing and under control. Oak character definitely seems more robust but I'll have to try another fresh to see what's what. 1,073 charactersagreenman19, Mar 14, 2017

A: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a thin beige head that fades slowly and leaves a thin lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains strong bourbon along with coffee, chocolate, molasses and a faint touch of hops.
T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of bourbon, molasses, coffee and chocolate. Then a hearty roasted malt character comes in. The hops presence is extremely mild as it should be and there is a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.
M: Very smooth and quite viscous, medium-to-heavy body, light-to-medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down dangerously easy, slightly filling, strong kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good big stout to sip on for a long time. 851 charactersTheManiacalOne, Feb 11, 2017

The aroma from this is heavenly. Tons of sweet, roasted malt with a massive amount of coffee and dark chocolate all with the most pleasant whiff of bourbon in the background. The taste is exactly the same as the aroma with the roasty twang of the malt being complimented by the coffee and chocolate and the bourbon coming in to bring it all together. This is as good as any BBA coffee stout I have had. It is a great beer. 553 charactersFriedSlug, Sep 18, 2016

this one blew me away since i was not expecting an overly potent barrel on this one.  not sure why, but my expectations were not super high for this, but man it blew me away.  the barrel is extremely present on this one.  tons of vanilla, oak, bourbon, and a hint of coffee.  this would be amazing with a few years on it, but certainly was also amazing with minimal age.  Amazed by how underrated this one seems to be, and will seek this out again 493 charactersrabbott2, Aug 31, 2016

4.37/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A- Huge, thick, and dark, this beer basically globs into the glass. A small and tan colored head forms and leaves a bit of lacing. The head reduces down to just a ring on the top of the beer. There are also a few alcohol legs around the glass.
S- Right off the bat, you notice that this one is mostly bourbon barrel. Great notes of char, spice, oak, and light sweetness hit the nostrils in an aggressive attack. There is just a touch of dark and black malt bitterness coming through in the nose as well, but the barrel really dominates the smell.
T- Barrel and dark, bitter malts hit the tongue first. The barrel is lighter and less dominant than it is in the scent. There is more of a focus on spice and oak than the sweeter elements of the barrel. The dark malts increase the bitterness with a dose of dark chocolate flavor and maybe a hint of light tar when the barrel and malt is combined. Everything mellows out toward the end of the drink with a slight lean towards the barrel flavors. Oak and a touch of bourbon ride out the drink and linger on the tongue.
M- No doubt about it, this beer is thick and viscous, smooth and strong. A slower drinker, but a delicious one keeps you coming back for more. Feels like the style should.
Overall, this is a very pleasant drinking experience. It is think, dark, and strong with a great display of barrel flavors. The Base beer is almost overpowered, but the balance that is struck between barrel and malt is absolutely delicious. Definitely worth it if you can find it. 1,520 charactersboilermakerbrew, Aug 28, 2016

4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a thick black with a nice creamy lacing.  Impressive for its age. The smell is intense.  Tons of oaky goodness, coffee, vanilla and chocolate.  Based on the nose, it seems like the bourbon has made its mark.  It reminds me of Black Tuesday in intensity.  The taste is much of the same.  This is one delicious brew!  The flavors are all there without being very sweet.  There's a slight acidic tartness that seems to come from the coffee that I love.  The mouth feel is a bit dull compared to what I was expecting from the pour, but nothing to gripe about.
I just had a 2014 Vanilla Rye yesterday and I much prefer this brew.  It is extremely well balanced with flavors hopping (no pun intended) taking my palette for a wild ride!   One of the best I've had. 764 charactersnawpnawp, Aug 17, 2016

Reviewed the 2015.
A: Jet black and so dense. Low head of very dense dark tan carbonation.
A: Burbon and oak, chocolate for days. So decadent. Coconut peeking through as it warms.
T: Bourbon dominates, almost a little too much. Cocoa, roast malts, low coffee flavor, oak. It it possible to have a clean BBA beer? If it it this would be it.
B: Love the medium to heavy mouthfeel on this beer. Like the base beer was designed to be barrel aged.
O: This beer and the base beer blow me away every time. There was something going on w/ Speedway when they moved to the bigger facility but both beers are right back on track again. 713 charactersd3brewing, May 10, 2016

And I say whiskey indeed, not bourbon- it has that astringent, sharp feel of a Scotch barrel. And nothing much else- no nuances. The coffee that makes regular Speedway so good is almost gone here, drowned in barrel. 
Glad I tried it, but would not revisit. 350 charactersDoubleSimcoe, May 08, 2016

 The nose is solid of the barrel aging. I don't get much else in the nose lots of good bourbon.
 The alcohol was pretty sharp at first but as my glass has warmed it has become really smooth. Don't find any real adjunts jumping out here but a nice smooth BBA stout.
 The mouth feel is smooth perhaps a tad thinner than I like but you get that with BBA beers.
 A nice drinking stout with plenty of bourbon. 465 characterssmanson56, Apr 01, 2016

Taste is where this beer becomes a let down, not much coffee, nothing like the base beer. Very hot, barrel is overpowering. Choclate and vanilla follow, but still overshadowed by bourbon on the finish. Feel isn't as thick as the pour suggests. Overall I would take Vietnamese or Hawaiian over BA, the barrel qualities far overpowered the base beer, which is exceptional in its own right. 492 charactersDrewZ926, Mar 26, 2016

Misc.: AleSmith Tap Takeover night
First time reviewing this, but third time tasting it. Picked this over Vietnamese Coffee variant, assuming I would get to have that next (this did not happen). Loved it the last two times I tasted it and expecting at least a 4.50.
Poured a black color with one finger of khaki tan head when I got it. Minima lacing on the sides of the glass. Average retention. (Sight - 3.75)
Smelled toffee, smooth milk chocolate, buttery bourbon syrup, caramel, roasty malts and wet cocoa powder. (Smell - 4.50)
Tasted much boozier than the smell. Super hot from the get-go. Bourbon heavy, chocolate, toffee, caramel and smooth dark milk chocolate. Bourbon was just overwhelming. (Taste - 4.25)
Full body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Boozy, warming finish. (Feel - 4.25)
Not quite as good as the last few times I had this at AleSmith. Not sure what it was, but picked a bad time to review this. Will have it again for sure though. (Overall - 4.25)

I find this beer very thin, not a ton of bourbon charecter, and overall kind of boring. The speedway charecter lends an astringent flavor i do not appreciate, and again, the body is not what i expected from a beer of this "caliber" 336 charactersTommo, Feb 23, 2016

A: Pours a pitch black color, with a slight, bubbly mocha-colored head that sticks around. 
S: First thing up front is ton of barrel. And it's mostly oak and char, not a ton of sweet or wet bourbon. Next you get that bitter coffee underneath, but it's not huge. Some chocolate and cocoa in the finish, with a touch of vanilla. 
T: Right up front is that barrel character again, with tons of oak, wood, char, smoke, spirit and whiskey. Very, very boozy and alcoholic. Middle of the mouth comes a ton of coffee bitterness, but not exactly flavor. Finish is even more barrel and oak, as well as a ton of booze and bourbon.
M: Medium body, decent carbonation. Tons of alcohol and booze here. 
O: Big thanks to illinikap for this one. Been a long time want for me. To be honest, I'm not a huge fan of regular Speedway Stout. It's too bitter and hoppy for me. Heading into this one, I was hoping that the barrel would smooth some of that out. Overall, this mostly accomplishes that, but there's a couple shortcomings. I do like the large oak and barrel presence here, and how it smooths out that coffee bitterness. My only gripe, is that this is quite boozy and hot from beginning to end. I've had larger ABV beers that you get no alcohol from, but this one is very, very hot. For some context, I'd say this is somewhere between KBS and BCBCS, but closer to KBS. 
Recommendation: Any fan of Speedway Stout or BA coffee stouts needs to get a hold of this one. 1,640 charactersSparty1224, Jan 29, 2016

Relatively fresh bottle.  Lots of bourbon heat, some coffee, but overall just a smooth BA stout.  Something about this makes the regular Speedway seem more special - at the price, this is absolutely not worth it - I would take a few regular over this 268 characterspagriley, Jan 21, 2016

Smell-Smells just like chocolate espresso cake. Lots of milk chocolate, vanilla, and mild coffee.
Tate-Just like the smell, a beautiful blend of milk chocolate, vanilla (probably from the barrels) and smooth coffee. The bourbon barrels really took the bitter edge of the coffee without overpowering the rest of the flavors, no booze to speak of at all. unbelievably delicious.
Feel-Medium/full body, lighter then expected(mean that positively), has a pillowy, marshmallow-like chewiness that is extremely enjoyable, not too oily, more carbonated then you'd think from looking at it which keeps the texture from being too heavy.
Overall-Seriously delicous beer, Flawless texture and absolutely unbelievable flavor and aroma. 840 charactersSteveB24, Jan 03, 2016

4.73/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 52013 Bottle.  
Look:  Almost still, dark brown body.  Super low carb kick-up during and after the pour.  Thread thin halo around the glass.  Oily and slick lacing and legs that completely melt from the sides of the glass.    
Smell:  Bourbon, sweet grains, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, sweet malts, bourbon, and molasses.  Play dough. 
Taste:  See above.  Nice drawn out finish that concludes with much caramel.  Big sweets that do not overpower or take away from the rest of the gang.  
Feel:  Creamy and smooth in the box.  Texturally superior to many top shelf imperial stouts and RISs.  
Overall -  Maybe not as thick as BCBS, but up there in terms of love and goodness.  A top competitor.  I am glad I have another bottle. 727 charactersmabermud, Nov 28, 2015

Black, almost no head on it.  Aroma somehow gets over the coffee in your face of the base version and gives it some bourbon to wrap your head around.  
Taste, a creamy smoothness over the pungent coffee and roast that the base version has going for it. The barrel seems to mellow this out with a dallop of bourbon along with it. Drinks pretty damn effortlessly with the coconut and vanilla. Caramel and marshmellow sweetness. Warming alcohol is nicely displayed, far from harsh or distracting. Chocolate is there, right in the middle of it all. The coffee is nowhere near as huge as in the base version, the bourbon character kind of forces that to the side a little bit.   
Carbonation is lower than regular Speedway. Toffee notes challenge caramel. Gets to be thicker and more chewy the longer you go with it. If you like coffee and bitterness, stick with the regular version, if you want some barrel, hit this up. 993 charactersrodbeermunch, Nov 26, 2015

Finally decided to crack this bottle after holding on to it for a year. Regular Speedway is one of my favorites and readily available year-round in my area. So I was really looking forward to this variation.
Look: Jet black with barely any head after pouring.
Smell: Dominant Bourbon with some toasted coconut and coffee.
Taste: Again Bourbon dominates, especially after the coffee has receded, 2 years past bottling. But that's fine with me. I love the Bourbon barrel effect on big stouts, especially from breweries that know how to use the barrel properly...and AleSmith does!
Highly recommended if you can find a bottle.
Still holding onto a BA Speedway w/Vietnamese Coffee. Looking forward to comparing it to this one. 743 charactersDonco, Nov 26, 2015

Pours a rich a lusciously smooth dark brown/black with a thin layer of light brown foam.
Deeply roasted malt, coffee has faded slightly but still detectable, sweet vanilla, and subtle bourbon heat.
Subtle coffee notes, roasty, oak, vanilla, and gentle warming bourbon.
Heavy-bodied, low carbonation, chewy, silky smooth, and roasty.
Overall, age definitely lessened the coffee aroma and flavor, but two years turned this into a creamy smooth sipper, and a damn tasty one at that. 524 characterslarryarms847, Oct 24, 2015

Appearance is perfect. Tight little bubbles, even on my second night (I was not dumb enough to attempt the whole thing on a Wednesday night).
Smell is bourbon and dark malts. The coffee's almost gone, but I never knew it so can't feel too sad.
Taste  starts malty sweet then goes bourbon then vanilla then perfect coffee bitterness mixing with roasted malt and residual bourbon fumes then drying roast then I instantly want another drink.
And it's slick, and carbed enough to stay a little tingly on the tongue...Wow.
It's kbs with more horsepower. Watch out! 671 charactersbennyman12, Oct 09, 2015

Smell: Smells of dark coffee roast and bourbon (if you are one of those beersnobs that seek out BA beers, but complain that it smells and taste of too much bourbon, dont drink this, and better yet, why are you seeking out BA beers, I see this too often)
Taste: Bourbon and coffee, slight butterscotch and vanilla, then roast and bourbon again. I have a lot of Favorite tasting beers, but this one takes the cake on my favorite beer when it comes to the bourbon characteristics in it. 
Mouthfeel: full bodied velvety greatness
Overall: This is a perfect imperial coffee stout aged in bourbon barrels. Perfect in every catagory. 667 charactersAB_Inbev, Sep 29, 2015

4.43/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Impressive looking brew: dark, nearly black, with a solid cream head with excellent retention, and leaving flat fields of lacing.
Aroma is equally impressive, layering bitter chocolate and coffee against a smooth bourbon undertone.
Flavor follows, with a hint of butterscotch (surely from the bourbon choice) both in the front third and on the back end. Bourbon is both a significant complement to the overall profile and perfectly restrained. Less coffee presence than in the base brew, but the massive, chocolatey, roasty malt shines through cleanly and strongly.
Incredibly smooth; absolutely unbelievable presence for 12% and BA. Thick, viscous, impressively mild on the palate. 685 charactersRoguer, Sep 17, 2015

Black, oily and thick, dark brown head on it, pretty cool looking like chocolate milk.  Bottles seemed thicker.  Aroma hits bourbon and heavy roast, the coffee is subdued compared to the non barrel aged bottles.  
Smoother and creamier than the pungent coffee you get out of the base version, even when uber fresh.  Vanilla and coconut can be picked up in the smallest way.  Its warming.  Mild chocolate.  
Toffee and caramel in the mouthfeel.  Always a treat. 545 charactersraiderandbeerfan, Sep 10, 2015

Had this for the first time last night in a sours and stouts tasting, and I was not disappointed (I didn't have to pay for it). Completely opaque, delightfully thick, and absolutely delicious. Naturally dark, nice barrel notes with a hint of coffee and vanilla. Feel was a bit thin and the carbonation was more prominent relative to other ba stouts. The tasting also featured Peche Mortel, Vanilla Shake, KBS, and gold wax Assassin. This was my third favorite stout after SR-71 and Assassin. It just nudged out the KBS, which is a very similar beer. 562 charactersdurlta, Aug 23, 2015
4.54/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Serving Type: Bottle (2015 vintage)
Consumed: 8.21.15
A: 4.75 Pours pitch black, looking very thick out the bottle. The dark tan head is dense, has good retention (about two minutes), and leaves little lace.
S: 4.5 The coffee in this beer, like most speedway stouts, isn’t as in-your-face as other coffee stouts. Instead, it plays more of a supporting role to aromas that are largely dominated by bourbon and vanilla. Char, molasses, and roasted malt also come through early, with dark coffee lingering on the finish.
T: 4.5 Taste is similar to the nose, but a bit harsher until the beer warms to 55 or 60 degrees. Flavors start sweet with lots of chocolate, vanilla, maple syrup, caramel, and dark cherries. The bourbon mixes in throughout the experience until moving on to mild coffee, roasted malt, and more vanilla on the slightly bitter finish.
M: 4.75 The body is rich, creamy, and very satisfying and the carbonation is also near perfect. The only minor flaw is that the finish is slightly too dry.
O: 4.5 Another excellent variation on one of the best coffee stouts out there. This beer is not as coffee forward as BCBCS, but still special in that it lets the barrel shine a bit more. I was hoping this would be indistinguishable from BAVSS, but, while still excellent, it does lack something that puts it just a notch below in my book. 1,351 charactersTele, Aug 22, 2015

4.49/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52013 bottle. The coffee has definitely faded. I don't get much on the aroma or the taste, but that's about the only negative thing I can say about this beer. I've been drinking a lot of boozy barrel aged stouts recently and I'm getting a little fed up with the style, but this was an awesome beer and my recent experiences should substantiate this review. The aroma is rich bourbon with vanilla, caramel, oak, and chocolate. The flavor is thick and rich dark chocolate and toffee. It's sweet, but not cloying. The dry oak really helps to add balance, and the base stout is not without roast and some smokiness. If I work at it, I can get some dark fruit, maybe prunes or raisins candied with brown sugar. There is some molasses as well, but the highlight is the rich dark chocolate, bourbon soaked brownie. The mouth feel is medium to full. It leaves nice lacing on the glass and some coating in the mouth. Overall it reminds me of Cycle Wednesday which is one of my highest rated beers. I think it would be a different beer fresh, but fresh is not always best. 1,061 charactersdanh53, Aug 10, 2015

Heavy bourbon on the nose.  Some coffee and chocolate.  Wish the bourbon was 1 order of magnitude less as it drowns out everything else.
Taste is bourbon and chocolate.  Coffee, vanilla, and cream.  Oak around the edges.  Sweet brown sugar and dark molasses.
Rich, creamy mouth feel.  Medium carbonation.  Oily.  Flavors linger.  
A really excellent barrel aged stout.  Boozy and full of bourbon.  Wouldn't mind seeing a boost in coffee flavor and aroma. 603 charactersleroybrown10, Jul 31, 2015

This poured black with a minimal head that retreated to a fine bubble rim. Once it warmed, the malts and bourbon barrel supplied a wonderfully balanced nose. Similar with the taste, everything came through in a balanced way. All the components - coffee, bourbon, dark roasted malts, a tad hop bite - were there but not singlely overpowering. No noticeable booze.oferate to high viscosity.
This was a very well crafted beer. Right up my alley. It is worth hassle, fo sho. 541 charactersmacher0, Jul 22, 2015

Bottled on 10/30/13.
Pours opaque black with a 1/4 inch brown head that quickly disappears completely, leaving almost no lace.
The smell is of dark chocolate, pipe tobacco, black cherry, vanilla, prunes and a hint of sweet bourbon. 
The taste is of dark chocolate, various dark fruits, oak and subtle sweet bourbon on the finish. 
The texture is heavy bodied, thick and viscous with low carbonation. 
They took a world-class imperial stout and aged it in bourbon barrels with impressive results. 529 charactersFurlinator, Jun 09, 2015

4.19/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Bottle shared by Curran last night. '13 vintage.
This one pours an inky black, with barely and head or lacing.
This one smells like creamy coffee, a bit of chocolate, bourbon, and the slightest amount of soy sauce.
This is quite sweet, definitely sweeter than regular Speedway, but it's not so much of a detriment. There is a very creamy coffee flavor, a bit of vanilla, some dark fruits, and a good amount of vanilla. No real roasty character, which would've been nice to balance out the barrel sweetness. Luckily the sweet flavors are tasty anyway so it's not too much of a knock.
This is medium bodied, could be slightly thicker, but still pretty full bodied anyway. There's a very low level of carbonation. Very drinkable.
This isn't quite an improvement on regular Speedway, at least the '13 vintage isn't at this age, but it's still a well crafted barrel aged stout from one of the masters of stouts. 911 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 18, 2015

Poura a completely black color, with nearly no head at all.
Has the most distinctive Bourbon barrel presence, I have yet experienced. Despite the Bourbon dominance, coffee cuts through easily among a huge amount of wood, as well as scorched, earthy malts. Hints of molasses remind me of this being a stout, setting the balance, but nothing more, this beer is focused on its warming coffee Bourbon blend. 
Drinks throughout smooth, perfectly fitting for the full body of the beer to unfold.
Not only becomes the Bourbon recognizable on the palate very early, the oaky barrel quality seemingly stands out on itself, blending perfectly into earthy, pleasantly bitter coffee beans. As on the nose, there is a certain, almost sticky sweetness detectable in the beer, but only as a neccesary counterpart to the fiery  Bourbon coffee melange, adding toffee, cocoa nibs and fudge to the blend. Liquor heat gets perfectly wrapped up by the coffee, with a sweeter, slick finish, turning into a chocolate direction at the very end, accompanied by vanilla, booze and earthy ground coffee - revealing throughout a fantastic flavour variety.
Impressive beer, huge, bold, focused, while leaving enough space  on the palate to exhibit an intriguing depth. Pretty much focused on coffee and Bourbon, with a mousse au chocolate creamy nouthfeel to it, providing oak, heat, fudge and gourmet coffee. 1,433 charactersaleigator, May 02, 2015

A: Mocha tan head formed and quickly receded into the beer, leaving behind a ring of dense head on the edge and a dusting on top. The beer is nearly opaque black but on further examination there is some brownish hues that shine through with good clarity. longer sustaining legs kick up when swirled.
S: Big, distinct aroma leaps out of the glass at serving temperature. Sweet caramel, maple syrup, bourbon, tobacco, vanilla and raisins that have been burnt to the bottom of the pan. Vanilla oak aroma comes through very natural with more forward sweet bourbon. Cold coffee is restrained, but a sweet milk chocolate and mild roast character come through.
T: Very natural assimilation of beer and barrel - The (not overly) sweet caramel, toffee flavor in the beginning blends seemlessly to a vanilla and coconut oaky flavor that seems so part of the beer I can’t imagine it with out it. The dark chocolate and cocoa flavors that come next provide a mild roasty-ness giving the impression of bitterness (along with the barrel tannins) that - again go very natural with the overall flavor of the beer. The beer finishes out with a tobacco and bourbon sweetness that rests on your tongue minutes after your last sip - making you remember how good the previous one was. The balance is perfectly between the barrel and the dark and caramel malts. The beer is on the sweeter side but in a very pleasant way.
M: Moderate alcohol warming in the chest with a numbing sensation in the cheeks from the bourbon. A full body with medium-low carbonation and a slight creaminess. A sticky sensation rests on the tongue like after having a mouth full of maple syrup.
O: One of those beers you’ll remember long after the bottle is empty. I’m glad to have been lucky enough to have tried this amazing beer. This is a great example of a beer that was designed from the beginning to with the end product in mind. I’ve had many BA stouts where the brewery just through it in a barrel and it just didn’t blend well with the ingredients - this is not that beer. Get this beer if you can. Cheers! 2,102 charactersguityler83, Mar 26, 2015

Review #1000
Dark brown/black appearance. Oily and slick but thinner than anticipated. The liquid was topped by a creamy, frothy, one-finger tall, mocha colored head that faded to a thick, bubbly ring. Blocks of drippy lacing trickled down the glass.
Boozy, bourbon-y notes came through strong in the aroma. Pure bourbon. Loads of vanilla and tannins. Oaky and dry but also slightly sweet. Touch of maple. The nose seemed a bit muted initially and contained no coffee whatsoever, but it improved greatly as the beer warmed. Sweet, brown sugar notes came forth, along with more maple, vanilla and oak. Touch of bakers chocolate and dark roast coffee. The vanilla continued to become more intense with time.
Bourbon notes dominated in the flavor profile as well. Vanilla and coconut came through super strong. Dark malts were noticeable. Slightly roasty. There was a subtle brown sugar and maple syrup-like sweetness. Good dose of caramel and toffee. Bakers chocolate was apparent. Perhaps some chocolate brownies as well. Bourbon flavors came through strong again in the dry, oaky and tannic finish. Surprisingly, the alcohol heat was actually quite restrained. Moderately roasty. Like in the nose, the coffee presence was undetectable.
The mouthfeel was lighter bodied for the style. A bit too frothy and bubbly. The carbonation settled down with time, but the body still seemed rather thin.
AleSmith's Speedway Stout was the first beer I reviewed on Beeradvocate, so it was only fitting that review number 1000 would be the bourbon barrel-aged version. Although I was a bit letdown by both offerings, I am grateful to have had the opportunity to enjoy so many great beers with friends and family over the years. 1,835 charactersDamian, Mar 03, 2015

The aroma is big of chunky chocolate, umami, heavy roast, slight bourbon sweetness. 
The flavor follows with sweet chocolate up front, some umami, and bitterness throughout. Coffee lingers on the palate. The bourbon is quite slight, but offers lots of vanilla. Great carbonation with a creamy flavor and mouthfeel.
An extremely balanced barrel aged brew, but could use a touch more barrel character. Still one of the best BA stouts around. 527 charactersdar482, Feb 24, 2015

A- Pitch black pour to a snifter with a small brown head. Frothy cap has decent retention but eventually dies completely. Sticky legs but rare lace.
S- Barrels rather prominent atop the big warm base stout. Bourbon whiskey smoothed out with caramel and peppery notes. Coffee muted a bit from that with cocoa in there as well.
T- Lots of Bourbon but it has a very high quality whiskey feel. Pepper, vanilla, semi fresh woody oak, dark figs and charred wood. Coffee and cocoa are big and support the barrel with the dark stuff.
MF- Thick body but a tiny bit thinned from the extra bourbon. Carbonation just below medium with a heat on the back end. A little bit creamy but could be more for the flavors.
Very nice Bourbon barrel meets the classic coffee imperial stout. Amazing flavor from the oak and whiskey. Decadent cocoa, coffee and vanilla oak. Probably the best beer of an insane weekend of tasting. 999 characterscbutova, Jan 16, 2015

Appearance:  A semi-hard pour whips up a frothy mocha head that leaves a nice webby pattern of lace; the remaining liquid is black with just a hint of chocolate brown at the edge
Smell:  Chocolate cake and caramel, with subtle hints of Bourbon, vanilla and coffee
Taste:  Rich chocolate cake flavor, up front, with caramel and Bourbon tones developing; coffee and vanilla arrive to add complexity to the finish
Mouthfeel:  Thick mouthfeel, with low carbonation; some warmth from the ABV
Overall:  As I tasted this beer I was thinking it must have a few years on it, as I didn't notice, at first, the year emblazoned on the image of the barrel; I generally like my BA beers to have a year or two of age on them to settle down their aggressive elements and to add complexity; the problem, here, however, is that you surrender the coffee influence when you age the beer; still, a very nice beer but I think I prefer the non-BA coffee variants better 965 charactersbrentk56, Jan 04, 2015

I love the way it feels, with all this body and slickness, despite being a palate coater. great great beer overall, I would love to try some of the other variants they do with it.
edit. this is elegant for its size, and i develop a new appreciation for it every time i get the pleasure of drinking it. head and shoulders better than many of its peers! 1,381 charactersStonedTrippin, Nov 30, 2014

A: Pours pure black with 1 finger of khaki head that reduces slows and leaves a thin collar throughout the glass. Viscosity seems to be thick, but a little shy of what I was expecting for the ABV. 
S: I mainly get coffee, bourbon, and chocolate. Aroma is very pleasant, much improved over the regular Speedway, which was extremely dominant in coffee. 
T: As a bourbon fan, this flavor speaks to me quite nicely. The barrel aging has done this beer wonders, as the bourbon flavor is very present and adds a much needed compliment to the strong coffee presence. I also get chocolate and roasted malt. 
M: Feel is thick and smooth, carbed well, leaving a slightly dry aftertaste which I attribute to the coffee. Lingering feel is dry with the compliments of coffee and bourbon. 
O: This beer is a great barrel aged stout that gets lost in a very popular category. I love how strong the bourbon and chocolate come forward to bring a needed balance to the coffee. 988 charactersroger617, Oct 31, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%Wow, this beer is so thick it could paint walls a nice toasty brown color.  It is very complex with many flavors going on.  I especially like the dark roast coffee flavors I get with the smooth yet potent bourbon flavor that warms you right up.  I couldn't drink more than one in one sitting, it is definitely a sipping beer but quite enjoyable. 345 charactersLisaBarker, Oct 24, 2014

4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Opened this bottle as part of a small tasting with friends because there's something about a $40+ bottle of beer that makes it seem anticlimactic to open by yourself. I don't remember seeing if there was a bottling date, but this particular bottle is of the 2014 vintage. Poured into a Belgian-style tulip glass.
Appearance (4.5) - Poured with some vigor, since I know barrel-aged beers have a tendency to lose their ability to generate much head, and I'm rewarded with a finger and a half of dark cocoa colored foam. Several of the smaller bubbles immediately start to expand, giving it a spongy appearance until it dissipates to a film of intermittent foam and ringlet. Some sticky, thin swaths of lace adorn the sides of the glass.
Smell (4.5) - A wonderful collection of aromas, with the roasted malt and bourbon taking the lead, but in a well-blended way that makes them seem like a single aromatic note. I'm a little dismayed at the lack of coffee presence--it's there, but muscled out of the picture by the much more prevalent notes of vanilla, caramel, bourbon and oak. It's honestly hard to distinguish the more bitter roasted malt notes from the coffee notes. That said, I cannot dock it too much, as the smell is still wonderful. Maybe my favorite element of this beer.
Taste (4.25) - As with the smell, the coffee takes a back seat to the barrel characteristics, with sweet booze and really nice notes of caramel and toffee blending with the grain to produce the sensation of kind of a granola bar dipped in bittersweet chocolate and drizzled with a ribbon of caramel. The only negative--and it's hardly one at all--I can say is that I wish it were a bit more overt. It's impressive that AleSmith could make such a big, bold style, with lots of flavors going on, and blend it into a nice, smooth-drinking beer, but I like my BA stouts to be a little more aggressive.
Feel (4.5) - There is a nice full-bodied nature to this, in spite of being (I believe) 100% barrel-aged. The carbonation is moderate to low--just enough to prevent the sweet viscosity of the body from becoming cloying or smothering.
Overall (4.5) - A wonderful beer that I'm glad to have tried, and one that I would recommend to anyone who hasn't had it, price tag be damned. That said, the price is prohibitive for repeat purchases, because if I'm paying that kind of price for a bottle, it needs to be one of the best beers I've ever tasted to warrant a return purchase. And it's a well enough made beer that for some, it could very well be just that. But not for me. As such, I will just tip my cap to AleSmith and say "stout well done". 2,624 charactersLambicPentameter, Oct 13, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750 mL bottle into an Alesmith sample glass. Not sure of the vintage, as the bottled on date is smudged, but I think it's a 2010. Thank you Kevin for this one!
Pours a thick, inkjet, oily body with a 3 finger milk chocolate colored head that reduces fairly quickly to leave a ring of retention. 
Smell is inviting and potent - vanilla bean, heavy dark fruit, bourbon, some mustyness (I'm assuming from the age), milk chocolate, some booze in the background. 
First thing to hit the tongue is sweet butterscotch, vanilla, sugar cookie, followed by milk chocolate, bitter roasted coffee, with a super charred, roasty malt aftertaste that sticks around for a while. Thick, rich, heavy body with low carbonation. 
Very nice, super tasty, rich, complex, and balanced while hitting all the good flavor points of a barrel aged stout. Highly recommendable! 866 charactersgcamparone, Oct 11, 2014

The smell is nicely balanced between the bourbon and coffee aromas. The taste is good, chocolate, coffee and subtle vanilla bourbon notes. The feel is slick and oily, pretty heavy as well. Overall it's a great variant of the Speedway series. 302 charactersKnapp85, Sep 29, 2014
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%March 2013 bottle. Still pretty darn hot, and I generally don't mind the bourbon heat. The coffee is still super strong, and the best part of the beer for me. I prefer the base Speedway to be honest. This one doesn't stack up to a fresh Bourbon County, and it pails in comparison to a BC Coffee. Too hot, still. It's very good, but considering how easy it is to get the regular Speedway in my area, I doubt I'll make a huge effort to find this one again when the regular is $12 a 750ml. 486 charactersJonnyBeers, Sep 28, 2014

Aroma is huge chocolate, smoky charred oak, coffee, roasted malt, bourbon, vanilla, caramel, and more bourbon.
Taste is likewise chock-full of bourbon, caramel, vanilla, coffee, chocolate, molasses, charred wood, and dark bitter roasted malt. Wowee zowee, this beer is full of flavor. Nice warming heat on the finish, like a good whisky.
Mouthfeel is slick and coating, lingering.
Overall an outstanding barrel-aged imperial stout. I wish I could try all my favorites side by side, but this one is blowing me away. Difficult to imagine how it could be much better. 687 charactersdraheim, Aug 26, 2014

A dessert beer with decent complexity. 278 charactersptykozoon, Jul 26, 2014

4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 3 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Barrel aged Speedway Stout. With Speedway Stout as awesome as it stands, I just hope this doesn't become like putting spinning rims on a Bentley. On-tap at 38 Degrees, on to the beer:
Black as ink in a glass with no head on the pour. Ok, next aspect. Whew! That is a beauty to smell! The liquor makes its mark first, and not far behind are generous doses of molasses, pleasant booze, coffee, and maple. 
The journey continues, and somehow it manages to be better than an already aromatic orgasm. Not only is Barrel Aged Sppedway complex, but flavorful and incredibly smooth at the highest level, aspects which are very difficult to pull off in a single beer. There's a mood elevating licorice and maple towards the start. A little roast breaks into the mold. Warm booze pleasanty compliments the journey while much of it is disguised. It all works together. Adding to the moment is a full bodied figure where the carbonation is not too weak or strong and overall very smooth.
How did AleSmith do it?! Taking an already outstanding beer and making it more succulent and smooth is a difficult feat, but it has been pulled off. Well worth the praise it has earned over the years. 1,179 charactersDoubleJ, Jun 30, 2014

3.98/5  rDev -11%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Despite the hefty price tag, I was excited to obtain a bottle of this so I could try what is a very highly rated beer. When I initially tried regular Speedway Stout, I was somewhat underwhelmed when comparing to other coffee stouts. The same is true with the barrel aged version. It was a really good beer but not up to par with some of the better barrel aged coffee stouts out there. At $40 a bottle, this is one that I probably won't seek out again although I was happy to be able to try it.
The beer pours a thick, opaque black with little head. The smell is a sweet mix of bourbon and coffee. My issue with the taste (just as with regular Speedway) is that the coffee seems rather rash and isn't smoothly integrated into the rest of the beer. Maybe with some age this would mellow out. Otherwise, the bourbon taste is very enjoyable and overall the beer has a sweetness that is similar other big stouts. 908 charactersmjpolzin, Jun 29, 2014

Aroma is barrel forward with bourbon and wood along with some cherry chocolate, vanilla and toffee. Richer chocolate through a fresh top off/cap of foam. Notes of ethanol are present yet more intriguing than insultive in a cognac sense and quite welcome.
Tastes of chocolate liqueur, Sabra in a sense, at least the way it used to be :) Rich yet not too rich and with light chocolate and just a hint of roast. Sweet yet not too sweet. Bready chocolate and spice on the moderately lingering finish. Overall very intriguing and I have a few more. 693 charactersHalfFull, Jun 26, 2014

Great depth of RIS dark fruits, rich coffee in the back ground with the fruits, huge barrel sweetness, vanilla cream, oak and whiskey-caramel.  Drinks incredibly smooth, full, and soft.  
Outstanding beer, one of the best.
Fresh 2014
Pours as dark as the base - incredibly creamy mocha head for a BA beer. Oak barrel dominates - vanilla, some graham cracker. Dark roasted coffee, roasted malts, some dark fruits from the coffee, bakers cocoa. Flavor is full and finish is long, dry and roasty with a booze kick. Pronounced oaky vanilla in the taste. Do not get much bourbon, just oak barrel and it works very well. As it warms up more sweet barrel nuances come out.
Great stuff. This has been a personal whale for a while 873 characterstimc100, Jun 14, 2014

12% ABV, Bottled on 10/30/13
A - Pitch black through and through, Barrel-Aged Speedway Stout generates a mocha head worthy of praise and keeps it's loose form very nicely!
S - Charred bourbon oak stave swirls smoky nuances and alcohol heat into the thick, chocolaty aroma complimented by medium roast coffee notes and crumbled honey graham crackers.
T - Rich milk chocolate washes over the tongue with robust presence while toting cocoa and mocha dryness, faint coffee undertones, and a warming vanilla bourbon note that punctuates the finish with lightly charred, smoky oak!
M - Heavy and full-bodied, AleSmith's barrel-aged Speedway Stout pulls no punches in the mouthfeel department. This thick and rich beer delivered the exact body I was expecting; creamy, smooth, and moderately sweet with a finish of warm alcohol that dries the palate out for a sort of balance.
O - After my first three failed attempts at the newly released barrel variants (read: price &gt; quality) of AleSmith here in Wisconsin, I was pretty weary of dropping nearly $40 on this bottle, but I've heard amazing things time and time again, for years no less. Of the four I've experienced, I'm happy to say, this bottle is the closest to being worthy of it's extraordinary dollar demand, though probably more than I'd pay for it again.
Barrel-Aged Speedway Stout is rich with chocolate intricacies but nearly devoid of coffee nuances; perhaps from it's age? It just became available here. Either way, it mimics the others regarding its apparent time in the barrels: short. Not boozy in the least, its robust, full body is demanding of attention but, it screams by like a race car; gone in a flash. Delicious as all hell, this lifts the beer that's aged in the bourbon barrel on a higher pedestal than the barrel its aged in while making both complimentary. Bravo, AleSmith! 1,898 charactersBeerFMAndy, May 21, 2014

A- pours pitch black with a small foamy dark tan head that has decent retention and alcohol legs upon agitation
S- big bourbony barrel notes up front with strong notes of vanilla, sweet caramel, dark chocolate mixed with dark roast coffee and sweet caramel malt
T- sweet and malty caramel malt meshes with big oaky vanilla and bourbon flavors, sweet dark cherry kicks in mid-palate along with melted milk chocolate and caramel, finishing with a hint of coffee with more chocolate and bourbon
M- medium body with low carbonation, slightly syrupy but quite smooth mouthfeel
O- this beer is pure bliss, the layers that the bourbon barrel adds can be savored for hours. Seek this one out. 729 charactersTreyliff, Apr 30, 2014

This is the exception to the rule.
A perfect mix of booze notes and oak are laid into this great stout.
This stout without the BB is good. It is now awesome! 346 charactersSandbarunner, Apr 26, 2014

App- pitch black body, one finger large bubbly mocha head with great retention. Thin splotches of lacing all over. Looks fantastic. 
Smell- Oak, sweet bourbon dominate. As it warms, more of the base coffee stout that I know and love come out. Roast, coffee, milk chocolate. Remains a strong and bourbon barrel-forward nose. 
Flavour- Barrel-forward. Much more so than I would have imagined. Oak, sweet bourbon, sweet charcoal smoke, vanilla. Really good stuff. Warming up brings out more of the coffee but it's nowhere near as coffee forward as BCBCS fresh. More milk chocolate sweetness, some roast malts. No oxidation.
Mouthfeel- Slick, thick bodied and super creamy. Good carbonation for the style. A nice sweet bourbon mixed in with a bit of bitter coffee makes the finish a delicious one. No heat at all. Just a lot of bourbon flavour but without the ABV.
Overall- A very nice drinking barrel forward beer with a year on it. Highly recommend, though I prefer the Vietnamese version to this one as there is a lot less coffee in the barrel-aged version. Looking forward to trying a fresher version sometime soon, which apparently has more coffee to balance out the bourbon barrel contribution. 1,345 charactersStevedore, Mar 15, 2014
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Thanks so much to the regular folks at Provisions for pouring this at the Cantillon tasting during SF Beer Week! Poured out of a 750ml bottle into a 6oz tulip glass. 3oz pour, too - about the right size needed for a basic evaluation.
Holy crap, that's a sludgy looking beer. Very, very viscous, with a blackened appearance with a mahogany tinted head that rises above in a creamy, decadent manner about a finger's worth, only to die down and fizzle into a modest ring with some superb bubbles laying at the top for quite some time. Looks a lot like other bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts that I've seen in the past, but it's definitely far more on the syrupy, fortified wine looking variety rather than the standard appearance that others (somehow) retain. A memorable first encounter, that's for sure!
Smells pretty good - almost in the same vein (if not *exactly* in the same vein) as Dark Horse's BBPT5. Big dark fruit notes, ranging from raisins to prunes to blackcurrant (with a little bit of dark cherry pits, maybe kirsch) thrown in, sprawled underneath huge notes of bourbon, imparting burnt toffee, butterscotch, brown sugar, and cinnamon. Peppery at the finish, with some roasted chocolate and coffee notes, but surprisingly subdued - perhaps the most subdued Speedway is at compared to the regular release and all of its coffee specific variants. Contains a brief port-like sweetness, but otherwise quite restrained and bountiful when it comes to the plethora of fruit, bourbon sugary notes, and roasted, bitter nuances at the back. Awesome stuff!
This is where beer makes its mark, and while it's quite solid and memorable for what it strives to do, especially in delivering the dark fruits and sugary bourbon goodness to the mix. Big notes of dark cherries, raisins, prunes (port comes to mind, once again), with a red wine grape sweetness that surprisingly comes through - perhaps the oak tannins are fooling my taste buds? Still, the fruits are awash with big bourbon flavors, ranging from vanilla to brown sugar, from burnt toffee to caramel. Molasses are huge at the middle, and the end continues some strong leathery and tobacco notes from the oak. Sweet, but finishes far more on the roasted side, imparting the ground espresso and chocolate that regular Speedway usually puts me head over heels. Syrupy, though, and could use more carbonation, as well as more balanced from the roasted conditions of the base beer. The bourbon isn't particularly overpowering, however, and it tastes a little duller as this warms up. Definitely complex, but loses a lot of gas, somehow. Definitely delicious in many respects.
For how difficult this is to obtain, however, it's definitely not the most recommended priority to chase after in the category of bourbon barrel aged imperial stouts. Parabola and KBS are far easier to find, and impart a lot more of the roasted notes that I prefer in these types of beers as they help cut down the bourbon sweetness substantially well. Somehow, this is lacking here, and I really did expect a lot more given the phenomenal base beer that Speedway is. Worth trying, but don't necessarily break your back trying to get one. 3,174 charactersmagictacosinus, Mar 13, 2014

The other best beer in the world would be Parabola by Firestone Walker.
This beer is pure flippin Bliss from start to finish. It is thick, rich, complex, smells fantastic, tastes fantastic, pours fantastic, smooth and just nothing at all bad that can be said about it at all...and I mean absolutely nothing!!!
Unfortunately for all of us, it is in extremely limited supply. Finding a bottle will be difficult. I would suggest doing whatever you can to get one (yes even if it costs $100...it is seriously worth it) If you do find one, I'm not sure you want to share even a drop of it...yeah it's that good. On the other hand, other people have got to experience this so you almost need close friends to taste it so you can forever brag about you giving them a sip of it....but really it's tough because you want to drink it all yourself.
I leave the decision up to you.
I drank every drop of mine...and told my buddies where they could get it that day...it was gone the next day...too bad for them!!! 1,246 charactersBelchmaster, Feb 23, 2014

A- Jet black. No carbonation. The bottle cap wanted to come right off. No lacing. 
S- Burnt wood, burnt toffee, dark chocolate; bourbon is muted melded in the back. 
T- It tastes oxidized a bit. The bourbon is so mellowed out, and I think the lack of carbonation may have been from a slight air pathway in the bottle cap. 
M- Very smooth, but no carbonation hurts this. Probably tastes like a new bottle where the lid has been off for a year in the fridge. 
O- I was hoping for an epic experience with this rare bottle, instead I got a flat BA stout. I have had the '12, and I know how good this can be. 657 charactersgueuzedreg, Jan 05, 2014

Pours pitch black along with what looked like some coffee grinds, and a one finger mocha head. Aroma is bourbon, coffee, vanilla, roast, some chocolate, oak, light anise. Flavor is bourbon up front, light roast, vanilla, anise, chocolate, sweetness, more vanilla. Comes in waves, with that bourbon first then the layers of roast and sweetness. Much sweeter than the regular version, and I like it. Silky smooth, relatively thick mouthfeel, low+ carbonation. Sweet bourbon coats the palate and warms the throat. 592 charactersBMMillsy, Dec 08, 2013

A- Pours a pitch black with a slight milky mocha head that leaves some spotty lacing.
S- Dark chocolate, espresso, integrated bourbon, vanilla, some booze, decent aroma strength.
T- Creamy chocolate, espresso, vanilla extract, slight rubbing alcohol, finishes with more bourbon and espresso. Not nearly as good as I remember the '09 tasting, booze could have been integrated a little bit more and I get a hint of rubbing alcohol that is slightly off putting. Overall pretty good but was expecting slightly better.
M- Medium bodied for a barrel-aged stout, low carbonation but fitting for abv, slight alcohol burn.
O- Barrel-aged Speedway is easily a world class beer however there were some very slight off-putting alcohol flavors that I didn't remember it having when I tasted the '09 at a bottle share. This leads me to believe that this beer improves with a few years on it, developing more of a smoothness. 1,030 charactersjaasen64, Nov 29, 2013

Huge bourbon notes, followed by sweet chocolate cake with a bit of coffee roast notes and hints of dark fruit, raw oak, vanilla, a touch of roasted malt. This is decadent, complex, and luscious. The most prominent aromas as bourbon and rich chocolate, and they intermingle perfectly. It's got a perfect level of carbo that decreases to a nice smooth, silky satin as the beer warms. 
Really, the only thing that might improve the beer is a bolder coffee presence, but that's about it. 567 charactersRollzroyce21, Oct 14, 2013

How many huge beers can we try in a night? This one pours a very deep and very dark black-brown topped by a nice finger of sandstone foam. The nose comprises cheaper whiskey, roasted malts, mild coffee, and a light dusting of cocoa powder. The taste brings in more of the same, with the whiskey still riding tall in the saddle, but not quite as roughshod over the roast and coffee as before. Moreover, a stronger undercurrent of oak worms its way underneath the proceedings. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a fluid feel. Overall, a solid barrel-aged stout, though not quite as good as the base would indicate. If anything, I'd take the normal, everyday Speedway over this most days of the week. That said, it's still pretty good, just not nearly as good as its current reputation would suggest. 850 charactersTMoney2591, Sep 28, 2013

A: Great looking pour! For a beer of this size that spent awhile in barrels, I can't believe the head retention on the beer. Pour is pitch black with the nice, lasting, mocha colored head. Exactly how a stout should look.
S: Huge aroma. Espresso beans, vanilla, coconut, brown sugar, bourbon, and dark chocolate. A very appetizing and complex aroma. There are some aromatic qualities that remind me of a big English Barleywine.
T: Taste hits dark chocolate upfront and is quickly followed by vanilla and coconut. You then pick up on the clear bourbon presence, but this is smoothed out by roasted coffee beans on the finish. 
M: Velvety smooth. One of my favorite aspects of the non barrel aged Speedway is the mouthfeel, and this one is only enhanced by the barrel treatment. 
O: Great beer. I'm incredibly grateful that I got to try this one. One of the better examples of a barrel aged stout you will find. KBS is one of my favorite beers and this gives it a huge run for its money. 1,040 charactersdbc5, Sep 12, 2013

A - Pitch black (as it should be). Light mocha head leaves nice lacing.
S - Big coconut and vanilla, dark dried cherry, chocolate. A little booze
T - Follows nose. Big coconut and vanilla, but the dried cherry and blueberry comes thru nicely. As well as a dark chocolate note, especially on the finish. Not overly sweet, actually finishes pretty dry. Booze definitely present, but not overwhelming. Don't get really any coffee.
M - Big and chewy. Low carbonation, which fits this style. Really nice.
O - Big fan. My favorite of the Speedway variations that I have had so far. Had this on cask at Churchill's before, and the bottled version is everything I remember. Fantastic! 750 charactersjeff1973, Sep 02, 2013

Described as "premium bourbon barrels," I assume the heat to be more linked to the type of bourbon versus the actual heat from the alcohol. As it warms the nuances begin to attract versus detract. Sadly, I can barely taste the coffee. This being a strong point in the base beer makes this the most disappointing part of this beer. I can't complain too much because the rest of the beer is great. Mouthfeel and smell are close to being spot on. I'm just wishing there was a bit more coffee. 545 charactersPlinyBeMiney, Aug 16, 2013

2009 Vintage
Pours a dark dark brown almost black color with no light penetration, small light brown head, fades at a decent rate, not much lacing on the glass though.
Smell has a nice boozy aroma, roasted malt mixed with a woody bourbon aspect, vanilla is strong but not overwhelming to the nose, lightest touch of dark fruit.
Taste starts out with a slight alcohol bourbon burn but quickly subsides when the roasted malt, vanilla and dark fruit come into play, subtle hints of chocolate help sweeten the deal, the burn does return in the throat though, even four years of age and this is a strong beer, carbonation is perfect, medium high viscosity so there's nice coverage on the tongue without being too "chewy". 820 charactersdeltatauhobbit, Jul 20, 2013

Holy shnikeys. Smells like a liquid almond joy. Vanilla, toasted coconut, almond, maple syrup, dark chocolate. Very sweet. 
Holy shnikeys. Tastes like a liquid Heath bar. More chocolate here. Toffee, coffee beans, dark chocolate, toasted oak, vanilla bean. Sweet, delectable. Coffee is subtler than expected, but leave nice acidity on the tongue between sips. Hot damn. 
Viscous medium full body. Thick. Some peppery alcohol on the tongue. Mild, tingly carbonation. 
Deeelicious. Not much coffee left here, but I don't care. The barrels are perfect, the sweetness is perfect. I don't much care for regular Speedway, but this is among the best BA stouts I've ever tasted. 796 charactersPhelps, Jul 12, 2013

Pours out a black, oily looking liquid. Seems thinner than the regular Speedway, less tan head frothing about this is a very thin head. Aroma was the heavy, heavy roast, bourbon and coffee. Good stuff.
Taste, takes on more of a creamy smoothness moreso than the pungent coffee and roast that the base version has going for it. The barrel seems to mellow this out with a dallop of bourbon along with it. Drinks pretty damn effortlessly. Barely there coconut and vanilla. Caramel and marshmellow sweetness. Warming alcohol is nicely displayed, far from harsh or distracting. A little bit of citrus here? Huh? Its very small. Chocolate is there, right in the middle. The coffee is nowhere near as huge as in the base version, the bourbon character kind of forces that to the side a little bit. 
Carbonation is lower than regular Speedway. Toffee notes challenge caramel. Gets to be thicker and more chewy the longer you go with it. If you like coffee and bitterness, stick with the regular version, if you want some barrel, hit this up. 1,152 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jun 26, 2013

A- Black, nice light-colored head.
S- Bourbon. Honestly the aroma is pretty much all bourbon, but there is a hint of coffee in there and vanilla from the barrel notes.
T- Amazing. So smooth, everything is incredibly balanced. Main flavors are vanilla, chocolate, and bourbon. I also tasted coffee and dark chocolate in the aftertaste. I love how much the barrel-aging process has changed the base beer.
M- Very smooth, could be a little bit thicker but it drinks extremely well.
O- Just an unbelievable beer. Barrel-aged stouts are my favorite style and I can't honestly say I've had any that are better than this. It doesn't exhibit any new flavors than others that I've had, but it's so well balanced. This definitely lives up to the hype. Awesome stuff. 827 charactersAhappyhiker2, May 24, 2013

Dark coffee brown with an edge of ruby clarity... a thin pale khaki head shows minimal retention, leaving behind more legging than lacing. 
Understated coffee presence, mushy dark fruits, a touch of sweet oxidation. 
Bitter coffee is still prominent on the palate. Charred oak, vanilla and molasses, licorice and macchiato... espresso, oily coffee bean and alcohol exist in harmony. The flavors are a little muddy but the end result is something delicious. 552 charactersyamar68, May 17, 2013

Zeebra was held for the first time with lots of very very very great beers like this one. As a matter of fact the normal version of this beer was also there....
This one was poured in a Zeebra glass, a small tasting glass. I did not really know what to expect from this beer but the expectation were higher than the taste i got.
No head and no carbonation. Just a normal Imperial stout where i made the remark that this is good one for the beginners in this BA style. Not bad but i have had way better ones.... 591 charactersBrabander, May 06, 2013

5oz mini snifter
A: Pours our a really deep dark black. Basically no light getting through, but being outside and holding up to the light I do see some reddish hues. Thin layer of tan head. Sticky lacing is starting to left on the glass.
S: Woah, this nose is unreal. Mocha. Chocolate fudge. Vanilla. Oak. Roast coffee. Just epic stuff here.
T: Big Coffee up front. Then a beautiful blend of vanilla and barrel. Chocolate fudge goodness. The bourbon booze is blended in so nicely. Really no harsh notes, just some warming in the back of the throat. Even the coffee is blended superbly. Long finish with flavors dancing on the tongue.
M: Full bodied.
This is right up there for me with some of the best I have had. 738 charactersinlimbo77, Apr 22, 2013

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a dark oily hue with a thin, thin off mocha halo. Pretty solid appearance.
S - Aroma is full of nice bourbon, smooth caramel, light chocolate along with sweet malts.
T - Taste is solid with nice bourbon and chocolate notes. Still, it is a bit on the sweet/syrupy side for my liking. Very faint chocolate here as well. 
M - Mouthfeel is pretty good, creamy, but semi syrupy. 
O - Overall, a solid stout. Perhaps this was a bit too old as the sticky sweetness really took over for my taste buds. 646 charactersrudzud, Apr 12, 2013
4.28/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25On tap at Cirro's in Pacific Beach, poured into tulip
A: Jet-black, small coffee-tan head that dissipates quickly. Looks heavy and viscous, no lacing. 
S: The nose is rich boozy bourbon and dark roasted coffee. Plenty if semi-sweet chocolate aligned with the deep malt-backbone keeps things in balance. There's a bit of a rum-raisin note in between the booze and residual sugars. Did I say boozy?
T: Way more balanced than the nose lead. A balanced mixe of sweet bourbon and chocolate bounce off of roasted coffee, paprika and nutmeg. There actually a dose of hop oil in there, drying things out a bit. Long, bitter-sweet finish. 
M: Rich and chewy. Enough carbonation to keep the palate clean, but not so mich as to offset the velvety mouthfeel. 
Delicious barrel-aged brew, but grading on a curve, this isn't that big a step up from Speedway. Which isn't a bad thing, just didnt exceed my expectations. 909 charactersrand, Apr 12, 2013

Nice hit of bourbon and caramel malts in the nose, dark chocolate and some dark dried fruits. Big taste, dark chocolate, roasted caramel maltiness, bourbon-soaked oak, notes of espresso and dark dried fruits; of course no hops detectable. The base beer is already great, and this just amps it up that much more. Smooth, rich mouthfeel, full body, appropriate alcohol warmth. Exemplary bourbon-aged stout. 529 charactersRifugium, Mar 24, 2013

A- Pours pitch black with a thin khaki head that recedes to a collar, leaves spotty lacing.
S- Lots of chocolate, vanilla, bourbon and oak. There's also some dark fruit, cherry and molasses.
T- Starts out pretty sweet with lots of bourbon, vanilla, dark fruit, cherry and molasses. There are also some nice big chocolate flavors and a lot of barrel character, with oak, sweet bourbon and vanilla. The finish is delicious and long, with lingering flavors of vanilla, bourbon, oak, chocolate and fruit. Less coffee than I was expecting but that's fine, the barrel character and chocolate flavors are more than tasty enough to make up for it.
M- Full-bodied, smooth, creamy, rich and slightly sticky feel.
O- A really, really delicious stout. It's incredibly rich, decadent and complex, I've been sipping at this for hours and keep finding new flavors. The regular Speedway is a delicious beer and one of the best 750ml stouts for its price, but the BA variant is definitely my favorite. 1,067 charactersWillCarrera, Mar 14, 2013

o-disappointed some with this one. i thought the barrel treatment would mellow and enrich the body of the base beer, but it wasn't as viscous as i'd have liked it to be. i think with the bourbon and with all the coffee, there was just too much acidity; ba speedway was just a bit too astringent for my liking. 581 characterspatm1986, Mar 06, 2013

This one pours with a similar body to the regular Speedway - silky, black, and only showing some dark brown highlights at its very extremities. The tan head on this one was a bit darker than that of the original Speedway, but it dissipates much quicker also, leaving basically no lacing along the glass as it sinks down.
The aroma is as powerful as they come; it hits quickly with huge barrel qualities - soft oak and vanilla melding with a bourbon character that is slightly grainy and raw, but not quite enough to be abrasive. Some nice dark fudge rounds out the rough edges, alongside just a hint of coffee. Despite the unique coffee aroma being so strong and "out front" in the original Speedway, it's actually one of the most tame aromas in the barrel-aged version. Weird. Just from the nose, you can tell this one is gonna be a doozy. Robust bourbon, oak, and fudge stings and warms my nostrils one last time before I dive in and take my first sip...
The first thing I notice is that the body on this one is much creamier than the original Speedway - chalk that up to the barrel aging, of course. A nice mixture of bourbon and vanilla are the first things to attack the palate, with a slight bias in the bourbon direction. Again, the bourbon characteristic is more grainy and "pure" than in many other BA beers - very powerful. A strong oak presence backs the beer from nearly start to finish, with some light coconut flavors coming in at the tail end. 
There is a reasonable heat to this one, feels maybe even a bit hotter than 12% ABV, not too sure how I feel about that yet. The fudge flavors are a bit more suppressed than I anticipated, but they come out much more during the latter half of the beer, along with some very light dark fruity and anise-like sweetness, helping to cut through the bourbon heat and the bitterness from the roasted malts. The strongest flavor in the finish is the grainy bourbon and a mild fudge sweetness. Low carbonation, smooth, chewy, creamy body.
Overall, the coffee was very unnoticeable on the palate, something that I loved so much about the original Speedway. The bourbon barrel flavors were huge, but perhaps a little "too huge" for my liking, as they seemed to overshadow some of Speedways excellent qualities. Still a very delicious beer, but I'd have to take the original over this one, without question. 2,440 characterstectactoe, Feb 25, 2013

A: Pours a very dark black color with a tan head forming on the pour. It recedes quickly to thin ring that leave some minor sploches of lace behind.
S: Bourbon up fron couple with some figs and various dark fruit. Sweet barrel presence with some caraml and light vanilla. A little stone fruit sweetness with some roasted malts and chocolate.
T: The barrel is upfront with some oak and smooth bourbon. Bakers chocolate and some milk chocolate with heavy roast. I'm missing the coffee flavors from this guy, but it's still really good.
M: Silky smooth mouthfeel, medium to heavy bodied. Medium carbonation level.
O: This is definitely in the upper echelon of BA stouts. Having more coffee notes would have definitely set it apart. Still a very delicious brew that I'd love to have again. 855 charactersTreebs, Feb 14, 2013

Huge thanks to evilc for sending this bottle my way in a trade! Your awesome chris!
vintage 2012 poured into a snifter glass.
reviewed from notes taken 01/03/13.
Appearance: Black bodied beer with thin, frothy light to medium brown head. Drops down to a ring.
Smell: Big chocolate and bourbon notes. Not much coffee in the nose. Well balanced aroma from this barrel aged stout.
Taste: Just as the nose suggests a lot of chocolates infact is like a dense fudge cake. You get a splash of bourbon, oak, and some vanilla sweetness. Maybe a hint of coffee too. This beer has great balance in reguards to the flavor profile.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low end of moderate carbonation. Silky smooth mouthfeel. The carbonation levels are perfect in this beer. Rediculously well hidden ABV. Not boozey or harsh at all, just an easy drinking well balanced barrel aged beer. 
Overall: BA Speedway Stout is fantastic! I really loved this beer. Its a tried and true BA Stout that Alesmith really nailed it. My only minor complaint is that I did not get much of the Ryans brothers coffee from this beer. I still give BCBS Coffee the nod when it comes to barrel aged imperial stouts brewed with coffee, but BA SS is not too far behind it. 1,255 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jan 04, 2013

Smooth cocoa notes, overpowers the coffee beans a bit.
The coffee and chocolate play well with the (relatively) tame barrel characters. Just a hint of vanilla. Extremely well hidden booze.
Smooth mouthfeel, carbonation kicks up on the tongue at the end of each sip.
Decadent in its chocolate tones, a real treat. I put this right up there with BCBS Coffee. Thanks for the share 4DAloveofSTOUT! 517 charactersDuff27, Jan 04, 2013

A - Dark chocolate brown. Almost black in color. Has a small milk chocolate head with a medium body
S - Bourbon, dark chocolate, light coffee, oak and slight sweet cream. 
T - This is one amazing beer. It has upfront sweet bourbon, caramel, light burnt toffee, vanilla, and light coffee with sweet cream. There is a light coffee bitterness in the finish with a slight boozy kick. Really a great beer with a powerful and complex flavors
MF - Such a creamy beer that makes this a joy to drink. Light carbonation to prevent it from being too thick.
O - Really a great beer with a ton of flavor. There is a great bourbon presence, sweet vanilla, oak, chocolate and coffee. The one downside is that the nose isn't that strong on this one. If it was, it'd be a damn near perfect beer. 865 charactersjeonseh, Jan 02, 2013
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750ml bottle (2012 release) poured into a Brooklyn snifter. This long time want is courtesy of grandmeaulnes. Big thanks Alex!
A - Pours pitch black in color with 2 fingers of chocolate milkshake colored and textured head with good retention. Head slowly falls to the surface leaving behind tons of webby lacing on the glass. Amazing head for a high alcohol barrel aged beer...hard to get much better than this.
S - Lots of bourbon up front, maybe with a hint of brandy aroma as well (from somewhere). Bourbon fades into rich milk chocolate, some astringency, tons of black coffee, some rich buttery toffee, hints of molasses. Creamy vanilla, oak, some sweet caramel...a bit of a boozy candy bar in a glass. This really smells great.
T - Very smooth beer. Sweet caramel and toffee up front that moves into sweet bourbon and milk chocolate and firmly passing into black coffee. On the finish this transitions yet again - this time to a firm black licorice and espresso. Some sweetness, some difficult to identify blend of fruits that contains some cherries, maybe some raspberry..but definitely something else too (blackberries?). Very mild booziness/heat. Well done barrel aging.
M - Full bodied. Carbonation is on the lowish/medium side. Has a bit of a foamy/frothy feel in the mouth with the carbonation "exploding" a bit in the mouth as it hits the tongue. Only a minor warmth from the bourbon barrel aging. Lots of complexity with the chocolate, coffee, berries, wood and bourbon. A fruity coffee/bitter chocolate flavor is left behind after the swallow for contemplation. The fruitiness is baffling me a bit...trying to identify it exactly but I just can't quite come up with it.
O - Well, after a long, long wait to try this one - it certainly doesn't disappoint. This truly is a great barrel aged imperial stout. The barrel integration is seemless, giving some additional complexity to an already outstanding beer. The semi-sweet candy bar aspect of this beer is pretty amazing...I'm thinking of a Dark Milky Way...bitter chocolate, coffee, caramel and nouget...so good. Very glad to finally land this one - a couple years of trying finally paid off. Thanks again Alex...really an awesome barrel aged stout. 2,219 charactersportia99, Jan 01, 2013

S: lots going on in the aroma, sweetness sticking out the most consisting of chocolate, molasses, brown sugar, and vanilla. plenty of rosatiness, a little wood character, coffee notes with a good booze presence and can't forget the bourbon.
T: bourbon barrel booze was way more apparent on the palate alongside the chocolate goodness, molasses brown sugar sweetness, nice vanilla accents, great roastiness but with a good amount of booze heat, a little dark fruitiness and coffee notes in the thick of it as well.
M: the brew was full in body with good amount of carbonation which had a roasty, slightly astringent, sweet, boozy, mild dark fruity, rich, and creamy finish.
O: very delicious beer that definitely made a huge difference after the bourbon barrel treatment. We actually did a side by side with a vintage bottle and it looks like it will aged great and the booze does mellow out. 1,038 charactersGobzilla, Dec 28, 2012

Served a bit warmer than refrigerator cold. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated. 
A: Pours a beautiful rich tan colour head of one finger, great thickness, impeccable cream, and amazing retention for the high ABV. Fantastic lacing. Body colour is a solid jet black. Gorgeous. 
Sm: Heavy bourbon and wood, caramel, dark malts, cream, oak, and chocolate. A subtle understated delightful moderate strength aroma. 
T: Chocolate, dark malts, caramel, bourbon, oak, and a bit of faded coffee. Beautifully balanced and built. Not as complex as it could be, but it's fucking tasty. Lacks the coffee flavour of the regular Speedway Stout. 
Mf: Divine. Incredibly smooth and creamy, with perfect wetness. Complements the flavour profile masterfully. Silky. Perfect carbonation. Wonderfully soft. 
Dr: Obscenely drinkable for 12%. I could down this all night. An incredible offering, but it could use more complexity in the flavour. Hides its ABV absurdly well.

250th BA review, beer #90 out of my top 100 (which is significantly different than the current top 100, but one list at a time!)
A huge thanks goes out to harink for the awesome trade, including this, my top want. 
A: Pours an opaque absolutely jet black with just under 1 fingers width of creamy looking chocolate ice cream colored head, which dissipates fairly quickly. Leaves only small patches of lacing, and a decent amount of alcohol legs. 
S: Huge bourbon notes, followed by bold black coffee, sweet chocolate cake, hints of dark fruit, raw oak, vanilla, a touch of roasted malt. This is decadent, complex, and luscious. The most prominent aromas as bourbon and rich chocolate, and they intermingle perfectly. Amazing aroma. 
T: Roasted malt initially more prominent than on the nose. Then the bourbon comes out and is quite strong. Rich milk chocolate, some dark fruits, oak, black coffee, hints of booze as it warms (but not in a bad way). Wonderful combination of sweetness, roast, bourbon and black coffee bitterness. The roasted component is a touch too prominent at times, so I cant give it a perfect 5, but it really is incredible. 
M/D: Very smooth, full bodied, carbonation is low which is appropriate, touch of booze in the taste but not at all hot, and drinkability is very good. Really nice mouthfeel here but could be a bit chewier. 
O: Overall, this is a fantastic treat of a beer. One of the best aromas Ive ever experienced, backed up by an incredible palate profile. Big, complex, strong, and delicious. Has to be considered amongst the best imperial stouts Ive had. World class in my book. 1,662 characterszac16125, Dec 17, 2012

4.53/5  rDev +1.3%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.52012 Version. Pours a pitch black color with a large, tan colored head that takes a little time before it goes down. A very delicious-looking beer. Scent is a very familiar bourbon aroma that I got from the 2010 Decadence bottle I had the other night. Wonder if they used the same barrels? I sure hop they did, because the bourbon/barrel on that bottle was insane! This one tends to be mellowed out in the aroma a bit by the intense coffee and chocolate scents. Fresh brewed coffee with an intense chocolate cake aroma. Not just chocolate, but definitely rich chocolate cake. This beer smells like boozy dessert. Great aroma. Taste is just as good. At first I get sweet chocolate and bitter espresso beans. The bitterness hangs around for less than 1/100 of a second, as the sweet boozy bourbon kicks in. This beer is NOT for the faint of heart. Very sweet and boozy. In my opinion, the booziness and the sweetness compliment each other very nicely. If one were lacking, this beer would not taste as great as it does. Lovely vanilla, oak, and bourbon finish. Coffee lingers on the palate. Mouthfeel is full bodied and slightly syrupy. Drinkability is fairly high. Overall, this beer would be much more drinkable if it wasn't so sweet. However, I don't think this beer was meant to be consumed in large quantities...so the sweetness is okay. This beer is fantastic and everything I hoped it would be. 1,399 charactersDovaliHops, Dec 10, 2012

2009 vintage.
Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Foamy streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, bourbon, and wood. Taste is much the same with a slight tartness. There is an alcohol kick and a mild roasty bitterness with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell but the taste doesn't quite match up for me. 565 charactersUCLABrewN84, Nov 11, 2012

Pours like motoroil, ink black with a one finger mocha head that dissipates into a ring around the edges. Big legs, no lacing.
Almost smells like dark chocolate frosting with a twist of bourbon. A touch of tannin and vanilla, the coffee has unfortunately faded out of this.
Big dark chocolate up front with a rounded out sweetness similar to malt balls. Bourbon notes throughout with highlights of vanilla and oak. Surprisingly not hot at all. 
Heavy on the palate and sticky. Extremely low carbonation.
A solid barrel aged stout but doesn't do too much different than any other highly rated stout. Wish I had popped this sooner because I feel that it would have had more to offer earlier in it's life but still, a great beer. 799 charactersauroracrisis, Nov 04, 2012

4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle thanks to boutip, 2009 vintage. Appearance is a nice full black with decent brown mocha head. Aroma is quite straightforward with bourbon, vanilla, the usual Alesmith divine caramel and molasses. You can definitly feel the high alcohol content which brings the ripe fruits upfront along with bourbon and caramel notes. Flavors are hard to describe as they aren't amazingly complex but so well integrated and intense. Bourbon and age seem to have completly taken over coffee from the regular version. As much as I like the regular version, BA speedway lifts this one to a new level without being over the top. Exactly what I expect from a bourbon barrel version.
Side-by-side with Black Note with BA speedway being a close winner. Although I prefered Black Note's palate and aroma, BA speedway's flavors were out of this world. One of the best stout I've had. 866 charactersLuk13, Oct 28, 2012

Taste is ultra soft, muted chocolate, lactic fattiness, and zero acidic coffee and lemon character which I despise in the normal Speedway Stout. This right here is a masterpiece. Muted barrel character, no heat, no booze. Just imperial stout perfection right here. Perfect palate: melted chocolate, chocolate pound cake, fatty yogurt, mild bourbon spice, buttery ganache. Holy #@!!. An incredible experience. For one of the most stingy raters I can safely say this is totally worthy of its ranking and should be considered a god amongst men. Praise the lord for this beer. 854 characterstarheels86, Oct 02, 2012

The brew pours black in color with a tan creamy head. Spotty to webby patterns of lace stick to the glass. A swirl revives a finger of rich brown froth back to the surface.
The aroma displays a bold presence of barrel aging. Caramel and toasty with hints of mellow vanilla sweetness. There are some citrus coffee components still present mixing with the roast of the dark kilned grains. A mild alcohol inclusion is noted and as it warms up, there becomes a scent of coconut included.
The taste is toasty with plenty of barrel characteristics imparted. A bit tannic with a feel of raw wood blended into a smoother flavor of caramel and mild oxidative properties. Some citrus coffee bean element is present along with bitter roast and chocolate. Some solvent alcohol is noted across the back with a spirit accented aspect.
This is a medium bodied brew with a smooth feel and modest amount of carbonation. It is boozy at times and demands to be a sipper. I enjoyed the big alcohol inclusion and the bold array of barrel character that was imparted. I am very glad I had the chance to try this but not being the craziest fan of speedway, I could take it or leave it in the future. Overall though, I can see why fans of speedway would go apeshit over this brew each time this treatment is released. 1,408 charactersstakem, Sep 11, 2012

2009 vintage - Pours pitch black with a nice brown sticky and foamy head. Aroma of roasted malts, licorice, vanilla, oak, bourbon, hints of coffee and chocolate. Taste is slightly sweeter than the original Speedway Stout. Has a lot of roastiness, notes of vanilla, wood, oak, coffee and sweet molasses. Sweetish and smooth finish with nice bourbon vanilla notes and roastiness. Alcohol comes through slightly in the end. Overall a quite massive beer. Perhaps just a tad too sweet for my taste, though, and not as perfectly balanced as the original one. Still extremely tasty. 647 characterstiong, Aug 29, 2012

Pitch black body departs the bottle, settling into my glass with no trace of head (as expected from a ~9-year-old stout). Aroma shows no signs of oxidization (!) with strongly roasted malts and plenty of character from the oak barrels. Coffee was sacrificed to the gods of aging.
Dark chocolate, heavily roasted malts, oak, more dark chocolate, and plenty of boozy warmth survived the journey. I'm not a big fan of the base -- and I similarly dislike '09 BA Speedway -- so I was surprised how much I enjoyed this. Mature, handsome, and delicious. 598 charactersbrystmar, Aug 20, 2012

A- Pours pitch black with a one finger dark mocha head that leaves some lines of lacing. 
S- Earthy bourbon, oak, light coffee, roasted malt, dark chocolate, dark fruit with notes of plumb, fig and black cherry and a hint of vanilla. A nice aroma, but a bit subdued.
T- Lots of dark chocolate followed by bourbon, oak, vanilla, coconut, coffee beans, roasted malt, dark fruits and caramel. 
M- Light to medium carbonation with a full body that finishes a bit hot. 
O- As a big fan of the regular Speedway Stout, I was very excited to try this. The bourbon barrels added some nice qualities to the base beer, but the aging also stripped away the big coffee characteristics that can be found in regular Speedway. Glad to try this and would happily have again, but wouldn't put the ammo it takes to land this. 959 charactersiadler, Aug 14, 2012

A - More Cigar City-like appearance than I expected. Opal coloring with deep brown hues at the edge. Deep khaki head with quick dissipation that reminds me of Marshal Zhukov's. Good lacing. Slight alcohol legs. Leaves a lot of residual brown coating.
S - Lots of bourbon and oak barrel, as i would hope. Dark chocolate, baker's chocolate, touch of winter fruit, and molasses. Nothing out of the ordinary here, but it has some promise. 
T - Relaxed espresso. You can tell the base beer has aged and faded off the dominate character. However, in place of that are good, if not great, barrel elements. Plentiful toasted oak, roasted nuts and malts, hint of coconut, and a robust bourbon whiskey character throughout. Tannic backend that showcases the darker fruit element.
M - Very smooth, nearly Parabola-level. Moderate body, appropriate carbonation, dry barrel finish.
D - Better than expected. The barrel is really well executed, almost like something Hair of the Dog would do if they had a stout. Absolutely not a sweet stout, so don't expect that coming in. Worth trying at least once but not quite worth the trade bait. 1,246 charactersAuracom, Jul 26, 2012

Taste - Awesome. Coffee comes through much more. Good chocolate and a great barrel flavor. Tingly bourbon is especially evident in the finish. Hot from the barrel, not necessarily the beer.
Mouthfeel - Thick and boozy, even if from the barrel, it's a little harsh. Decent carbonation.
Overall - Nice. Really nice. Maybe not any better than regular Speedway, but the barrel adds a nice dimension. 666 charactersAlieniloquium, Jul 18, 2012

Pours black, topped with a solid finger of thick mocha froth. The retention here is fantastic, with a rich ½ finger that just slathers the sides of the glass with gooey brown oils and spotty lacing. The aroma smells of bourbon barrel right off the bat, with notes of charred oak, vanilla, and coconut that segue into those already delicious flavors of coffee, chocolate, and then toffee along the back. Just a little bit of alcohol warmth sits along the back of the nose as well. 
The base sits at the forefront of the taste, with chocolate and toffee sweetness, and I’m happy to find that the coffee still has a lot of life left to it as well. Bourbon moves in along the back, with notes of vanilla, coconut, and then dry burnt wood across the back. The mouthfeel is full bodied, with some light crispness to the carbonation but the tannic slickness here from the wood makes this extremely creamy and easy feeling. For 12% ABV, the alcohol here is just magnificently hid. Just wonderful. 
There isn’t quite a total melding of barrel and base Stout here but the beautiful transition from the Speedway to the barrel in the back really makes this beer work. I’m a huge fan of the regular Speedway Stout and this just really took things to a new delicious level for me. Thanks again for the share Adam. I enjoyed every drop of this fantastic beer. 1,497 charactersKegatron, May 17, 2012

Pours a pitch black with a small light tan chocolate head that has decent retention and leaves a good amount of lacing on the glass. The aroma is big coffee, dark chocolate, a bit of bourbon, vanilla, and some oak. The taste has a bit of sweetness with lots of coffee, vanilla, a bit of bourbon, some oak, and hint of cherry. The finish has slight hint of alcohol, a bit of cherry, and a bit of bitterness. It has the full, creamy mouthfeel that regular speedway has with low carbonation. Amazing beer. This was quite similar to regular speedway (which I love) with some added flavors and complexities from the barrel. The only thing that could improve it would just a tad less sweetness, but other than that I have no complaints.

750 ml bottle generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. 2007 vintage. Pours black as night with close to no head and no lacing on the glass. The aroma is tons of dark chocolate, a decent amount of alcohol, some cherry, plum, and a hint of coffee. The taste has a light sweetness, with some coffee, cherry, plum, The finish has some alcohol and a bit of bitterness on the finish. Full bodied, but not quite as creamy as regular speedway. Low carbonation. A great beer, but quite a different beast than the 2009 BA Speedway (drank side-by-side). The coffee was faded in this one (unsurprisingly) and it had quite a bit more alcohol present (somewhat surprising). The cherry and fruit came through a bit more in this vintage. Not quite as good as the 2009 vintage.

On tap at the Toronado Stout Festival. 2008 vintage, I believe. Pours a dark black with a little bit of light coming through at the edges. A small chocolaty tan head leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass, much like the regular Speedway Stout. This beer was served relatively cold and at first seemed like another pretty good imperial stout. The aroma was vanilla, a little dark chocolate, and some bourbon with the taste very similar to the aroma. Once the beer warmed up some it turned into easily one of the best beers I’ve ever had. The aroma is dark chocolate, vanilla, cherry, plum and dark fruits, dark roasted coffee, bourbon, and a little alcohol. The initial taste is sweet with vanilla and cherry and then going into light coffee and dark chocolate. The finish is a bit of bourbon with vanilla and light alcohol and a very light bitterness. Not hot at all. Very smooth beer. Full bodied with a creamy mouthfeel. Light carbonation. If this beer has on flaw, it is that the initial taste is the tiniest bit too sweet. Very different from the base beer. Coffee is a background flavor instead of being front and and center. Tons of different flavors that are all well integrated. A little less bitterness on the finish than the regular Speedway Stout. Both are amazing beers. I would probably give the barrel aged version the slight edge based on its depth and complexity.

Black with a persistent dark tan head.
Caramel fudge, chocolate, liquorice and dark fruits. Sharpness and pungency from the barrel aging, if not real discernible bourbon characteristics.
Moderate char and coffee roast gives way to plenty of rich, dark fruits, caramel, leather, cola, vanilla and hints of booze. Gets better with each sip.
Silky smooth with tingly carbonation. Some booze heat mars an otherwise flawless mouthfeel.
Didn't find the bourbon characteristics overbearing like some other reviewers - in fact found the opposite and that is my chief criticism of the beer. Technically very well done, but was expecting more complexity and barrel character. 730 charactersspicelab, Apr 22, 2012

 No homeless people needed for this :)
A-- Poured straight black. Nothing more, nothing else. Nice looking light brown two finger head that left a good collar of head once settled. Good spotty lacking left on the sides of the glass while drinking. 
S-- Coffee, chocolate, roast, oak, ABV and subtle bourbon. Coffee has held up well in the nose I thought. far better quality coffee than other BA stouts have used. 
T-- Bourbon, vanilla, Carmel, coffee, and chocolate. far bigger bourbon taste than the smell. Same with carmel. Far bigger and bolder taste than the nose. 
M-- Rich and luscious. Medium bodied and medium carbonation. Dangerously drinkable for the ABV, even with the alcohol being pretty obvious in this. My biggest want of all time and it did deliver on many levels. Yet not nearly as good as other BA beers. Still would trade for it again in a heartbeat or get homeless people to sit in line for it 986 charactersmulder1010, Apr 10, 2012

4.5 A: Black color. Two fingers of creamy light brown head. Retention is very good for a brew this big and a sizeable ring of lacing is left.
4.5 S: As expected, there isn't a whole hell of a lot of coffee left in this. There is some coffee, but it might just be coming from the base stout. Lots of chocolate and molasses. Caramel and a touch of smoke to follow. The bourbon is a bit softer than I was expecting, but I'm not disappointed since the base beer is more than solid. Leathery with melon and apple fruitiness. Light oak and enough vanilla to please.
4.0 T: The taste is very good, but it seems like the bourbon is now carrying the beer instead of the opposite found in the nose. Leather, vanilla, melon, smoke, light spiciness, oak, and bourbony booze predominate. Chocolate, molasses, caramel, and coffee from the stout. Don't get me wrong, this is borderline 4.5.
4.5 M: Medium, borderline heavy body. Good moderate carbonation. Nice creaminess. No qualms here.
4.5 D: Very tasty beer, but I wish it was easier to get. It takes a lot to pull this in a trade, so in the future I'll resign myself to obtaining BCSs, CBS, and BA Boris. That said, I'm happy I traded for this because it is a great beer and something everyone should try. 1,316 charactersDavoleBomb, Mar 30, 2012

The full black color, long lasting tan cap, and high viscosity on BA Speedway definitely signals the brewers intention to make a thick, rich, and complex imperial stout. 
For me, there is too much bourbon in the aroma and flavor, stifling one of my favorite base beers. The bourbon and oak actually dry out the mouthfeel and pull some of the smoothness out of the flavor. Chocolate, bitter roasted malt, and a little bit of coffee step in behind the bourbon. It is a little bit acrid at the end of each sip. As it warms up a little bit, I get some vanilla, oak, and milky sweet notes. I would suspect that some of the off-putting bitter coffee and malt notes and the acrid mouthfeel come from the old coffee. Since this was a 2009 bottle, the coffee has significantly faded and could have left behind the old coffee taste that I have observed in a number of aged coffee stouts. 
BA Speedway is still enjoyable nonetheless, but this bottle does not do justice to how delicious fresh Speedway Stout is. 1,016 charactersKickInTheChalice, Mar 19, 2012

pour was deep black with some light creamy and cocoa head. fairly thick looking body.
the bourbon barrel aging is very apparent on the nose. big vanilla and oak with some coffee and chocolate.
as with regular speedway, there was a nice chocolate backbone with a light roasted malt. the barrel aging really brought the life out of this. the vanilla was very smooth. added some richness. 
a bit viscous and chewy. moderate carbonation. not much alcohol, fairly smooth.
this was delicious, a great example of a great -bal aged stout. 613 charactershooliganlife, Feb 26, 2012

Thanks to Jim for sharing
Shared at MrHirschybars tasting
App- Appeared just like the base version. An excellent coloring of dark browns and blacks. Very smooth and rich in the glass with a small head about ½”. A couple lines of cling.
Smell- This was much more layered than the base version. More chocolate vs coffee and of course the bourbon brings in a couple different layers of some oak, vanilla and marshmallow fluff. 
Taste- I would like to say this is very good but I just don’t think it does justice to the complexity of the original base beer. This seems to ignore the coffee notes and become a bit one sided with more of that bourbon and molasses notes. I think the middle of the beer it does trail off a little with a semi-drop in balance and is strictly a bourbon stout..
Mouth- A good bit of a medium body behind this one with a medium carbonation. Left behind a good amount bourbon, wood, vanilla and sweet.
Drink- Jim. Thanks for breaking this one out. A very good beer but just not up to par with what I think is one of the best stouts out there for the money. I like this I really did. Not bashing at all and rating just below the original in terms of taste and appearance. 1,254 charactersFosterJM, Jan 24, 2012

A - Pours black as night with a nice one finger tall mocha colored head leaving light lace down the glass. Not the prettiest beer but it is stil plenty serviceable.
S - Smells of rich coffee, milk chocolate, vanilla, oak, and warm bourbon. For being seven, going on eight years in the bottle this one has held up beautifully, still plenty of coffee to go around.
T - Starts off with a big dose of fresh brewed coffee slowly giving way to a mix of chocolatey sweetness, vanilla, oak, tobacco, and warm bourbon. Even with all those flavors going on it remains balanced, smooth and easy drinking. Finish has lots of dark roast, lingering on the pallet for some time. A touch of oxidation creeps in as it warms up but it doesn't really affect the taste at all. There is no alcohol to speak of here.
M - Heavy body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Full, smooth, feel with plenty of dark roast, lingering on the pallet for quite awhile after consumption.
O - Damn, this is easily one of the best Barrel Aged stouts I have ever had. The balance of dark flavors from the base beer blend flawlessly with the barrel aging to form one amazing beer. I can not thank you enough Kramer for the chance to try this one. 1,336 charactersorangesol, Jan 12, 2012

Smell: Sweet and roasty. Picking up some bourbon with vanilla and maple from the barrel.

Body is about average with medium carbonation and alcohol is not too apparent. A bit too dry and astringent for my taste thought still very much enjoyable. 464 charactersPhyl21ca, Dec 12, 2011

Big bold nose full of boozy bourbon, chocolate, molasses and coffee. 
Huge rich flavor as well. A bit on the hot and boozy side which I like but this is a touch much. Big bourbon, a touch of vanilla, dark chocolate and rich coffee make up the bold flavor. 
Mouth is viscous and silky with low carbonation and that alcohol heat. 
Overall this is going to be an amazing beer in about 2 years I think. It's pretty great now. But as the alcohol mellows out and all the notes relax and settle, it's going to be phenomenal. 596 charactersMrVonzipper, Nov 27, 2011

4.02/5  rDev -10.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42009 Bottle sampled at a recent tasting.
Pours a hazy dark brown, nearing black with a small, tan cap. Spotty bits of lacing are left around the glass.
Aromas begin with some nuttiness, espresso and a light bourbon/booze presence. Smells of vanilla, oak, cocoa, caramel, toffee and brown sugar further emerge as it warms.
The tastes begin with light coconut, walnuts, toasted oak and vanilla. I am a little underwhelmed to be honest. Sweet molasses through the middle with some milk chocolate as well, moving into a bourbon barrel finish. A bit too acrid overall for my liking.
Mouthfeel is full bodied with medium/low carbonation. Finish is slick and sweet on the palate but not overly so. Much more carboantion than the BA Wee Heavy I sampled earlier this year from the same '09 release.
Overall this was nice but something didn't really work for me. The greatness of the original Speedway is somehow lost here; the big espresso/coffee is masked by the bourbon presence which some may enjoy more, but I think I may prefer the original. I have also read that previous vintages of this release were much better so take that for what it's worth as well. Definitely a great great beer but it didn't meet the hype for me and definitely not the best BA Stout I have had. 1,271 charactersclaspada, Nov 14, 2011

Night of a Million Zillion Speedways
O'Brien's Pub
San Diego, CA
(Aged for 2+ years)
Dark as night black with brown edges, thin head but the body of this beer is just spectacular. It's thick and oily and leaves the glass absolutely covered in sticky lace. Thick as can be and dark as night. Spectacular. 
Deep, dark aromas of coffee and espresso beans, rich chocolate, and strong but complementary notes of bourbon and vanilla. Less hop presence than in the standard Speedway. Rich, divine, decadent, and slightly better than the standard version of the same beer. Incredible!
Earth and wood flavors from the bourbon stand out initially, with lots of vanilla from the bourbon barrel. The rich coffee, chocolate, and roast are still here as well. It's a lovely balance. There's just a bit of alcohol warmth present, but it's welcome in this beer.
Thick, oily, full mouthfeel.
A terrific version of a fantastic base beer. 940 charactersehammond1, Nov 14, 2011

2009 bottle.
A- Pours dark black color, really nice appearance, ½ fingers worth of brown head that dissipates to a nice ring around the glass. 
S- The aroma is fantastic, really nice notes of roasted coffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak, I cannot wait to try this beer. 
T- I was not let down, big coffee flavor, the perfect amount of bourbon comes out, vanilla beans, roasted coffee, chocolate and cocoa, really nice, well balanced brew.
M- Medium/Big mouth feel, well carbonated, creamy, silky smooth drinking, slight roasty aftertaste, alcohol is hidden.
O- I absolutely love this beer, the coffee, bourbon and vanilla are phenomenal in this beer, all the different flavors that come out are well balanced and make this beer an amazing experience. 820 charactersChriscrundwell12, Oct 30, 2011

Black pour, small khaki-light brown head.
Dark rich chocolate and bourbon on the nose. Nutty caramel.
Big bourbon soaked chocolate flavor. More caramel and toasted oak. Soft carbonation. All the coffee is gone which is a thing I love most about this beer. The mouthfeel has thinned out a little.
I've had the '06 and the one that was growler only before. I'd say this is the weakest of the three. This one isn't the A+ decadent showstopper that those were. 472 charactersBearsOnAcid, Oct 13, 2011

Cheers kids! 
From a 750ml into a snifter
Vintage: 2009
Note: Drunk after a 2 year old bottle of the base beer. Comparisons drawn. 
APPEARANCE: Pours out thick black and produces a three finger, thick mocha colored head with great retention. Head cascades up from the netherworld. Jet black body with no carbonation evident. Head slowly fades to a good film and clings to the sides of the glass. A swirling wisp and a ring remain until the end leaving lots some dots of lacing down the glass. A beauty of a stout and much like the base beer, though the lacing is not quite as perfect. 
SMELL: Nice, balanced nose. Roasted malts, molasses, with both dark and milk chocolate there. Touches of coffee as well, though quite muted now, and even more so than the aged base beer. Barrel is there, with some bourbon, oak and vanilla, but it is quite restrained. Very balanced, but somewhat mute for the style. 
TASTE: A little underwhelming up front, with some roasted malts and touches of coffee still. Sweet molasses through the middle with some milk chocolate as well, moving into a bourbon barrel finish. Bourbon, oak and vanilla for sure come out nicely after the swallow, with a touch of booze as well. Bigger and lingering aftertaste of barrel, sweet molasses and some bitter chocolate. Well balanced again, but a little muted up front and much of the coffee flavor of the base beer has disappeared. Even less coffee notes than in the aged base beer. The barrel helps after the swallow, however.
PALATE: Medium body and higher levels of carbonation for the style. Light on the palate, unfortunately, though still creamy and oily, goes down fine and finishes rather mouth-coating. Some heat lingers. The barrel has thinned and lightened up the feel somewhat. 
OVERALL: This is a good beer, but nothing more than that. Unfortunately the barrel aging has muted the coffee flavors and lightened up the feel, making this more of generic barrel aged stout as opposed to a BA Speedway. Furthermore, the barrel flavors aren’t even that impressive in themselves, so it’s not even an exciting generic barrel aged stout. The regular Speedway is a fantastic brew, but the time in the barrel has muted all that made it special. A shame really. If you love Speedway, just stick to the base beer, but if you love bourbon barrel stouts, pick something that showcases the barrel flavors better. Anyways, while this was a bit of a letdown, I was thrilled with the chance to try it out. Thanks again for the trades johbdoe8 and Irishgurl4. 2,773 charactersJeffo, Oct 12, 2011
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.52009 bottle, thanks James. Pours a viscous black "nighter than night" with a mocha head. Nose is more coffee forward than I expected, still a very pleasant montage of fresh coffee beans, baker's chocolate, pleasantly sweet vanilla. Barrel is subdued but woven in nicely. Really good contrast between bitter elements (coffee beans, baker's chocolate), sweet elements (vanilla, coconut), and a pleasant complexity from the barrel. Luscious and thick in the mouth. Flavors open with very dark chocolate, vanilla, coffee beans parading high in the profile, segueing into that rich bourbon barrel, coconut, and a really nice creamy, hot finish. Mouthfeel is perfectly thick and creamy, foamed latte and crushed velvet. Beautiful beer! 729 charactersJAXSON, Oct 10, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A friend brought this over to our place as part of an epic tasting on Saturday. Thanks Jason! Following review based on notes taken at that time.
4oz. sample poured into a snifter.
Appearance: An impressive head quickly recedes to a thin, brown halo. A pitch black body shows off a crimson-brown horizon when held to light. Thick walls of lace trail the beer as it descends the glass.
Smell: Coconut, powdered chocolate, and light booze come through from the start. With time, earth and oak emerge, followed by espresso. Intriguing.
Taste: Tremendously smooth. Vanilla-chocolate swirl, coffee, molasses, and coconut all meld beautifully! The bourbon also adds a light boozy kick to the conclusion of each sip. Creamy and harmonious - damn near a 5.0.
Mouthfeel: Gently carbonated, viscous, and semi-dry with just a touch of heat. Full-bodied, thick, and creamy. I couldn't ask for anything more.
Overall: Fantastically smooth, complex, and flavorful. The bourbon barrel accents the already exceptional base beer, rather than covering it up. One of the three or four best imperial stouts I've ever had, hands down. 1,119 charactersThreeWiseMen, Sep 30, 2011
3.92/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Jeffo strikes again with a killer theme for Tuesdaynight beers at my crib. Had this thing on my wants ever since I tried the regular Speedway Stout which became an instant favorite. I can hardly contain myself.
A hord pour into my snifter revealed a thick black beer with a fluffy three finger head that leaves some nice lacing.
On the nose this is a winner. A nice balance between the regular Speedway Stout and the barrel. Everything is there but nothing is dominating. Hints of soy, sweetness and some vanilla of the bourbon. Very nice.
Flavors a solid but a bit of a let down after the nose. Where the nose promised a perfect balance between base beer and the barrel the bourbon barrel takes over quite a bit. It's quite good but not as special as you'd think of such a hyped up beer. There is a clash between the sweetnes and the bitterness I don't care for.
It has a light creamy, silky mouthfeel. Not as thick as I expected after the pour. A decent amount of carbonation.
Drinking this beer was great experience. I was really excited to try this and now I know. I don't think I'd go through a lot of trouble to aquire this but won't say no when offered. It's almost a love/ hate between me and this beer. Jeffo nailed it again for beer theme night and now I have to see how I can out do him for the next Tuesday... 1,326 charactersdoopiedoopiedoo, Sep 28, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to kbutler1 for sharing this bottle.
2009 vintage.
Pours a half finger of tan head. Color is black.
Aroma: Very fresh coffee. It is spot on goodness. Warming bourbon with nice oak and vanilla. Rich, creamy chocolate. Very little roast. Amazing.
Taste: Warming bourbon, just perfect. Oak and vanilla. Chocolate and cocoa. The coffee is perfect and it doesn't bring a lot of roast to the beer. This is spot on. A bit of dark fruits in the background.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, and warming. Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. A little thinner than I expected. Ends with just a touch of roast.
Overall, this was an amazing beer. Much better than the 08 growler I had, which lacked the huge coffee flavors. This beer was a real treat. 759 charactersmothman, Sep 21, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -6.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42007 vintage. 3oz. Pour from a 750ml foiled and capped bottle into a TJs snifter. Thanks to capra12 for this one. Had at a tasting 9/4/11. 
Pours a thin light mocha head with poor retention. Beer is an opaque black. Lacing is spotty and sparse with poor stick. Great legs though. 
Nose is chocolate, vanilla, espresso beans, and a light overtone of booziness. Some molasses also. Great complexity and very aromatic. 
Opens chocolate and sweet molasses. Brownie and cocoa in the middle with a touch of booziness towards the middle, end. End is more molasses and big vanilla sweetness. Finish is sweet booze and aftertaste is chocolate and sweet espresso. Very appropriate for the style with exceptionally robust flavors and surprisingly drinkable. 
Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and oily in the mouth with some heat going down. Finish is hot with a lingering aftertaste. Pretty standard for a bear with big barrel characteristics except for the lighter body that really aids the integration of flavors. 
I’m a big fan of Speedway stout but I’m surprised at what barrel aging has done for this beer. A completely different flavor profile very different from the coffee-dominant base beer emerges here. Silky smooth, complex, and just very good overall. Definitely worth seeking out. 1,307 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 05, 2011
4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Drank this with a friend next to the regular version last night. This is from the 2009 batch released earlier this year. 
This poured black into a snifter with not much of a head. Aroma is a really nice bourbon, oak, spice, dark chocolate, and some rich coffee beans. More vanilla than in the regular. Awesome aroma. Flavor is not as boozy as I thought it would be. Really smooth medley of bourbon, oak, vanilla, spice, and dark chocolate. Really great flavor on this, it has deeper flavors and more complex than the regular Speedway. Thick and rich body. I enjoyed this a lot more than Parabola, KBS. Not the best barrel aged imperial stout I have had recently but still worth seeking out. 691 characterskayalla, Sep 02, 2011

A: Pours black with a thin brown head that leaves a bit of lacing around glass.
S: Roasted malt and chocoate with a mellowed bourbon barrel character from the 2 years this spent in barrels, alcohol, bourbon and oak.
T: Super smooth with oak notes from the bourbon barrel, chocolate, some faint coffee notes and a mellow bourbon flavor as well.
M: Really smooth and creamy full body with low-moderate carbonation and sweet finish.
O: Great example of a barrel aged imperial stout, extremely smooth and full of flavor. Quite drinkable for a beer of this size. 643 charactersAzurescens, Sep 01, 2011

S: Very nice! Minimal bourbon notes, but definitely noticeable, in fact the other aromas seem to be muted perhaps due to age, or simply due to being overwhelmed by the barrel aging. There is some wooded essence to it as well now that I mention barrels. 3.5

This beer is regular speedway on crack. The tan/mocha head dissipates quickly but does come back on with light agitation. The color is inviting and begs to be savored slowly.
I could get lost in the smell of this beer but eventually had to drink it and was lost in the roasty coffee notes with hints of vanilla surrounded by the barrel treatment of this beer. The mouthfeel is the only part of this experience that let me down as it was a little too thin for my liking.

4.12/5  rDev -7.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 42006 bottle, opened at a bottle share event at Beer Revolution. Thanks to cpferris for sharing this (I think, lots of people there)
A – It was fairly dark in the bar, but what was in my small snifter tasting glass was very dark yet semi translucent. A nice looking beige head topped the beer. The head was very tight and creamy, but also very short, indicative of the high ABV and the barrel aging.
S – Huge bourbon and oak notes mixed with coffee and chocolate. 
T - Not as boozy as I thought it would be. Some age clearly did some real wonders for this beer. Oak mixed with chocolate and coffee is the best way I can describe the flavor. The bourbon is definitely present, but mostly on the finish. Never had this fresh, but this seems rather mellow compared to what I was expecting. Maybe a good thing, maybe not, but I found it very tasty.
M – Low carbonation and not as heavy bodied as I come to expect from this style of beer. It was creamy though with a real buttery finish.
O – This is a great BA stout, and I enjoyed it greatly and am glad I got to tick it. I still prefer The Abyss, Parabola, and other variations in this style that would prevent me from trying to hunt it down again. Its a solid, balanced beer that is great if you can get it and no big deal if you cant. 1,295 charactersdubinsky, Aug 29, 2011
3.94/5  rDev -11.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks, glazeman. I've been waiting for this for a long time. Probably currently my biggest want, and here it sits before me. 2009 vintage.
Appearance is very nice. Two finger head that fades to a quarter finger and hangs around. Cappuccino colored head that is darker at the junction of the foam and beer. Thick, nice legs. Can't see through this one, as it should be.
Smell is outstanding. Vanilla, coconut, booze, chocolate, and dark fruits. Up front nose reminds me of Hawaiian Tropic sunscreen. 
Taste is good, but a little too bitter for me. I enjoy the vanilla/bourbon up front and chocolate in the middle, but the harsh, burnt, bitter, porter-like, coffee ground finish is quite offensive. Honestly, I was hoping for a little bit more of a BA Yeti, CBS, or Event Horizon-like picture, but the base beer here is just too harsh and roasty for me.
Overall this is a very good beer. I would love to try it again. But, since my expectations were SO high, I am a little bit disappointed. 993 charactersairohead2001, Aug 16, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -3.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 42009 Vintage. Split with airohead2001. This was a top want of the both of us for quite awhile.
A: The beer pours near black in color with a 1.5 finger medium brown head that has excellent retention and lacing.
S: Wonderful bourbon and chocolate notes up front, followed by raisins. Overall I was very impressed with the smell, although it’s not quite up to the top of the class level as it lacks some depth and intensity. 
T: As with the nose, the taste is quite good and is very balanced, although the flavor profile isn’t quite as diverse or intense as the best ba stouts. The finish is of milk chocolate with a slight bitterness. I like that this one isn’t sweet but rather smooth. The bourbon is integrated well throughout.
M: This is more carbonated than the average ba stout, which makes it feel a bit on the thin side. Still, it has a good feel and aftertaste.
O: I’m really glad to have had this beer. It lived up to my expectations and is one that I would gladly have again, and will probably search out again in the future. Hides the ABV very well. 1,071 charactersglazeman, Aug 16, 2011

Pours an almost black with some tan head floating around the edges. Muted cold coffe in the nose, a tad vinous, more bourbon as it warms. Taste folllows nose, with some tartness, bitterness from the coffee, and some roast. Bourbon peaks out for a second behind the oak and vino character. Good beer, more like an english old ale at this point than a stout. 420 charactersbaconsausage, Aug 13, 2011

Poured pitch black with a one finger tan head that subsided to half a finger slowly. Maintained good lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, coffee, caramel, and subtle sour acidity. The flavor was of sweet malt, wood, sweet alcohol, coffee, caramel, and subtle sour acidity. It had a heavy mouthfeel with medium carbonation. Overall this was a great brew. The barrel on this brew really developed it quite nicely. This one however had the same acidic flavor as the 2010 Speedway that was had side-by-side with this one, but this one came off a little more sour than the regular 2010 version. Not sure what to make of that, but it didn't hurt the brew at all. The sweet alcohol and wood notes on this one were quite well integrated and took the regular to a whole new level. Really glad I FINALLY got the opportunity to try this as it was quite good. 1,013 charactersthagr81us, Aug 10, 2011

Black hole dark. Bourbon all day on the nose. Smells really nicely balanced. Yum...one of the better BA Stouts. Really on the money for my taste buds. Bourbon with chocolately roasted malts. Mouth is really good as well, not as smooth as others I've had, and this is very heavy, but overall very good on the mouth.

A - Dark, but not completely black like a Parabola or other heavy stout. Decent legs, very little to no head.
S - Bitter coffee, some notes of chocolate. Honestly, nothing really too special in the smell.
T - More of that bitter coffee flavor and some sub-grade cocoa/chocolate. I'm really not impressed with this beer at all.
M - Light carbonation, and not viscous. This is pretty my favorite attribute of the beer.
O - Decent, but not great. I don't understand the hype behind this beer. 568 charactersunitmonster, Aug 02, 2011

A: This has a slick BP disaster look to it, without all the deceased marine life. It isn’t pitch black but imparts some nice deep mahogany notes to the edges, like a hardened cop with a heart of gold you somehow impart a sense of trust in this stout that despite his over character flaw evidenced 14 minutes in, he will make it all right after 90 minutes in your life. Also, nice lacing, tiny bubbles, coffee stickiness, and other things people don’t read.
S: This is coffee acidity, to a huge degree. Also entering the fray is a serious boozy profile that apparently hasn’t had the shithead weathered out of it after 2 years in an oak barrel. It isn’t as recalcitrant as the new Dark Lords, but it still is rambunctious enough to be bothersome. However, some nice bourbon and oak notes finalize the experience and you give it an approving nod into your club, aka YOUR MOUTH, where all the action takes place infra.
T: Fast forward 3 seconds from the smell to the tasting, first one to show up to your sick rager is coffee, oh wait but he brought, acidity, and then, his other boy coffee, and then toffee. You don’t judge but things seem a little unbalanced in here, oh wait then his crazy friend chocolate shows up doing magic tricks and making observational comedy references. Everyone is put at east with a nice coffee walnut finish: your BA speedway house party is officially underway.
M: This coasts like a bucket of Sherwin Williams. I don’t mean in the way when you hire day laborers either. It coats like if people who cared painted your mouth with coffee and bourbon. We all know how much that costs IN REAL LIFE so this is a welcome reprieve. 
D: As much as I want to hometown and keep the drive strong for this amazing beer, this is certainly its weakest point. I can’t in good faith say that I would crack 2009 BA stouts all day while at Havasu doing sick broesque things. Then again, is that the target market? Notwithstanding, this tires a bit after a solid 12oz just due to the complexity and rampaging coffee and toffee double team on your bitter and sweet zones. Enough is enough the tongue declares insouciantly.
Narrative: Kicked out of the racing academy. Well, at least that is what he told his parents that his tuition checks were going to. The truth is that Chase Worthington was never attending a racing school in Temecula. He accepted “tuition” checks from his parents every 5 months and even in the summer session for modding his sick 2001 Mercury Cougar for drag racing or “Straight up Dragging it” as he abrasively referred to it, much to the chagrin of his friends, when present. His friends told him that running the mean streets of San Diego was not to be trifled with, that is, unless one were content to life his life “a quarter mile at a time.” This seemed to be a deafeningly infinitesimal stretch for a racer like himself. Cold air intake, cat back exhaust, chipped, sick body kit; all of the accoutrements were present however he forgot a single thing: his car had only 189 horse power and people grew tired of its inky discharge, regardless of the speeds that it allegedly traveled. This speedway pun was a speedway pun for the racing pun speedway pun, and in the end, they all learned speedway pun, racing. 3,334 charactersSubpoenaDeuces, Jul 28, 2011
4.58/5  rDev +2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had this at the Indiana Microbrewers festival, a huge thanks to Sprinkle and the Crown Liquor guys
Appearance - Pure black with a half inch dark mocha head.
Smell - A nice chocolate smell, then some bourbon and vanilla. All of these were very muted compared to other barrel aged stouts the smell was a let down compared to the hype.
Taste - The taste really picked uped compared to smell. It was a very very nice balanced stout there was chocolate, bourbon, coffee, sugar, vanilla, and caramel. But none of the flavors were overpowered they were very nicely balanced between each other.
Mouthfeel - The mouth-feel was nice, but a little thin. The carbonation was medium, and just a little alcohol heat.
Overall - I would love to try this again but not for what it has been trading for in the ISO/FT forum. 812 charactersphisigben, Jul 28, 2011
4.65/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to Andy for opening this mamoth. Bottle from the most recent release. Pours black with about two inches of light tan head. Nice retention and soapy lace.
Bourbon is pretty much kicking me in the face. It's awesome. Rich bourbon really comes through right and above all else in the beer. Mollasses and roasted coffee makes up the rest of the aroma. This one is hugely roasty wtih a sweet undertone. This is pretty much what I want a barrel aged stout to taste like. Lot's of rich bourbon with a bit of mollasses on the flavor. Hints of oak, vanilla and a bit of a fruity character. 
The feel is good. Nice full and robust but a little sticky. Overall this one is insane. Very complex and surprisingly drinkable. A little hot but it doesn't even matter. This one is great. 784 charactersBendurgin, Jul 25, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Tro for making this happen! The bottle says 2009 on it (most recent release). Poured into a tulip. There is a large tan head atop an oily black body. There is a moderate amount of sticky lacing.
The aroma is very enjoyable. The coffee is well integrated to create a slightly sweet mocha aroma. The vanilla and bourbon flavors are heavy as well. This is pretty complex and really inviting.
The taste is mildly sweet, offset by the bitter malt and coffee followed by a slight warmth of alcohol. The coffee isn't as strong as it is in the nose. There is a nice chocolatey malt flavor to this. At any given sip I can hone in on an individual flavor and enjoy something different each time.
The mouthfeel is full and creamy. This is like liquid chocolate cake.
This met my expectations. I would happily have this as often as possible. 843 charactersandrewinski1, Jul 25, 2011

A: Pours black with low carbonation and a thin dark brown head.

T: Warming bourbon, touch of coffee, caramel, toffee. This tastes pretty much like the standard version with a good amount of well integrated bourbon.

Pours black in color with a very small tan head. 
The aroma has all the good stuff working well together: chocolate, roasted malt, coffee, woody, well integrated bourbon and vanilla. Very nice! 
The flavor is full and rich and includes everything I would want in a big decadent imperial stout. Roasted malt, caramel, chocolate, vanilla, coffee, wood, molasses and the well integrated bourbon. There is no "I" in team, and these flavors are definitely working together. 
Full bodied and smooth drinking for such a big beer.
This was one of my favorites of the evening. 587 charactersajsdad06, Jul 20, 2011

4.35/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours black with a very thin layer of tannish head. The aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla and roasted malts. Definitely more reserved than some BA imperial stouts. Taste is smooth. Iced coffee, roasted malts, mild chocolate meld with bourbon, oak and vanilla. A good level of sweetness is balanced with a reserved bitterness that comes together quite well. While there is a lot of barrel in this beer, it is not an over-the-top BA imperial stout like some. Good medium carbonation and body work well. Overall, this beer is a winner. AleSmith obviously knows their way around a barrel. Being picky, a bit more of the coffee flavor that comes out in the base beer, along with a slight boost in the barrel character would have pushed the taste to a 5. In addition, that additional coffee probably would have brought out the nose more. Still really good as is. 853 charactersseeswo, Jul 08, 2011
2.21/5  rDev -50.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 2.5 | taste: 2 | feel: 2 |  overall: 2At a recent tasting i had the 2007 bottle, i didn't get to try any other vintages that were also cracked due to the shear number of glasses present and i wanted to let other BAs go first, but i got alot of the 2007 since it was not in high demand, but if i ever do i may update this, as the 2007 is not a sight/taste to behold.
Color is very dark in all regards, head fades into the black body.
The aroma gives the impression that this is super sweet and going to be sticky, it really smells under attenuated and sugary but with a bit of roast and chocolate inside aswell.
The flavors take a nose dive into dry territory that tastes like it was meant to be tart, or aged with dark fruits or something along those lines, i really kept thinking this was like a bad stout version of Boulavard BBQ with dark cherries as it had those same characterisitcs, though not desirable and tasty like you would expect, maybe i needed more to grow on me. There was considerable oxidation which only made things worse. Dry and over fermented, if you have a bottle, i'd save it for 2025, just because it's barely worth drinking now, i think most of our bottle was left over on the table. Maybe in 2025 it will be a novelty. 1,206 charactersChadQuest, Jul 01, 2011

4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap at the 2011 release at Alesmith. Written notes from 4 tasters of the 2009 BA version.
Appearance: Reminded me of what I would expect if I dropped an 88% cocoa piece of dark chocolate into my taster cup and let it melt while I waited the 3.5 hours in line to get my ticket. Poured a hybrid between dark mocha and jet black, depending on your angle, with a tan head whose thickness was about the size of 3 US quarters stacked on top of each other. After ~10 seconds following the pour, the head quickly dissipated to form a lingering ring around the edges of the taster cup.
Smell: Holy crap, what a distinction between the BA and regular version. The barreling process completely metamorphosized this one. Aromas of wood and spicy bourbon upfront with dark chocolate and coffee following suit. Could have sworn I detected subtle hints of vanilla and burnt malt, but it also could have been the delirium starting to set in as a result of standing in line for hours on end in the sun wearing a long sleeve thermal shirt, a cashmere sweater, and jeans in the middle of June in San Diego. (Insert "idiot"-related synonyms here) 
Taste: Absolutely delicious. Easily explains why I decided to leave 1 line only to wait in another on 4 separate occasions. Taste closely follows the nose. Very nice balance between the barrel, coffee, and dark chocolate with an added treat at the finish: absolutely no bitterness from the coffee (unlike the regular version of Speedway). Slight heat from the alcohol, but not enough to add to my slowly-rising body temperature as a result of being bombarded by sunrays while standing around. 
Mouthfeel: Medium- to full-bodied. Felt like smooth velvet swirling in my mouth. Carbination was spot-on.
Overall: Nice work Alesmith. They worked the barreling process to near perfection with this one. Danger is its middle name. Deceivingly drinkable for a 12% ABV. Probably explains my lack of self-control and my desire to have 4 helpings of this one (in adddition to the Decadence and Speedway Vanilla & Coconut tasters I had as well). While Alesmith does a superb job with not letting the barrel completely overwhelm all other aspects of the beer, my only criticism is that I wish the bourbon was just a tad more pronounced in the flavor profile. Regardless, I enjoyed this one very much. I wish everyone gets the chance to sample this eventually. In my opinion, the BA version of Speedway completely blows the regular version right out of the water. 2,485 charactersleschkie, Jun 19, 2011

A: Black as motor oil with a reddish mocha colored head that stays at about one finger. Good retention.
S: Pretty big aromas of freshly ground coffee, dark chocolate, raisin and bourbon.
T: Dark chocolate, cocoa powder, coffee, fudge, hints of dark fruit (plum and black currant) with a slightly acidic finish. Lush and velvety mouthfeel with a pleasant warming sensation on the finish and a little bit of a peat flavor and dryness from the bourbon. The bourbon was surprisingly restrained, which surprised me. The balance was really well done. I definitely feel lucky to have gotten to try this one. 625 charactersnotchucknorris, Jun 17, 2011

A – In the cup the beer looked black with no light able to shine through. It had a nice beige/tan head that dissipated quickly to leave a nice ring around the cup.
S – First to the mind is a nice strong chocolate scent. Also detectable are hints of caramel, wood, and burnt malts.
T – Up front first was a flavor or strong malty chocolate that eventually finished with a coffee aftertaste. The alcohol goes down warm but not hot. This beer leaves a sweet coating on your lips that you can taste for a bit afterwards.
M – Creamy feel in the mouth with a perfect amount of carbonation. Excellent for this BA stout.
O – This was a great version of the Speedway Stout. The barrel aging has done wonders to this beer. I’m hoping that aging this beer a bit more will help bring out more flavors. 872 charactersnightwing002, Jun 17, 2011

M: Creamy mouthfeel, light carbonation, and a bite from the bourbon.

Look: Dark brown to almost black in color with a 1/4 tan head with some decent retention and lace
Smell: Spicy notes of bourbon backed up by dark chocolate and coffee
Taste: Very very nice spicy notes of bourbon it did tingle the palate a bit but it was a pleasurable tingle and leaved me wanting more. The beer finished off nicely roasted malt coffee and a hint of chocolate.
Mouthfeel: Slight burn from the alcohol and bourbon notes. Full body with little carbonation 
Overall: Very good BA imperial stout. Picked up two bottle of this so I will put one away for a year or more to see how the flavors mature and I will drink one again here soon. Looking forward to another go around with this beer. 750 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jun 16, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5'09 vintage. On tap at the 2011 BA Speedway and Decadence release. From three 3oz pours in taster cups.
Pours black with a thin film of sand colored foam, which persists in ring form for quite a while. Not much lacing to speak of. Smell is mostly bourbon and oak, a little vanilla; a nicely restrained aroma, though, and not at all overpowering. Not a lot of coffee or malt here, and definitely more mellow than regular Speedway. Taste is more balanced than the smell, with more of a coffee and chocolate presence along with the bourbon and oak, as well as some maltiness and sweetness. Finishes with a very slight coffee bitterness. Wow, super tasty and smooth stuff. Medium-full body and medium carbonation work great with the beer here; not much heat to speak of. Overall, this is a world class bourbon barrel age coffee stout, exceedingly drinkable, and which shows admirable restraint with the barrel treatment. 917 characterspmarlowe, Jun 16, 2011

On tap at the brewery. 
The beer is a dark reddish brown color with a light beige head. The foam recedes quickly leaving a thin ring around the glass. The nose is chocolate, bourbon and dark fruit. Taste is of leather, chocolate, caramel, and oak. There is a sweet quality to it, as well. Bourbon is integrated so well that there is almost no alcohol heat to speak of. Finish is sweet with lingering chocolate and bourbon. Feel is somewhat thinner than I'd expect from a big BA stout and carbonation is on the low side, as it should be. Overall this is another very nice barrel aged offering from AleSmith. 618 charactersSideswipe, Jun 15, 2011

T: Oak, lightly roasted coffee beans, harsh bittering chocolates. The bourbon in subdued but powerful oak dominates. The beer bears some oxidative notes however minute. Dry oaky finish. The coffee has faded a good bit when compared to fresh Speedway.
M: A little chewy, low carbonation and parchingly dry oak finish.

Pour revealed a fudge like dark brown color. No head whatsoever with some bubbles on one half of the glass. The best part of this beer I felt was the nose. I enjoy coffee stouts and coffee in general, so naturally I picked up a lot of coffee flavors off the bat. Followed by some vanilla, oak and slight bourbon characteristics. I got vanilla and a slight tart coffee and bourbon taste that was blended well. Also tasted some chocolate in there. A very creamy stout that was very easy to drink sip after sip. Enjoyed this one and was a standout at the tasting. 645 charactersmistakebythelake, Apr 17, 2011

Pours dark and sexy. Near black. Almost white head of a finger turns into a small film. 
Lace is small, but present. The legs are thick and nice. 
Smells of oak, chocolate, coffee, some charred vanilla, and light hints of bourbon.
Taste is sweet, with all the notes from the nose. The oak really dries it out on the back end.
Body is thick and full with a nice creaminess. 
This is good... But not as great as the growler that I've previously had. Still, it was fun to drink. 493 charactersAleWatcher, Apr 16, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A-Body is big, thick and opaque black. Pours with a 1-2 finger creamy dark tan head. Head fades eventually to a thick collar but plenty of lacing sticks all the way down the glass.
S- Exceptional. A delicate balance between bourbon BA characteristics and IRS characteristics. Very complex and slightly sweet-of moderate strength. Vanilla, oak, a slight hint of bourbon sweetness, dark chocolate, anise, dark fruit. Just wonderful.
T-Flavor is just as good as the nose but adds a slight roasted malt component to it. Upfront is a lot of IRS characteristics-dark fruit, anise, licorice, dark chocolate-and offers a bit of vanilla and bourbon sweetness and the slightest hint of oak in the background. A hint of roasted malt comes through for the finish to create an equal balance to the slightly sweet initial flavor. Some remnants of the initial flavor linger as well as a slight roasted malt bitterness.
M- Low to medium carbonation and a body that is thick, viscous, and exceptionally smooth and creamy. 
D- This is one of the best stouts I have ever had. The BA components compliment the stout characteristics very well and this is worlds better than regular speedway-seem like 2 completely different beers. The flavors are really big here but it is not nearly as aggressive as regular speedway. 1,301 charactersbiggied, Apr 12, 2011

A: Black body with bright orange-brown highlights. No head to speak of. Not that great, really, but I won't say it's below average for a 5 year old BA stout.
S: Big, smooth, round aroma of coffee, bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate, and just pure stour awesomeness. Lovely.
T: Opens with chocolate + vanilla malt sweetness, followed by some coffee, bourbon, and an oaky, slightly boozy finish. Sublime, but the slight harshness on the tail end keeps it from being perfect. Damn close, though...
M: Full, rich, velvety body. Light, but present carbonation. Just lovely.
D: Yes, yes, a thousand times yes.
Notes: What a beer. Perfect balance of the roasty base beer and the richness of bourbon barrels; huge drinkability for a 12% monster; power, delicacy, and complexity all together.

4.09/5  rDev -8.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750 mL bottle courtesy of a great Cali trader. Obtained a little while ago in a trade and cracked tonight on the night of my 1200th review. This 2007 vintage, bottle #318/447, was poured in to a 22 oz. snifter.
Appearance: Pours a oily, thinned out body, quickly out of the neck of the gold foiled, double waxed silk screened bottle. The body is pitch, glassy, obsidian, opaque except for the faintest twinge around the edges suggesting light. A vigorous pour - made more vigorous once I realized that there wasn't a good head forming - yielded pretty much nothing in terms of head, and that's not entirely unforgivable: this one has both coffee additions and barrel thinning. There's no hint of surface lacing (after about 30 seconds) nor any hint of a collar or side lacing, so there's not too much more to say - it would have been nice to have more, but I understand why it's not here. 
Aroma: This beer's best attribute. A gentle, rolling nose with a lot of character. Toasted coconut is huge, mingling brilliantly with fudgy brownies and full roast coffee, but also a ton of stone fruits and dark fruits, courtesy of both the maltiness of this beer as well as barrel sugars and a pleasant amount of oxidation. Cherries are strong, both black and sour, mingling with raisins and figs, and everything here is wrapped up and beautifully macerated in bourbon. It's not hot at all - only faintly warming and ethereally spicy, the whole thing is mellow but complex, subtle yet strong. Very enjoyable. 
Taste: A varied mouth, ranging from tart, oxidized, sherry-like notes to dark malts to barrel sweet spicy bourbon. First, a comment that this beer is probably a little past its peak - the malts (particularly the coffee addition) are beginning to fade, the oxidation is beginning to come through pretty heavily, and the whole package seems a little dull. That being said, there's still a lot of good stuff here (as evidenced by the nose). A thick, fat malt base contributes a lot of dark toastiness - toast, molasses, cola, bittersweet cocoa, and full roast coffee all mingle with a slew of fruits ranging from raisins to cherries. There're a few notes in between - definite figs, hints of things more sour and tart like kiwi, red grape, and the like - that sort of round of the flavor, but these fruity notes are pretty heavily countered by a lot of oxidation, sherry-like, a little papery, though not too distracting. The bourbon and barrel notes constitute about a third of the flavor components, strength-wise, in the mouth, growing in intensity as this one warms (unsurprisingly). Coconut and leather mingle with fat oak, slightly toasted, and caramelized barrel sugars, though the bourbon is decidedly mellow, a little fainter than I expected. It's definitely present in the finish, though, warming and spicy, though never intense.
Mouthfeel: A very interesting mouth on this one. Very soda-like, though not overly bubbly. I imagine the erratic, unevenness is likely due to the thinned out nature of the body, diluted and rarefied by a year spent in some bourbon barrels. The end result is good, but not great - a little oily, courtesy of the coffee addition, but also definitely a little erratic. Give it a little time to smooth out and it becomes really nice (though, yes, a little flat and thin, so either way it suffers slightly). If I had to pick one or the other ... let it sit for a while.
Drinkability: So this beer has a lot going on. And, as an initial matter, it's all going on in a 12% soup, which is problematic, because 12% is one hell of a soup. That being said, this 12% is not hot - there's no burn, and the bourbon itself doesn't even contribute anything close to a hot amount of bourbon, whether it be in the nose, mouth, or anywhere else. 
That being said, I was mildly disappointed by this beer. It is nowhere near as good as fresh Speedway Stout. I'm can't state conclusively whether or not that is because this beer is past its prime - that is certainly a possibility, given: a) the oxidation; b) the knowledge that this beer is 5+ years old; and c) the fading of the coffee, etc. etc. etc. Not to mention that this isn't how I remember normal Speedway tasting. But while there's some evidence to suggest it may be, it's possible that this is just how -bal Speedway is supposed to taste, thinned, aged, diluted. If that's the case, then maybe this one isn't quite the candidate for barrel aging. I'm also ruling out infection or accelerated oxidation by virtue of the double waxing (who double waxes? Kudos to Alesmith!). 
I'm glad this beer was #1200. I'm also glad I had the opportunity to try it. That being said, I wish I'd tried it sooner, and I wish I'd tried it alongside the non -bal version of Speedway, just so I could get the true side-by-side comparison in an attempt to identify how much of what I'm tasting is due to aging and how much isn't.

A- Pours a dark, chocolate brownie color. Practically zero head developed as the beer was poured. Not the sexiest looking beer.
S- Wonderful mixture of mellow bourbon aromas and candied chocolates. Some molasses and chocolate brownies in there as well with a hint of vanilla. Super complex.
T- Mellowed bourbon upfront. Following is a mixture of chocolate malts, brownies, and bitter caramel. Blends together very well. As stated, this beer was very mellow, yet complex. Great malt profile.
M- Viscous and velvety smooth. Just the way I like it. 
D- One of the easiest drinking stouts I have ever had. The mellowed out attributes really helped here.
Overall, very excited to finally try this beer, especially one as old as this one. An excellent beer and a good example of how aging can completely change a beer. Recommended. 947 charactersrhinos00, Feb 12, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4On tap (2009 release) poured into a small snifter. Pitch black beer that looked viscous when poured. A finger of chocolate colored creamy head stuck around for a bit, leaving just a trace of lacing but a lot of alcohol feet. 
Nose is a nice mix of dark chocolate, rich roasted coffee, wood, caramelized sugar, and roasted malt. 
Coffee, dark chocolate dominate the tongue initially, then as it warms, the booze and the wood shows up mid tongue. Nice lingering roasted coffee, malt and wood aftertaste. 
Full bodied and creamy in the mouth, combined with the alcohol warmth made my taste buds really happy. Some light carbonation still remain after all the barrel aging, helps to move the flavor along as you take a sip. 
Very big beer demands small slow sips. A very enjoyable stout to sit down with for an evening. 819 charactersnataku00, Jan 13, 2011
4.22/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Happy birthday to me! I can't express enough gratitude to fiver29 for sending me this, a brew I truly thought I might not ever get to sample, especially an older one. 2003 vintage, bottle 79 of 196 split with my wife. 
I will admit it; this is possibly the only bottle of beer I've ever held that I had second thoughts about opening. It wasn't easy. The cap pops with scarely a whimper, carbonation is close to absolute zero. Pours jet black with a double handful of tiny bubbles clinging together in the middle of the snifter. A quick swirl dissipates them completely. I can almost read the reflection of the computer screen in the darkness. The nose projects a good ways from the glass, warm, subtle bourbon & a hard shoulder of malts. Only a bare hint of coffee or roast. 
This bottle of Barrel Aged Speedway is like an aging ballet dancer, the tastes are muted, graceful, & gentle, not at all like the hot bourbon bombs so common in my cellar. Despite that, the barrel retains the upper hand here, but it's a slow, thorough burn, like a high-end bourbon (not the Jim Beam I used to quaff). It's distilled out into a prominent vanilla tailing too, & the oak is strong both in the taste & the spit-drying ending. Roast malts do a nice job rounding the taste out, along with light touches of ash, coffee, & the faintest peels of dark fruit. 
Smooth & silky beyond belief, this is the ideal for mouthfeel. The beer just slips into your drinking orifice, smiles slyly, & vanishes down the gullet, leaving only a lingering bit of Victoria's Secret lace on the throat. Wowza. Perhaps it's only the knowledge that I'll never get to sample this again (at least the '03), but I'd happily sit around all night sipping this with my pinky in the air. 
Overall an excellent beer. I can only imagine getting to try it at various cycles of its life, & sure as hell hope I get to in the future. One more salute to fiver29, thank you so much, sir. 1,937 charactersmaximum12, Jan 04, 2011
2.61/5  rDev -41.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2 | feel: 3 |  overall: 2This was nicely shared at the HOTD Matt Release a few months ago. It was a 2007 Bottle. I think that it was either infected or had gone bad.
Pours a rich black with a brown very thin small head. 
Has a lot of coffee smell to it with a nice roasty richness, this bottle had almost a sour off smell to it though. 
The initial taste was great and full of rich malty and coffee flavor but then it faded into an almost soured oxidized flavored and not in a good way. I don't think it was infected but it was certainly a bad bottle Carbonation was still good though which was odd.
thick mouth feel which is what I want in a big stout.
overall really disappointed i'm hoping that I get to try a bottle thats not been compromised. 727 characterspsiweaver, Dec 10, 2010
4.44/5  rDev -0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This was the '03 vintage, courtesty of TurdFurgison. Didn't bother to copy down the bottle number. Served in a Chouffe tulip.
A - Pours with minimal foam that quickly settles to a thin ring of bubbles, leaving behind no lace but some sticky legs instead. Body is black, with maybe a faint brownish glint at the upper edge.
S - Vanilla, bourbon, chocolate cake, plenty of oak and barrel, some light soy and dark fruit oxidation notes, and perhaps still a hint of solvent alcohol in there. Minimal coffee, but that wasn't unexpected.
T - The taste is more mellow, with some light oxidation notes, and big prune and dark fruit notes. Not as much chocolate, but more earth and charred wood instead.
M - No heat, extremely low carbonation. Full-bodied, quite chewy and sticky. Surprisingly little tannic character - seems to have faded in the intervening years.
D - I found this quite easy to drink, and went back for a few more ounces after my initial pour. I liked this more than the 2008 growler, but I'm not sure it's the mind-blowing experience others have described. 1,072 charactersMasterSki, Dec 06, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42003 vintage, courtesy of mikesgroove about 1 year ago, shared at a tasting after the Jackie O's anniversary party. No audibles when the cap was removed, threatening no carbonation, but in fact there's a little.
The aroma is nice, exceptional really considering it holds its own directly after Bolshoi which was unreal. Soft bourbon with a very refined feel, roasted malts, no coffee at all (unexpected), I could smell it for hours. It tastes sweet upfront with a very low grade burn in the aftertaste, the bourbon has integrated well. A very nice aftertaste too, maybe the only negative is a hint of ash, light though.
Smooth and creamy mouthfeel (very low carb), it gives Bolshoi a run for the money, excellent. 715 charactersTurdFurgison, Dec 05, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 42007 bottle, thanks Jay for sharing! 
Wispy tan skim on a glassy obsidian surface. Ever present ring at the edge. 
Dark and formidable body, the surface skim has the look of a planet's atmosphere.
As it warms there's distinct vanilla, coconut, and chocolate notes.
Flavor is rich, mildly oxidized, reminding me of Thomas Hardys. The alcohol has a mild sting but it doesn't affect the taste. Mellow roast and fudgy chocolate flavors, bitter coffee, an almost wine-like grape note surfaces too. Some soft bourbon traces, mostly vanilla and booze. Mellow carbonation, strong enough to keep it a sipper. Three years might be slighty too long to age, but it's still holding on. 675 charactersemerge077, Nov 21, 2010

A huge thanks go out to Eric for this, it was the gem of his awesome party. It was a festivus for the rest of us. Pours a dark brown color with a very thick light beige colored head. A awesome aroma of sweet fruits, chocolates, some coffee and just loads of milky sweet chocolate and mocha. The taste was excellent, sweet and milky chocolate and coffee, dark fruits, maybe some fudge. So very, very smooth and almost silky. Not aggressive, but excellent. The aging has done wonders to this, no alcohol noticed at all really. What a rarity and a wonder. One of my favorite beers ever. Re-rate: Eric shared a 2010 growler of this. It was hot, nasty and super aggressive. Pure goodness. Not the complex beer it was with four years on it, but still super good. A great brew 821 charactersDouglas88, Nov 10, 2010

Jet black pour with 1/2" of espresso colored head. The head slowly dissipates before the 1st sip. Hot fudge, molasses, french roast ground coffee aroma.
Touch of bourbon sour at first. As it warmed, the sour bourbon released a little. Coffee and bourbon and bourbon. Drinking like a raspberry framboise with a tad of coffee. Quite sour...drink now. 446 charactersRustyDiamond, Sep 30, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours an oily black with no apparent carbonation. Fully opaque. A little swirling the snifter kicks up a few bubbles, then goes back to still blackness. Aroma is sweet, and quite fruity; Dark fruits, that is. Just a little coffee on the nose, with cherry and plum/prune. Just a little wood and bourbon aroma. The flavor is pretty huge on this one, way bigger and more complex than the regular Speedway. Very tarry, lots of cigar smoke, leather, booze is alive and present. Huge espresso is present, with dark chocolate. Sweet, but not an all-out sugar assault. Again, there is dark, smoky tar throughout. Extremely chewy. Only faintly bitter. If you swish it around in your mouth, you get some more carbonation, as you can almost feel the cavities developing in your teeth. I'm glad I got to try this. Definitely not a session beer (Of course if you're reading this, you likely already knew that. I mean, like anybody other than the CEO of Alesmith would have the means to session this anyway.), but very soulful for just a glass now and then.

Aroma of nutty fudge, bourbon, oak, vanilla, light coffee, liquid amazingness, florals and soil. I literally smelled this beer for 15 minutes without tasting a single sip. Taste is chocolate, coffee, oaky, brandy, bourbon and a bit nutty. Very smooth and silky mouthfeel. 508 charactersBMan1113VR, Sep 10, 2010

2003 vintage - Bottle 169/196 aged at 55 degrees since the release a few years ago - thanks me. 
The beer is black with a diminutive light brown head that quickly fades. The aroma is of chocolate sugar cookies and a graceful oxidation character with light soy sauce and vanilla notes. Bourbon is well integrated. Brown sugar is evident. Decadence itself. The flavor is chocolate desserts of all sorts: truffles, cake, brown sugar cookies...you name it! The beer has aged gracefully, evincing light soy sauce notes that compliment the smooth bourbon flavor. Oak is detectable, in addition to subtle dark fruits (prunes?). Coffee is nonexistent. Carbonation is low, and it works well with the rich flavors. An outstanding beer, and one that I probably won't see again. 778 charactersHopHead84, Jul 21, 2010

Pours an oily black with a thick espresso head. Excellent lace and retention.
Nose has freah roated coffee, bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark pitted fruits, chocolate, dark candies, big malts and molasses.
Beautiful blend of espresso, wood, whiskey, vanilla, plums, figs, dates, roasty malts, cocoa, caramel and toffee.
Thick, creamy body is perfectly carbonated. Perhaps a bit past age, but still a lovely beer. Peaks closer to 5 years. 461 charactersrye726, May 31, 2010

A- Poured a black color in the glass. One finger mocha colored head has good retention. Light soapy lacing left on the sides of the glass. 
S- Nice roasted malts in the front of this. Hints of vanilla, bourbon, and oak linger throughout the aroma overall. Light oxidation which I expected a little bit toward the middle. The chocolate malts this comeout toward the end with a semi-sweet kick in the nose. 
T- I pick up a nice roasted malt upfront with a light chocolate coffee undertone throughout the entire beer. The coffee flavor isn't as strong as I thought it would be but...there could be a lot worse than that. Vanilla and bourbon make this beer have a light warming sensation. Oaky notes come through toward the middle to end. Light oxidation with this that stays from start to finish. I could do without that but once again it almost goes with the beer by the end.
M- Heavy mouthfeel. Carbonation was good for the style and age on it. Roasted malts with light oxidation left on the palate with some bourbon like notes in the aftertaste again with the oxidation. Flavors were bold for the age and I enjoyed it for that. Oxidation was bigger than I would have liked. 
D- This beer was great...period. The oxidation was not a deal breaker with the beer. I had no problem drinking the bottle over a hour and a half period. I am glad I saved this bottle but it should be drank sometime here soon before the oxidation takes over the entire beer. The ABV makes this a one and done but also one bottle is good enough. 1,593 charactersalleykatking, May 30, 2010

Pours black with a half-finger brown head. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving decent lacing.
Smells of robust roasted malts with large amounts of dark chocolate and vanilla. Also present are solid amounts of butterscotch (it seems to be a trend with AleSmith BA beers) and hints of molasses. Finally, coffee aromas linger in the background.
Tastes very good. Roasted malt flavors kick things off and are joined by mildly sweet molasses and butterscotch shortly thereafter. Dark chocolate flavors work their way into things midway through the sip. Near the end of the sip mild amounts of vanilla flavors make an appearance before fading into a mildly bitter ending. There's also a bit of alcohol burn that lingers but is nowhere near overpowering.
Mouthfeel is very good. It's got a very smooth thickness with grainy carbonation.
Drinkability is also very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall I thought this was a phenomenal beer however I'm not sure if I don't prefer the normal Speedway. I think the type of barrel AleSmith uses is more geared toward a stout that's not quite as big as Speedway, maybe one with bourbon that was on the boozier side would work better. Anyways, I'm grasping at straws here, give this one a shot. 1,322 charactersglid02, May 19, 2010

S: Oaky up front, along with some distinct hints of bourbon. Some coffee remains, although it's definitely faded compared to normal Speedway. Dark fruits lurk in the background, some figs and black cherries. A bit of burnt sugar and caramel, but very, very light.
T: Oak more subtle than on the nose with a bit more vanilla and bourbon. Dark fruits come in at the middle w/ chocolate and burnt coffee. Finishes with semi-sweet chocolate, vanilla, and hints of coffee.
M: Moderate to slightly above moderate bodied...velvety, creamy, and smooth all come to mind. Carbonation is low but enough to support a beer of this weight.
D: Flavors are well integrated and the barrel aging wasn't overdone...obviously it's not exactly quaffable, but I'm having no trouble working my way through a growler with a friend. 956 charactersXul, May 19, 2010

2007 vintage. Bottle number 205 of 447. This was sampled side-by-side with a regular Speedway Stout. The beer pours dark brown to black with a brown head. The aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malt, chocolate and alcohol. The flavor is awesome. I get bourbon, oak, semi-sweet chocolate, brown sugar and vanilla. The oak and tannic notes are very tart or bitter, giving the beer an almost sour quality. The coffee has completely faded. Medium-thick mouthfeel and low-medium carbonation. Not sure which I liked the best out of this and the non barrel-aged version because they are both awesome. Very happy I got to try this. 673 charactersMora2000, May 19, 2010

2007 vintage bottle #212. Poured into a tulip. Beer is black with a thin brown head that breaks and clings to the glass. Some (very little) lacing left on the glass and the carbonation is apparently low.
There is a woody / liquor sweet aroma to this beer. Smells great. Not a lot of alcohol but some sweetness and a hint of roasted malt.
Beer is really really smooth. Medium to full bodied, sweetness up front with an ever so slight amount of heat behind it. Oddly there is almost a late tartness to this beer. Its not lactic or acetic, the beer isn't going bad but there is a strong almost tannic character to the whole beer. I suppose this the result of the wood aging process. It is unexpected but does not interrupt the flow of the flavors in the mouth. Bitterness at the back is low but good. Overall a really good beer. I'd still like to do the side-by-side with the regular. 919 charactersdrabmuh, May 17, 2010

2007 vintage. Bottle 212/447
This beer pours a rich, deep black with a dark tan head. Plenty of carbonation left in this gem. This aroma is not subtle. Bourbon and rich roasted malt, with a slight alcohol note emit huge scents I can detect from a few feet away. The beer is absolutely fabulous. Although it is very strong and forward, it drinks very smoothly. It definitely has some heat to it, but it only serves to add a little warmth in the finish. Alesmith Speedway Stout is a terrific beer, so it makes sense that barrel aging such a tasty stout would result in this masterpiece. What a treat. 660 charactersHuhzubendah, May 17, 2010

A: Pours a nearly pitch black body with a billowy dark mocha head; it retains well and leaves a substantial collar on the brew. Quite nice for a beer of this style and gravity. 
S: Great aroma. Lots of chocolate, toasted marshmallow, vanilla, bourbon, caramel. I pick up hints of sherry-like oxidation, coffee, oak, and earth. 
T: I let it warm to have the full flavor come out. It's incredibly complex, but the oxidation dominates this beer, too much for my tastes. It introduces a light tartness, sherry / wine, and salty soy. Those aren't deal-breakers in barrel-aged beers anymore, but they have an optimal concentration, and this beer exceeds that. Still, the rest of the flavor isn't irredeemable: it's chocolatey, coffee-driven, and earthy. It has a nice caramelly bourbon to it, and I pick up toasted oak in the finish. 
M: Full in flavor, medium in viscosity. Good carbonation. No heat. 
D: It comes together a lot better as it warms, but I am never in love with it. I'm glad I had it, as I was very curious about this one, but I'm not breaking the cellar for it in the future. The fresher one out of a growler was more to my liking. 1,236 charactersArbitrator, May 17, 2010

S - Very sweet smelling, lots of vanilla, chocolate, and a nice sweet bourbon smell that doesn't seem like it is going to be too hot. Seems to be one of the sweeter big stouts I've smelled, but not sugary sweet, more of a very rich, deep sweetness.
T - I've had most of the top imperial stouts, and this one holds it's own with the best in the taste department. Lot of chocolate with vanilla notes, very sweet and smooth. It's definately boozy, but not sharply so. You feel the heat on this one, but it's a decent compliment to the sweetness. I thought the regular version of Speedway stout was solid, but not as good as it seems to rate, but the barrel-aged version is just ridiculously good tasting.
M - Thick, with a bit of stick to it, decent amount of carbonation, a bit low, although this was a 2004 bottle.
D - Runs a tad hot, but still definately above average all things considered in the drinkability department. 1,021 charactersAgentZero, May 13, 2010

I've been sitting on it for quite some time but what better time to break it out than for losing a bet with Scoobydank. Drank from a specialty Sam Adams glasses.
2006 version bottle #68 of 233
Appearance- Pours a pitch ass black with a big beautiful one finger dark tan head. A decent cap and collar is maintained the entire beer along with a fair amount of spotty lacing.
Smell- Sweet and caramelly with a big bourbon boozy thing erupting out of my glass. A bit of chocolate and coffee but nothing with the potency of the original. The bourbon and wood are very overpowering and totally take over the base beer that is Speedway Stout. Plenty of vanilla makes its way through along with a bit of light caramel.
Taste- Wow, the taste is so much more soft and balanced than the nose. A bracing bit of fruitiness from a big hoppy bite right from the get go. The original Speedway isn't really present in this beer (meaning the huge coffee and chocolate) but there is a bit of an acrid roastiness present. Plenty of wood and vanilla though as the barrel is crazy intense - bourbon galore. A fair amount of caramel though as there is a lightly bitter finish from the malt roast.
Mouthfeel- Big and rich and heavy with a very light bit of carbonation that lends itself to a nice creamy feel.
Drinkability- Not bad but honestly I'd much rather have the original. The barrel just covers all the great aspects of Speedway and doesn't help to make it better. Yes, it's still very good but for how limited it is but there are other barrel aged brews out there that are slightly better. One of the few beers that I prefer the regular to the barrel aged. Thanks Matt! 1,725 charactersyounger35, May 11, 2010

Invited over a few friends that evening and busted this one open. What a great beer! Poured into my Portsmouth snifter (more than once, of course!) and savored the flavor. 
Extremely dark and thick pour. The head billowed up a dark, dark brown and then subtly changed to a dark tan. Fairly quickly, the head diminished to just a thin layer but left behind some thick blotchy lace around the sides.
Wow, what a sweet smelling beer. My first thought was this smells like s'mores. Seriously - very sweet, marshmallow / vanilla nose that was very intriguing. Some sweet chocolate in there as well. I spent quite some time smelling this thing before I ever considered taking a drink. In fact, I was over at Wine Wednesday at the time with about 20 other people (non BAs), and I had a lot of them smell it because I thought it was so "different"...in a good way. There is definitely a whiskey component at the finish that reminds you how this sucker was created. Goodness.
The first thing that struck me upon my initial drink was how much thicker this was than I had would have guessed. Thick and sticky (which I love). The taste starts off with dark and sweet notes. Vanilla coffee is present, but quickly turns to a slight whiskey burn. It is a fairly alcoholic tasting beer. Throughout the session I get several varying tastes but nothing detracts; they all work very well together. There are some dark chocolate undertones that peek out every now and then as well. A very, very nice flavor...would be perfect if that alcohol was just a bit more subtle.
This was definitely an unexpected treat; thanks again, Ryan, for such generosity. We all very much enjoyed this beer. I had three glasses of it and would have gone back for more if I hadn't invited this many friends. It is a tad bit hot, but apparently not enough to really slow us down. Will definitely look to try this one again down the road.

A: Inky black, with a brown head giving testimony to the colour of the brew. Retention is quite nice and there's plenty left behind on the glass. 
S + T: Vanilla, chocolate, mocha, caramel all make . A comment at the table was that it's like being in a candy store, and that's probably the perfect statement. As it warms, it all comes out a lot more - though nothing is really excessive. Just a nice balance of a lot of bigger flavours and aromas. 
M + D: Creamy and full bodied with a little bit of crisp carbonation to keep everything in balance. With such a huge ABV, the alcohol is verging on deceiving in how well hidden it is. There's really no sign of any heat at all. Very nice, and something that comes across far nicer than what I remember from the original. 828 charactersProteus93, Apr 30, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5HUGE thanks to Kevin for sharing this growler with us!
A-Body is big, thick and opaque black. Pours with a 1-2 finger creamy dark tan head. Head fades eventually to a thick collar but plenty of lacing sticks all the way down the glass.
S- Exceptional. A delicate balance between bourbon BA characteristics and IRS characteristics. Very complex and slightly sweet-of moderate strength. Vanilla, oak, a slight hint of bourbon sweetness, dark chocolate, anise, dark fruit. Just wonderful.
T-Flavor is just as good as the nose but adds a slight roasted malt component to it. Upfront is a lot of IRS characteristics-dark fruit, anise, licorice, dark chocolate-and offers a bit of vanilla and bourbon sweetness and the slightest hint of oak in the background. A hint of roasted malt comes through for the finish to create an equal balance to the slightly sweet initial flavor. Some remnants of the initial flavor linger as well as a slight roasted malt bitterness.
M- Low to medium carbonation and a body that is thick, viscous, and exceptionally smooth and creamy. 
D- This is one of the best stouts I have ever had. The BA components compliment the stout characteristics very well and this is worlds better than regular speedway-seem like 2 completely different beers. The flavors are really big here but it is not nearly as aggressive as regular speedway. Great to try the 2 side by side! 1,390 charactersPittBeerGirl, Apr 29, 2010

S-the nose is amazing, it isn't huge but it is strong. Oak and vanilla set in right up front with a touch of bourbon sitting behind. Dark chocolate, chocolate brownies, toffee and a touch off caramel in the back
T-the taste is awesome. The oak and vanilla great the taste buds with the bourbon quietly coming in right after. Molasses comes in next and fades into dark chocolate, some bitter cocoa, and hints of coffee. Sweetness comes in at the back, toffee and a touch of caramel with some notes of dark fruits
M-huge mouthfeel, completely full bodied and thick, almost chewy. It is soft, smooth and creamy on the palate. So great!
D-this is a delicious imperial stout. The flavors are spot on, nothing dominates but the barrel aging works perfectly and smoothes out the feel so well. Awesome beer! 967 characterscpetrone84, Apr 29, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks goes out to Mothman for sharing this growler he got at our small pre-DLD tasting. Thanks to whoever sent this to Mothman!
Pours pitch black with about of half finger of tan head. Was expecting the head to be darker, but thats nitpicking. Surprised this is as carbonated as it is, good sign so far. Leaves some nice blotchy lacing.
The nose is lighter than I imagined it would be. I get virtually no coffee, and for the life of me can't decide what barrel's this was aged in. In the nose, bourbon seems out of the question, as it gives off a sweeter smell, like Whiskey or Rum. I get a light vanilla like character, but mostly chocolate and dark roasted malts.
The taste is smooth and creamy, with dark roasted malts, velvety chocolate with a soft woody character. Still having a hard time deciding on what barrel this is, but based on others reviews I guess it's bourbon? That wasn't my first guess.
Smooth and creamy, with a medium to heavy body. Lighter than I expected. Soft carbonation. Drinkability is surpringly good. I had no problem finishing my two generous pours.
Overall, I'm extremely grateful to try this once in a lifetime gem. It wasn't exactly what I hoped it would be, but a stellar beer none the less. Thanks a bunch, Ben! 1,256 charactersMistofminn, Apr 27, 2010

A - Pours black, mocha/tan head, slim cap on top, and good lacing along the sides of the glass. This one was pretty sticky.
S - Chocolate, slight bourbon, oak, dark fruits, slight coffee, burnt sugars, dark malts. Lots going on here all very-well balanced. 
T - Lots of chocolate (both milk and dark), slight coffee, slight bourbon. I was expecting a little more bourbon and coffee notes on this one, but I ended up enjoying how it was balanced in between the chocolate/coffee/bourbon.
M - Medium to full, rich, smooth, light carbonation. 
D - I had 4 or 5 tasting glasses worth, and I would have had more if it wasn't for everyone else breaking out more awesome beers. I really enjoyed this one. I'd def get another growler but obviously, you'll need several people to split this one with. 955 charactersSean9689, Apr 26, 2010
4.54/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Doodler for the hookup on this one! Poured from an 8oz. hand-bottled swingtop growler into a Bruery tulip.
A: AleSmith only uses Mobil 1 in this baby. Some carbonation sticks around from the straightdown pour. Has a nice mocha color to balance the black beer. With a few swirls of the glass I notice it sticks to the side - sign of a good beer to me.
S: The best feature of this beer. A deep breath yields toffee, butter pecan, and rich chocolate notes. As it warms up I also get some fresh baked brownies and maple syrup aroma.
T: Sweet malts lead to a creamy caramel flavor. Chocolate, rum esters, and bitterness from the hops weave their way into the brew. This beer is well-layered and definitely improves as it warms up.
M: If you're a carb freak you might be disappointed. However, I think this beer does just fine without it because of it's "chewy" aspect.
D: Pretty solid for 12%. I don't get the squinty eyes from other BA beers that bring the motherload of booze. Also, as much as it smells syrupy, it's not.
Overall, a rare treat to get to try. Thanks Scott! 1,085 charactershoppymcgee, Apr 22, 2010

A- Black as night. 1-2 fingers of light chocolatey colored head. Leaves a nice light lacing as you progress through the glass. 
S- Smells mostly of bourbon, with somelight coffee and chocolate notes. Also a distinct taste of dark malts and molasses.
T- Despite it's strong bourbon smell, it is actually quite subdued. Has a nice balance of Bourbon/Coffee/Chocolate, with a strong malty aftertaste. Almost reminds me of a KBS that isn't as soft/smooth, and has a little more backbone. It is very complex, and transitions through several flavors over a few seconds.
D- Alchohol is barely noticible for a BA Stout. I easily plowed through 2 glasses, and was looking for more.
M- Perfect balance of body and flavor. Not too light and not too thick. The carbonation and everything is just spot on
As a lover of BA Stouts, this is one of my favorites. I wish I had a keg of this stuff, as I looked forward to coming home to it the last couple nights. Awsome awsome beer, hopefully I'll get to have it again sometime 1,144 charactersGfunk720, Apr 22, 2010
4.24/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Doodler hooks me up again! Served from a flip top bottle filled from a tap - I'm callin' this one a growler. 
A: Pours pitch black with virtually no head to speak of - just a very fine ring of tannish bubbles around the perimeter of the glass. I think this one has lost a good amount of carbonation since the bottle was filled. 
S: So sweet and luscious! Definitive aromas of milk chocolate and molasses, mixed with a large dose of sweet vanilla extract and bourbon. Smells a little "hot" too, if that's at all possible. 
T: A good amount of chocolate, molasses, and oak up front. Not as much vanilla and bourbon in the flavor as in the nose, but both still definitely come through towards the finish. A little hop bitterness is also evident in the finish, which provides some nice balance. I think a little oxidation has sneaked its way into this bottle too, but it doesn't really detract from the overall experience. New layers of chocolate and buttery vanilla flavor come out as the quaff warms. The alcohol also becomes a little more apparent. 
M: Thick and full bodied. The lack of carbonation detracts form things very little. In fact, a decently strong bite of alcohol in the finish mostly compensates for the lack of bubbly stimulation. 
D: Admittedly, I probably did not review this beer under the best circumstances and I may have given it better marks fresh from the tap. That being said, however, as is it's a wonderful beer with many layers of complexity. I'll definitely seek this out fresh in the future, but I already really like it. 1,554 charactersMrDanno96, Apr 20, 2010

Flavor again is more strong coffee, oak, bourbon, cream, toffee, booze, and just a hint of paper. Silky smooth mouthfeel. Some hint of the abv. I really liked this one, but after everything was said and done I almost prefer the non BA speedway. I did here from a few folks I shared this with it wasn't up to par with other bottles tasted. Still though, I'm so glad I finally got to try this. 454 characterspepsican, Apr 19, 2010

A - Black as oil. No head and no lacing, but this may be due to the fact that the growler was opened two days prior to my tasting.
S - Oak and bourbon are apparent from the get-go. Alcohol is easily detected, as are hints of roasted coffee and malted milk.
T - Wow - this beer fires on all cylinders in the taste department. The taste of bourbon is strong from start to finish, as are the dark chocolate and espresso notes. Despite tasting toffee and caramelized sugars, the hops and barley are blended to perfection and keep this from being too sweet. This finishes with suggestions of dried fruits and more bourbon. The taste of this beer is seriously outstanding, and as you'd expect, it grows by leaps and bounds as it warms.
M - Satin-smooth, this has a great level of viscosity for an imperial stout. The fact that it was slightly less carbonated than I'd prefer is no doubt due to the growler having previously been opened.
D - Excellent drinkability for a beer of this magnitude; this is extremely complex and rich in flavor, and I'm upset that I don't have at least a few more ounces to enjoy.
What a beer - I can't wait to have this again sometime down the road! At least one of the people who I shared my growler with exclaimed that this is the best beer that they've ever had. It's easily among my tops as well. 1,361 charactersklikger, Apr 18, 2010

Seriously, this was the best imperial stout I've ever had. The mouthfeel was the real high point, and I wish there was a way to rate it a 6. This beer is milk smooth. Unbelievable. The bourbon was present but not overwhelming, the coffee was still available if you really taste closely, and the vanilla flavors from the barrel were perfect. A one shot that won't be found again. Epic. 469 characterssquaremile, Apr 17, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5There's nothing quite like waking up to a phone call where the person goes "Hey, I was just at Alesmith and they had growlers of BA Speedway and I figured you'd want one". Thank you, Shane. I split this with a few friends on Sunday, but given that the past couple of days have cemented that I will actually be graduating this summer, I feel like I've earned a healthy 16oz pour as a nightcap.
Jet black with a dense dark brown head with great retention and lacing, this beer looks great. The nose is intense. I get a big chocolate character with licorice, a surprising amount of coffee and of course, the big barrel character with bourbon, vanilla and some coconut. The second pour a couple of days later has picked up some great oxidation as well, lending a light fruitiness to the beer. The palate opens with a big, wet barrel character with a big hit of bourbon and vanilla, warming and quite intense coupled with some oak. Chocolate, chocolate wafer, a delicate creaminess, and some licorice are all noticeable. Like the BA Decadence (Imperial Porter), this does exhibit a character that Alesmith has found to coax out of their barrel aged beers, a decadent chocolate milk character. The balance of flavors is exquisite. Full in body, this beer is particularly smooth with a soft, lush carbonation and a ridiculous finish with a blend of dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and a slight oak tannin character, as well as a little bitterness. Quite an exceptional beer.
Letting the beer sit in the growler for a few days brings out more fruity oxidation in this beer, really reminding me in some ways of the 03 BA Speedway, but it doesn't match up in the richness or breathtaking beauty that that beer is. All told, though, this is an exceptional beer, one that I feel lucky to have had a chance to try. 1,804 charactersDefenCorps, Apr 16, 2010

A - Pours a vicious and viscous pitch black with a finger width of mocha head...it dissipates fairly quickly and leaves a decent amount of lacing on the glass for a BA stout.
S - lots of bourbon up front. It's also maybe just a tad bit briney. There are chocolate notes that come through, though they are faint. The coffee is faint.
T - Speedway on crack, in an awesome way! I get lots of toffee and roast mixed in with some bourbon and coffee. The bourbon lingers perfectly.
M - Heavy body with mild carbonation. Really can't get much better. There's a slight coffee aftertaste.
D - Too good. I could drink way too much of it.
I'm so lucky to have had this 2 miles from my house. Cost me a lot to help out a couple of friends, but it was well worth it as a it's a special treat to be able to try this beer. 914 charactersKaiser81, Apr 16, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +7.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Headed down to Alesmith first thing I could to grab a growler of this beast. 
Pours thick and a black that looks like you took used motor oil and tossed in some extra black. Not a ton of head but what does show up is thick and creamy. A chocolate brown hue, some lacing. 
Smell is pretty intense. I instantly get a whiff of the barrel on there but with further investigation I get more of the roasted malt and chocolate profile perking up. Roasted sweetness. Smells great. 
Taste follows directly behind smell but it is kicked up a notch. It is so surprising to me how well balanced this is. The majority of barrel aged stouts that I have had in my experience have been hot messes at the start but the growler of speedway is near perfection. Vanilla notes play well with others of cocoa and a big malt backbone.
12 percent is nearly impossible to pinpoint. Creamy mouth feel that just keeps dancing around my taste buds screaming for me to have more. 
Overall this is an incredibly well made beer and one that truly lends itself to the barrel aging process. My only qualm is that it is not readily available. 1,113 charactersMauerhan, Apr 13, 2010

The aroma was terrific - lightly bourbon-y with some coffee and toasted chocolate as well - very different from regular speedway. Taste is great as well - not overdone on the barrel-aging as some recent stouts have seemd to me. Love the mouthfeel - very thick and oily. Nice and easy to drink as well.
 Went nicely with the brownie cakes made from the leftover regular speedway growler and drizzled with speedway caramel sauce. 518 charactersbobjonesSD, Apr 12, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Generously shared by Dyan yesterday.
BA Speedway pours an impressive blackish brown color with great head retention and plenty of sticky lacing. The beer looks impressive, but then I took the first sniff. Mama mia!!! The nose on this bad boy is just stunning, with coffee, malt balls, chocolate milkshake and vanilla. This beer smells wonderful and imparts one of the most impressive aroma profiles I've ever come across. The flavor profile generally replicates the nose, but is not quite as intense and complex. The chocolate milkshake and coffee take center stage on the palate, and the stout is pretty sweet. Yet that sweetness never seems over the top or cloying. Mouthfeel is outrageous in this one; this beer is so soft, plush, creamy and smooth. The finish seems to last forever. Alcohol is noticeable, but it in no way detracts from the drinkability in this fine beer. 
Easily one of the best stouts I've ever encountered. It doesn't have the complexity of the Abyss, but scores very high in the decadence category. So rich and fine.... this is delicious stuff.
Dyan opened a bottle of the regular Speedway to compare the two.... while regular speedway is delicious, the BA version is just in a completely different league. Wow!
Thanks Dyan! 1,253 charactersJohn_M, Apr 12, 2010

A: Pours coal black with a thin and creamy dark khaki colored head. Retention was fleeting but when this was swirled, it showed off some pretty legs.
S: I was surprised by how restrained the bourbon aroma was. It, by all means, is there but slightly in the background. Heavily roasted malt, espresso, and dark fruit.
T: See above. Barrel flavor comes on strong during the late middle and on through the finish. Bourbon was more pronounced here than in the aroma. Again, loads of coffee, blackened malt, and raisins.
M: I found this to be a little on the thin side for such a big stout. Don't gete me wrong, it's still huge, but a little less full and coating than I expected. Maybe that helped the drinkability score? Finishes tannic, dry, and ashy.
D: Pretty excellent. I felt that this is more drinkable than regular Speedway which I find to be pretty hot and bitter, as of late. Actually this drank like a 6-7% stout. How do they hide that? 1,120 charactersGbVDave, Apr 12, 2010

A: Pitch black with quickly receding tan head that provides good lacing.
S: Heavy on the bourbon and oak with dark chocolate, vanilla, cherry cola, and strong espresso. Very decadent and can't wait to dig in.
T: Surprisingly, the dark fruit is the most dominant flavor, with lots of cherry and plum. The coffee is still present, and bourbon, vanilla, oak, and chocolate is there in full force too. The coffee has provided a nice bitterness that balances out the sweet caramel and toffee flavors.
M: Definitely on the thin side for a barrel aged stout, with very little carbonation and an oaky dry finish.
D: Although definitely a sipping beer, it is so decadent and complex and goes down so smooth.
Overall this is a fantastic bourbon barrel stout and the coffee, chocolate, and cherry flavors make it one of the best. 955 charactersbmanning, Apr 11, 2010
4.91/5  rDev +9.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was fortunate enough to take a half-day on Thursday and get down to Alesmith to try and purchase a growler of this wonderful stuff. Can life get better? I submit that it cannot.
A: Poured motor-oil thick and black into my Bruery tulip glass. What was disappointing was the lack of head and lacing, but I can contribute some of that to the growler. A few quick swirls develop a head, but the retention was mild at best. 
S: Sweet bourbon and caramel off the bat with hints of sticky molasses, vanilla, cocoa and coffee towards the backend. The barrel is strong, but enhances all the other smells instead of overpowering them. 
T: The first sip (impression) is a combination of complex flavors that almost makes my palate quiver. Coffee, vanilla, wood, and caramel seem to be the first wave of flavors I pick up. Tons of molasses, bitter-burnt chocolate, and residual sugar are next in line and make up most of the middle. The coffee, which seems subdued for most of the sip, seems to really come through towards the finish. 
M: Creamy, full-bodied, and quite sticky at times. The finish is slightly dry, which may be due to the high attenuation this beer experienced and/or coffee. 
D: Extremely drinkable; no alcohol bite at all and flavor profile is among the best I've ever tried. 
Overall: Vastly different/better than the bottled version I tried a few years back. The complexities that the barrel imparted on this year's Speedway were amazing, to say the least. I can't think of another beer that used the barrel aging process as well as this. I must try. Cheers! 1,575 charactersOlieIPA, Apr 10, 2010

2007 Vintage bottle 412 of 447.
A-Deep black/brown with a never reducing thin tan head that left a surprising amount of streaky lace.
S-Musty oak and bourbon notes reside underneath decadent dark chocolate, rich, fresh tilled earth and espresso bitterness. Extremely rich and complex.
T-Rich, dark chocolate with lighter accenting bourbon notes in support. Dark, sour cherries, espresso and oak reside in the drying finish. Immensely complex and Oh! so tasty!
M-Medium bodied, amazingly smooth with long lingering flavours and a bitter kick accompanying the oak dryness.
D-Really--is this a question? I love regular Speedway and this is that taken to another level--BIG TIME! Simply an outstanding barrel aged brew. I wish it wasn't so damn rare and limited. I would be happy to drink this anytime. 960 charactersDeuane, Apr 05, 2010

Not much retention or lacing, goes down to zero bubbles pretty quickly. Slight coating effect from the alcohol, but no legs or church windows. The aroma is plums, bourbon, brown sugar, black treacle, coconut, coffee, and oak. The barrel presence is quite real and stronger than the bottles I have tasted from time to time, as this growler would be fresher out of the oak. The flavor has cocoa, oak, bourbon, raisin, and even some olive and spiciness to it. Roasted coffee and cookielike malts on the finish. The body is medium to full with some nice oily thickness to it, but still a bit thinner I would expect. Quite a nice beer, somewhat boozy, though I like some nice bourbon flavors. I will have a couple glasses. 793 charactersvacax, Apr 05, 2010

bourbon and coffee meld wonderfully...coffee up front and bourbon in the rear...so many avenues to explore here, but I'll let it go. Wave after wave of dark chocolate as this beer warms. Wood from the barrel is increasingly evident. Just thoroughly enjoyable.
Body is slightly oily, lightly carbonated, and a bit thin for the heft of this beauty.
Alcohol content is well hidden in this incredibly crafted, highly enjoyable stout. A real treat. 534 charactersBarrytheBear, Apr 05, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Trey for bringing this gem to our tasting. Bottle 60/196 from 2003, this was a highlight of the tasting. Number 12 on day 2 and number 21 overall. Poured into a snifter.
Pours pitch black and extremely viscous. There is no head at all, nor is there any hint of carbonation. I guess that years in bourbon barrels will do that to ya. Upon swirling, nice legs form on the sides of my glass. This is one classy-looking beer.
The nose is phenomenal, as AleSmith shows of their ability to do barrel aging better than, in my estimation, any brewery out there. Coffee, chocolate, caramel, toffee, vanilla, and bourbon all come through in the nose, completely masking any alcohol aroma that may be present. Additionally, the bourbon and oakey vanilla are more highlighting factors than they are focal points. This is how I like my barrel-aged beers to smell.
On the palate, the complexity begins to grow and expand. Added to the nice balance of chocolate, vanilla, toffee, and bourbon are dark fruity flavors of dates and prunes. There is also a nice nutty syrup twinge that comes through towards the finish. The finish is full of well-balanced mellow bourbon and vanilla. Dark chocolate lingers on the palate afterwards.
Smooth and almost creamy, this beer is a case study is how a barrel aged beer should be created. The fact that there is no carbonation works extremely well, and the consistency is not syrupy either. The body is great, and the drinking experience phenomenal. 1,484 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Apr 04, 2010

S: Lovely... Bourbon, oak, vanilla, espresso, caramel, general roasty goodness.
T: The bourbon here is sublime... all the flavor without much of the burn. Earthy oak and vanilla are present along with profound coffee and espresso flavors. Nice caramel underbelly with perhaps a little brown sugar.
M: Moderate-heavy bodied. Oily, smooth and lightly carbonated. Nice finish that lingers for a few seconds without any burning sensation from the bourbon.
D: Truly top notch. I think this vintage is just about at its peak. It was sublimely delicate and complex. Would easily seek out another bottle if anyone is trading! 766 characterscallmemickey, Mar 29, 2010

4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this on tap at the City Beer Store Alesmith event during SF Beer week.
The Bourbon Barrel Aged Speedway Stout is 12.5%, just a .5% more than their regular Speedway Stout. It poured an eclipse black with some light cream. It smelled like bourbon, malt, espresso, but not too overwhelmingly bourbon. It tasted like toasted malts, bourbon, but no burn. It was incredibly smooth for 12.5% and seemed more like it was created using Irish whiskey barrels perhaps? You don't get much vanilla or coconut flavors out of it- just a hint. Seems reminiscent of the Deschuttes XXI. Overall, pretty tasty. 595 charactersfemALEist, Mar 25, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52007 edition, bottle #280 of 447. Shared by Grant with some of the usual suspects- thanks very much for the opportunity, Grant! This is an exquisite beer. The barrel aging rounds out the flavors, adds a touch of creaminess, and some nice counterbalancing flavors as well as some nice drying notes from the wood. Pours a very dark brown with a relatively thin swirly head. Amazing nose, with wonderful Bourbon notes that complement the stout rather than overwhelming it. Sweet and creamy with deep notes of roastiness and nicely merged coffee and bourbon. The taste showcases a perfect marriage of drying woody notes, a touch of coconut, sweet rich bourbon finish, and nice creamy roastiness. Super creamy in the mouth and just ridiculously easy to suck down, especially given the very high abv. A very nice example of where barrel aging enhances rather than overwhelms a beer. Superb. 884 charactersGeorgiabeer, Mar 11, 2010
4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Churchill's Renaissance.
Appearance is jet black. Thin head dissapated fast. Left a ring. No lacing.
Aroma is tons of dark fruits, caramel, toasted sugars. Very complex. Some bourbon in the nose.
Tastes exactly as it smells with a good bourbon flavor that doesn't take over and let's the other flavors play as well.
Mouthfeel is heavy with nice carb.
Overall a damn fine beer that I am glad shows up every once in a while. 437 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Mar 06, 2010

Pours a solid black with a stingy tan head that dissipates quickly to a cap on top. Smells of coffee, vanilla, chocolate, dark fruits and prunes, with and oaky alcohol edge. The taste is filled with rich coffee and chocolates sprinkled with and oaky plum sweetness and a touch of alcohol. Hints of coconut and vanilla show up to the party but hide in the kitchen. Fairly thick body with a full creamy almost acridic mouthfeel and light carbonation. I am sad to say that I have enjoyed my last bottle of this fine brew. Intensely complex and damn tasty, I wish this was more available. 646 charactersjohnnnniee, Mar 05, 2010

2007 Vintage
A: Pours a deep dark black hue with a small tan head. No retention or lace.
S: aromas of bold dark fruit, mild notes of chocolate with a touch of oak.
T: Raisin, Raisin, and more raisin. This one is dripping with dark fruit flavors. It is supported by a bit of chocolate and coffee as well. The barrel is very very mild. Very light oak, no vanilla or booze to speak of.
M: On the fuller side of medium, nicely carbonated.
D: Good, wish it had a bit more roast and a bit more barrel though to be honest. 608 characterstpd975, Mar 03, 2010

S: Roasty and coffee predominantly. Also chocolate. A little booze and toffee malty sweetness around as well.
A: Jet black w/brn thick head. 
T: Vanilla and wood dominate this one. Coffee along w/the delcious maltiness and roastiness. Vanilla and wood dominate this one., chocolate, toffee notes. A little boozy presence but the etoh is well hidden for sure.
M/D: Thick and velvety sublime mouthfeel. Drinkability is definitely impressive for ABV. 
Overall: Bal-aging thins the body just a bit, and really balances out the coffee roast of regular speedway. I have to say that side by side I like this a bit better. 638 charactersbret27, Feb 28, 2010

Tonight, they had a barrel-aged beer night, which included eight different barrel-aged beers. This one was by far our favorite of the five that we tried (with Firestone 12th Anniversary Ale a close second). To me, this came across as the best a stout can offer: full-bodied with all the flavors you would expect, but not too sweet or too strong or too heavy on the chocolate or coffee notes. A perfect balance, just right! 513 charactersstricklandia, Feb 25, 2010

a - Pours a dark black with about a finger of brownish head. Poured a darker color than the 08 Speedway.
s - I thought it smelled similiar to the 08 Speedway, which was mostly coffee and bourbon. Also smelled a little chocolate and some roasted malts.
t - Tastes like coffe and was a lot sweeter than I was expecting. Also has a vanilla bourbon taste to it. Very smooth.
m - Full bodied, this was very smooth and easy to drink.
d - Overall I really liked this stout. I liked the 08 Speedway, but thought this was a lot better. Very smooth for 12% ABV and I'd love to try this again sometime. 727 charactersmdfb79, Feb 23, 2010

Good looking stout. Smells of toasty malty bourbon with hints of coffee. Taste is sweeter than expected, malty, chocolate, coffee and bourbon. Smooth and rich with some alcohol burn in the finish, especially as it warms up. Delicious, complex, well rounded beer. Easy to drink with a nice full bodied mouthfeel.

A: Pours an extremely dark and mildly thick motor oil black with a lighter than expected two-finger head with nice retention leaving some sticky lace.
S: Has all the elements of the regular Speedway; coffee and roasted malt with just a faint hint of dark, bitter chocolate, but this clearly enhanced with a wonderful wave of vanilla bourbon. 
T: Like the original, coffee is certainly the dominating force with this Imperial Stout and it does so in a very effective way. Seems quite fresh with some espresso-like qualities with a great degree of roasted malt and some hints of chocolate in a dark and bitter form. The barrel aging adds a whole new dimension to this beer with some nice sticky bourbon and layers of vanilla.
M: I found this to be slightly thinner than expected, but had some nice creaminess and moderate carbonation
D: Quite easy to drink especially for a 12% BA Imperial Stout.
In my oppinion this was a nice, but subtle improvement over the its non-BA brother, adding some nice dimension and character to an already stellar brew. Thanks again Mac! 1,232 charactersLunch, Feb 18, 2010

Pours black, black, black. Nice light brown head that is about one finger thick. 
Smells of bourbon and coffee. The taste starts bitter like a very dark chocolate and espresso beans. Leaves behind an aftertaste of vanilla and caramel. Mouthfeel is perfect for the style as it is thick without being syrupuy or sticky and it is generously carbonated. The beer is very easy to drink, especially for a 12%, not hot like some other RIS's out there. 487 charactersthedindaniel, Feb 17, 2010

A dense black in the snifter with wisps of dark lacing around the glass. 
Smells sweet and creamy. Lots of dark fruit, raisins, cherries, caramel and oaky bourbon. One of the best smells I've ever had the pleasure to sniff.
Taste is not nearly as sweet as the smell. Lots of coffee pops up that just isn't in the smell. Tons of oak tannins, bourbon, prunes, cherries and dark caramel with chocolate.
Feels dense and lush, very heavy and creamy. A definite sipper; took me quite a long time to finish, maybe because I wanted to savor it. I can understand why this is so sought after. 633 characterskirok1999, Feb 10, 2010

Thanks to BA member McAllister for sharing this bad boy
Pours a deep rich black with a very thin bubbly tan head. Slight lacing on the glass.
Smells of a stellar blend of bourbon, chocolate, and roasted coffee. Tastes of oak bourbon and very rich coffee. Somewhat of a sour tannic taste on the tongue like that you would get from eating the skins of fresh cherries. Very thick mouthful that coats the tongue. Surprisingly drinkable to me on this cold winter day, but definitely a beer meant to savor slowly. 543 characterspixel, Feb 09, 2010

Pours a dark viscous black with a unstable mocha head that leaves large sticky bubbles on the edges of my dogfish snifter.
Lovely smelling beer with coffee still at the forefront followed up quickly by a oaky bourbon accent with toasted vanilla, black cherry, chocolate, roasted malts, and some other black fruits and licorice.
Damn this is a beauty. Still plenty of cellar life left as well 5 years or more. Thick coffee and roasted malts, reminds me of a dark chocolate covered coffee bean that may have been soaked in bourbon. Tons of oak tannins on the finish and a nice vanilla middle from the oak as well. Very soft and creamy on the palate. Slight anise, black currant, black cherry and red currant flavors. Some tobacco and mollasses as well. Hints of residual sugars on the finish just an amazing beer. 878 charactersmcallister, Feb 09, 2010

Appears a hazy dark brown, nearing black with a small, tan cap. Spotty bits of lacing are left around the glass.
Smell is of vanilla, oak, cocoa, caramel, toffee, espresso, and brown sugar.
Taste is of the addictive aromas with a sweet apple and cherry flavor pulling through in the flavors.

4.87/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Review #500 on BA (well, not really, but I first entered this as BA Speedway and that review was actually #500, then someone told me it was "The Vine" version, then it was merged back with BA Speedway since it was essentially the same beer - oh well). Had this from a growler, huge thanks to Smokepot23. Been looking forward to this for a long, long time. Speedway Stout is so awesome on its own that I couldn't even imagine what would happen when they aged it in the -bals. The answer is that it became a ridiculously good beer, even among ridiculously good beers.
A - Pours a clear light golden color...no, scratch that, actually it's pitch black. This is where photons go to die. Not much in the way of head, but then again it did come out of a growler. This is the beer's only minor flaw, if it even is one.
S - Absolutely heavenly. High-quality chocolate and coffee (I'm talking weasel crap quality), roastiness, oak, and just a touch of bourbon.
T - Amazingly balanced, yet very intense awesomeness liquified. Lots of chocolate and vanilla, a little bourbon, sweet caramel malt, roasted malt, and oak. Coffee is definitely less dominant than in regular Speedway, as I hear aging will do to coffee flavor. This is a good thing, even though I like a strong coffee presence in a stout. When I drank this, I think a light might have shone down from the heavens and angels might have sang, but I'm not 100% sure.
M - Incredibly smooth, full, and creamy on the palate. Very soft carbonation.
D - I know this is a barrel aged imperial stout, but I could drink it ALL NIGHT LONG! I couldn't imagine this beer really being any better unless they put weasel sh*t in it. 1,670 charactersnickd717, Jan 26, 2010

S: Such a lovely nose on this one. Milk chocolate dominates the nose with lots of roasted malt, vanilla, coffee and a slight bit of bourbon.
T: Much like the nose, the chocolate and vanilla are really the stars of the show. The coffee flavor is not as noticeable as in the regular Speedway, but I don't necessarily think the beer is hurt by this. A nice touch of bourbon and roasted malt as well.
M: The beer is full bodied, creamy, and very smooth with light carbonation.
D: A dangerously drinkable beer. This is easily one of the best barrel aged beers I've tried. Very smooth and not too heavy on the barrel character, but not "too light" either. 721 characterswomencantsail, Jan 18, 2010

Pours midnight black with some wispy lacing and bubbles around the edges. Very little carbonation if any at all. The aroma is enticing, with dark chocolate coffee cake with a lactic sour barrel funkiness. Unfortunately the smell was much better than taste and mouthfeel. 
I have to say it was not bad but pretty underwhelming and actually seemed a lesser beer than a regular speedway stout. A bit stronger coffee taste with bitter bakers chocolate with a ripe sour cherry finish. Not much barrel (makes me wonder what type of barrel they use in the aging) with moderate heat. It is not nearly as viscous as I would have liked and for this beer, it is borderline watery. Any carbonation would have helped this out significantly. Fairly easy to drink but again without carbonation and the sour funkiness to it, made it a bit difficult to finish my glass. 
Overall it was an ok beer but was a pretty big letdown. I look forward to trying another BA Speedway to compare this with, but not sure I'll go out of my way for one. 1,198 charactersJoeySchlitz, Jan 02, 2010

Unfortunately, it may have been spoiled. The smell and taste had a sour spoiled milk quality to them that overrode everything else for me. I ended up having to pour this down the drain. It poured black with no head at all. Body was on the lighter side for a big barrel aged stout (but still fairly thick on an absolute scale). This was a disappointing and surprising brew, as I really enjoyed the barrel aged Numbskull and barrel aged 07 Decadence, so figured the BA Speedway would follow in the same vein. 629 characterswaltonc, Jan 02, 2010

2007 Vintage #290/447. Poured from a 750ml bottle into a tulip. Got from ummagum who got it directly from Alesmith. It came in the standard Speedway Stout bottle with pen markings on the side to identify it as the BA and bottle number. Was pitch black even against a strong light. Good carb streams in center from the etching. It had about a finger of brown foam that quickly dissipated into a collar and some wisps in center. No lacing but at 12%ABV you don't expect any.
The aroma was mostly mellow bourbon with some oaky vanilla and then just a bit of the base coffee. It's a bourbon show but it has mellowed as it aged so not overpowering. The tastes closely follows the aroma. Again, it's bourbon show with some oak and weak coffee highlights. The bourbon has mellowed so not overpowering. Has a slightly sweet finish. BA's are not my favorite style but this shows what a great BA can be. Mouthfeel is thick and creamy with good carb tingle.
Overall, an excellent BA stout that highlights what good barrel aging can do. Dangerous drinkable at 12%. Most highly recommend if you want to try a top tier BA beer. I was at the brewery in October and they said it would probably be another 12-18 months before this comes out again so get to trading if you want one. Rotation - not avail in TX - got from a friend. Wouldn't mind trying this again with another 1 or 2 on it to see what happens...but since so rare this probably will be my only shot. 1,462 charactersTexIndy, Dec 21, 2009
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Decided to crack this one as a Thanksgiving day treat. 2006 vintage, served at the recommended temperature of 50-60 degrees.
Pours pitch black with a very foamy finger of tan head that leaves bits and pieces of lacing behind.
Smell is very smooth bourbon on top of a coffee and earthy hop base. Deep notes of oak sting the senses, alcohol burn isn't huge but is definitely noticeable. Smells fairly sweet also. Pretty damn nice. 
Taste is MUCH more coffee forward than I would have imagined. Now, I realize that the base beer is a coffee infused stout, but I thought the barrel complexities would overpower the coffee a bit more. Well, they definitely didn't which makes for a beer that is surprisingly deep, complex, and subtle without being too brash and in-your-face with booze. Don't get me wrong, there is a lot of heat still there but compared to the only other BA Alesmith I have tried (07 Decadence) this is relatively tame. Background notes of oak, marshmallow, milk chocolate, a bourbon merely complement the huge roasted coffee grounds.
Mouthfeel is nearly full bodied with good carbonation levels, but I find this one to be a bit too dry. The bitter coffee beans just linger on the palate, which makes for an aftertaste that isn't as pleasant as the beer itself. Luckily the body helps make up for it.
I almost regret cracking this 750 because there is no way I am going to be able to finish it myself. Overall I thought the beer was very impressive but I wouldn't call it one of my favorites. Honestly, the dryness is the only thing really holding it back for me but unfortunately that has an impact on the taste, mouthfeel, and drinkability which is a large chunk of the score. Glad I got the chance to try it though. Back when I was in my coffee stout faze a while ago I would have probably given this a 4.8 or higher, but after having so many amazing beers over the last year it takes something really special for me to rate that highly nowadays. And I don't find this to have that specialness.
Nonetheless...still a fine, fine beer
EDIT: OK, here I am 4 hours later and it turns out I did finish the 750 all by myself. I originally rated the drinkability a 3.5, but boosted it up to a 4.5 because it is very rare for me to drink so much of this high of an ABV beer in one sitting. Perhaps I was forcing myself to drink every last drop because of the high cost. Or maybe it really is as good as they say. I think I'll take the middle ground. 2,464 charactersalcstradamus, Nov 27, 2009

Wish I could say I had more, but with a limited amount for everyone at the South Bay tasting, you have to pick your battles and I'm very, very thankful to have had the chance at this. Who knows if I'll have it again?
2007 bottle.
Appearance: Dark black, much like normal Speedway, really, with decent carbonation and clinging lace. Really not too much here to differentiate between the original and the BA.
Smell: Solid bourbon barrel character comes through with the coffee acting more as a backbone than a full-frontal character. Oaky vanilla, slight chocolate, and mild sweetness. Very solid barrel-aged stout, and simply smells like a bourbon Speedway, but it works as a companion, not a separate entity. 
Taste: Bourbon is certainly present, but not overwhelming. Much less than BCS, Angel's Share, and such, but still upfront and present. Coffee, chocolate, sweet maltiness, vanilla, and oak finish it out. Very solid, but it lacks just that little extra "wow" for me that 5s bring. Still, excellent, through and through.
Mouthfeel: Creamy, carbonated just right, and finishes--much like its non-barrel counterpart--with little alcoholic evidence. Smooth and delicious.
Drinkability: Tastes a bit more of the part of a 12% thanks to the bourbon, but just a great mixture of two styles. It feels like a baby Black Tuesday though is what kept running through my head, and it kept nagging me every sip I had that, while I really liked this beer, Black Tuesday does everything it did and just a hint more. Still, a very worthy member of the all-world stouts, and makes a great base beer a great barrel-aged beer. Highly recommended. 1,687 charactersnomomentwasted, Nov 21, 2009

Appearance: Inky black goodness with a tiny brown cream head that shows little retention but leaves some swirls of lace behind.
Smell: Loads of beautiful bourbon sweetness meets oak, vanilla and roast malt. Smells more sweet than boozy. Pungent but well refined. I'm not getting as much coffee as other reviewers have mentioned.
Taste: My first sip provides an initial wave of sweet oak that opens up into dark roasted malt, a touch of dark fruits...plum and prune mainly and finishes with a refined bourbon twang. 
Mouthfeel: Fairly creamy and on the thick side of medium bodied. Not too much carbonation but this brew doesn't need it.
Drinkability: For a 12% abv brew I'm finding little heat, little booze, a good mouthfeel, and a good flavor profile.

The only difference in my mind is that the 03 had no carbonation, the 04 was carbonated, and the 06 had more alcohol in the aroma and taste with even more carbonation. The lesson here is don't let these go too long or you won't be drinking a carbonated world class brew versus a flat one. 901 charactersfiver29, Aug 21, 2009
3.9/5  rDev -12.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I consider this to be my cellar's crown jewel, and I want to thank Nobama, who, in spite of questionable politics, gave me the biggest trade I have ever done on here, including this 2006 vintage BA Speedway. This is one of a few remaining beers that I have to try from the top 100. Speedway Stout is easily in the top five I have ever had. Barrel Aging, with the exception of Blackout Stout (IMO) has never done anything but make a great beer incredible. Let's see how we do here.
Look, off the bat, is quite a tough one. Judged against imperial stouts, this would score a bit lower, but considering the aging and barrel life, this one gets a tiny curve. Think layer of mocha head that is hanging around quite a bit. Liquid is black with some highlights when held up to light. Lacing is minimal. 
Nose is actually relatively light on the barrel as I pick up more dark fruit scent. Unfortunately that is about all I can pick up. It's a good, if slightly oddly unrefined. Chocolate is way in the background. The barrel actually seems to upset what was a perfect balance. 
Mouth is going to be tough..this is where Speedway excelled and, really, was probably the best imperial stout I had ever had. So far, the barrel has actually caused some issues with that formula, but traditionally, this is where the bourbon comes in best. The good news is that this isn't too hot and there is certainly some Speedway in there. The coffee has left the building, but the dark fruit and chocolate are hanging around. Truth be told, while this is great, I still prefer the regular Speedway stout. 
Mouth is the high point of this brew, it is a relatively thick beast with relatively low carbonation.
Overall, I wouldn't go too far out of your way to get this one. There are better BA beers on the market, and it's little brother, IMO, is a better all around beer. 1,851 characterssonicdescent, Aug 01, 2009

A - Poured an opaque pitch black body with one-finger tan head that receded to a patchy film and deposited some decent lacing around the glass. Virtually no carbonation is noticeable. 
S - Apparent bourbon and vanilla notes up front with a candy bar-esque chocolate character and crispy malt. Some oaky notes also creep into the mix. 
T - Mmmm... like a bourbon-infused chocolate candy bar with crispy, rice-like malt, caramel and toffee notes and just a touch of alcohol heat in the finish.
M - Medium body with an incredibly smooth mouthfeel with only a hint of carbonation. Mild astringency with moderate bitterness on the palate, as well as subtle alcohol warmth.
D - Wow! Amazing bourbon barrel aged stout that's - dare I say it? - even better than the original. 932 charactersffejherb, Jul 06, 2009

Thanks to Carlos for this one.
I poured this beer with some heavy vigor but still only achieved one finger of carmel colored head that fades in minutes leaving a quarter inch of solid lace. Body is used motor oil blackness and just as thick. Nose has a black charred bourbon character and some carmel, coffee, smoke with a bit of an alcohol sting. Enters the mouth with a slight twang that has a bit of a dark fruit sour feel, but only slight. Then a nice bitter richness becomes evident with distinct bourbon laced all throughout. Bold bitter thickness really hangs on to the back of the tongue. This same thickness makes up the mouthfeel with some bitter dry twang. I have mentioned sour a few times but this is only a subtle sour. And I am not sure that is what is intended. This one really needs to be drank at room temperature. Drinkability is excellent as a all night sipper. 897 charactersSPLITGRIN, May 24, 2009
4.74/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow what a fantastic beer brought out by Dyan at our Graduation tasting! Many, many thanks!
Vintage 2007.
A: Pours a nice dark black with noticeable brown hues. Yields a nice head, but the head was very light colored. The lightest colored head for an Imperial Stout I have seen, as it was a light tan/khaki color. That was the really only downfall in the appearance.
S: Wow. Incredible scents of sweet bourbon, dark roasted barley, dark chocolate, and a nice oak scent. If you love bourbon, this is the beer for you. The bourbon scent comes right to the forefront.
T: Again, the warming, sweet bourbon is fantastic. I like my barrel aged beers to blend the bourbon without it being too harsh, and this does just that. Great dark bitter roast and sweet caramel.
Overall, this is a great, great stout. One of the best in its class. Thanks Dyan!
Update:
2003 Vintage. One of the best beers I ever had. Top 3 beers for sure. So rich, creamy, and perfect sweet bourbon. It is mostly flat, but it actually complements the beer and coats the palate.

4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Barrel aged 2007, 750mL bottle with gold foil, double waxed seal, standard silk skreen label, bottle number 321 of 447. Thanks to HopHead84 for this one, big time.
Into a chalice, pours a thick, syrupy thickness of pitch black, some nice fizzy, then eventually smooth, tan head that lasted for several minutes. Not much lacing, eventually the head evaporates and you have yourself a light trap, total darkness.
The aroma started off a tad odd, some cardboard to it, but as it warmed the vanillas and oaks, that classic bourbon feeling came one strong. The stock coffee and roasted malts form the base beer are still there, just massively overwhelmed by the bourbon. In my opinion, this detracts slightly from the exceptional base impy stout, but hey, that's just me. Taste is similarly dominated by the bourbon, oaks and vanilla, but some of the coffee remains, some roasted malt, some figs and fruits and stuff, its there, just pummeled by the boubon.
Mouth is smooth, warm and thick, initially nicely carbonate, but a bit flat as it warms. From the reviews I just read, it seems the earlier BB versions fared better, wish I couldn't have them, but as for this version, too much bourbon for me... and I like my bourbon in my big stouts! But it has just been too much and too overpowering for what I know to be a superior base impy stout, that I just can't forgive the crushing of favorite parts. That said, delicious beer, wish I had another dozen sitting in my cellar. 1,473 charactersobjectivemonkey, Apr 16, 2009

Pours black with beautiful red highlights. The head quickly dissipates. Smells only of bourbon and alcohol. First sip is roasted malts, prunes, oak, vanilla, licorice and a ton of alcohol. There is plenty of yummy bitterness as it is sweet for only a moment. Part of a massive 2 day Stout tasting. On my bracket BA Speedway lost to Older Viscosity in the second round. 402 charactersATLbeerDog, Apr 10, 2009
4.42/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.52007 Vintage, Bottle #295. Good call on this one, UncleJedi. You have chosen... wisely.
Appearance: Pours a turbid, dark brown, near black body with a thin, short-lived, tan head.
Smell: A very full, all-encompassing bourbon barrel presence on the nose -- large notes of oak wood and full-on bourbon with lighter notes of vanilla and coconut shavings. Pair this up with a malt aroma replete with plenty of chocolate and roast and you have something worth smelling.
Taste: Cup of Sumatra Dark Roast 'Black Satin' Coffee stirred up with aged oak and light touches of vanilla and coconut and garnished with a few chocolate-covered coffee beans. Fleeting plum fruitiness. Some fire-roasted marshmallows. A pinch of Black Cavendish Tobacco. Medium roast bitterness. Plenty of alcohol to be found, but, thankfully, it's not glaring. Warming, roasty finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium-full body. Medium carbonation.
Drinkability: Yes! This is going to be a pleasure to finish off, I can tell. It's so darned yummy, I just had to tell the world! 1,033 charactersChainGangGuy, Apr 07, 2009

Its a 2006 BA speedway.
A - Pours a nice deeply black with little light penetrating the thickness of it. 
S- It has some bourbon on the front end with big dark fruit prunes especially.
T - Once the bourbon clears you get coffee then chocolate with a very smooth silky finish.
Drinkability is very easy on this. The other guys were saying they may still prefer the regular speedway over the BA version. I like both versions and would but this everyday if it were available to me. 672 charactersBgThang, Mar 15, 2009

Poured from a bottle into a tulip, it pours an almost black with a deep tan head. Initial head was a 1/2-1 inch and quickly resides to a mild lacing.
The smell was reasonably good. It definitely had more of the oak and vannilla notes when compared to regular alesmith. The other dark chocolate and coffee notes are also present but not overwhelmingly high on coffee. Some bourbon notes are also present.
The taste was fairly good. It starts a bit heavy on the oak/vanilla combination and very mild bourbon. It them seems to hit more dark chocolate and coffee notes. There is a nice sourness that also aids in hiding the alcohol.
This is a full-bodied beer that sits on the palate fairly well without being overwhelming. It is quite smooth and not so creamy or sticky that it is hard to drink. Adequate carbonation.
This beer is a very good beer. It is interesting comparing with regular Alesmith, which I think is somewhat better. However, given the unique and limited number of this beer, it is certainly worth getting your hands on one, if you can. Very well hidden alcohol. Again, much thanks to brdc for sharing. 1,199 charactersSykDoc, Mar 14, 2009

Compared with a bottle aged, presumed 2006 version. 
Poured into a snifter, pitch black except for a very slight reddish edge. The tan head here is significantly smaller, poor retention, some lacing. 
Aroma here is dominated by the oak notes, vanilla, bourbon. Coffee, roasted malts, bittersweet chocolate, and molasses complete it; more complex, less pleasant (but still nice). 
Full bodied but interestingly does not feel as creamy on the palate. Flavor is also dominated by the oak notes, vanilla, bourbon, but also roasted malts, baker's chocolate, molasses. 
This is a very good beer, but IMHO, as it gains complexity, it loses some of the most pleasant aspects. It is certainly worthwhile, but I honestly prefer the original version. 826 charactersbrdc, Mar 14, 2009

2 Year Anniversary of my first review.
2006.
#122/233.
A - Pours into the snifter with a beautiful, tight little brown head. The body, a menacing black, beckons. Great lacing, legs.
S - Nice bourbon characteristics up front. A slight hint of wood, big notes of underlying coffee and vanilla. A molasses sweetness is present on the backend. Booze. Bigness. 
T - Lots of coffee throughout, which surprises me due to the age. Big, bitter, dry finish. Bourbon and coconut notes on the back. Some heat, but nothing very much noted in the taste itself. Vanilla. It's a great representation of a barrel-aged beer. Complex, huge, ever-changing. Nice dark chocolate and fig/raisin notes as it warms. 
M - I'm slightly bummed because it doesn't seem as thick as I remember Speedway being, but it's still got quite a big body and a nice, steady carbonation.
D - For everything involved, and the bigness of the flavors and ABV, this is absolutely killer... the over-attenuation seems to help with ease of quaffing.
Notes: Mad thanks to Carlos for this. It's a great, and I mean GREAT, brew to have for my 200th review. Totally worth seeking out. 1,153 charactersSaucyA, Jan 13, 2009

The aroma is full of coffe, vanilla, oak, dark fruit, and so much more I just couldn't wrap my head around. Same with the flavor. Everything mentioned in the nose was present in the flavor. All very well blended. There was some concern at the table that the coffee would not make its way through. It was there and stood tall. The palate was a touch on the thin side, yet very fullfilling. 450 characterstjthresh, Jan 11, 2009

Pours a deep opaque black, some very dark brown in the far edges in the light, huge and thick brown head forms, drops some lace spots and settles down to a very thick ring, looks great. Smell is amazing, lots of bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate, coffee and roast, light woody sourness, toffee, toast, oats, very very rich, its hard to describe how good this smells. Perfect mix of bourbon barrel with the stout. Taste is just as amazing, buttery toffee, chocolate and bourbon, oak, vanilla, roast, figs, toast, very intense flavour, light wood astringency in the finish, perfect. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, buttery smooth. Drinks like 5%. Wow, this is an insanely good beer. Proof of perfect barrel aging, one of the best beers I've ever had. Thanks a ton Jay! 916 charactersViggo, Jan 04, 2009

Wow, this beer is delicious. The bourbon was present in the smell and taste. As good as regular Speedway Stout is, the addition of the barrel aging makes this a real treat. Not as sweet as the regular version. I enjoyed the fact that it wasn't too heavy. Overall it tasted wonderful, and is great paired with leche flan, a creme brulee type desert. Outstanding!!!
*Update 4/10/10
I was able to grab a growler and drank over the course of two nights, and wow, I would leave all my original scores the same, but I would actually bump up the mouthfeel score to 4.5
There was loads of chocolate in the nose on the growler version. It also had a fuller and thicker body with a slightly sweeter taste. I really liked how the barrel aging aspect was not overwhelming and would actually play the background on some sips. Just a world class brew, and I can't wait till they do growlers of this one again. 964 characterssteadydose, Jan 01, 2009
4.62/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5No better way to celebrate review #500 than to break out the barrel-aged version of one of my favorite beers ever. Huge thanks to hoppymeal for the opportunity! 2007 bottle #316 of 447.
Pours black but not completely opaque as hints of mahogany show through the edges. The head is one-finger tall, very bubbly and remains a swirl of small bubbles and a ring for the duration, leaving traces of lacing.
The aroma is exceptional. The bourbon is present up front but is supported by dark roasted malts, bakers chocolate and a whiff of coffee (not nearly as dominant as in the regular version). The barrel presence is evident with a bit of vanilla. All of these things seem to come together into one cohesive aroma.
The taste has the sweetness of the chocolate and some dark fruits up front before the dark malts and roasted coffee step up in the middle. The finish is big on vanilla and bourbon and leaves an alcohol warming as it goes down.
The mouthfeel is very smooth and medium bodied for the style with less carbonation than I remember in the regular version.
This is a fantastic beer though I can't decide if it quite measures up to the regular version to me. Either way, it's not to be missed. Thanks again to Derek for his (continued) generosity! 1,256 charactersgford217, Dec 30, 2008

I enjoyed this beer but it isn't my favorite style so I probably am not the best evaluator. I definitely got the bourbon taste as well as a strong vanilla flavor. Warming made the flavors more robust and brought out the alcohol intensity. It was relatively thin as far as carbonation and pretty smooth for the 12%. I would love to try again but it is definitely a sipper with a max of one for me. 507 characterscpn920, Dec 21, 2008

Black with faint brown edges. Thin, dark tan cap of very fine bubbles. Lots of very sticky lace. Looks great. The barrel aging really worked well with the base beer, and Speedway's no slouch on its own. Aromas of vanilla, woody oak, bourbon and booze, melded with the toffee and caramel, coffee and dark chocolate, and mild fruit character. Just a bit buttery as it warmed. Great balance in the flavour too. Plenty of roasted malts, coffee, oak, toffee and chocolate. Bitterness and hop flavour had faded somewhat, but were still present. Mild alcohol and light vanilla. Extremely smooth in texture with very fine carbonation, a bit on the low side. Full bodied, but seemed just a little thinner than I remember Speedway being. Truly an elegant beer. Delicious and wonderfully balanced. One of the high points of barrel aged beer, at least for me. 962 charactersDrJay, Dec 17, 2008

Poured part of a 750ml into a snifter.
Vintage 2007 - 254/447
Appearance - Pours an opaque black and produced a 1 finger head that quickly dissipated to a swirly/spotty crown on the surface of the brew. The crown is rocky textured around the perimeter of the glass. 
Smell - The scent is pretty awesome. I get notes of vanilla, bourbon, oak, hints of chocolate and barely any coffee. The bourbon dominates here, but that is hardly a problem for me. Very boozy. 
Taste - I think this is a little too young to have opened now, I should have sat on this for a while. The bourbon character is huge, to the point where the original taste of the Speedway is hardly discernible. Vanilla, woody oakiness, and hints of chocolate. There is only a hint of coffee. In fact, the BA version seems to have replaced the coffee in favor of bourbon. I would have favored a little more balance.
Mouthfeel - This feels a little thin, but good nice as it rolls over the tongue. The carbonation level is pretty good for a BA beer. It feels lively. Medium bodied.
Drinkability - The drinkability is pretty good if you enjoy bourbon, and I love bourbon. This is definitely a sipper, I am feeling pretty warm as I type this. I will have to trade for another bottle and sit on it for a while, because at this point, I think I would rather have the original version over the BA version. I would love to see how this tastes with a little age on it. 1,473 charactersMiguelMandingo, Dec 14, 2008

pours opaque black with a medium sized dense brown head. the head drops fairly fast but leaves lots of lace behind.
aroma is awesome. holy shit does this smell good. bourbon. vanilla. coffee. dark chocolate. caramel. whole wheat bread. biscuit. cracker. some dark fruit. the caramel component seems to get bigger as it warms too.
wow. taste is excellent. i love speedway and this is just a decadent slice above. coffee. dark and milk chocolate. bourbon. vanilla. oak. big bread and biscuit malt. some dark fruit. caramel. toffee. there's just so much depth to it, so many layers to uncover that it's tough to capture it all.
mouthfeel is excellent too. silky smooth medium-low carbonation level. medium-large body.
drinkability is awesome. i've heard from several sources that the barrel-aged version was "underwhelming", not as good as they expected, and just didn't measure up to the regular speedway. i couldn't disagree more. this shit is awesome. the rough edges from the speedway are gone, just silky smooth, well balanced, and just plain great. i really loved this one. we were trying to wring every last drop out of the bottle and wishing there was more. definitely the highlight of the night. great stuff - must find more! 1,418 charactersgrub, Dec 11, 2008

Pours a very dark brown in color. There's a short lived frothy ring of head around the perimeter of the glass. Very subdued bourbon in the nose. Good to see that the bourbon is not dominating. Still some good roasty coffee notes coming through. 
There's much more coffee coming through in the taste. So much in fact that it's dominating the bourbon barrel aging effects. I expected just the opposite. Also was a bit thinner in the mouthfeel than I was expecting. Ends up being a bit more balanced than I was expecting. Not earth moving, but then again, don't know if this had a chance to live up to the hype. 621 charactersFtownThrowDown, Nov 30, 2008

Pours black with very little head and a nice ring of lacing.
Scent of bourbon, oak, roasted malts, coffee and a hint of raisins. Just an absolutely huge bourbon and oak aroma on this one, which is very good, but it's not quite perfect. Perhaps it could use a bit more age as the bourbon is dominating, but I like a big bourbon aroma, so I'm not complaining.
Taste is even bigger, starts off sweet with bourbon and raisins while roasted malts, oak, chocolate and coffee come in quickly and bringing the initial sweetness to a halt. The bourbon here is overpowering as well, leaves something to be desired. Finishes with roasted malts, oak and alcohol. Roasted malts and oak linger for some time making for a very pleasant, lasting aftertaste.
Mouthfeel is heavy and smooth, but kind of watery.
For as strong as this beer is, it is still quite drinkable.
I would take a regular Speedway Stout over the Barrel Aged version any day if this is the best it can offer. It's still a great beer, but the bourbon is too overpowering for it to be really enjoyable, but maybe some more age would have done some good. 1,163 characterspaco1029384756, Nov 19, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Decided to crack this bottle while barbequing some chicken one fine day. Why? Because I can. Just like the dog. Pulling this out of my cellar brought back fond memories of the release day: scoring 6 bottles, cracking a piss warm westy12 with friends, sluggin Pliny and Blind Pig out the bottle, mowing grub at Stone... good times!!!
Now some people feel that they can sufficiently review a beer after a 2oz taster. Not Daddy. That's why 750ml of BA Speedway and I are about to have a serious discussion on the nature of the multiverse. While barbequing chicken.
Agressive pour creates a monstrous Del Taco chihuahua fur colored head. That settles at a moderately quick pace to a thin film on top of an open tar pit.
BIG whoof of the barrel. Alcohol, dark fruits and... maybe some bitter chocolate or cocoa. Nutty even. And some more whiskey like aromas. 
I was afraid there would be too much booze in the taste (possible?), but it's mostly in the nose. Taste is a big bite of dry cocoa. Then maybe some chocolate and coffee. And some booze. Then some prunes. Ahh, prunes.
So very smooth through the mouth. I catch a bubble or two of carbonation in the back of the throat, but the alcohol bitch slaps it around and calls it Susan. Everybody ends up fat, dumb, and happy. Not quite as thick as expected. Not that it's thin by any means, but it's not 30wt. Goes down like melted butter. Big ass beer here - no joke.
The missus takes her customary 4oz taster (still breastfeeding) then dumps over half back into my glass (too strong!). YES!!! Where does that leave Daddy? Well, shitfaced to be candid. If this is my last review, it's because this big ass beer kicked my ass and I died. Smart money is on me though!
Smooth! Two-thirds of a bottle down and I'm losing motor skills. Rolling the chicken instead of flipping. Hope I can read these notes when I go to type the review. Same 12% as the regular Speedway, but the bourbon flavor makes it seem like more. Like 12.2% maybe. Good thing I've spent the last 15 years in high alcohol altitude training.
Above from notes. The outcome: I'm still here, she's all gone. Good times.

Wake up at 7:30 am, on the grounds of the beautiful Ommegang brewery. As the rain begins to fall, I see some good friends, looking like they need a good beer. So I open up my 2004 bottle # 14. The rain begins to come down harder, so I put the bottle under the shade of my open trunk. Our glasses our filled with care, and we enjoy, as the rain droplets fell into the open glassware, and onto our heads. The right beer at the right time, I love this shit! 699 charactersegajdzis, Nov 10, 2008
4.59/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.52007 Vintage, Bottle 300/447. Poured into a New Belgium snifter.
Pours blacker than the soul of Dick Cheney, with a thin wisp of a head that disappears as fast as it arrives. Huge coffee & bourbon on the nose, followed by oak, vanilla, and dark fruits. Coffee is the overwhelming flavor on the palate, followed closely by bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, dark fruit, leather, and smoke. Full bodied for sure, but not as huge and viscous as other Imperial Stouts of this magnitude. Saying it's thin is a bit of a stretch, but it's not as coating as you'd expect. Definite alcohol bite combined with the thickness dampens drinkability. It took four people to polish the bottle off.
A fantastic beer, no doubt. Whether it's worth the time & money to acquire, the jury's still out. 780 characters0110x011, Nov 05, 2008
4.24/5  rDev -5.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Deep and dark, brown hues around the edges. Minimal tan head that fades quickly to a ring then to nothing. Rich and deep in the nose. Bourbon isn't showing up front but after it warms it shows more and more. Rich coffee, chocolate, and some dark fruits in the background. Bourbon...oak and vanilla show up. Taste is also pretty deep. The bourbon is more present but not dominant and imparts a nice vanilla flavor that comes in the finish. Coffee and chocolate. Some caramel and light butterscotch as well. Darker fruits still present. Mouthfeel is lacking in carbonation a bit and not as full as could be. Somewhat creamy but to silky to the point of almost being thin. Overall, it's a drinkable brew. Didn't quite live up to my expectations but it was enjoyable. I owe PHawk a huge thanks for helping me with a bottle of this. Not as good as the regular Speedway in my book but worth a try. 891 charactersncvbc, Nov 02, 2008
4.75/5  rDev +6.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours black like the night. Totally opaque. Head is tan, well carbonated, not overly so.
The aroma screams bourbon. It overpowers the coffee, chocolate and vanilla. The taste is very heavy bourbon, surprising, and amazing how much flavor the beer draws from its barrels. Definitly some coffee, and some hints of chocolate and vanilla. More aftertaste of coffee and initial hit of bourbon and warming alchohol.
All in all, fantastic. Like no beer I've ever had. The bourbon character really sticks out, to the point where every sip continues to surprise me. I split the bottle with a few friends who proclaimed it the best beer they ever had.
Highly recommended if you can get it. 2007 vintage. 696 charactersantilogic, Oct 29, 2008

P: 4.5 - 2006 edition. Now standard 750ml silk-screened brown glass bottle with gold foil and a notation in silver marker pen that says 2006 barrell aged 189/233.
A: This beer is a turbid dark black, with crimson edges, and an espresso whip foam head that lasts and has decent legs, lacing, and retention.
S: Big booze, bourbon, and wood. Dark malt, chocolate, and coffee are there but a bit subdued by the massive oak and bourbon character.
T: Big bourbon and oak again. Malts are big and provide bread, chocolate, and coffee notes. Coffee beans do their work in the mid palate, herbal green hops and hersheys chocolate syrup fight for dominance in the back palate. The booze, oak, and bourbon come back to meld everything together in the slightly warming finish.
M: Smooth and thick. Not over the top nor too chewy. A good mouthfeel for a beer this big. Just about right, if you ask me...
D: Exceptional. I love bourbon, vanilla, oak, chocolate, coffee, etc...and this one delivers big time with those flavors. I actually had a sample of the 2003 a while ago and the oak and bourbon just wasn't as fresh and this 2006 batch is just killer. Probably the best oak aged speedway batch that I have tasted thus far (I have not had the 2007 yet)
O: Super solid. 4.9 material here. Definitely a nice way to showcase the big, bolshy, oaky bourbon and booze flavors that one can achieve when barrell aging a beer. Is it a bit over the top and one dimensional....? YES! But to heathens like me, this is the perfect mid evening sipper before catching a My Bloody Valentine concert...
Thanks again mbrasi. 1,643 charactersfrancisweizen, Oct 01, 2008
4.78/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5'03 vintage received from seaoflament. Thank you, Carlos!
Appearance: From a 750ml bottle into a wine glass, the only suitable thing I had on hand at the place I drank this. The pour is dark chocolate brown, nearly black, with no head whatsoever. It sits in the glass viscous and opaque.
Smell: Chocolate and molasses. Moderate oxidation, but the good variety - there are no off aromas here. Rather, it's got a quality almost like vintage port or sherry. Wonderfully rich, sweet and dessert like.
Taste & mouthfeel: The first thing noticed is that there's no carbonation. The second thing noticed is that carbonation is completely unnecessary. The lack of bubbles only enhances the chocolatey richness and silky smooth mouthfeel. As the nose suggests, molasses is up front in the taste, with a strong undercurrent of chocolate and dark fruit. Coffee still comes through with surprising strength, especially in the finish, which dries the palate only slightly. Compared to fresh Speedway, all the rough edges have been smoothed; there's no trace of alcohol, low bitterness, no astringency; this is remarkably smooth beer. If not for the rarity (and strength), this would be downright quaffable.
Notes: This is the sort of beer that, before you try it, you have to wonder if it's all hype or if it actually merits all the praise. The answer is yes, it's worth every word of praise. Incredible stuff. 1,401 characterslargadeer, Sep 20, 2008

750 ml gold foil topped bottle poured into a snifter. Bottle #175/235 - 2006.
Pours a complete midnight black with a quick half finger dark brown head that fades to just about nothing. Swirling the glass leaves a few specks of lacing on the sides of the glass. Smell is coffee, booze, molasses, rich caramel, dark chocolates, vanilla, and wet oak. Lots of dark fruits in the nose as well; dates, fig, raisins, plums, and prunes. Extremely complex aroma, but I pretty much expected that. Taste, heavenly...Rich coffee flavors up front with sweet caramel and bourbon. Toffee, vanilla, and brown sugars midway with a good amount of oak. Aftertaste is roasted malts with bitter chocolate and more bourbon. The mouthfeel was a bit harsh which surprised me. I was expecting this one to be silky smooth, but there was a distinct sting to it that took away from the overall experience. Medium to full body with a mild carbonation. Wonderful complex flavors with nothing over the top that just gets better with some warmth. Thanks again Joey for the opportunity to try a beer I probably won't be able to obtain again anytime soon. 1,185 charactersBeerTruth, Sep 20, 2008

Pours blackish, with dark brown edgings. Small dark tan head. The smell is huge bourbon, with a bunch of roastiness. In a blind taste test, I'd never guess this was based on Speedway. Large ashy, vanilla-y, bourbony roasted dark chocolate, fruits, with some burnt coffee. 
Not nearly as coffee laden as the "normal" version. Absolutely stunning smoothness, and very drinkable. Aftertaste of vanilla. 
Frankly, a better beer than the normal, and that isn't the case with the BA Numbskull and Wee Heavy, neither of which benefited from barrel aging. 736 charactersOverlord, Aug 23, 2008

The beer poured an attractive somber hue with a good inch or so of foam that retained for a few moments and settled to a ring.
Aroma of dark fruits, chocolate, and coffee upfront, but not as strong a coffee aroma as the regular version. Black currants are there too with a little smoke and oak wood. Brown sugar and maple open up near the last few sips. A lot more vanilla and toast as it warms up. I would have given a lower score for the aroma but it really opens up as it warms to room temp, the last few drops in my glass are heavenly.
The coffee is actually more present in the taste than the aroma. The first few sips tasted of milk chocolate, vanilla, and oak. Some alcohol in the finish and the beer starts to develop more as it warms up. Wow this is like a chocolate milkshake! My friend thinks he smells some whiskey a lot of barrel. A bit of black cherries develops later on. Brown sugar and maple in the taste near the end as well.
Mouthfeel is as creamy and delicate as it gets.
I could have drank this whole 750ml bottle by myself, even if it knocked me on my ass, I would have enjoyed it and said "thank you, can I have another?"
I traded all by BA Speedways, I hope the beers I got are as good as this one was, and that will be hard to match.
**update 10/10**
Thanks to my friend Rene for popping his only bottle 03 BA Speedway tonight. #70/196
Pours jet black with the most minimal amount of bubbles, after a few seconds it looks pretty much flat. (3.5)
Not very intense on the nose but the most strong barrel presence in BA Speedway I have had so far...smell of wood, oak, vanilla, chocolate, nuts, and booze. Pretty close to a chocolate flavored liquor. The aroma does intensify as it gets to room temp with more chocolate, vanilla, and oak. (4)
The taste is a bit of a step up from the aroma, though very similar. Starts off with some roasted and chocolate malts, then a wave of vanilla, cookies, toast, brown sugar, molasses, and coffee in the finish. (4)
Very, very thin body with zero carbonation. (3.5)
I'm glad I had someone to share this one with because it would have taken me a long time to drink it myself. (3.5) 2,328 charactersseaoflament, Aug 21, 2008

2006 - 
Smells dark, with hints of molasses and bourbon and a little fruityness. Pours dark black with just a little head into a DFH snifter. Wonderfully smooth and complex at the same time, with a little licorice and molassas, coffee, chocolate. Just a little carbonated, with a slight syrupy feel on the tongue.
2003 - 
No carbonation, no head. It's slightly smoother than the 06, but I think I prefer the 06 overall. Not as sweet as 06, which is nice.
I am lucky to have had the chance to try these next to each other. Not something I will soon forget. 667 characterstprokop7, Aug 04, 2008

Nice bourbony and wood notes in the tangy finish, along with a small nibbly bite and warmth from the alcohol. Mouthfeel is medium to heavy, carbonation is fairly light, decent peppery tingle on the tongue and warmth in the throat towards the finish.

4.92/5  rDev +10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 52006 Vintage bottle 62 of 233 . Consumed on 07/07/2008.
Had the pleasure of having this one last night. I had been waiting forever to get to try this and finally was bale to score. Immediately chilled this one and decided to break it out last night after having had the numbskull the night before. I had really enjoyed both of the other two BA Alesmith releases so far, and was hoping this would be the icing on the cake so to speak, and I have to admit I was anything but disappointed. Served at fifty degrees and decanted into a Snifter over the course of the evening.
Appearance - The pour on this one was just about as I would have expected, and just spot on. A rich, deep, dark as night colored liquid came gurgling out of the bottle immediately. Rich and thick in appearance it left no light inside of it whatsoever. Very nice one finger thick layer of chocolate colored foam, which had a nice tendency to stick around for a good long while. Really nice side glass lace thoroughly coated the inside of the glass throughout.
Smell - The aroma was perfect. Huge smell of coffee coming off of this one from the moment on opened the bottle, but I have to admit, it was more then that. It was enormously rich, with touches of oak and vanilla, hints of sweet milk chocolate and a touch of alcohol. This was definitely a big beer and actually very sweet. I was loving every minute of this one so far.
Taste - The flavor was just as heavenly as the aroma. Rich coffee notes just rolling out across the tongue, immediately coating everything that they touch. Sweet coffee flavor, with nice touches of oak riddle throughout. The barrel aging here took on more of a highlighting effect then n overpowering note. Subtle touches of light chocolate coming through towards the end as well. Wonderfully complex and rich, this was simply heavenly. Long lasting flavor of coffee, with oaky highlights, playfully dancing hints of vanilla just lingering for what seemed to be forever. I was really impressed here.
Mouthfeel - This was not as huge and thick and creamy as some of the other stouts, however it was masterfully done. Definitely full bodied, every sip of this was like a little slice of dessert. Really great bit of beer here, with a thick coating feel to it and a really nice carbonation profile.
Drinkability - I could have sipped on this one for days. There was no hint really of the alcohol to the extent you would have expected given the strength. A very solid sipper that I had a wonderful time with and would gladly throw down another any day of the week.
Overall would have to say this one was beyond excellent. A truly wonderful beer that I really could not get enough of. I would love to have this any day of the week, and I really think that hype to the level things get is not always deserved. But I have to admit, this was really damn good! 2,858 charactersmikesgroove, Jul 09, 2008

Smells of molassses, roast coffee, black patent sour, clean alcohol, chocolate, dark fruits. Potent and enticing. Alcohol becomes a bit too strong once the beer warmed.
Tastes oaky coffee, vanilla, cream. Chocolate rises late and tastes like a coffee bean covered in high-end chocolate. The flavors are strong, balanced in their intensities, and melded wonderfully. Mouthfeel is thick and leaves a persistent coffee hanging on the tongue. The alcohol doesn't quite wipe the palate. Fantastic drinkability, a great sipper for pondering. 597 charactersmentor, Jul 06, 2008

Pours black with a light tan head. Smell is roasty, chocolate and bourbon, but not too strong. Taste is almost milder than I remember the regular speedway stout being, at least in terms of alcohol, somehow. Still very mild coffee, and is hardly noticeable, with roasty chocolate and light bourbon. Good stuff. 341 charactersJDV, Jul 01, 2008

This looks identical to the regular speedway so I'll spare the details. The smell was dope, like regular speedway but better, my friend siad it was like candy. The flavors were also very close to the regular speedway, dark coffee bitterness. There was a little bit of a booze but it was quite subtle. This was a very solid stout but honestly I can't say it is an improvement over the regular speedway.Damn you Alesmith! The four people who drank this agreed that it was not something you would want a whole bottle of. My verdict is that this is good but don't trade your cellar away for one. 722 charactersArrogantB, Jun 13, 2008
3.5/5  rDev -21.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Vintage 2006, bottle 70/235; Sampled June 2008
A fairly vigorous pour produces a one-finger thick, darkly browned, tan colored head in my 25cl tulip glass. The beer is simply black as it sits in my glass and no amount of putting up to the light makes it anything but opaque. The aroma has a tartness to it that is strongly influenced by Bourbon-like notes and likely coffee. Roast coffee notes actually play a big role and mix with some fruity, burnt prune notes and lots of deeply toasted malt notes. There is also a nice aroma of richly toasted coconut that still has a touch of sweetness of coconut meat. It also seems to get just a touch musty at times, which mixes in with a lightly spicy oak character and a touch of estery alcohol aromas.
Thick and rich feeling as it firsts hits my tongue, creamy dark malt notes hint at lots of residual sugars, but don't really contribute much sweetness to this beer. A very light carbonation also contributes to the creamy feeling of this brew. Towards the finish the beer thins out considerably while picking up acrid roast notes and sharp, burnt acid quality and a huge bitterness that seems just as much from burnt malt and roast coffee influenced as from the hops. The dual roast influences of coffee and malt actually contribute a tartness that is noticeable throughout the flavor profile, not just the finish, but it is tempered a bit up front by the unctuous body.
As the beer warms up a bit it begins to lose a touch of the acrid character, but seems to pick up a bit more alcoholic heat. This last seems to accent a note reminiscent of burnt prunes. While rich and malty this is surprisingly dry tasting; the thick residual sugars seems to be so well balanced by the roast and barrel flavors that they are not really noticeable. At most there is a noticeable chocolate / cocoa note here, but even this is pretty devoid of sweetness. There is also a touch of almost salty, sort of peat like smokiness that is likely a combination of roast malt and barrel influences. By my second pour the salty, peat-smoke like qualities of this brew are accented even a bit more. This last, in combination with the rich, dark malt flavors really save this beer for me; though it still has an overwhelming bitter and acrid finish at times.
I do like that the barrel influence does not absolutely overwhelm this beer. I am not sure if this is still too young or what, but the roasted grain notes really get overly acrid and bitter in the finish. The barrel influence also contributes to an overall impression of this being unbalanced. This is not nearly as unbalanced or undrinkable as the BA Old Numbskull though, and is even enjoyable in its own right. I think that the complexity of the aged, base beer and the lightish influence of the barrel make this at the very least worth procuring for me. 2,836 charactersGueuzedude, Jun 10, 2008
4.78/5  rDev +6.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5750 ml bottle with gold foil, #32 out of 235, purchased at the brewery for twenty dollars on April 1st, one of the last people to get a bottle thankfully, had to celebrate after finishing my second semester of graduate school, drank the entire thing by myself over a course of three hours, poured into my Chimay goblet slowly last night
A-Appeared to be completely black when it was first poured, then the head settled there was a very tiny bit of light going through the top only, 3/4 inch soapy brown head that went away rather quickly, not much retention, just a little stringy lacing
S-Coffee, complex set of roasted malts, both milk and dark chocolate, sweet cream, half and half, oak, vanilla, a hint of bourbon, nuttiness including cashews and honey roasted peanuts, barely any dark fruit but the ones present were ripe, caramel, and burned sugar
T-First thing that I noticed was different with the barrel aged version was the initial espresso flavor was much weaker, this was not a bad thing because the coffee can be a little aggressive without some age with the stand version, smae chocolate and caramel malt in the middle, but the finish was different at first with not as much dryness but more sweet accents, roastiness was not near as intense in this one because the sweetness overpoured it, this is usually not a good thing but definitely was in this case, never had a beer this sweet that went down so easy, later on the oak and vanilla started to shine through, vanilla mixed wonderfully with the chocolate, the aftertaste started to get a little boozy by the end but the only way I got tell was the sensation on the tongue, thought this beer would be much stronger tasting, incredibly balanced with sweetness and roasted accents, this is much better than normal Speedway because it is more subtle and complex with no flavors overpowering others, would love to be able to drink this more often, taste was enjoyable to say the least
M-Medium body, did not expect this to be as thin as it was, taste lingered for up to five minutes at times, warming was nice because it was not overpowering, not much carbonation but a few small bubbles throughout, spicy on the tongue towards the end, sweet, roasty, dry, complex, and tangy mouthfeel
D-This did not feel like twelve percent by any means, went down easier than any imperial stout I have ever had, could barely taste any whiskey in it and all booze were hidden very well, not heavy on the stomach, incredibly smooth, could have drank more than the twenty-five ounces even
I had a few people tell me this was their favorite beer ever and I am right there with them, certainly in my top five of all time, Speedway is good by itself but after being in a barrel it is just amazing, too bad this is only brewed every two or three years, now I know what all the hype was about, the three hour drive to get a bottle was definitely worth it, Alesmith has something going for them with their barrel aged brews, cannot wait to see what they come up with next, would be ecstatic to drink again, cannot recommend this one enough, have now had three different years and this one is for certainly for real 3,160 charactersFloydster, Apr 18, 2008

A: Pours black with a very minimal head, some lacing.
S: Great smell, full of roasted coffee, baker's chocolate, and bourbon/vanilla.
T: Sweet coffee comes out first, mocha, then a burnt of bitter dark chocolate comes out. The aging certainly smooth things out, some of the harshness that the original can have at times was non-existent. Light vanilla comes out as well, with some light acidity to end the beer.
M: Very smooth, very light carbonation, oily, medium-bodied.
D: An interesting beer to compare to the original, both are tasty as hell and very enjoyable. All and all, the BA Speedway that I had was very interesting, but definitely a different animal than the original. If you get a chance to pick this beer up, it's worth it. 784 charactersHalcyondays, Apr 06, 2008

Smell of coffee and soft bourbon, maybe some hints of chocolate and oak. The bourbon is nicely balanced in there, it's not overpowering as so many other barrel aged stouts have been. Taste is simply exceptional. Roastiness adds a nice touch to the dark chocolate and bourbon. Hints of vanilla and oak, but I am once again impressed on how well the bourbon is integrated. It's like a soft, smooth, high quality bourbon barrel was used; it's not harsh at all. A little less than full bodied, with a soft amount of carbonation. A pure joy to drink, I am forever greatful for being given the opportunity to try this. 713 charactersbadbeer, May 03, 2007
4.15/5  rDev -7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4157/228 2004 courtesy of kmcnair. The aroma is muted chocolate, light oak and roasted malt and while it smells good it doesnt really wow you either. The body is deep black with a fading, but initially quite thick and creamy, mocha head. The curious thing about this head is that unlike many BA beers you can always tease this one right back up to impressive stature. 
The fore is hot with spicy oak notes, black chocolate, burnt malt, espresso, some light bourbon and oddly some fairly nutty notes. The coffee seems much less concentrated than in the regular version. The mouthfeel actually has held up quite well and this is a world class beer, but sadly it isnt quite the wonder beer I have dreamed for over two years. Perhaps that is my fault, but while its great its not the beer I hyped it up to be in my mind. Which still leaves a wonderful brew. 863 charactersJredner, Jan 24, 2007
4.72/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Originally reviewed on February 18, 2005. 2004 Un-numbered bottle. Pours a dark black with no head and almost no carbonation. This doesnt bother me, since my favorite in this style was even more still. Ruddy orange fringe. Holy shit. Aroma is a building steam train of gentle coffees and tahitian vanilla beans steeped in fresh whipping cream and brown sugar. Moves into a supple and not harsh bourbon poured into gingerbread and spice cake. A hint of brandy vapor. Some savory herbal notes, with oregano and tarragon. Sweet candied limes dipped in rum sugars, with a finish of black currant and pears. Flavor is priceless and indescribable. Fuckin liquid heaven. Really hard to describe because the flavor is so similiar to the flavor, almost to a tee. Palate is a dense, absolutely syrupy sugar elixir that holds, disperses, and perform the flavors with total elegance. Finish and smack carry the very gentle and floral glowing qualities of an exquisite 21-year old single malt. A lot of the rich condensed malt and oaky finish characters ring through. More vinous then beery, with copious rich berry notes and continuing brandy and cognac vapors in the finish. Totally rounded and mellowed by the beers, with NO harsh edges. And the flavors are original each time they touch the palate, without fatigue. Finally, its a touch thin, to me, as it could be even denser, but it still has that ubiquitous cold cream texture that stays with the beer and maintains astounding density and quality as the beer continues.

This beer smells of Bourbon. But only subtly, not overwhelmingly. This beer also has a pretty strong coffee aroma. Some chocolate mixes in also. It has a slight oak aroma also.
Wow. This beer tastes great. It tastes on Bourbon, but not overly. It is subtle. It also has the characteristics of the regular Speedway Stout. Coffee and chocolate upfront.
This beer is incredably smooth. It leaves a slight Bourbon aftertaste. It also warms slightly as it goes down. This beer is very low in carbonation, due to being aged for a few years.
I doubt this would make a good session beer due to the alcohol content. However, other than that, it is very easy to drink. Surprisingly so.
Overall: Bottle 93 of 228. Good job AleSmith. This beer is awesome. I was out of town when this beer was released. Thank you very much abizzles for so generously hooking me up. I owe you dude. 1,016 charactersOStrungT, Oct 21, 2006
4.52/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I believe bottle #81/228
Had this sitting around the campfire in Mammoth thanks to a good friend. A perfect time and place for such a beer.
The regular speedway is one of my favorite beers, and I place it above Dark Lord and Stone. I think the coffee is just perfect for the style and love it.
Pours jet black in an AleSmith tulip glass. Little carbonation, but more than I expected. It's a big beer thats been waiting a long time to be poured in my glass.
The smell is amazing. Pick up the alcohol first, hints of bourbon, then comes coffee and chocolate.
The smell matches the taste. Alcohol first, but not overpowering. Silky smooth but surprisingly, a little thinner than I would assume. Not as thick as Founders KBS. Be interesting to have the two side by side, since it's the only beer that could come close to comparing with the BA Speedway in style. The BA Speedway seems more balanced though, probably due to the aging. The coffee seems subdued compared to the regular speedway. Not sure if that was due to the aging or the bourbon. So many flavors. Really don't pick up on any oak. Just to much going on in this beer. All I know is I sipped on this one, enjoyed night, and savored this truly great beer.
Of course it's an amazing, well crafted beer. Now does it live up to the hype? Who knows. It was different that I expected. It's not the best beer I've ever had, but it's definitely up there. A prize to anyone, but I wouldn't sell my soul for another one. 1,489 charactersCallenak, Aug 22, 2006
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle #32/228
 Started off with the regular Speedway, it had been a long while since I had it, wanted to compare the 2. Regular Speedway was better than I remembered, my palate has grown to favor Imperial Stouts. Now on to the BA Speedway
 Pours pretty much the same as regular, but smell is not the same. Has dark ripe fruits in the smell, as well as the expected coffee and chocolate, mild alchohol. Very nice smell, couldn't wait to get the first taste. 
 Holy crap! This is the smoothest beer I have ever had! Goes down like silk, very little alchohol flavor, but the warming effect is there. I am not one to give great details on flavors, I am still learning to pick out the different ones, so I can't do this beer justice in my description. Very mild bourbon flavor, coffee, chocolate, but very different from the regular Speedway. 100% smoother, and the regular Speedway is pretty damn smooth. I have not rated a ton of beers, but I have had over 600 different beers, and I think this is #1!
 This gets a "5" from me. I don't see how to improve on this. I can't wait to age my other bottle and try again in a couple of years. To all who have this beer, ENJOY! To all searching for it, GOOD LUCK 1,212 charactersBoolshot, Jul 10, 2006
5/5  rDev +11.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The 2004 Barrel-Aged of an already awesome favorite...couldn't wait any longer, someone had to open one! Bottle # 68 of 228.
From the new labeled, 750ml. green champagne bottle pours a pitch black (almost brown) that let's no light through my tulip glass. A 1/2 inch of cocoa-brown cap sits on top. Mild carbonation and a little sticky lace as you go...nice. Although it's been classified as an American Double Stout previously, it is very Imperial Stout like as well, thus the RIS listing here.
The smell is of dark black roast coffee, chocolate, black licorice and alcohol, and it smells even better as it warms. This stuff smells tantilizing, correct me if I'm wrong.
Amazing flavor, after I have a sip, my tastebuds start to water, I'm not kidding! The entry is sweet (not too mention alcoholic) and strong with coffee, black licorice, bitter-sweet chocolate and liquer. Full of intense flavor that intertwine beautifully into a toxic, elixor of bliss. It is a definitely a notch + above the Speedway as I Know it...it's f-in tasty!
The mouthfeel is smooth and alcoholicly warm, the body is only medium-heavy, not as thick and chewy as I was thinking, the flavor is truly exceptional...absolutely exceptional too me.
Great to drink right now...can't wait to see how this one matures.
Awesome stuff, Cheers to the fortunate few (and everone else of coarse) !!! 1,379 charactersscottoale, Jul 03, 2006
4.4/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4bottle 66: Black body wears a thin off-white head. I cant wait for the old numbskull version. Obvious bourbon barrel aroma. It comes out minty (after eight chocolate) and candyish with all the usual stoutish aspects. Big whiskey and roasty suggestions. Large hop presence although the barrel aging really seems to mellow them out for the best. Bitter bourbon finish. Mild acidity doesnt alterate the pleasure. Fruity and almost anise reminiscent. Great balance for such a monster. Thick body with smooth low carbonation. Good going Alesmith. I didnt notice any coffee. To me, this is far more pleasant than the regular speedway. Thanks again hopsrus. 656 charactersRastacouere, Aug 01, 2004
4.43/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Dark brown color. Medium head. Aroma is malts, dark sugar and fruits. Full bodied Imperial Stout. Malts are roasty, chocolate and coffee, with touches of vanilla and dark fruit. The brandy/bourbon flavor is evident. Nice blend of chocolate, wood and smoke. Very smooth. Bourbon and chocolate flavors blend well together. Touch of alcohol bite. Nice beer. Mouthfeel is full and round. Finish is clean and smooth. Aftertaste is slightly bitter. 442 charactersbeerguy101, Jan 01, 2004
