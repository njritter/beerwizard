3.65/5  rDev -20%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75$1 per oz at a bar in Brooklyn. Currently #43 in the Top 250.
HEAD: Frothy, soft, white. Leaves a thick and even coating of lacing on the Glass's sides as it recedes, which takes about 2 minutes.
BODY: Unfiltered and hazy, with a dull orange-copper colour. No yeast/lees are visible within.
Appears aptly carbonated. Not a unique or special appearance for an IPA by any stretch.
AROMA: Yogurty tang. Passionfruit. Citrus zest. Keylime. Fresh floral hop aromatics. Not too tropical by any means.
Pale malts erase any trace of hop bitterness. It's pleasantly pungent, suggesting a balanced yet surprisingly complex beer for a single hop (I)IPA.
Aromatic intensity is moderate.
TASTE: A unique mix of yogurt-like tang and fruity hops make this a delightful and balanced brew. The subtle tug of tropical Passionfruit on the more straightforward keylime citrus hop emphasis works well, with floral hop flavours lending this ale additional complexity.
Pale malts balance out any hop bitterness. Good depth of flavour. Above average flavour duration.
It fulfills the potential of its premise, showcasing galaxy hops remarkably well and making me view the hop differently than I had before...But as a single hop beer, it is limited in its intricacy. Drinkers after a still more multidimensional and masterfully complex brew may be let down.
Not an IPA for those drinkers after a piney, grapefruity, resinous, or oily hop profile.
TEXTURE: Smooth, coating, wet, well-carbonated, medium-bodied, soft, and approachable, with a cool refreshing quality to it that helps elevate it beyond many beers in the style, playing with that odd yogurty flavour that Hill Farmstead seems uniquely able to coax out of certain hops (often Simcoe).
OVERALL: Dangerously drinkable for its moderately high ABV, and no doubt one of the best galaxy single hop beers I've ever had. I wouldn't count it up there with the very best in the style (and I consider it an IPA), but it's absolutely worth trying and I'd definitely buy it regularly if not for the price. Not Too 250 material by my personal estimation, but it's unusually well-executed and joins the company of Mikkeller's Single Hop Amarillo as one of the best single hop IPAs I've had. Hat tip to Hill Farmstead.

Grapefruit is the dominant smell, but lots of tropical fruit as well. A bit on the sweeter side. More guava and mango, not a lot of citrus or pine.
Malt is has a more substantial presence than I expected...the cracker keeps the hops reigned in a bit. Citrus is more prevalent in the taste.
Soft mouthfeel, a bit chalky, light carbonation. Really no bitterness 441 charactersTrojanRB, Feb 15, 2017
4.68/5  rDev +2.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Look: Poured from a 750ml Growler filled at the brewery into a tulip glass. Pours a cloudy golden, orange color and is for all intents and purposes opaque. Virtually nonexistent head, and leaves characteristic lace around the glass. Exactly what I look for in a good DIPA.
Smell: Very fruity notes. I get orange peel and grapefruit with mild piney  notes which hide under the immediate burst of citrus. After first opening the bottle, you get a good burst of the malt backbone this beer provides which is a nice balance for this world class beer. I just want to crawl inside the bottle and live in here.
Taste: Phenomenal taste which starts with orange peels, lemon, and grapefruit which finishes with light hoppy notes such as pine and tart. The malt profile offers a delicious balance, and there is virtually no astringency you get from other 8% DIPAs on the market. This beer leaves a delicious resinous aftertaste of a good hoppy beer.
Feel: Light carbonation which easily flows over the palate and offers a delicious way to spread the flavor of this beer. 
like true fashion of most world class DIPAs the finish is perfect and your mouth is left feeling refresh and tart.
Overall: This is a delicious beer and rivals as one of my favorite beers, if you can get your hands on this gem I highly suggest you make the trip to the brewery (Practically in the middle of nowhere in rural Vermont). Part of the attraction this beer provides is how it is not readily available, and you can only bring this beer home from the brewery.

on tap @ The Mule Bar, Winooski, VT on 6 June 2016
$8 / 10 oz., 8% ABV
Notes: Cloudy orange-gold body beneath a bright white head. Hard to tell what the head retention and lacing are truly like given it's in a bar glass... seems very good, but it could perhaps be better. I'm guessing this is hopped with Galaxy hops, although I'm not sure about the "double" part. Is it a double IPA or is it double hopped with Galaxy? Do they make a "Galaxy IPA"? Pleasant, non-distinctive citrus in the aroma with a suggestion of other fruit over a lightly grainy malt base. The flavor is fuller, delivering juicy hops  (tropical/citrus... soft grapefruit... perhaps passion fruit) over a sweetish 'cracker-like' maltiness. Solidly bitter, leading to a dry, bitter finish with some residual hoppy fruitiness. The alcohol never shows (although I only have 10 oz.). Medium bodied with a moderate carbonation that leaves it smooth across the palate. Nicely balanced - finely focused. I'm pleased that it's not over-blown, and thus quite drinkable despite its strength. 1,091 charactersNeroFiddled, Nov 01, 2016

Pours a beautiful hazy deep golden color with one finger of soapy head.
Aromas are dank hops, tropical fruit and a touch of sweetness.
Flavor is incredible. Tons of orange peel, some tropical fruit and good maltiness in the finish.
Mouthfeel is excellent.
I can't believe it took me this long to try it, but it's fucking incredible. 360 charactersBoldRulerVT, Jul 20, 2016

4/4.5/4/3.5/4
Hazy, unfiltered head. No chance at a head -- full to the brim. 
It smells delightfully hoppy, and also lots of fruit. Delightfully citrusy mangos. Lemon peel. 
Light bodied and bit fizzy. The hops aren't immediately obvious, but he aftertaste is eternally herbaceous. The maintaste is mostly grain and orange zest, with a juicy-bitter component that is more Tropicana than Copacobana. I certainly wouldn't have known the provenance of tasting blind. 
Decent DIPA, but there's better out there. Not HF's finest moment. 553 charactersAgentMunky, Jul 17, 2016

5/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Double Galaxy is the best DIPA I've ever had and one of the best beers I've had bar none! It is thick, looks thick, drinks smoothly (like all Hill Farmstead) and tastes amazing! People describe IPA's as tropical tasting, but I was never able to taste tropical fruits in an ipa. That is until I had Double Galaxy. It was bursting with orange, bananas, mangoes, pineapples, guava, peaches and other yummy fruits. It also introduced me to the Galaxy hop, which has become a favourite of mine.  Double Galaxy is an outstanding beer. Its way better than Treehouse beers which currently 7/5/16 rank higher than it. I highly recommend drinking it. Awesome stuff!!! 657 charactersTheRossness, Jul 05, 2016

This one pours a bright and supremely hazy orange, with a small head, and a ton of lacing.
This smells like orange puree, grapefruit pith, mango, pineapple, passionfruit, a little bit of pine, and a little bit of grass.
This is probably the most delicious IPA I've ever had, possibly the most delicious beer I've ever had. It's so bold, but balanced between all the things in an IPA that I want. It's super juicy up front, delicious grapefruit, intense orange, as well as mango, pineapple and passionfruit, and just the slighest hint of malt to prop everything up. This is unreal.
This is pretty rich, but not thick. It's very easy to drink, but substantial, with a good level of carbonation.
I am absolutely floored by this beer. Unreal stuff. 783 charactersGreesyFizeek, Jun 01, 2016

Nose is a little light -- citrus and a little funk. Lots of orange, orange peel, and a bit of funk in taste -- super clean, super smooth. This is one of the top IPA type beers I have had -- very much different, but in the same world class as the Abner I had yesterday. Bottom line - it is going to be real hard to put Vermont in my rear view mirror tomorrow knowing that Hill Farmstead doesn't make it down my way. Well worth getting off of the beaten path to visit Greensboro Bend and pick up some real gems. 614 characters11-52_4hops, May 30, 2016

The small and flavors consist of mangos, pineapples, citrus, pine, fresh grass, somewhat herbal; very clean IMO. The hint of alcohol is very limited here.

appearance is everything youd expect in a HF ipa... hazy, nice retention and lacing 
smell basically sealed the deal for me. tropical vacation status - mango, pineapple, melons, orange, citrus zest and a light pine. 
the taste is unbelievably fresh and juicy, matches the nose really nicely, straight up hop bomb with just the right amount of very light malt sweetness to balance. mouthfeel is great in terms of accentuating the intended flavors and creates a really nice piney bitterness on the finish. 
overall i think its one of the most perfect IPAs ive tried, although that is highly subjective of course. balance is unbelievable, the quality of flavor surpasses that of most IIIPAs but it drinks like a session. i dont know how they did it, but im very pleased. 870 charactersHyptochrons, Feb 16, 2016

Looks beautiful.. pours a hazy golden orange body with a big, frothy white head that reduces slowly to leave moderate lacing and some chunky retention. 
Aromas are super inviting, bursting citrus, pine, tropical fruit, grapefruit. On the tongue is a delicious cornucopia of fresh hop notes, tons of citrus and grapefruit, light pine on the follow through with a light resinous hop zing on the finish that sits on the tongue for a while. Medium body and low-ish carbonation. Wish it was a little more carbonated but that's really not a big deal. 
Overall delicious, another winner from HF. Clean, crisp and nicely balanced, easy to drink. Recommended. 760 charactersgcamparone, Dec 16, 2015

No matter, it still smelled pretty impressive. Galaxy, to me, always has such a ripe, tropical fruity aroma and then the flavor is more assertive. The nose here is mixed citrus with passion fruit. The flavor is more pungent than the nose. A really strong, tropical fruit medley. Passion fruit and some grass. Creamy, full bodied ale. Slightly below my expectations but my head was in the clouds for this one. 513 charactersVelvetExtract, Nov 05, 2015

A: Golden-orange color. Opaque with haze. Fluffy white head retains well. Webby lacing. 
S: Heady and obscenely tropical. Kiwi, papaya, passion fruit, tangerine wedges, grapefruit with sugar. Freshly mowed grass, mildly leafy and spicy, sticky cannabis. Big floral dimension too.  Broken pine needles. Juicy fruit gum. There's a crazy hop complexity on the nose, especially considering this is a single hop brew. Underpinnings of doughy malt. 
T: Tropical and exotic hop flavor hits the tongue with magnum force. Honeydew melon and cantaloupe, kiwi, papaya, tangerine juice, grapefruit juice, tangy passion fruit. Leafy with a mild spice. Broken pine needles in the background. Sticky cannabis. Pithy and floral too. Bitterness is very tame. Doughy and nougaty malt flavors support. Faint trace of alcohol. Long juicy tropical finish.
M: Medium bodied. Round and full with that chewy unfiltered feel. Silky smooth. 
O: Ridiculous hop flavor and complexity crammed into this single hop beer. Bitterness is tame and drinkability is through the roof. So vibrant and uniquely tropical and juicy. This is Hill Farmstead's mic drop. I don't know that it's possible to make a hop-forward beer better than this. 1,242 charactersryan1788a5, Oct 31, 2015

L - hazy orangish, gold.  Thin head.  Simply a beautiful beer
S - bready, earthy, mango, and orange.  a unique heaviness to the smell of citrus
T - this is where it all comes together.  zesty citrus big time.  grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and orange.  also very grassy and earthy.  quite amazing, especially considering it's a single hopped, galaxy hopped IPA.
F - very crisp and smooth.  very drinkable as always with these HF ales
O - amazing beer overall.  Another great HF beer that I could drink any day of the week.  Mr. Hill really knows how to pack tons of flavor into now super high ABV beers.  I would take Abner and Double Citra over this, but not by much.  Will have again! 719 charactersrabbott2, Oct 23, 2015

S - pineapple and butter. Wheaty galaxy. Little bit of lemon. Very rich and sweet. 
T - buttered popcorn and Chardonnay. Distinct flavor that I am poorly attempting to describe. Guava, crackers, and sweet malt, but no caramel. Margarine candy, which sounds disgusting, but screw you this is delicious. 
F - low carb and chilly. Refreshing and utterly smooth. Savory and fits the profile of this beer to a "T". 
O - I will always love this beer. Has the right amount of sweetness to sate that tooth of mine with some bitterness and a luxurious mouthfeel to top it all off. 707 charactersagreenman19, Oct 22, 2015

Looks like Sunny D and the smell is world class. Resin, earth qualities matched with Danky juice and the perfect amount of garlic. Taste is world class this is insane. Really the perfect blend between resin and juice. They balance so well and the alcohol is no where to be found. Mouthfeel is where I like it. Just enough bite to remind you it's full of hops but plenty of smooth orange/white grape danky goodness. Definitely my favorite brewery - makes me want to visit Vermont STAT 558 charactersM_chav, Oct 20, 2015

Hmm, can't give this much props for appearance. Very turbid in the body and resembles pear juice or something of that variety. Excellent lacing however and a nice frothy head. 3
That nose gets us back on track. Mango and pineapple leap out at me. It's so potent I feel like there are strands of fruit fiber stuck in my nostrils. How this is achieved I don't know, but I'm mighty impressed. It's bitter and citric to boot, but those are minor role players. 4.75
When I shared this beer with friends earlier in the day, I got much more pithy and zesty grapefruit peel, but for whatever reason, more mango emerges with my second visit of the day (alone and able to focus entirely on the beer). Still, it's got a strong bitter grapefruit flavor followed by an injection of floral flavor that suggests a saison. 4.25
Has what seems a trademark of Hill Farmstead beers, an excessively easy-drinking quality and smoothness, at least for 2/3 of my palate. The finish is much more aggressive, yeasty, pithy and bitter. It's easy to miss the spicy hop bite too, but it's there. 4.25
Hill Farmstead. Good beer. I'm being redundant. 1,165 charactersONovoMexicano, Oct 05, 2015

Pours a cloudy orange color with not a big head, leaves some lacing. Big wallop on the aroma of oranges and citrus, sweet, with a nice malt note in there. Resinous hoppiness. The taste is pure sweet orange juice, much more so than the Edward I had before. Some tropical notes in there, too, and the bready and doughy malts try to form a backbone. Body is a bit thinner than expected for a DIPA, but overall quite light and easy to drink, no alcohol present. Simply a lovely, citrusy DIPA from those awesome Galaxy hops! 590 charactersBranfordBound, Oct 04, 2015

The aroma brings bold orange/lemon citrus with a lightly grassy mustiness. Very appetizing. The flavor delivers big juicy orange grass with mild lemon edges and piney malt. Fairly intense but mellowed slightly by the woodsy grain ideas. The body is medium plus with a finely full carbonation that blankets the tongue and finishes with a lively but mildly sticky feel. Just a class delivery of wonderful hops here. 580 charactersDurge, Sep 30, 2015

Pours a hazy burnt copper with a frothy 1/4 inch top. 
Mangos, pineapples, citrus, pine needles and white pepper touch the nose.
The taste starts clean, and finishes with a gracious Galaxy hop presence punctuating fresh grass, hard herbs, citrus and stone fruit. Only a hint of alcohol present for an 8% beer.
Truly a wonderful DIPA, and one I would be lucky to have time and time again. 467 charactershandcrafty, Oct 31, 2014

Taste is so smooth and balanced. Far from the typical over-resinous or sweetened dipa. Citrus, hint of pepper (alcohol?) but not boozy at all. 
Bitterness is dry, fruity, smooth, perfect.
Overall, that's the kind of ipa i've always dreamed to drink. One of my best beer from HF so far 356 charactersFranck, Oct 31, 2014

4.83/5  rDev +5.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a brewery-filled growler into a US tumbler pint glass.
A: The beer is a deep gold color, with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a very thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is an excellent blend of floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out very sweet with flavors of citrus and caramel. Then a nice piney hops bitterness comes in. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and provides a great balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is clean.
O: Extremely tasty, goes down dangerously easy, not too filling, good kick, great representation of style, this is a tremendous 2IPA to drink for as long as you can handle it. 780 charactersTheManiacalOne, Oct 26, 2014

Consumed 10/25/14
A: Hazy tangerine colored with some burnt orange, honey, and gold - pours with a large, white head, fades to a wispy cap, leaves some nice streaks of lacing 
S: Hoppy and juicy, as expected - potent, bright notes of tangerine, orange, and grapefruit - very ripe, fresh, and fleshy - floral and herbal notes - hop cones, pine, grass - peaches and some spice - tropical aromas - light sweetness - pale, bready malts, with a touch of caramel
T: Fruity, juicy, nicely hoppy - ripe orange and ruby red grapefruit flesh - herbal, grassy, floral, and kind of spicy in an earthy way - pine needles and an aftertaste of mint - moderately bitter - malts are very mild, just providing a solid base of pale malts, pale grains, and bread - very clean, as is the trend with Hill Farmstead
M: Medium body, nicely carbonated, very smooth, finishes very clean, dry
O: So many stars in one bottle
This is very similar to Hill Farmstead's Double Citra, which makes sense. I'm not as familiar with the idiosyncrasies with galaxy as I am with citra, so I guess this was more novel. Both are awesome beers, but I think this may have some more depth. 1,212 charactersangrybabboon, Oct 26, 2014
4.31/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Split with angrybabboon.
Appearance: Hazy dark golden yellow. Head is a loose dense white with tons of sticky lacing. Solid retention leaves a small clumpy cap and slightly thicker collar. Moderate carbonation on the pour. 
Smell: Earthy and grassy with a pronounced but not aggressive bitterness. Pine needle lingers on the back. Tropical, but more like guava, mango, etc. A less sweet fruitiness. Malts are the expected pale malt sweetness with a slight push of cracker and undercooked biscuit dough. A touch of yeast adds some slightly fruity esters. Some grapefruit rind and oil in the mix as well. A bit more aggressive than the other single hop beers.
Taste: Woody pine branch. Slightly earthy and herbal as well. Some pithy bitterness coupled with some grapefruit rind. Pushes guava, mango, some passion fruit, and a touch of ruby red grapefruit. Flash of bitterness cleans out rather quickly. Malts are very lightly sweet with some mild bready elements. Slightly mealy fruit. Flower petals. Some hints of grass thrown in there. Fresh biscuit dough. Some very mild fruity esters. Bitter pithy fruit.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate carbonation and a decently dry finish. Initial sip is slightly creamy and smooth. Easy drinking.
Overall: The Guardians might have trouble protecting this Galaxy.
Throw on your favorite mixtape and sit back with this and enjoy. As far as a single hop goes it has decent depth and plays quite well with the malt base. Slightly sweet and properly bitter. It lingers. 1,516 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Oct 26, 2014

A: Hazy just darker than golden body full of vey fine carbonation. A 1.5 inch frothy whote head bursts over and over again with bubbles. Head retention is moderate (~ 1 minute) and eve vigorous swirling regnereates only about 1/2 inch of the head. A moderate yet fone lacing pattern remains as the glass empties.
S: Compared to Citra single, thos is more tropical, perhaps passion fruit or guava? Not as potent or strong up front as the Citra. but more balanced and nuanced with touches of grassy, earthy aromas. Still no hint of malt in this.
T: Pine and resin dominate with tropical fruit and lemon following up. Much jucier i my mouth tha. I thoguht fromthe nose. Bitterness lingers on the tongue, but not at all unpleasant. Malt backbone is mild but noticable...it doesn't smack you lie, a west coast IPA, but it's presence is clear and crisp.
M: Despite the huge hop flavor this remains medium to medium-heavy in the body. Oily residue is minimal and as a result, residual bitterness fades quickly. Carbonation is appropriate and keeps the beer fresh. 8.00% alcohol is well hidden...no hint of fusel heat or booze.
O: I really like this, and I'd like to think I could drink more... but I don't think that the alcohol would permit that. A great example of the style, especi?ly or out here o. the east coast. I can see why people clamor for this beer. 1,423 charactersF2brewers, Oct 10, 2014

Appearance: Pours a bright honey color and leaves a couple fingers of white, medium head which lingers for a little while before fading to a white layer atop the beer, leaving lacing down the glass. (4.5)
Smell: Nice grapefruit, peach, mango, honey, some light cereal malts. Really nice aromas from the hops in here, and really well balanced. (4.75)
Taste: Grapefruit takes the lead along with some peach, light piney resin, all hops which is great. Really juicy. Nice smooth finish too - all the hops without the bitterness. Really drinkable for a big IPA, and really balanced for being so hop forward. (4.75)
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a medium, creamy body. Really nice mouth-feel. Finishes smooth. (4.9)
Overall: Wonderful citrus, peach and resin flavors in the aroma and taste take center stage and make it terrific. Nice, creamy body and an extremely drinkable DIPA. Fantastic. (4.76) 1,031 charactersResuin, Oct 08, 2014

A.  Cloudy, hazy goldenrod.  Three finger white head with big soapy bubbles and coating lacing.
S.  Mmmmmmm, those Galaxy hops.  Like a sun drenched citrus farm.  Bursting with tropical scents and just a little bit of a herbal hop and doughy malt backbone.  Perfect.
T.  Close to perfect.  It's loaded with flavor but doesn't quite "pop" like the nose. I'm not having this super fresh but it ain't stale either.  Honey drizzled tangerine rind, watermelon, candied oranges, and drying grassy hops.  Yum.
F.  Big, creamy, luscious, coating, refreshing.  Bright and expressive with nice complexity.
O.  One of the very best IPAs around.  Would enjoy again and again. 738 characterssiege06nd, May 17, 2014

Review #200
Appearance- Hazy orange with big 2 finger bubbly white head that left great lacing.
Smell- Big tropical fruits, nectarine, peach, tangerine, clementine, mango, pineapple, white grape, light malt background, and a slight hint of booze.
Taste- Big citrusy hops with light grassy/pine notes. Peach, grapes, oranges, earthy floral notes. No hint of booze in taste at all.
Mouthfeel- Well carbonated, with a medium body. No booze heat, very drinkable. Not very bitter, but very fruity.
Overall- A very well-crafted IIPA from Hill Farmstead (obviously). Very good beer that I could drink all day. 667 charactersSeanniek91, Jan 24, 2014

Look - Cloudy straw golden with an amber hue and a small soapy head. Great lacing. Great looking brew as per usual from HF.
Smell - Dank citrus from Galaxy hops, touch of malt but otherwise hops take center stage. Hill signature yeast.
Taste - Mouthful of juicy Galaxy hops. Dank citrus followed by some lemony zest and pine.
Mouthfeel - Light-medium bodied with light-medium carbonation. Rests citrus and pine bitter. Slight warm booziness but definitely well balanced. Great drinkability.
Overall - Great Galaxy hop brew, HF almost goes without saying that it's going to be a treat. 671 charactersJMScowcroft, Jan 19, 2014

A: Pours a slightly orangish straw color, hay with a half finger of attractive, snow white head. A good portion of the bubbles are quite large. Very good retention and some dots of lacing.
S: Predominantly delicate fruit (passion and stone fruit) with some herbal/floral notes, dankness and the occasional whiff of blue cheese, with a mild malt backbone. with some sweaty socks/blue cheese thing going on. 
T: Again, some mild fruit (grapefruit, now, but also stone, tangerine) with a more prominent herbal note, finishing quite dry with a mild bitterness. 
M: Soft mouthfeel with light carbonation and medium-light body.
O: Not the most exceptional DIPA, but delicate and highly drinkable, esp. given the ABV. Like all HF, this is well crafted, though more on the subtle end. 819 characterspmarlowe, Jan 17, 2014

4.57/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5750ml growler generously sent to me by Anthony. Thanks a lot man! Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass today, 1/15/2014. My main comparison is Pipeworks Galaxy Unicorn as that is the one other Galaxy-hopped DIPA that stands out in my mind.
Appears much like the other HF DIPAs- hazy golden-straw body, lots of thick white head and lots of lacing. Looks delicious, and from a homebrewing perspective, I can't quite see how Shaun can get his beers to look quite that pale!
Smells very good- straight up Galaxy hops. Lots of passion fruit and mango, but a little bit subdued compared to Pipeworks Galaxy Unicorn. However, the hops are more or less unopposed given that the malt base isn't as ridiculous in this one. This is a nice showcase of Galaxy hops here.
Flavourwise- comes out better than the smell. Flavour is a lot of passion fruit, a little of mango but not a ton of sweet malt backbone, which is interesting. Still, the flavours comes across really well here and I actually prefer the balance here more to Galaxy Unicorn which definitely has quite a bit more of a malt backbone. 
Medium bodied, very creamy and rich; not a terribly bitter aftertaste as Galaxy Unicorn has but rather a more passion fruity flavour finish. Finishes somewhat dry as well. Very good and easily drinkable. I could drink the entire growler on my own, easily.
I see the hype here, and the hype nearly meets expectations here. At the same time, I think the nose doesn't quite measure up to Galaxy Unicorn, but it does beat that beer in every other facet. Not Shaun's best DIPA despite what these ratings would have you think (Abner is a better, more complex beer) but it's definitely worth trying at least once.

Hazy light peach-colored body with a white head. Falls to about a half-finger leaving decent lace.
Scent includes herbs, earthiness, citrus/peach, caramel and sugar cookie sweetness. Honestly, tame overall. 
Taste is better and more potent with cat pee, peach, pineapple, earthy hops and some dank. Some sugar cookie malts and warm bread there but mostly hops. Low bitterness.
Nice smooth mouthfeel similar to other HF IPAs. Good carbonation, light feel, and way too drinkable for 8%.
This was good, the highlight to me was how crushable it was. Compared to some of their other hoppy ales I thought this too subtle in the flavor-wise. 702 charactersChico1985, Jan 13, 2014
4.35/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25A - Light tangerine color with a warm glow to it. Small white head
S - Sweet galaxy hops with passion fruit, strawberry, tangerine, and slight caramel. Really a sweet smelling beer.
T - Sweet galaxy hops with orange, tangerine, passion fruit and strawberry. Light bitter hops near the backend to it. Sweet balanced beer
M - Sweet body that is slightly thick with a good amount of carbonation to it. Slight hop resin remains on the tongue in the finish
O - A good galaxy hop beer that brings up the nice passion fruit and strawberry presence that'd you expect with enough slight bitterness to remind you that this is an IPA 626 charactersjeonseh, Jan 13, 2014
4.99/5  rDev +9.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Light straw colored body with a fluffy white head. Smell is citrus juice with light pine and almost fruity. This is probably the best IPA I've ever had including many from Alpine, Heady, Pliny, etc. The balance is incredible, and this drinks juicy but not sweet. The hop is incredibly delicate and the star of the show. Nothing gets in the way of the hop. Pretty much a perfect beer. 383 charactersPHBoiler, Jan 13, 2014

4.47/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.532oz growler (Tired Hands) poured into a Hill Farmstead oversized wine glass.
The beer pours a murky, unfiltered, copper color, hues of orange and gold with a big, thick, soapy white head, about 2 fingers high atop the beer that has very good retention and leaves a beautiful network of lace behind. The aroma is great, super dank, herby and grassy, big notes of pine and resinous hop spice that is cut beautifully by tropical fruit and a touch of citrus with only the softest, doughy malt character. The flavors follow well, bitter pine and coniferous character, hop spice, dank grassy and a bit of floral qualities pop up before the malt evens things out a bit. The mouthfeel is great, typical of a Hill Farmstead beer, rich and coating, but soft and gentle with just enough liveliness. The finish is dry and kicks well.
Verdict: A delicious DIPA from Hill Farmstead, great bitterness with a tremendous balance of flavors. It's ripe, juicy but also dank and bitter, wonderful to sip on. It's not the best DIPA he's made, but damn is it tasty. 1,046 characterskevanb, Jan 11, 2014
4.57/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to MikeyPNH for scoring this growler for me.
Pours a hazy light golden honey with 2 fingers of thick foamy head. The head slowly dissipates to a light layer of foam that persists.
Smells delicious. Citrusy hops and grass.
Tastes great. The transition from the hoppy deliciousness to the bitter aftertaste is super smooth. 
This is another great DIPA from Hill Farmstead. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this to any hop lover. 437 charactersScotNH, Jan 11, 2014

Certainly more of a citrus overtone and a fruity undertone- mango for sure. Fuck the blah blah shit- amazing hops character with excellent grapefruit and tangerine taste in the background. Quite bitter but doesn't go too far overboard, not a strong booze taste at all (very well masked) and not so malty, however why the fuck would I want malt in a doub? Insane hops is what is what I came for and its what I got in return. I live in VT so not so hard for me to get my hands on, but if you can do so its worth a 2 hr wait in line 661 characters80x2HopHead, Mar 19, 2013

Appearance. Pours a hazy honey gold with a finger of thick white head that leaves some nice lace.
Smell. Pineapple, papaya, oranges, red and yellow grapefruit, cedar, and some grainy toasted malts and a little bit of savory herbs. 
Taste. Big herbal, floral, and citrusy hops with some pine sap and cedar, a bit of those savoury herbs I was smelling, some grainy, lightly toasted malts, oranges and grapefruit flesh. Some bitterness throughout and some slightly numbing citrus rind in the finish. Very nice.
Mouthfeel. Medium+ body with fine medium carbonation. The fine carbonation really stands out among other IPAs. 
Overall. A fantastic IPA on par with the best. Reminiscent of heady topper with some more fruit juice flavours. Loved it. Thanks again montrealbcr98!! 922 charactersRutager, Mar 06, 2013

A- Pours a very hazy non-translucent yellowish orange with a white head that quickly dissipates (most pictures I've seen has a nice fluffy head with great retention so perhaps even though this growler is still very fresh some carbonation loss might have occurred). This is probably one of the haziest beers I've seen, even though it is fairly light in color there is hardly any light that penetrates.
S- Very aromatic with nice strong tropical fruity aromas of oranges, grapefruit, and pineapple. Easily one of the best smelling DIPAs I've encountered.
T- Similar to smell with tropical presence of pineapple, oranges, and grapefruit. Very flavorful with a nice bouquet of tropical fruits.
M- Medium bodied, very easy drinking, finishes with a slight alcohol bite that lets you know it's there but isn't very noticeable, a little bit fuller bodied then your average IPA.
O- This was another fantastic HF beer that was extremely flavorful and is one of my new favorites from them. I wish they could make this year round along with Abner. Although maybe slightly overrated this beer definitely lives up to it's hype and is well worth checking out. 1,344 charactersjaasen64, Feb 22, 2013

A: Poured a murky bright yellow with orange highlights. 1.5 fingers of a bright white head
S: Wow. This is where this beer shines. HUGE tropical and stone fruit notes: sweet peach, papaya, pineapple, coupled with nice citrus elements - lemon peel, orange, and grapefruit.
T: Ton of that tropical fruit in the front of the mouth. Lemon peel emerges a little bit towards the middle of the tongue. Finishes quite dry and bitter
MF: Spot on. Medium body with carbonation on the lower end. Works perfectly.
O: Super drinkable, refreshing, at at 8%, the alcohol is not present at all.
I could drink this consistently. Paired great with spicy food. HF does not disappoint once again. Was worth the 2 hour wait in the cold. Cheers! 765 charactersmontrealbcr89, Feb 19, 2013

Appearance - Very hazy orange body. Light wisps on the surface. Clings a little bit.
Smell - Oh yeah. Buckets of hops. Excellent citrus hop smell but it still manages to have a grainy malt presence. Sweet hoppy nectar.
Taste - Juicy citrus hop. Orange and grapefruit flavors. Nice sweet flavor behind it. Very monotonic, but deliciously so. Grainy malt and the sweetness drops off.
Mouthfeel - Medium body. Medium carbonation. Clean and just a little heavy.

The beer pours a slightly hazy amber with a thin, whispy white head. The nose is subtle yet potent, slightly citrusy/lemony, and has a great sweetness. The taste is saturated with flavor - sticky, fruity hops, a touch of alcohol, and sweetness, all of which is incredibly well balanced. The mouthfeel is drinkable, medium bodied, hop forward...it's a beer you could drink endlessly. This is definitely worth getting a growler of, even if you're not impressed after trying the sample size (which I was not). 542 charactersThePorterSorter, Feb 09, 2013

4.4/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Big thanks to dujayhawk for hooking me up! Reviewed from notes. Poured from HF growler into Russian River pint glass.
A: Pours a hazy gold with peach highlights. Medium size white fluffy head over fairly low visisble carbonation - perhaps due to the serving type, though this was a very fresh fill.
S: Wow, hops. Grass, pine, citrus, tropical fruit, all atop just a bit of biscuit malt.
T: Follows the nose well. Melon/spice hops show up big on the tongue, along with the big tropical fruit, and citrus. There are flavors of dank, resiny, citrus, and some grass hops. Surprisingly, though, it seems only moderately bitter amidst the cavalcade of hops. Just a bit of chewy malt noticeable just before the swallow.
M: The alcohol is well-hidden. A big, heavy, sticky body for an IPA with good carbonation sensation.
O: This is very tasty, and I'm glad to have had an opportunity to try it. It's a very well-put-together beer, but the hop profile isn't my favorite (or I may have scored it even higher). Very impressive nevertheless. 1,035 charactersmacrosmatic, Feb 03, 2013

Pouring a hazy yellow orange with a dense, white head with excellent retention but surprisingly little lacing, this looks pretty decent. The nose is a beautiful expression of fruit hop notes. Tangerine zest, mango, passion fruit, a little floral character, fragrant honey, all bright, with minimal bitterness, this smells _excellent_. There is also a little bit of semi-ripe pineapple present. I can't perceive much malt character here. While the nose isn't explosive (like, say, Heady Topper), it does display depth and delicacy, which I enjoy.
The palate opens bright with a blend of moderate bitterness and plenty of tropical fruit. The layered flavors of citrus, mango, passion fruit and pink guava juice are delightful, but there is something that's a little lacking here. The hop flavors, while beautifully layered, aren't as bright and redolent as I'd hoped. Bitterness is moderate, delicately so, working well with the flavors. There may be a hint of pale malt somewhere here, but it doesn't particularly stand out, this is all about the hops. Given the delicacy of the flavors here, the medium-high carbonation is distracting. It makes this a blend of creamy and frothy on the palate, which when combined with the lack of aggression as far as the hop flavors go, seem a little muted. Once the carbonation does fall off, this does gain a slightly ethereal feel, which is nice. Drying, moderately bitter on the finish, with a lingering fruity hop flavor, this beer is pretty excellent. 
I initially gave this beer a 4 for MF, but as I keep drinking it, it really does get better with subsiding carbonation, and so, I'm upping the score a hair. I guess what I was looking for was just a little bit of snap 1,834 charactersDefenCorps, Jan 30, 2013

Pours a super cloudy yellow/golden color. The smell is full of fruity citrus hop notes and seems very fresh. The taste lives up to the beer's reputation. Full of juicy citrus and pine hop bitterness. Enough sweetness to balance the bitter but still let the hops be the star. The finish is bitter and full of wonderful hops. 409 charactersoline73, Jan 28, 2013

Very nice citrusy sweet candy hops show their face first with good malt sweet character, signs of grapefruit, with pine and earhty notes. Nice hop profile consisting of citrus pine and earthiness with candi sugar accents, good bready malty sweetness, notes of pineapple and grapefruit accents. The brew was medium in body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a sweet, hoppy, bready, semi malty, piney and slight bitter finish. 563 charactersGobzilla, Jan 27, 2013

Pours a .5 finger frothy white head with moderate retention. Beer is a cloudy, pale yellow-orange. Lacing is thick and layered with great stick. As always, quite the looker from Hill Farmstead. 
Nose papaya, pineapple, starfruit, citrus, and cane sugar. Very pulpy and aromatic. Delicious!
Opens citrus, pineapple rind, papaya, and lemon rind bitterness. A light malt body balances this one in the back. Some citrus hop notes make their way to the front at the finish which is sticky and dry with a lightly astringent hop bitterness. Aftertaste is balanced tropical fruit. So drinkable and with a refreshingly new hop profile. 
Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth with some bubbles and life in the mouth and goes down dry and sticky with a long, lingering aftertaste. Perfect as always. 
Double Galaxy is far from my favorite Hill Farmstead DIPA but that's not to say it isn't astoundingly complex, refreshing, and drinkable all at the same time. Definitely worth seeking out as this one is quite different from the other HF pale ales. 1,170 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 22, 2013

A: Golden orange hone cloudy and basically completely opaque with a thick white fluffy head looks pretty much exactly like a dipa should in my opinion
S: Smells of tropical hops there is pretty much nothing there but hops but it has such a presence that you can almost smell the bitterness 
T: HOP BOMB this thing literally punches you in the mouth with hops instantaneously after taking even the smallest sip. This resides some as the beer warms and the hops start of have a juicer flavor with some citrus notes, but there is still a strong bitterness with hints of pine resin. This beer is pretty much straight hops in terms of flavor profile but I see nothing wrong with that.
M: The feel is very oily and resinous you can almost feel the stickiness in your mouth and it lasts for a pretty decent amount of time after the finish. There is not much carbonation but the bite from the bitterness makes up for it with crispness.
O:This is a hop head's dream especially if you like galaxy and bitterness. I really enjoyed this and does live up to the hype, but it is a little too much for me, however compared to everything else this beer is amazing. If you can get your hands on it try it for sure. 1,228 charactersPinknuggets, Jan 20, 2013

Citrus and tropical fruits pack a punch right up front on the nose. A nice variety of lemon and orange alongside juicy mango and pineapple. Just a hint of pine resin in the background. 
First sip is like drinking the mix of juices from a bowl of tropical fruit salad. Mango and passionfruit with a bit of orange as well. Not nearly as grapefruit-centric as many IPAs are these days. This is followed by a healthy bit of floralness and some heat from the alcohol. 
Mouthfeel is rather full-bodied with smooth but bubbly texture. Overall, another winner from HF. I'd put this on par with Heady Topper and just below Abner. 696 charactersKinsman, Jan 19, 2013

A~ glowing amber color, cloudy but still beautiful. nice head as well.

M~ very nice and smooth, some what thick and creamy but not over powering. this is a double i could drink all day long and definitely fall over =]
O~ could be one of my favorite double IPA's but at this point i've said that so many times its really hard to pick... would definitely drink again, but IMO it would be easier to seek out some heady or something similar and still have just about the same experience, maybe even better? 751 charactersSkrip, Jan 16, 2013

A: Cloudy lemon yellow. Foams dies down after a decently aggressive pour. Legs are OK. Not perfect, but acceptable. Might be turbulent still from the shipping. 
N: Clementines, pineapple, grapefruit. Pretty intense citrus. However, I don’t find there to be much depth to this. It’s like a wind through an orange grove.
 T: Very full. Pine and earth. Lots of citrus: Mandarins, passionfruit, pineapple. Quite tasty, but like the nose, it seems to hit a high dimension in the front and leave the back end lacking. 
M: Sticky and filling. Alcohol is well-hidden. 
O: A very solid DIPA and not when I’d ever turn down. Balanced and flavorful, bitter and filling, but it feels like it’s lacking another dimension which would bring it to the top tier for me. 800 charactersSarlacc83, Jan 15, 2013

Looks like natural apple juice coming out of the growler, pours a nice hazy apple juice color with a fat white head. Sticky lacing.
Smells dank, like overripe mangos and passionfruit, a little cat piss but somehow not in a bad way.
Tastes again like borderline-rotting mango and passionfruit, solid bitter bite, clearly a palate ruiner. I get maybe a little pine, lots of fruitiness and basically no citrus. Little to no malt character. 
Mouthfeel is great in my book, very creamy and inviting, medium carb, evident tannins from the hops. About 8-9oz is, my mouth feels like it's covered in hop particles.
Overall, a pretty great beer. It reminds me very much of Lawson's Kiwi. I enjoy single-hop beers, as they are an exercise in brewing restraint (though it's hard to argue this beer is in any way restrained). As far as DIPA, I enjoy Heady Topper and Abner more. 1,056 charactersMasterCraft, Jan 10, 2013

A: Pours a really cloudy hazy bright yellow orange color. Layer of bright white head. Still has tons of carbonation. Leaves sticky lacing sheeting all over the glass.
S: Getting some serious fruity hop aromas. Grapefruit, tangerine, mango, etc. Just an epic hop bomb. Also getting some herbal hop notes too? Maybe my nose is off. In appearance and small so far, very HT like.
T: This is really awesome stuff here. Not overly bitter on the tip of the tongue. Great citrus hop bomb. Getting all that grapefruit rind and orange juice like character that you smelled. There is minimal malt backing here. Just lingering hoppy goodness. Leads you to a nice dry finish.

Pour: Really nice hazy yellow orange, with two fingers of which foamy head. Head hangs around and leaves some really nice matted lacing. Body has a beautiful glowing aspect to it.
Smell: Huge grapefruit and tangerines up front, followed by some pineapple. Some light pine, but this is a citrus bomb. Some very light honey and biscuits on the back.
Taste: Bitter, juicy grapefruit explosion up front. Lots of citrus, some mango, and other tropical fruits. A nice bready sweetness tries to balance, but this is a hop assault. Finishes bitter with citrus.
Mouthfeel: Very juicy, and quite bitter. A nice medium body that has a certain breadyness to it. Finishes bitter.
Overall: This beer definitely lives up to its hype. An absolute citrus explosion. I think I personally prefer Double Citra, but one of the best nonetheless. 871 characterscfrances33, Jan 05, 2013

A- double galaxy pours a hazy golden yellow body that bursts with colors equivalent to the brightest yellow highlighter you will ever see. A plethora of white foam bursts onto the stage leaving massive spider web lacing on the edges of my hill farmstead stem glass. Very vibrant and inviting. On second thought, it's glowing.
S- A whack of pineapple juice blasts forth with mango and apricot flavors. Absolutely citric and as juicy as it gets. DG is as fruity and citric as it gets. Nevertheless there is a bitter element coupled by some herbal scent. A little pine at the exit and not to mention the alcohol is hidden. These galaxy hops are off the charts. 
T- A sweet rush of grapefruit that is enrobed in pineapples laces my mouth with brilliant bright flavors. This is like a tropical getaway for your palate. Astringent flavors of ripened fruit it matched with some caramel sweetness that has not been seen before. Whatever Shaun Hill did with the initial use of galaxy hops was essentially magnified by the dry hopping with the same hops. A perfect score for a DIPA when you include some mouth watering bitterness as well
M- refreshing, crisp, sticky, resinous flavors all over. Perfect feel
O- nearly three years on beeradvocate and finally it has happened for me. A 5/5. This is the best beer I have ever tasted. The attention to detail to this brew established the best DIPA in the planet in my opinion. What a brew. Give Double Galaxy the credit it deserves and drink it fresh!

Probably the worst looking beer I’ve had from Hill Farmstead. Aroma is a burst of tropical fruits, mango and pinneaples with a woody and rustic touch. Taste: Citrusy and spicy hops. Not as expressive as the other HF DIPA I’ve had but highly drinkable. Full bodied med-low carbonation. A little attenuated because it wasn’t consumed as fast as it should have. Should have drank this one sooner, but still very good nonetheless. 513 charactersLuk13, Jul 17, 2012

Appearance: Dark golden pour into a Hill Farmstead tulip. Thick head that slowly dissipates and leaves the glass thoroughly laced.
Smell: Huge juicy citrus and tropical fruit. Grapefruit is strongly present. Hops and a piney resin scent a lightly present in the backbone, but this one is all citrus. 
Taste: The galaxy hops really shine here. Grapefruit, orange, tropical fruits. Lightly bitter to start, with a stronger, lasting bitterness to finish. Beautiful.
Mouthfeel: Mild carbonation with a medium body. Slick and smooth on the palate. 
Overall: This is by far the best IPA/DIPA I've ever had. I drank this immediately after a Heady Topper and it put my previous favorite of the style (and still much beloved) to shame. I can't wait to try the other single hop experiments from Shaun. Incredible. 915 charactersvonnegut21, May 08, 2012

A: Pours an extremely cloudy dark iced-tea color with a huge, greasy and fluffy head that slowly faded into a thick and very oily looking head that left a ton of crazy lacing down the glass. 
S: Huge notes of citrus rind and tropical fruits. I get notes of lemon zest, orange peel, grapefruit zest, passion fruit, papaya and pineapple. There might be just a hint of pine as well. Smells great!
T: Follows the nose with huge dominating notes of galaxy hops. Lightly bitter citrus mixed with sweeter tropical fruits fill my palate. I get hints of dough and mint in the finish, and the aftertaste is solidly bitter. 
M: Slick and lightly greasy mouthfeel, smooth overall, with soft carbonation and a medium-heavy body. Bitterness is refreshing and goes well with the flavor. 
O: This was an amazing dipa, definitely top 10. Galaxy is a hell of a hop to make a beer out of. Thanks a million for this growler Mike. Much appreciated. 1,043 charactersscottfrie, May 04, 2012

Score: 94
No bottling date, but this one was picked up from the brewery approximately one week ago. Served in a stemmed Hill Farmstead snifter and enjoyed on 04/04/12.
Appearance: Pours a hazy and transclucent golden yellow color. One-plus fingers of cream colored seafoam head at pour settles into a thin layer atop the glass. Amazing lacing, undying retention. This IPA is beautiful. 5/5
Smell: Huge notes of fresh tropical citrus. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, apricot and mango. Fresh pine and freshly cut grass. Candied grapefruit too. 4.5/5
Taste: The aroma's hops were piney and a bit leafy, but the flavor's hops are downright earthy. Heavy, sticky and earthy hops pummel the palate along with light, complex, juicy and sweet tropical citrus flavors to balance out the hoppy bitterness. Pineapple, grapefruit, orange, mango and lemon. Maybe a little peach and apricot. Definitely detecting some "fresh mulch" or dirt-like flavor from the earthy hops (but not in a bad way, despite how bad such a descriptor might sound). The flavor throughout is very consistent: heavy hops with a sweet juicy citrus backhone. Finishes with a lingering earthy hop bitterness. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Light-medium bodied with low carbonation. The lesser carbonation works really well with the heavy, earthy hops on the palate. Juicy mouthfeel. Bitter finish. 4/5
Overall: Another home run from Hill Farmstead, who are quickly proving to me that they are the northeast masters of hops. If you liked Half Acre's Double Daisy Cutter, you will absolutely enjoy this one too.
Recommendation: If you like your IPA's juicy, and especially if you like heavier, earthier hops in your beer, then seek this one out. Short of the most casual beer drinker and the most cynical hop hater, I feel the remainder of beer enthusiasts out there could/should/would enjoy this one.
Pairings: Home grilled hamburgers with plenty of garlic and mango BBQ sauce.
Cost: $9 for a 750 ml swing-top bottle (plus a $3 deposit). 2,109 charactersjegross2, May 01, 2012

4.74/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Growler from gn0sis. Thanks!
Appearance: Hazy unfiltered pale amber. The head is lasting and dense, leaving sheets of lacing down the glass.
Smell: A ton of tropical fruit - pineapple, mango - lesser notes of grapefruit and onion. A low level of pale malt sweetness enhances the scent of tropical fruit. This smells excellent.
Palate: Waves of pineapple, mango and grapefruit. A hint of onion. There's a moderate level of malt sweetness that works well with the fruity hop profile. Medium bodied with slight chalkiness; not quite as light and crisp as I'd like, but it's not much of a detraction. Bitterness is firm and lasting without bringing any astringency.
Overall: Outstanding. Easily in the upper tier of DIPAs. 722 characterslargadeer, Apr 30, 2012

Growler to HF stemmed glass
750ml
Thanks to CliffBrake for this one
App- A big hazy, creamy, orange, yellow mixed with creme color. A solid fast receding 1-1/2 in off white head with tons of sticky cling and lace. Just a great looking beer.
Smell- Large amounts of tropical fruits with pineapple, tangerine taking over. Layered with a small piney large hoppy nose. Well balanced without either side dominating the other.
Taste- Really a creamy large and smooth IPA. Has a wonderful balance between the two flavors of tropical and hoppy. The hops are a very small bitter component and blend well with a creamy fruit layer.
Mouth- A very large medium carbonation. A bit too thick for my tastes and has a medium creamy carbonation. Residual citrus and small hop bitter.
Drink- A very good DIPA. Large flavors abound with a wonderful balance and texture. The rest of the beer makes up for the thickness, but just lovely. 942 charactersFosterJM, Apr 25, 2012

Pours a murky honey orange-brown with a foamy beige head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of tropical fruit and some herbal and peppery hop aromas. Taste is the same with some big grapefruit flavors. There is a somewhat mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA with awesome aromas and flavors that showcase the galaxy hops used. 585 charactersUCLABrewN84, Apr 17, 2012
4.42/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks much to gn0sis! About as fresh as I can manage and poured into a Deschutes snifter.
It's murky... cloudy... sort of like looking at melted butterscotch, except for the beautiful pearl head that leaves a good deal of lacing on the sides of the glass. I wasn't expecting such a translucent sheen, but I like it. The smell is... of... wait for it... Galaxy hops! no kidding! these are an earthy hop, sort of like smelling a peony in a pine forest. a bit of honeycomb comes through as well.
The taste is on the bitter side, but comfortably so with caramel on the sides of the tongue (as well as clementine, navel orange, and just a hint of berry sweetness). It goes down incredibly smooth with a clean aftertaste. The mouthfeel is a bit thin at first - it enters just on the watery side, but seems to thicken as it moves toward the throat and leaves just a bit of film. The transitional nature isn't quite doing it for me, but it's a small hiccup in an otherwise outstanding brew.
This was my first taste of Hill Farmstead. I blew the chance last time I was in Burlington, but glad I took the time here. Galaxy is a really wonderful brew, showcasing the quality of the hop variety in a subtle but focused manner. I'd certainly have this again. 1,249 charactersfvernon, Apr 17, 2012

Pours a clouded burnt orange with 2 fingers of creamy off white head, retains a sheet forever and leaves beautiful rings the whole way down the glass.
Mmmm Galaxy hops! Smells like super fruity pineapple grapefruit juice poured over some biscuits. Taste is a concoction of tropical fruits, pine resin, and biscuits. Medium body with creamy carbonation, light and dry finish for such a resinous hop monster. HF knocks it out of the park yet again with their IPA/DIPAs, and this might be my favorite IPA to date. 576 charactersxpimptastikx, Apr 16, 2012

S - Aroma is full of citrus and tropical fruits with lots of grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. There is some sweet caramel malt mixed in along with a bit of lemon and orange zest.
T - Starts off strong tropical fruit hop flavor with lots of grapefruit and pineapple with some bitterness. Through the middle, more bitterness comes through with even more topical fruits and citrus flavors with some orange zest, mango, and stronger pineapple, with a bit of sweet caramel malt. The finish is a mix of orange zest, lots of tropical fruits, bitterness, and a touch of caramel malt.
M - Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. Feels smooth with a zesty, dry, and bitter finish.
D - Very drinkable. The hop profile is incredible with the tropical flavors strong from start to end. The bitterness is really nice as well. Great showcase of the Galaxy hop. 1,011 charactersngeunit1, Apr 15, 2012

Medium body, medium-low carbonation, a hoppy dry finish. Super drinkable and creamy mouthfeel.

Pours a hazy unfiltered gold with a small white head leaving excellent lacing.
Smells like a tropical paradise. Loads of pineapple, mango and a nice dankness.
Flavor is what I've come to expect from galaxy hops slowing becoming one of my favorites. Juicy tropical fruit with a nice pine bite at the end. Perfectly balanced.
Juicy without being sweet and typical HF lower carbonation leading to that mouthfeel. No alcohol burn at all.
I'm an unabashed HF IPA lover, but this is still one of the best I've had. Amazingly complex for a single hop beer and goes down way too smooth. 621 charactersjmarsh123, Apr 13, 2012

Poured from a HF growler which I bought on 3/21/2012 into my glass (date 4/11/12).
A: Pours a brown/orange with a large head. Cloudy but uniformly so. 
S: Lemon zest, some pine and citrus notes. Overall a simple but great IPA smell.
T: Musty, some citrus and some hop very balanced and a little malty. 
M: Hops and malt fills the mouth all of which are good and balanced.
O: A great IPA. It would have been better fresher, but no worries. I would drink this on a weekly basis the only problem is there really nothing that particularly seems to stand out to me and it’s way too far out of the way to buy this when nothing stands out. 656 characterscodysjb, Apr 12, 2012

 While super hazy, looks are 4/5 all things considered. Somehow doesn't invoke the feelings of yuck that Heady Topper did in spite of being similarly murky. Not much by the way of aroma: slight papaya, rotting leaves, pine and resins.
 Taste? Goddamn this goes goes down easy! Bitter and dry but still creamy owing to the low carbonation. Very smooth. There is a good malt backbone and even that has character; very juicy with elements working in unison. Bigger body than their Society and Solitude 3, but still very easy to drink.

Pours a hazy bright orange color, with one finger of white head. Great lacing and retention. Looks inviting, for sure.
Smell is quite fruity, with undercurrents of grainy malts and hoppy bitterness. Grapefruit leads the way for sure, but the galaxy brings forth some unique juicy tropical fruity aromas. Pineapple, something pulpy I can't put my finger on. I like it.
Taste starts out with grapefruit citrus, then has a wave of I-don't-know-what. Almost nutty. Finish is grapefruit peel bitter. Unique, but in a way I wasn't really expecting, with some surprising flavors mid-way through. The bittering comes off a bit strangely, and peaks quite late. And I get much less of the tropical fruit here than I did in the smell. It's good, but doesn't have quite the depth, variety, or balance I find in the best DIPAs.
Medium-bodied, long bitter finish, spot-on carbonation. Not as sticky as many DIPAs, but good.
A very good IPA, definitely showcasing many aspects of this hop. Doesn't bowl me over, though, in the way that, say, Abrasive does. Looking back on this review, I barely mentioned the malts. Didn't mention their absence either, though. Clearly they're the supporting cast, and they do their job by not being noticeable. 1,288 characterszeledonia, Apr 02, 2012

The beer pours a murky, cloudy, light yellow/gold color. Very unique color and appearance for a DIPA or any beer for that matter. Rustic looking. Less head than other Hill farmsteads... maybe 1 finger or less. 
The nose is unique and inviting. Very fresh and loads of tropical fruit smack you in the face. The most tropical smelling/tasting beer I have experienced. I got mango, pineapple, passion fruit and orange. There is some citrus but less noticeable. 
The taste is similar to the nose. lots of juicy tropical fruit hops lead, with some mild/medium bitterness that transitions to a creamy and smooth finish. Not much malt apparent and the alcohol taste is well hidden -- two things I really like in a DIPA. 
The mouthfeel is pretty good. medium carbonation right at the beginning of the sip and beginning of beer, slips to mild carbonation for most of the experience. A little less that i prefer. Very creamy and smooth with nice bitterness and hops dancing around the taste buds. 
Overall another fantastic hop creation from Hill Farmstead. Very unique tropical flavor profile which is very cool. I'll look for this one to try again soon! 1,209 charactersdurrrr, Mar 31, 2012

Strongly hoppy, piney aroma. Assorted of citrus fruitiness hides in the background. Flavor profile is nearly a palate wrecker, though, as it unloads wave after wave of sharply flavored hops onto my taste buds. No malt in sight; balance be damned! Again: mild citrus in the shadows if you can find it amongst the overwhelming hops. Plenty of lingering bitterness after swallowing.
Might be the first West-Coast-style DIPA from Hill Farmstead, and certainly the first that lacks balance. Reminds me much more of a Single IPA than a DIPA due to the absence of a malt backbone, and I dislike Single IPAs for exactly this reason. If you like hops with your hops (and then more hops on the side), you're gonna love this one. 806 charactersbrystmar, Mar 29, 2012

Flavor is also full on hops - tropical and citrus fruits mixed with a bit of pine and spice on an appropriate malt base that lets the hops have all the limelight. 
Medium body, slightly chalky and definitely mouthcoating. Although this is a big beer with a lot of flavor, it still feels fresh at the end of the glass and is very gentle for what could be a palate wrecker - really amazing in that regard.

Very cloudy and light gold in color. Definitely unfiltered. Small head and some huge lacing.
Aroma of dank tropical fruit--mango, pineapple, passionfruit, some citrus.
Tastes like tropical hop juice. Big orange, pineapple and passionfruit flavors. Minor catty flavors. Little to no malt notes. The hop flavor is a great showcase of Galaxy hops. This beer lacks the usual pine/earthy/citrus-rind hop distinctions. 
Mouthfeel is medium in thickness, creamy and mildly carbonated. It goes down like nothing, but doesn't feel like water, either.
Hill Farmstead nails every hoppy beer they make, and this is no exception. It may be the best IPA or DIPA I've ever had. 755 charactersmusicforairports, Mar 13, 2012

4.57/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Hill Farmstead Galaxy Imperial Single Hop IPA has a hazy body that is a mix of orange and yellow hues. The off-white head is thin yet very solid looking, and the retention and lacing are both pretty good.
The aroma is very nice. Lots of citrus, passion fruit, a little bit of leafy hop flavor. Just a hint of pale malt lingers in the background.
Galaxy hops rock. The best way to prove that point might be by trying this IIPA from Hill Farmstead. The flavors are extremely juicy and fruity, with an array of citrus flavors that are not dominated by grapefruit. Hints of passion fruit and lemon also come through. The bitterness is low relative to the hop flavor, and relative to the style, moderate is the strongest I could describe it. The malt is very understated, with just a hint of cracker and bread from what tastes like a malt bill lead by pale malts. The finish has some more hop flavors, with a grassy, fresh taste to them and a little bit more bitterness.
The body is very nice, with a smooth creamy feeling and just a little tongue-rattling bitterness.
This is a IIPA that is worth seeking out for fans of the style, as it is one of the few best that I have ever had. Hill Farmstead absolutely crushes hoppy styles, and this and Ephraim are prime examples of that. 1,279 charactersHojaminbag, Jan 29, 2012

T: Oh so nice! The wonderful citrus fruit in the nose is perfectly balanced with earthy hops and smooth bitterness. Simply perfect! No joke.
M: Medium bodied with perfect carbonation.
O: Beautifully balanced beer! Another wonderful beer for these folks. So smooth and easy to drink it's almost dangerous. Luckily there was a group of folks to help enjoy the growler; otherwise, it might have been tempting to enjoy it over a day or so by myself. Will definitely seek this out again! 835 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 22, 2012

A: Perfect golden straw body with a huge white head. massive lacing.
N: Sharp citrus liquid sunshine nose. I want air freshener that smells like this!
Flavor is incredulous hop juiciness to the nth magnitude! Serious sunshine on my tongue with citrus character on the order of fresh squeezed orange juice.
Mouthfeel is thin, slick, slightly toothstrippy. Medium carb, hides it's ABV well.

Appearance: This looks great - super orange-amber-hazy. Classy and rustic, with a bit over one finger of white-and-bubbly head, very frothy. Good retention and solid lacing.
Smell: Super fresh and full of the best of citrus. 
Taste: Super citrusy and carbonated, sticky around the roof of the mouth. A fresh, orange and zestful taste and tropical feel.
Mouthfeel: Medium body, flavor and carbonation. 
Overall: Another great beer from HF! 639 charactersseanwhite, Jan 04, 2012
4.83/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On-tap at Armsby Abbey. Reviewed from notes.
A- Yellow orange body with a big white, creamy and thick head. Great retention and size. Unlimited lace makes the glass almost opaque.
S- Again, HF with very fresh hops. More of a sharp citrus-forward feel instead of any sweet fruit. Citrus mixes with grass, floral, pineapple and general grain.
T- Hop bomb flavor, big notes of mango, orange, peach, lemon zest, grass, strawberry, grass and floral. Don't know what it is but this reminds me of a farm somehow, grassy and grainy malt mixture. Some sweets.
MF- Creamy moderate thick body, tart and a bit bitter. Smooth overall feel.
Amazing Double IPA when it comes down to it. Awesome peach and mango feel. Shaun really competes with any good hoppy beer, Heady, Pliny, Alpine etc. 780 characterscbutova, Jan 02, 2012

It poured a pale, yellow orange color that was a little reminiscent of pineapple juice. A thick, frothy, white colored head filled the top two inches of the glass and clung to the sides as I drank it. 
The aroma has a juicy, citrusy hoppiness to it with notes of grapefruit, pineapple and mango. Nice range of hoppy flavors coming out in it, and I really liked the tropical fruit notes. 
The taste shows more of the juicy, sweeter, tropical fruit notes to it up front. Towards the finish more of a bitter, citrus rind, grapefruit flavor starts to take over and linger into the finish. I get some piny, resiny flavors lingering in the finish as well. Nice range of hoppiness to it. 
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall I thought it was a great beer. It was a very flavorful and easy drinking beer. It had a great range of hoppy flavors to it but more importantly it really managed to balance the juicy, sweet flavors with the bitter, resiny flavors nicely. 1,054 charactersbillab914, Jan 01, 2012

Light fizzy 1/2 finger head, soapy lacing, super hazy carrot wheat color.
Nose fresh hops, light musty resin, pine, citrus, very light malt, tangerine, peach etc.
Taste starts grainy and malty, then earthy hops, light floral, then citrus galore, light tropical fruits, tangerine, mango, even slight pineapple, hint of pine and resins, light malty sweetness but little balance. Big malts and bitter hops, would be astringent if it wasn't for the malty sweet balance. finish is fairly bitter, little sweet but dry, hint of fresh pale malt, more hops, long pine and reason, lots of fresh tropical fruit hops late, and gets boozy as it warms.
Mouth med bodied, good carb.
Overall nice, big hops and malts, nice malty balance overall, a bit on the boozy side, decent tropical fruits and citrus hops, overall not too heavy but a sipper. 884 charactersjlindros, Dec 30, 2011

Served in a snifter
The beer poured a super cloudy, peach color and was topped by a small, flimsy white head. Spiderwebs of lacing coated the glass.
The aroma was amazingly fruity and pungent. Tons of tropical fruits, including mango, papaya and pineapple. Super strong notes of peaches and apricots. Lots of tangerine juice as well. Pure hop nectar in a glass!
Intense peach and apricot notes also appeared in the flavor profile. Dank and resiny with a slightly floral hoppiness. Some honey was apparent, along with a touch of caramel malt sweetness (just enough for balance). Ruby red grapefruit came through on the crisp, slightly dry finish.
The mouthfeel was medium bodied. Smooth, creamy and supple on the palate.
Galaxy Imperial Single Hop IPA is a ridiculously hopped yet super smooth and drinkable double IPA. It is definitely one of the top three versions of the style I have ever sampled and one of my favorite beers overall. 985 charactersDamian, Dec 30, 2011

A- Pours a slightly hazy orange with a frothy two finger heads that slowly dissipates leaving gobs of lacing. 
S- Ripe juicy passionfruit, lemon, mandarine, pineapple, mango, peach and a good chunk of caramel malt.
T- Matches the aroma with a boatload of tropical and citrus fruits, floral hops, a bit of pine and the perfect amount of the caramel malt to provide a perfectly balanced DIPA.
M- Medium carbonation and body with a smooth and creamy mouthfeel that finishes slightly dry. Perfect. 
O- In my notes, I wrote smooth about 5 times and that is really what this beer is. A perfectly balanced DIPA that keeps the bitterness in check with the right amount of caramel sweetness. I was not let down by the hype surrounding HF IPA's and I'm craving to try more.
Thanks again Bryan! 957 charactersiadler, Oct 11, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -11.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at the Rattle n Hum last month. The beer was served as a 12oz pour in a tall thin glass.
Galaxy Imperial Single Hop IPA pours a somewhat clear dark orange. There's a little bit of soap colored foam crowning the beer, but it's unremarkable both in terms of head retention and lacing. The nose is a little bit weak, but what is there is very nice, redolent of passion fruit and other tropical fruity notes. Each sip opens with a pleasant swirl of caramel, before a very smooth bitterness rolls in mid palate. The same fruity notes from the nose comprise the back end, and it's not as subdued as the nose is. The body is nicely dialed in, sturdy enough to support the hops, but not at all overbearing. The carbonation is nice and active, the bubbly nature really accenting the hops. I really enjoyed this beer, and specifically the flavors/aromas from the Galaxy hops. I'll be sure to check these hops out for my own brewing purposes in the future. 953 charactersaxeman9182, Sep 26, 2011

Filled ~ 8/13/11
Poured from Swing-Top Fill to Oversized Wine Glass.
A: Deep bread crust orange/yellow with some bold foam sitting over the beer like clouds. Really very lofty foam that leaves rain drops of lacing as it recedes. This is a very deep orange/persimmon jam in the glass. I would say marmalade, but it's much thicker and darker than that. Organic raw honey look that makes me excited to taste.
S: Huge tropical fruit character that exhibits those more unusual fruits: Passion fruit, Mango, and a bit of guava with rind. A bit of tangerine citrus mixes with lemony zests. Though I would say the only thing very citrusy about this is the zesty spritzy essence, while the smell character is actually tropical in a slightly unusual way. This reminds me a bit of the Kern River IPAs in the nose. Which I think are some of the best smelling beers on the planet.
T: The taste is a bit more ordinary than I would have hoped (It's single hop, I know, but I can dream). A really rounded grapefruit rind and connective tissue flavor that lingers closer to mandarin oranges/clementines. A very light bitterness that doesn't come off harsh in any way whatsoever. There's a big "oily" character to the flavors that I can't quite pinpoint, but it soothes over any potential room for alcohol to peak in the flavor. Oily flavors mix with alcohol to create a cloak for the alcohol. 
M: Okay, this mouth is phenomenal. This is so buttery and so creamy I can hardly believe it came out of a growler. I'm very glad that it's held up this well, but really this is just an outstanding lightly bursting bubble mouth that just slips down the throat like some delicious broth. Even if the taste wasn't that good, the mouth feel would make this crushable for me. Fortunately the flavor is good, and the mouth almost convinced me it tasted better than it does. light burstings of small bubbles match a silky slipper nectar mouth. 
O: It's impressive to see what HFS can do with a single hop DIPA, but I have to say I felt teased. The look and the smell gave me that same sort of build up that non-fresh Just Outstanding IPA does. It looks awesome, it smells fantastic, it tastes.... not quite as good. Don't get me wong, exceptionally well made, but it doesn't compete with its other characteristics. Before you light the torches and cry blasphemy, let me just say that this is still just a single hop DIPA. Galaxy tastes good, but I still want a cocktail of hops in my glass. All things considered, this is super good. I just wish more was there in the flavor to compliment the amazing aesthetics and feels. If nothing else, this beer makes me want to try ephraim quite badly. If HFS can do this well with a single hop series, then I've got to know what other potions they can concoct. The brewers up there are certainly masterful in their creations, I just want to know what they can do beyond the limitations of a single-hop. A good beer where the flavor stood out far too much as the weakest link. 3,110 charactersCavery, Sep 04, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Growler provided in a very generous trade by phingdong. I can't thank you enough for this one Pete.
I like to try and review my DIPAs from the same glasses so I split this with my girlfriend in my Duvel Green tulip and La Fin Du Monde tulip.
Pours a very appealing blood orange that glows violently. A pure white head of foam climbs about 2 inches, but falls rather quickly to nothing but a thin film. At first, lacing is not present at all, but as the bottle warms and I pour my second glass I get some sticky foam cloying to the sides. The lacing isn't terribly impressive, but it's there. 
The smell is so enticing. It has heaps of tropical fruits (mango, pineapple, peaches, all the norm), gobs of citrus, then a hop heads delight at the end with a punch of galaxy.
The taste follows the smell perfectly. Blends of fruits, pine, slight earth tones, then hops hops hops. A perfect dryness on the end that I really didn't expect. Hard to believe there's only one hop varietal in this one.
Mouthfeel is very nice. Slightly lighter than a typical DIPA, but it works so damn well for this. It has the lighter body, but the lower carbonation makes it feel thicker. Insanely drinkable.
Naturally, I compared this to Citra the whole time I was drinking it. My girlfriend and I split a bomber of Citra last night. She is siding with the Galaxy, but in my eyes, Citra took it by a nose. Call me a homer, you're probably right. You can tell from the review though, I absolutely loved this beer. 1,493 charactersDearthVader, Aug 31, 2011

A - Pours a hazy yellow-golden color with one inch of white head and moderate carbonation. Light lacing on the glass. Very good looking DIPA
S - Grapefruit, some light orange, citrus, and light notes of vanilla and pine. There's a faint hint of alcohol too. As it warms up some tropical fruit notes emerge.
T - The hops truly dominate here and they are really impressive. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, and some strong pine. Some nice sweetness from the malt is a nice underlying note as well.
M - Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and a crisp feel.

A - Hill Farmstead has the best looking IPA/DIPAs. Hazy orange with a white head. Sticky lacing all the way down. Just beautiful.
S - Fantastic. A hop explosion. Citrus, orange, tropical fruit, with a bit of pine/dankness thrown in. All this from one hop variety.
T - Follows the nose. Citrus, dank fruits, bright orange, etc. Any malt seems to cower in the background and fear for its life. This is the kind of DIPA I love. It's not too sweet or too malty, just beautiful hops. It's also bitter without being overly so.
M - Mouthfeel is very good. Nice and full and moderately creamy.
O - This is one of my favorite DIPAs. I have had all of Shaun's DIPAs, and not a one has failed to wow me. This is fantastic. I'm happy to see that it has become a regular in the DIPA rotation. I can't wait to see what new ones comes down the road. 948 charactersphingdong, Aug 26, 2011

A: Orange merange with a thin frog egged head. Very warm and murky
S: These hops smell incredible- Tons of citrus, thin and blended- there's lots of different fruits amalgamating and making it difficult to identify, pine is even significantly quaffable as a tertiary aroma. Some thin/cleanness + a lesser degree of mustiness akin to simcoe and/or centennial at the end as well. 
T: Not quite a mirror of the smell. Some empty delay in flavor in the beginning that's a slight let down. Citrus fades quickly from first sip to last and it doesn't have anywhere near the citrus presence implied by the nose. Finish is also akin to simcoe/centennial. 
M: Not too rough, approachable level of dehydration for a DIPA. low-medium carbonation. 
O: Good IPA, not on world class level like some other HF's. 944 charactersCharlieMurphy, Aug 15, 2011

The strong aroma is loaded with orange citrus, grass and lemon zest. I could smell it from 2 feet away as I poured the beer into the glass.
Each sip of this full bodied beer is smooth, chewy and slick on the palate. Dry finish with mild carbonation. The flavor is sweet with loads of citrus and spice. It begins with orange and lemon citrus, grass and a touch of pine. In the middle some peppery spice takes hold. Throughout a sweet malt caramel flavor balances out the bitterness. It finishes bitter with a lingering lemon citrus when gone.
A friend of mine got me this beer on a recent trip to Vermont. It's definitely worth the trip to the North Country to get this beer! Loads of flavor and very well balanced. 839 charactersWanderingFool, Aug 14, 2011

A- A glowing amber/hay color, the beer is quite murky but very bright. A light frothy/foamy white head forms.
S- Fresh grass, lemon, pinnaple. It smells extremely fresh and smooth, no harshness. Other people at our group said it smelled like pot, but I wasn't picking it up.
T- Wow. So smooth, soft, and balanced. Lots of citrus and fresh grassy hops. Some piny notes, and the perfect malt background. This beer tastes amazing, and everyone agreed that it was an amazing IPA.
M- Perfect. Nothing I would change about it.
O- Hill Farmstead is making the best IPA's on the East Coast right now, and possibly in the country. The Ephraim/Galaxy/Citra are all in my top 5 IPA's of all time. You really can't go wrong with this beer.

4.7/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Alex for sharing this
Served from growler into pint glass
Color: Big vibrant yellowish color, almost hay like. Two fingers worth of frothy white head form from the pour. Leaves behind a good amount of lacing.
Nose: Big fruit smells.... Pineapple is massive here also followed by hints of mango, apricot and peach. The hops are fresh and evident. Wonderful smelling beer.
Palate: Amazing presence on the tongue. The drinkability is perfect and the carbonation is just right. Waves of fruit hit the mouth with a fury, but its all balanced out by the hop and malt body. The Abv is nowhere to be found. Amazing!
Finish: Superb! complex and smooth. You get an array of fruit flavors, especially pineapple. The Abv is so well masked its unbelievable. An excellent IPA.

4.12/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this one at the Hop Head Throwdown, and reviewed from notes. I made sure to start with this guy, to go in with a fresh palate. 
Appearance- Hazy orange or apricot color. Sort of a cloudy gold, with a hint of amber. Thick two inches of head. It takes a moment to settle, but I can barely wait.
Smell- Huge tropical fruits. Just massive. Mango, tangerine, a fruit bowl for sure. A little dankness as well. That sort of dank, pot-like aroma. Very good.
Taste- Follows the nose. Delicious fruits lead off. It's like a fruit punch. Pineapple, mango, tangerine, the whole nine. It gets very, very bitter on the end. The bitterness leads to a dank, almost herbalness. The finish is almost grassy. I love bitter beers, but the finish on this one is sort of detracting from the actual flavors. It transitions from huge fruit, to huge bitter pretty quickly, I'd like it a little smoother.
Mouthfeel- Pretty thick, unfiltered, reminds me of Kern River Citra. A tad heavy, but good.
Overall- Not the smoothest beer ever, and it honestly got a little hard to finish. I remember just throwing down the aforementioned Citra, ordering one after another. This one, I needed a break before getting a second pour. I found the extremely bitter, grassy finish a little off-putting. I think there is a reason that people often mix hops. I enjoyed the aroma aspects of this hop more than the bittering ability, it appears. It's 9/10 of being a truly spectacular beer, but it just misses. 1,473 characterscallmescraps, Aug 10, 2011

Taste is a punch of bitterness and floral hops. There's a nice long bitter bite on the finish. Mothfeel is smooth and crisp with some very nice carbonation. Very tasty and refreshing on a hot day like this. 391 characterskingcrowing, Aug 07, 2011

Super great IPA and worthy of the hunt. This beer can hang with the best of them. 355 characterscosmicevan, Aug 04, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Much thanks to Michael for providing this one!
Pours a dull golden amber with a huge fluffy white head that leaves tons of sticky lacing as it fades to a thin layer that remains for most of the drink.
Holy citrus! Loads of juicy oranges and grapefruit, with a slight resiny presence. Not much malt to be found, but that's the way a good hop bomb should be.
Taste is equally as citrusy and juicy. No doubt this one is loaded with hops, but it's extremely smooth and balanced. Slightly sweet with minimal malts to be found.
Pretty thick and sticky in the body with lots of find carbonation. Pretty bitter up front, but the finish is as smooth as can be with no lasting bitterness, excellent. This is an absolutely fantastic DIPA. I'd love to be able to have this on a regular basis, maybe I should look for a job in Vermont... 828 characters321jeff, Jul 28, 2011

A: Pretty orange color with bubbles on the sides of the glass to compliment and pinky of bubbly white head with excellent lacing. Great start.
S: Very nice dank tropical fruit semi sweet notes hit the nostrils with ample weed and plant hop aromas. Nice earthy aroma overall.
T: No malt in there, but really there is not much need for it as theres a slight sweetness supporting big tropical mango, pineapple, pine needles, leafy weed, and earthy hop notes. Nice bitter lingering finish on this. 
M: Great feel, perfect sweetness to bitter, a pretty good hop bite. 
Overall I enjoyed this beer a lot, though if it had even a little nice malt character I probably would have loved it even more, just my opinion. Keep doing great stuff Hill Farmstead! 848 charactersDreadnaught33, Jul 27, 2011

A: Clear light amber body with a thin head of frothy white foam. Nice retention, fine lace. Pretty good.
S: Pure hoppiness, with intensely spicy, fruity, vegetal, leafy, herbal craziness going on; very, very minty. I'm impressed - it's hard to believe this is a single-hop beer.
T: A little more restrained than the nose, but similarly terrific: piney + citric hops dominate, with some more herbal hop notes joining with light pale malt on the long, bitter finish. Very drinkable and enjoyable.
M: Light-to-medium body with similar carbonation. Pleasantly understated.
O: This is the last of the HF DIPAs to cross my lips (at least of those that are listed on BA), and as amazing as it is I think it's actually my least favorite. The Galaxy hops definitely did more than their due in terms of lending the beer flavor, complexity, and character, but I'm just not as crazy about this hop as I am about Citra, and both Abner and Ephraim are just masterpieces. I can't wait for a new variation.

The bomber(counter pressured filled off a keg) pours a hazy, murky golden orange. that, the haziness is the only negative thing I have to say. Everything else, it perfect. 
Before I can even pour the hops hit my nose, massive citrus notes, mostly tangerine and pink grapefruit. A little clean white head covers the beer and lets loose this ridiculous smell. Flavors are perfect clean IIPA, tangerine followed by grapefruit, leading to pine and finishing with a clean malted bitter. Sexy. 
Damn, I gotta get to that east coast soon. 662 charactersolympuszymurgus, Jul 20, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Hill Farmstead Galaxy, on tap at Shorty's in Hell's Kitchen, New York City, billed as "Double Galaxy" and sold at $9 per 14-oz glass. 
Appearance: This looks like a homebrew, super orange-amber-hazy. Classy and rustic at once, with a bit over one finger of white-and-bubbly head, very frothy. Good retention and great lacing. Belgian qualities here! Looks bright and cheerful. 
Smell: Super citrus! Fresh lemon (peel, zest and juice), pine, cleaning product. Sap, cake icing. 
Taste: Super citrusy and carbonated right away, a bit like sparkling water and/or a non-alcoholic concoction or orange juice. Tingly and bitter, sticky around the roof of the mouth. A fresh, lemony taste and feel all around. A bit too soapy and astringent at times, like licking fresh snow. Mild sweetness and pleasant tropical feel, reminds me of a pineapple cake or lemon custard. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body, flavor and carbonation. A tad thin around the edge, bit of a watery finish, but well-balanced nonetheless and super delicious, enticing. Intensely dry finish. 
Overall: This is truly an exceptional beer. I had it many times while on tap at Shorty's (despite the sticker shock) and I just couldn't stop drinking it. It goes down so damn easy! It strikes the right chords of flavor, balance and and smell, and it leaves you wanting more. The only thing I would ask is for a bigger body. I love Hill Farmstead! 1,397 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Jul 19, 2011

A: Looks like a Hill Farmstead DIPA! It's a hazy golden/orange with a decent amount of lacing.
S: Smell is a fantastic citrus/hops aroma.
T: Taste is a somewhat sweet up front with a bitter grassy hops bite on the finish. This is pretty much straight hops right here with nary a hint of malt, yet the flavor is still complex enough to keep this beer interesting. Quite good. 
M: Medium-bodied with decent carbonation.
O: This is another great DIPA from Hill Farmstead, but I'm not sure it comes quite up to the level of Ephraim. This seems more in line with their other DIPAs instead, not sure why exactly this one is getting so much more hype. It's damn good, but no better than their other fine offerings.
Edit: Revisited in January of 2013 and it's better than I remember! I might still give it a similar score, though would consider going up to 4.75 on smell, taste and overall. It's got more of a malt characteristic than I remember which really helps balance the incredible citrusy hop flavor. I absolutely believe it deserves the hype it gets now. 1,148 charactersstarrdogg, Jul 14, 2011

The appearance is pale yellow with a good sized white head. Its` smell has pine, grapefruit, a certain earthiness. Galaxy tastes of citrus hops, different tropical fruit, bitterness. It is a well balanced imperial ipa and does not seem to overdo it, in any aspect. MF is dry, bitter in the end, but not too much.

The beer is a hazy orange hue, with a small head that hangs out for a while, leaving a fair bit of lacing on the glass. The aroma is just awesome, with bold scents of oranges, grapefruits, hops, and nary a trace of malt. What a delicious beer. I wish I had a keg of this. Teeming with delicious citrus and hop flavors, this is hard not to chug. Superb on all accounts, I highly recommend this beer. Hill Farmstead is quickly becoming one of my favorite breweries. 512 charactersHuhzubendah, Jul 11, 2011

s - Smells of tropical fruits, citrus hops, pine hops, and light floral notes. Lots of fruit, I found it pretty enjoyable.
t - Tastes same as the nose, with some moderate bitterness. Pine hops, citrus hops, and some tropical fruits.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Moderate bitterness up front and then especially in the aftertaste.

T - Great hops, sweet, with a little floral taste, tropical fruit, grapefruit, citrus rind. There is a nice buttery taste at the beginning of this one that adds an interesting element to this beer melded with the hops.
M - Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, and a crisp feel.
O - Really nice beer, with a unique taste. I'm not real familliar with Galaxy hops, but it made for a really great beer. 653 charactersAgentZero, Jul 10, 2011

Poured into a DFH glass a very nice cloudy golden yellowish color, nice carbonation, very nice one-finger plus creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing to follow. The nose is a hop bomb, with some nice malt notes, lots of citrus, and a very nice touch of pine notes, also some spice notes. The taste is very nice, hoppy, slight maltyness, sweet, lots of nice citrus/pine notes. Medium Body, ABV hidden very well with this one, very nice subtle dry/bitter finish. Goes down very very easy, slightly chewy. Never heard of this Galaxy Hop from Australia before, but it is very nice. WOW! This is definitely a very tasty DIPA on the lower side of things.

3.8/5  rDev -16.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Growler shared by Thorpe429 at his place the other night. Thanks! A big want, obviously because at the time of this review, this is the #44 beer on the beeradvocate best of list "popular" and the #6 beer on the best of American Double / Imperial IPA. This probably means I'm going to love it. 
Beer is yellow and hazy with a wispy head of small white head that leaves some lacing, moderate to low carbonation.
Aroma is mildly vegetal and earthy with a mild citrus hops, moderate floral notes, smell good but I'm not overwhelmed so far.
When I drank this I asked Thorpe if it tasted the same as the one he drank (by himself) a few days earlier and he confirmed that "It is nearly the same, perhaps a little less hoppy" -- it is hoppy, mild to moderately bitter on the back, interesting throughout but there is an off sulfur character or some sort of vegetalness that makes me wish we were drinking more Abner. Not my favorite from HF but perhaps my expectations were too high. I've never had a Galaxy single hopped beer. I'd have another and I'd even have this again on draft but it was somewhat of a disappointment. 1,118 charactersdrabmuh, Jul 09, 2011

(near the brewery), and this is the second time I'm enjoying it from a growler. 750ml Hill Farmstead flip-top growler into my Bruery tulip. All to myself! (don't worry guys, I got a 2nd one to share).
A - Pours a FL orange color, white frothy head, sticky white lacing, lots of bubbles along the collar and cap, thin whisps on top.
S - An wonderful aroma of bitter hops, tons of orange peel citrus dominate the nose. Tons of hops, but, it's really nothing like I've ever had before. Very juicy, rich, and just plain outstanding. There's some sweetness there on the finish that's very tropical, peaches, pineapple. 
T - Orange peel, mango, some tropical notes and lots of wonderful hops. The bitterness is smooth and enjoyable, not trying to destroy your palate like many other inferior DIPA's. You know this is a DIPA without it screaming "look at me"...it's refreshing.
M - Perfect, to say the least. Smooth, refreshing, soft carbonation, with a medium body. 
O - Seriously, there is nothing wrong with this beer. I looked, I tried, I failed. I've had this beer in draft, out of a growler, from a taster, from a wine glass, tulip, etc. I still can't find a flaw. I would put this DIPA up against any of the same style from any brewery, it's just that good. Not a palate destroyer, not overly sweet or syrupy, just f'n awesome. Shaun, you killed it with this beer! 1,436 charactersSean9689, Jul 09, 2011
4.9/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Many many many many thanks to Beenitty for this incredibly generous extra (32 oz growler) in a trade just received today. My beautiful wife was kind enough to unpack the box and put the growler in the fridge so that it was cold when I got off work. 
After undoing the amazing tape work that Beenitty did to the top of the growler (seriously, he did a great job with the packaging), it popped with a nice hiss. Immediate floral hop scent left the top of the growler into my nostrils. Its clear that I'm in the presence of greatness here.
Smell- buttery citrus, some breadiness, nice tropical fruit flavors. Taste- just decadent for an IIPA...nice citrus, sweet breads, a buttery smooth tropical fruit flavor, with a nice bitterness on the end. 
Mouthfeel- just a tad of the carbonation may have been lost (no fault of Beenitty, just a probable result of a little bit of air in the top), but regardless this is absolutely drinkable and wonderful.
Drinkability- It will be an absolute pleasure to take this growler down, and it will leave me for more. I long for the day where I can drink Hill Farmstead's goodness again, and hopefully I'll get a chance at GABF this year. 1,173 characterslnashsig, Jul 08, 2011

Pours heavily clouded, dull, dark tangarine amber, well groomed head, with ample webs of lacing left behind..
Muted ripe mango, lite smoke and some grapefruit on the nostrils.
Ruby red grapefruit, mangoes at back with a note of hot sauce. Nice spicy/sweet balance. Smooth grapefuit pith infused finish.

4.92/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Growler sent by Tucker. Consumed two days after my first review below. Scores are based on this sample.
Looks similar to most other HF DIPAs and it's beautiful. Color is a hazed and cloudy glowing apricot with a fluffy, dense white head. Long lasting retention and abundant, sticky clumps of lacing. 
Aroma is perfect balanced blend of peach, grapefruit, mango, and citrus rind. Sticky and more sweet than bitter, extremely tropical and juicy. A rare 5.0 for a DIPA aroma from me...
Flavor is intensely tropical sweet and juicy to start, following the same flavors as the aroma before finishing slightly dry, floral and with strong citrus rind. Never intensely bitter or thick and overbearing. What about malts? Who cares? With this blend of flavors from the Galaxy hop and balance, a strong malt presence is not only irrelevant, but unwelcome. I would give the flavor a 5 as well if not for the previous growler (that drabmuh also reviewed) where we picked up on some unpleasant vegetable flavors.
Body is medium thick, creamy and smooth. Reminds me of Double Sunshine in the softness of the texture where the beer is light and refreshing, instead of being a thick, chewy chore to get through. 
So here we are. All of HF's IPAs/DIPAs have been great or exceptional and IMO this is the pinnacle so far. Not as flashy as Ephraim but Ephraim isn't an everyday beer. This is as good as a big "everyday" DIPA can and should be. All tropical hops, restrained bitterness, undetectable alcohol, perfect body and aroma. I guess I'm saying I liked this.
Growler shared by Thorpe429
This is a great DIPA. I enjoyed this more than HF's Double Citra. Not quite as much as Ephraim. Certainly not on the level of recently sampled Double Sunshine or Kryptonite and not on the level of other "classics". Grapefruity, lemony, danky and floral, everything I want from a DIPA except, oh wait, why is this so fricking vegetative in the finish. Funny, I don't remember that touch from batch 1 and now I'm very curious to try another growler. 2,027 charactersyourefragile, Jul 08, 2011

Served in FFF tulip pint.
A really hazy beer here-- a lot like other HF beers that I've had actually... It's a golden apricot color with a nice two finger head. The bubbles are big and loose, and due to that fact, it seems we don't see great retention or lacing. 
The beer smells and tastes very nice: citrusy lemon and grapefruit with some dank floral notes, all over a light bready/biscuity malt. Very dry and bitter finish. Clean and fresh. 
Body is nice. Well carbed and medium light. 
Overall, this is a good beer... Not the best HF beer I've had, but still good. 619 charactersAleWatcher, Jul 08, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Tremendous thanks to SFLpunk and imagineiii for making this possible, and ensuring that quite a few people in the DC circle will get to try this one out. First 750 is all for me. Nothing like having over a dozen tickable pours all to myself. 
Served in a Hill Farmstead long-stem tulip glass.
Pours a moderately-hazy bright apricot color with a strong two-finger white head. Fairly fluffy. There's some good retention and gobs and gobs of spotty lacing as it goes down the glass. Good collar and -- appropriately -- a galaxy-swirl cap on top throughout. 
The nose starts out with some very, very strong citrus. Lots of grapefruit and orange rind. Some tropical mango in the background. Some more hops. Then some more. Damn. As it warms, the grapefruit takes a bit over from the orange and tropical notes. One of the better smelling DIPAs that I've come across. Me giving something a 5.0 is rare. It being a DIPA that doesn't feature Citra is even rarer. I'm not a Citra fanboy at all :) (That's right, a smiley face in a review...I'm pretty sure I've never done that before.)
The flavor begins with some supremely-aggressive hop components. Grapefruit pith abounds. Looking for serious hop action? Whoop, there it is. Smiley face? Check. Old-school "ashamed to have had singed and danced to" song? Check. Banging on all cylinders tonight. Reference to Brian Regan. Class act. 
Other than the all-out grapefruit assault, there's some malt in the background. Who am I kidding? No there's not. It's all hops. This is what a double IPA should be. As has been a frequent topic of forum discussions, no, hops don't belong everywhere. Straight fact, though: malt does not belong in an American Imperial IPA. It simply does not. That's an American Barleywine. Shaun gets an A+ here for brewing a beer that is an all-out hop assault that I never need a break from. The bitterness and flavor both take me to the brink, but never off the edge. So much hop flavor and bitterness all in one package.
Medium body with a brisk, crisp bitterness and moderate carbonation. No real alcohol character. Strong bitterness. Then some hop fruitiness. Nearly a flawless beer. Now, given that this review is about eleventy billion times my average review length, I think I'll call it quits. Cheers. 2,279 charactersThorpe429, Jul 06, 2011

The smell of this beer is fantastic with that fresh hop juice aroma, very prominent citrus and floral over tones. You can smell it even before you get it up to your nose.
The body is medium and the taste is just as good as the smell. It has a great fresh grapefruit / hop taste with a slight piney bitter finish. The way an IPA should be.
This is a great beer and I am lucky to have one of the few kegs of Galaxy available from Hill Farmstead at my home. 482 charactersitsmebillyb, Jul 04, 2011
4.59/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Blackback pub.
Pours slightly cloudy with a medium sized tight sticky head. The aroma is phenomenal, lemon, grapefruit, mango, passionflower and a little oniony dankness. Taste is more of the same, just not quite as incredible as the aroma. The citrus hits hard up front, gives way to some slightly sweet malt (hint of medium crystal), which then disappears into a wonderful complex hop finish. Medium-light body with just enough alcohol evident to push the hops into your tongue. Smooth and dangerous.
I cannot believe that something this complex only contains one hop! 582 charactersskivtjerry, Jul 04, 2011

S: Awsome nose of tropical fruits followed with hops, no complaints.
T: Explosion of fruit flavors, leaves you wanting more and more and more
M: Very very nice, slight bitterness in aftertaste, very smooth
D: Super high, give me more holy crap.
This beer tastes just like Double Sunshine except a bit less on the explosion of fruit in the taste department, but the description of liquid heaven by other reviewers is very accurate. The fact that I gave Double Sunshine all 5's is the only reason that I didn't give this one all 5's. Not sure if that's fair but, there's nothing wrong with this one. Do what you can to get ahold of this beer its worth it. 814 charactersbeenitty, Jul 04, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Ginger Man in NYC. Served in a large snifter.
A - Arrived with a finger-plus of creamy white foam that settled to a thin cap, leaving behind splotchy lacework. Hazy peach body.
S - Initially it's big grapefruit, some light orange, candied citrus, and light notes of vanilla and pine. There's a faint hint of alcohol too. As it warms up some tropical fruit notes emerge.
T - Again, plenty of intense grapefruit pith and rind mingle with light caramelized sugars and tropical fruit flavors. Initially quite bitter, particularly in the finish, but gains sweetness and complexity over time. Alcohol is better hidden here.
M - Medium body, medium-low carbonation, a super dry finish, and plenty of residual hop resins. No alcohol warmth. Pretty much what I expect from a Hill Farmstead DIPA.
D - A very hop-forward DIPA for the East Coast - Shaun E. Hill knows how to get it right. I downed my glass in record time, and could have gotten quite hammered from a few of these if I hadn't had elsewhere to be. Looking forward to the bottles/growlers Sean is bringing back from the VT. 1,090 charactersMasterSki, Jul 04, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On-tap at the Fourth Avenue Pub in Brooklyn, served in a goblet
A hazy orange body sits below a one+ finger yellow infused cap. Head fell slowly and left chunks of lace all over the glass. I have yet to see an iipa that looks any better.
The aroma is dripping with citrus and tropical fruit. Juicy orange, mango, white grapefruit with pine needles and some herbal dankness. Hmm, one hop varietal giving up all of this? Amazing. 
Delicious. Absolutely freaking delicious. Juicy oranges, mangoes, white grapefruit, ganja and pine needles. Follows the nose closely. Clean, fresh malt, lightly toasted holding down the middle before the hops pummel your palate. A flat out assault on the taste buds. The bitterness is bold and clings to the inside of your mouth.
The finish is dry and bitter. Medium feel with perfect carbonation. Resiny and chewy. This guy means business.
Overall, this beer is near perfect. It's actually hard to not rate this all 5's. Galaxy hops lend tremendously deep aromas and flavors. It's amazing you could get one hop to deliver on all fronts. 1,071 charactersColForbinBC, Jul 03, 2011

Price - $130 per 1/6 barrel
Pours turbid with a shade close to that of apricot accompanied by a fluffy white two inch head. Laces nicely with polka dots. The appearance is like a 9.0 on the beach.
The aroma is strong with hemp resin and herbal hops. Oranges, lemon, mango and pine are all there behind the backdrop of grapefruit. The fruit and pine blend well together and add to the balance. 
The flavor is much more earthy than what I was expecting. Not as fruity and sweet as the nose would suggest. Grapefruit, orange and caramel are hidden in there. No sense of the 8.0% punch lurking in the dark so beware. 
The mouthfeel is intense and sticky with a bitter dry finish. It does settle down a bit as it warms. Has a medium body with a near perfect carbonation feel. 
Overall I enjoyed this beer many times over several days. As a DIPA this is very dangerous due to it's high drinkability. Perfect for this time of year and another solid offering from the areas best brewery. 1,065 characters05Harley, Jul 03, 2011

S: So how does it smell? As good as Abner/Double Citra? BETTER!!! A perfect balance of citrus, tropical fruits, floral notes, pine, and a touch of herbal dankness. Extremely strong aromas that jump out of the glass. I was nothing short of amazed at the depth and complexity a single hop could have. 
T: As great as the nose is, the taste out does it. The hop character is just as the nose: tangerine, mango, grapefruit, lots of floral notes with a touch of spiciness, herbal dankness in the background, with tons of bitter pine resin on the top of the tongue. As always, there is a big toasted malt base that tastes rich and fresh. There's a moderate to light level of sweetness (mainly crystal) in the middle of the tongue that allows the citrus/tropical fruit notes from the hops to really open up with a juicy quality. The sweetness disappears toward the back of the mouth leaving a fairly crisp, dry finish. The hops are nearly as strong on the finish as they were at the beginning of the sip, there's practically no fading in this guy! Dry, bitter, pine finish with a ton of lingering hop flavors. There's almost no alcohol visible anywhere. 
M: Medium body, moderate to slightly high carbonation, as resinous as it gets. Smooth and rich with a refined crisp finish. Bitterness all around. 
O: I love Double Citra and Abner blew me away, so I was fairly confident that Shaun had another monster in his hands with this Double Galaxy. I guess my expectations weren't high enough, because this beer still managed to blow me away. It's a beauty to look at, I couldn't keep my nose out of the glass all night, tastes like liquid heaven. Perfect balance of hop flavors with incredible intensity both in the nose and taste, a strong malt base to compliment the hops, but not too sweet as to take away from the pine resin and dry bitter finish. Hops simply don't fade at all, extremely long finish. For 8%, I couldn't get any alcohol and it was a very easy drinker. I should have bought more of this stuff. 
Note: I HATE giving perfect scores and I don't want to be over-hyping Hill Farmstead, but Shaun just keeps making ridiculous, perfect IPAs. I can't find any flaws or any areas upon improvement. 2,359 charactersSatchboogie, Jun 30, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Tasted multiple times off a 1/6 barrel I'm lucky enough to have sitting in my fridge.
A beautiful hazy yellow-orange sunburst when held up to a gorgeous summer New Hampshire sky. Really, this might be the best looking beer I've ever seen. A two-finger white foam collar settles down quickly after a vigorous hand pump. Sea spray-like rings form on the sides of the glass after each sip and gradually recede back into the opaque yellow-orange depths.
The nose on this is unlike most of Shaun's other stellar DIPAs/IPAs as it is much more herbaceous and floral than tropical. Dank marijuana, fresh basil, sage and nettle mix with scents of pine and various flowers. Notes of Mandarin orange and mango can be found, but definitely not at the fore. Wow! This is my first experience with a single hop beer featuring Galaxy and all I can say is "Wow!"
As usual with HF's beers the nose is carried over to the palate almost verbatim. This is one bitter beer but in the best way possible. The finish is ever so slightly sweet after the onslaught of bitter and is so damn clean that you'll find yourself salivating for the next sip. This makes this 8.1% abv libation eminently drinkable and dangerous! 
The mouthfeel is exceptional and another thing that Shaun gets spot on with his beers. It's soft with just enough of an edge from perfect carbonation. Silky but not too oily. Perfect.
Overall, this is a tremendous DIPA and might be my second favorite beer from Hill Farmstead (single Citra being my favorite). A fantastic beer in every regard. 1,542 charactersRochefort10nh, Jun 30, 2011

4.94/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5There are a few beers that defy review. This is one, but I still managed some notes. Some notes. Not a lot. And I was sharing a 64oz growler with only two others. Big big thanks to myspoonistoobig for driving to VT to get this beer at Hill Farmstead. It's just freaking epic.
Brewed - as the name states - with the single hop strain of Galaxy, the beer has an orange hazy hue with a wonderful off white head. The lacing sustains as it sits there looking like just another good beer. If you're a finding fault person, you had better find fault here: there aren't many other places. Because it's way better than just another beer. The aroma smashes you on the first sip. It's a mix of citrus first, followed by pine and grass. But honestly my notes aren't much of a help here. "Smell: 5.0. Amazing. Pure joy."
So apparently they put joy in this brew. They must, because Praise the Lord the taste follows the aroma. The hops are tamed and tempered by the malt, but also enriched. I can't describe it with the little beercabulary I have. It feels perfect, it drinks perfect.
Simply put, try this beer. 1,100 charactersafksports, Jun 09, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On draft at the Blind Tiger, NYC. 
Poured a hazy bright orange hue with a one finger frothy white head. There was good retention and lacing. 
The smell featured a balmy earthy hop spice with a touch of juicy orange. some tropical notes as well. 
The taste consisted of consecutive waves of pine, pepper and grapefruit With a moderately doughy malt. 
The moutfeel was toward the cleaner side of the style. 
Overall an excellent DIPA. 437 charactersplaid75, May 15, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Cheers and thanks to weeare138 for sharing this brew. 
Poured into a mini snifter, this brew appears a hazed golden orange color. When held to the light it displays some greenish and yellow hues around the edges. The head formation is soft with white bubbles that hang close to the edge if the glass. Spotty lace sticks to the glass.
The smell of this brew is downright fantastic. Citrus explosion in the nose with a fruity rindy aspect that is a little catty in character and herbal as well. The aroma comes across quite sweet and fruity with such a sick abundance of juicy hop oils. It is somewhat spicy and as it warms picks up a vinous twinge, fantastic all around.
The taste of this brew is rindy with citrus and spices, it has a lasting catty character that also turns more herbal in flavor. There is a spiced aspect to the hop flavor that gets a bit grassy as the experience continues. The malt backing is light and bready, maybe a bit biscuit-like that provides a soft sweetness to let the hop be the showcase in this offering. It has a lasting aftertaste of grassy and herbal bitter rinds.
This is a light bodied brew that is modestly carbonated and exceptionally easy drinking. Fantastic straight across the board. On this occasion, Ephraim was suppose to be the star of the show and this Galaxy offering completely stole the show. Supposedly this offering was more fresh than Ephraim but still I was blown away. For my first experience with Galaxy hops, I am very anxious to see more of this and get my hands on more of Hill Farmstead's offerings. 1,562 charactersstakem, May 11, 2011

Nose - mango, grassy hops. Taste- big tropical fruit punch followed with grassy and pine notes. Very resinous and has a lingering white grapefruit rind bitterness. Some sweet pale malts also come through but by and large a fairly dry dipa. This is one helluva hop monster- very unique offering. 389 charactersoakbluff, May 04, 2011

A: Pours a bright, cloudy orange with large off-white head and good retention that leaves lots of lacing around glass.
S: Smells absolutely delicious, tons of sweet citrus and piney hops make it hard to type this without taking a sip. Some alcohol and barely any malt aromas are detectable beneath the hops. Awesome!
T: Tastes just as delicious as it smells if not better. Perfectly balanced, nice hop bitterness that isn't overpowering with tons of flavor from the juicy piney and citrus hop resins. Just the right amount of malt to let the hops dominate the taste without being overly malty yet provide enough sweetness to balance out the bittering hops. Balance and flavor are spot on.
M: Moderate carbonation with sticky, medium-full body that coats my mouth with delicious hoppy goodness. 
O: Awesome imperial IPA, my first offering from Hill Farmstead and I am not disappointed one bit! I will admit that I prefer my IPAs to be clear but when it smells, tastes, and feels like this I don't care one bit! I want more! 1,126 charactersAzurescens, May 04, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: 64 oz. growler (they were out of the nice Hill Farmstead swingtops) poured into a tulip glass. Growler split amongst a couple friends.
Appearance: Pours a really impressive, white fluffy and full head. Cloudy orange in color. The growler certainly did well in holding the carbonation as this is exactly how it tasted earlier in the day on tap.
Aroma: Big grapefruit, pine and sweet tropical fruit notes dominate the nose. Impressive hop presence here.
Taste: The hops truly dominate here and they are really impressive. Grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest, and some strong pine are all here in full force. Some nice sweetness from the malt is a nice underlying note as well. The aftertaste is a tad bitter and can wear thin over a couple glasses.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied and creamy. Coats the mouth wonderfully.
Overall, a really impressive and strong IPA. A great way to showcase this hop. The flavors are big and bold. This is certainly not for the timid. A really nice hop bomb and something I would love to try again. 1,037 charactersGosox8787, Apr 30, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Special Thanks to BearsonAcid for providing this in a trade. I was saddened to have to wait a week+ to dip into this growler, but the time has come.
Pours with a finger of very creamy bright white head. Retention decent & lacing is intense. All over the glass. The beer is a slightly hazy orange color
Aroma is fantastic. Blast of tropical fruit, grass, lots of herbaceous tones and this all is quite nice.
I can certainly see why this is receiving some great scores. Excellent. Full flavor front to back. Tropical, citrus (orange) and even some apricot. A touch of mint and even the herbal flavors that are apparent in the aroma. The lingering bitterness is sprinkled with some real fruity flavors. A bit of mango at the end. Nice! ABV is not really in your face, but you can tell this is bigger than a standard IPA.
Medium body and somewhat muted carbonation. I can’t tell if this is from a growler sitting for a week, so I’ll ignore this. (besides, I like that)
Great DPA. Fresh, juicy flavor with a bog hop punch. 1,026 charactersReagan1984, Apr 29, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at The Blackback Pub & Flyshop in Waterbury. 10 oz. pour into a small Allagash cervoise, which was a bummer given that they had plenty of Hill Farmstead glasses. Oh well.
Hazy gold in color with a solid off-white head and residual lacing. Nose is incredible, with tons of citrus notes. I savored the scent for a bit before taking a sip. Taste is equally as impressive: fresh hop bite but with some mild creaminess to it. Not as bitter as most DIPAs, but the dank hop bitterness is still noted. This goes down way too easy and did no damage to the palate. Another fine offering from Hill Farmstead. 605 charactersElGallo, Apr 28, 2011

The color is golden peach with 3 fingers of voluminous white head with fine bead and lace clings in rings on the inside of the glass. The smell is light floral at first with lots of tropical fruit and light herbal with subtle spice and very light alcohol in the aroma. The feel is excellent with very juicy texture and resinous with moderate carbonation and lightly sweet mid palate with semi-high bitter element into a dry finish. 
 The taste is tangy and tropical with slightly bitter flavor in the back with hops overwhelming the flavor profile with a slight fruity and juicy quality with subtle pine and very floral quality with zesty lemon and mild pineapple tropical quality yet subtle stone fruit and citrus compliments the combo with low malt taste and slihght lemongrass quality with low alcohol in finish with a nice lingering bitterness. Overall a wondefrul IPA, just about as close to perfect as yoou can imagine -I increased the score because on a fresh palate it seems even more vibrant than I remember. A single hop galaxy is great to enjoy I was so glad to have been able to share this with my brother!
back in 2010?
Look- 4.5 Smell 4.5 Taste 4.5 Feel 5 Overall 5
I am very appreciative to weeare138 for sharing this. enjoyed from a snifter. 
A hazy apricot color w/ slightly sunny appearance and small head w/ spots of lace collecting. The smell is so fragrant! a juicy nose of pineapple and very tropical in general with dank juicy aroma and some floral elements from the hop w/ mild apricot and light grassy odor w/ slight honey tinge in the back. The malt body is smooth allowing for the hop bitterness which is not coarse at all, moderately carbonated w/ juicy texture and light bits of malt interwoven w/ some highly resinous effects from the hop oils. 
 A slightly lemony and juicy tropical hop flavor is saturating this with some fresh and almost mango-like flavor w/ subtle citrus edges and light tea-like herbal notes. There is a mild spice tinge w/ moderate malt in the finish that seems to tie the whole flavor profile together. It doesn't really strike me as a normal single hop flavor since it has a good deal of complexity and doesn't have the one-note quality of some single-hop IPA's. Overall a wonderful beer to display the great complexity of a very unique hop-Galaxiy really shines in this brew and I admire the great things Shaun from Hill Farmstead can do to Pale ale w/ some amazing smoothness for an 8% Imperial IPA! 2,565 charactersSlatetank, Apr 27, 2011

Pours super densely hazy with a reddish gold color and thick white head that leaves lots of lacing. Aromas of dank bud, over-ripe orange peel, lemon oil and hay/grass. Palate is immediately bitter with loads of orange & tangerine juice followed by yellow grapefruit bitterness. Sticky up front and bitter on the finish, but far from dry. Not as tropical as the Nelson Sauvin, but packed with all manner of citrus fruits. Excellent. 502 charactersSFLpunk, Apr 25, 2011
5/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I haven't reviewed very many beers, but I felt very compelled to do so for this one. Thanks to jsvt for sending a very fresh growler of this.
A - Pours a very hazy, golden yellow with a nice two finger off white head that lingered to the very end.
S - As everyone has been quick to point out, the aroma on this bad boy is incredible! It's exploding with citrus and tropical fruits at every turn. Orange zest, grapefruit, pineapple and piney hop notes. Hill Farmstead really nailed the smell on this IPA.
T - Much of what is present in the nose is exactly what you get upon your first sip of this perfectly crafted brew. Again, citrus and tropical flavors dance all over my tongue. Orange rind, lemon zest, pineapple, mango and maybe some peach. This is all finished up on the backend with a resinous piney bitterness. It's all balanced perfectly. Very drinkable.
M - not overly carbonated. A think mouthfeel which adds to the body. Not overly bitter.
O - This has definitely moved to the top of my list when it comes to IPA's. I highly recommend seeking this out and trying it for yourself. 1,095 charactersJefe73, Apr 24, 2011
4.94/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Tonight marks the third time I've had this beer (once at the Blind Tiger event, once at the brewery, and now from growler) and the third time it's blown me away.
Appearance is a cloudy, amber/gold, with a nice, half- to one-finger head that lingers long enough. 
Easily the most striking feature when drinking this is the aroma. Explosive citrus hop character that fills the air without assaulting you; you don't have to bury your face in the beer to find something worth noting, it's overflowing the glass.
The taste is also exceptional; citrus to equal the nose, bitter yet balanced by a sneaky sweetness and hint of earthy pine.
As for the mouthfeel, it took some time and comparison to note how exceptional it really is. At Blind Tiger, I had this side-by-side with Ephraim; at the brewery, obviously it was stacked up against the other outstanding HF beers, and tonight it was served up by chance next to Pliny the Elder. I don't necessarily think that the practice of side-by-side tasting is about one beer winning over another, it really just allows for comparison of style and highlights relative success amongst like-styled beers. This beer succeeds. This is not your typical hop-forward, hit-it-and-quit-it IPA. It really fills your mouth. Here I am typing and it's been literally minutes since my last sip and there's still the flavor developing in my mouth. Truly beyond comparison.
I can't imagine a better beer (a 4.0 in appearance simply because it's unfiltered and the cloudiness makes me think "overcast" versus "clear skies"). Cheers to Shaun and Dan and this truly delicious brew. Can't wait to refill my gorgeous growler. Worth way more than every penny spent and every minute behind the wheel, sleet and snow notwithstanding. 1,751 charactersmyspoonistoobig, Apr 22, 2011

Poured from growler to my Darkness snifter.
A beautiful honey color fills my glass. About six foot of head atop the beer. It in fact poured over and spilled on the table. After I'm done punching the guy that spilled it I contemplate licking it off the table. Lacing prevails after I let it sit for about 3 mins.
Sweet baby jeebus this smells like ecstasy. It's so sweet rich and potent of orange juice and zest. My mind wanders to a grove of orange trees and a pool of orange juice with oompa loompas frolicking about. This smell can't be real for a beer.
I'm waiting for the pinch of reality to set in as I put the glass to my dry lips. Ha f'n ha. Cruel fate does not come and I have won. The prize is damn near the best tasting ipa ever. Holy bat testicles Batman. Just like orange marmalade. When you get to the orange zest/peel part of the taste is when you get the slight, ever so slight hop bite then that dry cut in the tongue /back of the throat you yearn for. The carbonation is tender and perfect. So easy to drink. I'm in awe this is 8%.
This beer is flat out incredible. Worthy of every praise that will come its way. Tonight when I go to bed i will not pray for world peace. No I say. I will pray that Hill Farmstead remains a hidden gem and that I can trade for it all my life and there will be no rarity inflation attached to its good name. 
Galaxy imperial single hop ipa. Ask for it by name. 1,480 charactersTheDudeRules, Apr 19, 2011

Another incredible smelling beer from Hill Farmstead. They really know how to nail down the nose on an IPA(all of their beers for that matter). This beer is exploding with tropical an citrus fruit notes which are nicely complimented by the floral earthy, notes and faint pale malt. Hints of pineapple, mango, grapefruit and citrus peel alongside grassy, piny hops and sweet biscuit malts.
I tried Ephraim before this and while that beer looked and smelled incredible, the flavor and palate let me down so my expectations for Galaxy weren't the highest. Thankfully this beer lived up to the appearance and nose. Chewy medium body with an complex, delicious flavor profile. Again, as in the aroma, the palate is bursting forth with sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Hints of papaya, pineapple and mango as well as a boat load of citrus rind. This is countered by an earthy resinous pine bitterness that creates excellent balance and makes this beer dangerously drinkable. There's also some faint biscuit pale malt adding to the balance and complexity and there is little to no heat, resulting n an excellently masked ABV. I was very impressed with this beer. I highly recommend that you seek it out. 1,400 characterscorby112, Apr 18, 2011

This is the beer I would pick as my answer to any other repost you see on the forum.
It's is presented to you with an enormous billowing head that just sits on top of the unfiltered golden beer like a barrier keeping you from drinking it. The more you want to try it the more head you have to endure.
I can remember the first time I stuck my face in the first bag of hops I bought. This reminds me of that day. It's like if I were to make a mask for my face out of passionfruit, citrus peels and used hops as glue then stuck it on my head. The inside of the mask is what this beer smells like.
It's amazing how much this one hop can acheive. Its high alphas can achieve a palate wrenching bitterness but the softer side of it lends dynamic flavor and a unique tropical aroma making you think that this is all impossible. This is the Macgyver of hops.
8%?! You have to be joking. The very mild carbonation lets you suck this down like its 2012. I can see Galaxy becoming trendy among brewers pretty quick. Much like the Citra craze that is happening now. 1,341 charactersBearsOnAcid, Apr 13, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On the tap at Blind Tiger, this beer had the misfortune of being sampled directly after the magic of Ephraim. How could anything top that sick bastard? Well, this one would attempt to use my memories against me, trick me into thinking it was better. Even though this was a new hop, a descendant of Perle, it reminded me of standing in the gigantic Hopunion refrigerated warehouse, swaying, intoxicated by the brilliant and bold aromas of citrus assaulting me. In an instant with my nose in the glass, I was transported back to Yakima, a kid in the nose candy store. The flavor was nice, some sweetness, oranges, tangerines, and the resins lingered with the sweetness nicely. Ultimately, another awesome DIPA, but quite a different brew. 736 charactersdragonWhale, Apr 11, 2011

The nose is filled with orange wedge citrus and grassy, slightly spicy, hops throughout. Some sweet malts and a touch of grapefruit.
Grassy, peppery hops, caramel, crushed orange wedge and sweet malts on the tongue. This is like drinking hoppy liquid candy. Delicious.
Mouthfeel is smooth with medium to low carbonation. Nice level of hop bitterness throughout. Finishes fairly clean. Not quite as crisp as some of the other HF offerings. ABV is unnoticeable.
Overall, this is another solid DIPA from the Hill Farmstead. Drinks like a single IPA, but is packed with a ton of flavor. I'm really digging the Galaxy hops. It seems like Shaun can do no wrong with IPAs/DIPAs. Highly recommended. 843 characterssisuspeed, Apr 02, 2011
