This one checks off a ton of boxes for me...the look, smell and taste are just out of this world (maybe not so much the look as it's your standard NEIPA muddy orange haze). Really enjoying the smell though, its delightful...very easy to drink. Bitter but not terribly dry on the finish.  A nice balance of juicy and floral.  All around a top notch beer for the NEIPA lovers. 446 charactersGreyvtrayn, May 20, 2017

4.29/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Thanks to HighLowJack for sending this one! Reviewed from (long-standing) notes. Poured from a 16 oz. can into an El Catador Barrel-Aged glass.
A: Turbid yellowish gold, typical of the New England IPA style. A thin fluffy white head forms, with low visible carbonation.
S: Melon and citrus, dank and tropical. Lighter flowery, minty, and spicy hops. Biscuity malts and some wheat but without almost any grainy character. Nice, though I’m not blown away.
T: Melon, tangerine, and citrus rind. Dankness swells up with pineapple and tropical fruit following. Biscuity malts don't add a ton of sweetness, but the bill seems hefty for an APA. It finishes with more dank and melon and orange juice, and stays only very modestly bitter in the hang.
M: This is full-bodied for anything calling itself an APA; it's even leaving sheets on the sides of the glass. The carbonation is a touch on the low side, and there's minimal alcohol flavors.
O: This was awfully tasty. I'm not sure that it lived up to its sizeable hype or not. But I can certainly see where the hype came from. Very, very good. 1,093 charactersmacrosmatic, May 15, 2017

L- Thick soapy white colored head that stands 2 finger widths tall,with good retention and thick sticky lacing.Deep hazy straw colored body,with light orange hues.Low clarity through the glass,with distorted light showing through.Medium amount of carbonation,with some sediment.
S- On the nose I get heavy amounts of citrus and tropical fruit hops.Peaches, grapefruit, mango,pineapple are all in the forefront.Bright notes of sweet malt,white wheat,and bright barley are there for a beautiful balance.This APA smells wonderful.
T- The palate follows the nose perfectly.Up front I get light pine needle,mango fruit,and peaches.In the middle I get sweet malts,and grapefruit citrus.On the back end I get pineapple, white wheat,and the pine hops return.The citrus is dank and zesty.This beer tastes amazing!!!
F- The mouth feel is silky and smooth,with moderate oxidation on the tongue.Moderately dry finish,that leaves the slightest chalky texture after the sip.
O- I have seen and heard alot about this beer prior to drinking it,and it definitely lived up to the hype.This is by far my favorite APA out of all the ones I have tried so far.Looks great,smells and tastes great,perfectly balanced.This beer is the total package.Just enough bitterness,mixed with fruity hops,dankness,and light sweet malts.I could drink this beer all year long,and probably will seeing as it is only 40 minutes away.If you love a hoppy / dank APA then I would definitely recommend you get your hands on this one,by any means necessary.I can't wait to get back out to the brewery in Canton,MA. 1,658 charactersDraconusDesanctus666, May 09, 2017

A: Pours a super hazy golden orange in color with a one inch, frothy, cream colored head with good retention. Thick, white lacing throughout.
S: Aromas of citrus and tropical fruits including grapefruit, orange, melons, peaches, pineapple, and guava. Notes of piney and earthy hops as well.
T: Juicy Pale Ale. Starts off with soft notes of melons, grapefruit, and citrus rinds followed by pineapple and guava. Finishes with a nice light lingering, piney, resinous hop bitterness.
F: Light to medium bodied. Super smooth and velvety feel. Slightly dry on the finish with very light carbonation.
O: Overall, this is a great Pale Ale. Super smooth and crushable. Nice balance between the fruitiness and hop bitterness. Could crush these one after another on a nice summer day. Would love to try this one fresh from the source. 878 charactersBeerGuy8315, Apr 26, 2017

L -- Moderately aerated pour produces a skimpy one-finger white head atop an effervescent turbid orange. Not quite as hazy as Trillium's IPAs, but still very clouded. No retention or lacing
S -- Big orange, grapefruit, pineapple, and peach. A hint of soap as well
T -- Bright, elegant, and refined. The tropical fruits from the hops really dominate the flavors here, with very little residual bitterness. The biscuity malts give a nice dry character that further accentuates the hop profile. Some green/grassy/herbal flavors on the finish
F -- Each sip is a juicy bomb that washes my tastebuds in a gentle fruity hoppiness before finishing dry but not bitter
O --  If Trillium could figure out a way to reduce their pricing by a few dollars per 4-pack, I would be buying this by the case as my summertime go-to. Or maybe they could start subsidizing their beers for their lower-income fans ;)

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Canned 04/13/17, it pours cloudy orange color with a 2 finger foamy white head that's full of bubbles of all sizes, dissipating slowly and leaving really good spotty lacing.
APA??...could have fooled me. This leans more towards an IPA with an aroma of orange peel, lemon zest, grapefruit, biscuit, fresh citrus hops, papaya, piney hops, caramel, toasted grains, coriander and floral notes. Well balanced with a lot of fresh hops, tropical fruit and a nice malty backbone, this would pass as an impressive IPA so in the pale ale class it's top notch.
Tastes just like it smells with  grapefruit, orange peel, fresh citrus hops, lemon zest, pineapple, caramel, and piney hops followed by a malty sweetness that brings graham cracker, biscuit, light brown sugar, wheat bread, toasted grains and finally some mild spices like pepper and coriander. It fades clean and dry with near perfect balance of those bready flavors, pungent citrus and floral notes. 
Mouthfeel crisp and smooth at the same time, with average carbonation, a medium body and a perfect level of hoppy bitterness that masks the ABV and makes it extremely easy to drink. A year round session beer that's full of flavor.
Overall this is up there with Zombie Dust at the top of the mountain. Happy to finally have gotten a 4 pack of it as this has been on my BeerAdvocate "Want" list since 03-21-2015. An outstanding beer, world class indeed. 1,407 charactersCHickman, Apr 22, 2017

Appearance- A very cloudy hazy orange with thin finger of white head. A dull sort of look
Smell- Melons with tropical fruits. I smell pineapple, grapefruit, and a nice hint of peach. Lite hops and even less piney resin. 
Taste- A citrus and melon taste dominates the first sip. Not much hop in the taste but there is slight bitterness that grabbed my attention. The fruity taste lingers with a palate clinging sweetness. 
Mouthfeel- Medium carbonation with a soft pleasing creamy texture. Rather oily for the finish and I have not had another APA that it really compares with.
Overall- The creamy texture sets this apart from most APAs. I have recently been enjoying Zombie Dust and this is a huge change in the feel and fruitiness. Great job Trillium. 806 charactersKdouble, Apr 21, 2017

Big orange juice notes on the nose as well as a hint of cat pee (is there Simcoe in this?).  Taste expresses less juice and more rind and crackery/biscuity malts.

4.05/5  rDev -9.4%look: 2.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4I think this was my favorite during the tap takeover at Rare Barrel.  Well organized event by the way.  
Pours a cloudy yellow.  Pretty much all of Trillium's offerings that day "looked" like shit, but they were all above average in every other department.   Relatively thin 1/3" white head.  Aroma gives hints of citrus and tropical, nicely restrained.  
As usual for many of the trillium beers, they use wheat to lighten up the malt base and stays away from heavier caramalt.  Appreciated.  Notes of pineapple and pine.  I wouldn't describe the back end as dry, more oily than anything.  A little bit of mango sweetness to it.  Strong for a pale ale. 654 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 13, 2017

A: Super cloudy orange juice color with a soft, greasy, white head. The color is more of a glowing, brighter, orange than it is a muddy yellow orange. 
S: Sweet tropical fruit scents along with hints of melon. Fruity and clean smelling. No bitterness on the nose, but I get hints of mild grapefruit pith. 
T: Sweet tropical fruit follows the nose with notes of tangerine and papaya. Juicy perfumey hops; kiss of pale bready malt. Bitterness is lightly herbal but fairly easy on the palate.
M: Very soft and smooth medium-full body with creamy carbonation and a well-rounded soft feel overall. Slight spritzy tingly fresh hop oils, moderate bitterness that is cut by the sweet fruity quality. Surprisingly fairly drying finish. Not the wettest cloudy APA I've had, which is great to me.
O: A delicious beer. I've had clear beers that have taste and smell similar to this, but the carbonation in this is more soft and creamy. Thankfully, the mouthfeel is still drying and not overly muddled feeling. Delicious. 1,035 charactersscottfrie, Mar 13, 2017

The nose is soft, but getting some peach and pineapple.
Taste is what the look and smell portend, just a crazy easy drinker. 
Feel is crisp, smooth, and clean. 
Overall, this is a first rate pale ale. 314 charactersnuggetlover, Feb 12, 2017

I brought home 3 cases of beer, most of it Trillium.  This pale ale is almost an IPA, but it super fragrant with tropical notes.  Flavor is similar with citrus and mango, but it is more malty than their IPA's.  This is the daily drinker of my dreams! 334 charactersDrvitlkeyustolit80, Feb 10, 2017

Lighter, and gentler, bitterness-wise, than the Trillium IPAs, it has a floral bouquet of citrus and sweet pine on the nose. The taste has a mild sweetness of pale orchard fruits and hints of flower and wheaty grain. Feel is soft and gently  carbonated and smooth. 378 charactersGreywulfken, Feb 06, 2017

L - light peach color, super cloudy body, super tiny bubble foam with Lunt lacing 
S - almost completely stumped on this one. Peach pulp comes to mind, cracked pepper, lemon peel, grapefruit. Wow, what a nose
T - crisp pilsner like taste, juicy citrus, slight hop finish. 
F - super crisp and clean, some body but easy to drink. 
O - I had to slow down in trying this beer to fully enjoy it rather than just putting in a review. This is as good as beer gets right here. People go nuts over Trillium and it's well deserved. Don't turn down Fort Point by your beer mule or trader, this one is a winner. Cheers! 829 charactersctylinebeer, Feb 04, 2017

I am not a huge Pale Ale guy, normally prefer IPA but as with just about all Trillium brews, this is solid.  the Double Dry Hopped Fort Point is WAY better in my opinion, but this is still very good and one to check off the list. 251 charactersryno6616, Feb 02, 2017

Super hazy, white hued, straw- golden color. Lively and active. White foam cap.  Immense, rocky, clumpy, sea foamy head. Looks unfiltered and very healthy. Thick, long lace all around.
The nose is unreal. Robust, zesty , floral, hearty with grains, golden wheat, lemmongrass spices ..and very citric. .An amazing array of intense, earthy aroma's. I mean, huge aromatic scent! Easily the best aroma/nose for an American Pale Ale I can remember. 
   Light, crispy....no, very crispy and bold malt that is quickly overtaken by a truely abundant grouping of hop flavors. Mostly, earthy, hearty, herbal with big  spicy tones.  Very complex, multi-layered and honestly, intense!  Wildly drinkable, but with huge, interesting flavor. Hops and malty balance is golden.
 I cannot describe the wicked huge complexity in this. Robust and intense, yet utterly crushable.
   The feel is medium, to heavy, crispy with a nuce healthy bite, but also robust and rather full. The finish has a long, lush but dry thing. Just like the rest of the aspects from this brew, complex is a good word. 
Wowza. 1,099 charactersGratefulBeerGuy, Feb 01, 2017

Pours milky gold with a short-lived head of whipped fluff. Moderate lacing. Aromatics are pungent and filled with ripe tropical fruit. Orange juice with splashes of grapefruit, mango, and peach. Medium bodied with a creamy, chaulky mouthfeel. Bright citrus on the palate with zero malt and low bitterness.  Peach and grapefruit with shades of tangerine and more mango. Finishes with plenty of lingering tropical citrus and bone dry.
Great beer and insanely drinkable. Quite a luscious juice bomb. 522 charactersbrewandbbq, Jan 30, 2017

Pours an hazy-to-opaque semi-bright orange with one-finger bone white head that quickly dissipates to a thin veneer with sparse lacing.
A fantastic tangy aroma smacks you as the glass is raised with a base of earthy dank citrus and pine.  For me the fruit notes (peach and mango maybe?) were very subtle but present.
The taste is smooth and creamy and a little bread-sweet, which augments the dank hops.  The tropical fruits come out in the taste with hints of orange and pineapple along with the citrus and grassy pine.  Low bitterness lingers in the aftertaste along with the tangy side of the hop flavor.  Mouth feel is light and creamy with minimal stickiness and a zing of carbonation.  It becomes more juicy the longer it sits.
Just wow!  As a fan of the style this is a huge treat of balanced dank and sweetness.  I am drinking this only 4 days after being canned so I suspect that it is more earthy than others have noted.  You may want to let this sit a bit before opening. 1,031 charactersdigboy, Jan 28, 2017

Hazy medium gold color with light creamy white head which dissipated quickly. Not much lacing to speak of.  Nice tropical and citrus fruit nose.  Taste follows with nice balance and a well-balanced bitterness in the finish.  This not as exciting as some of their other exceptional offerings but outstanding as a "daily drinker".  Getting to Trillium is hard for me so I have to be selective when there but given the cooler capacity, I would grab 4 whenever I am there. 507 charactersKidDoc, Nov 22, 2016

Pours quite hazy dark golden orange with white head and good lacing, smells like candied peach/apricot/mango/citrus zest and green pine, taste follows the nose well with sweet tropical fruit juice and peach skins that transitions into a deeply bitter citrus pith that lingers, feel is medium minus with bright carbonation. Nice tropical fruit sweetness, but the bitterness is slightly too aggressive to balance it out. 465 charactersChipChaight, Nov 21, 2016

Pours hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy off white head with good retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lingers. Nice spotty soapy lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Aromas of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, lemon/orange peel, light pine, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Damn nice aromas with great balance and complexity of juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt notes; with good strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, lemon/orange peel, light pine, wheat, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light-moderate pine/grassy/citrus rind bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, lemon/orange rind, pine, wheat, cracker, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Fantastic complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Light-moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately sticky/resinous, and creamy/grainy balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 6.6%. Overall this is an outstanding pale ale. All around awesome complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink. Not quite as vibrant and aromatic as some of their other beers, and more resinous/drying in the mouthfeel; but still highly enjoyable. 1,868 characterssuperspak, Oct 17, 2016

The palate is similarly dank, but with touch of resin and citrus.  The mouthfeel is medium without being sweet and malty.  The haziness reflects the outstanding mouthfeel of this beer, accomplished without sacrificing its avoidance of overly strong use of malt.  A world class pale ale.

4.24/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25My first beer from this highly regarded brewery.
The beer pours a hazy orange amber color with good head retention and lacing.  On the nose, there's a huge orange citrus presence, with some underlying tropical fruit and light vanilla as well.  The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely in this fruit bomb of a pale ale, though I appreciate the fact that there's a least a little bit of bitterness in the finish (unlike many of the other NE/Vermont style pales and IPA's).  Happily, the beer isn't overly sweet, though certainly the beer delivers plenty of citrus and tropical fruit flavors.  Mouthfeel is fairly light, and the alcohol is barely an afterthought in this well crafted beer.  
Shrug.  I guess the demand for this style of beer is insatiable back East, as there sure seem to be plenty of breweries making them in this style.  Regardless, this is a very solid effort, and I'm looking forward to the cans of IPA and DIPA I have from these guys.
Thanks Derek! 983 charactersJohn_M, Sep 28, 2016

Citrus predominates with a bit of peach. Taste is sweet up front with a bready middle and only a slight bitterness on the end. Feel is rather coating. Overall a pretty good beer but I don't think it is anything outrageous. 341 charactersAmguerra305, Sep 13, 2016

S: Citrus, orange peel, light malt. Strong for a pale.
T: Citrus and tropical fruits. Relatively dry with an assertive pine note towards the finish. 
F: Softer carbonation. Good mouthfeel.
O: Pretty incredible "standard daily-drinker." Almost more of an IPA than a Pale but where is the line anyways these days. 388 charactershgw605, Sep 09, 2016

This one pours a hazy yellow, a beautiful depiction of NE haze.  Anticipation is building.  Smell is quite fragrant for a pale ale, def smells like a great IPA.  Yet this beer is smooth going down, and demonstrates its underlying base is less bitter than an IPA. A pale ale it is, but the accentuated flavor and aroma of hops puts it well in its own category of pale ales.  Finished slightly tart that was quite refreshing.  Overall, a great beer and highly recommended.  Can't wait to dry the double dry hopped version! 625 charactersquindog, Aug 11, 2016

The most aromatic pale ale I've had that wasn't homebrew: big citrus, orange, resin, and white bread. The taste was a nice interplay between the citrusy notes and a dank resin/piney undercurrent. Great soft feel with a bready backbone. Exceptional. 343 charactersBuck89, Aug 10, 2016

The feel is medium high, smooth, almost creamy. This Pale ale is amazing! Easy to drink with so much going on with the interplay of flavors. I wish I could get this beer all the time. 463 charactersMeyers1023, Aug 10, 2016

Note - I'm taking a self imposed break from IPA's for a couple of weeks.  I'm a little OCD, I get stuck.
L - Deep hazy golden orange with full finger of foam.  Laces
S - Nice - Malt, citrus, stonefruit/peach aroma is strong.
T - Hops shine through but without the bitterness of an IPA.  
F - Silky smooth feel with a nice finish
O - This is the best pale ale I've ever had and one of the top ten beers I've ever had.   The Canton brewery is also a nice place to visit and stock up.  Although I'm a big fan of Treehouse, I'm starting to lean toward Trillium.  I'm glad they expanded. 641 characterscrotharagain, Jul 29, 2016

Look is a hazy juice bomb.  Orange and cloudy with significant lacing that sticks.
Smells is of pineapple, passion fruit, and mango.
Taste follows the nose.  Great pale ale.  Super fruity but hopped up.  Really balanced.  Not as good as the galaxy fort point, but still great.  
Feel is medium bodied and smooth.  Good finish.
Overall a great APA.  Love the co Plex fruit and earth tones mixed with hops. This brewery earns it's hype.  I have 2 more of these and will enjoy drinking them. 562 charactersJay_P22, Jul 24, 2016

4.81/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pour is that signature hazy NE style hue, excellent lacing with small bubbled head that settles to a ring. Aroma is very tropical fruit foward, with a nice array of hops and biscuit like malt in the background. Plenty of mango, pinneapple, kiwi. Somewhat grassy. Very hop foward taste, with the same, equal array of tropical fruit found in the aroma with a certain pine bitterness in the back end. Mouthfeel is relatively thick and mouth coating. This has the longest coating of straight hops I've ever tried in an APA. Overall although this is an APA, the most similar beer this reminds me of is Heady Topper. Definitely no subtle hop or tropical fruit about this, in your face. But so well balanced. A1 704 charactersMateo2699, Jul 23, 2016

A -  Cloudy golden-orange with a 2-finger white head and great lace.
S - Peach, pineapple, pine, orange, mango, lightly dank, nutmeg and floral.  Big, bold and juicy.
T - Hop forward like a bold, complex IPA.  Then it's a lot of tropical fruit with pine, mint, biscuit with the mildest hint of caramel, orange flesh and zest, earthy spice, white pepper and a not-over-the-top bitterness.  Some alcohol taste.  Long-lasting finish that is spicy and moderately bitter.  
M - Medium body and carbonation.  Resinous, soft going down and a little prickly in the finish.  
O - Strikes a nice balance between a Pale Ale and a Northeast IPA.  Reminds me somewhat of a Three Floyds Zombie Dust although this is even more hop-centric.  The ABV is higher that I look for in a Pale Ale so to me, this is an IPA with tons of flavor and a restrained bitterness (something I definitely appreciate). Good stuff indeed. 992 charactersTucquan, Jul 18, 2016

4.16/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Solidly opaque yellow orange, Fort Point actually looks like pouring milk at first. It displays a huge, lumpy meringue-like head.
Bright citrus, fresh orange juice, and white pepper on the nose.
Lime and spice sting the tongue up front, with orange and other vibrant, fresh fruits, with nothing dank or piney coming through, yet there is still a fair amount of bitterness to go with it all.
The feel is a little thinner than it looks, actually come to think of it, it may even be thinner than their session Skimpy Sparrow, but it's not a detriment. Regardless, it's a magnificent brew, and in a way this beer reminds me of Julius. 633 charactersSabtos, Jul 10, 2016

Aroma is big on hoppy fruit notes; mango, tropical fruits, big notes of citrus. Flavor is big and hoppy as well with moderate bitterness. Big fruity notes, some grassy notes. Medium bodied, some creaminess, medium carbonation. Really great hoppy beer; drinks more like a big IPA. 363 charactersstephenjmoore, Jul 10, 2016

Citrus, tangerine, grapefruit, light stone fruit, and a touch of honey.  I knocked this on feel as its only real flaw as the carbonation is high, flavors are a bit muted by it, crisp, finishes slightly dry with a little linger.  Refreshing brew.  It's hard to think of this as a pale ale, even though I think that's what they intended.  This drinks like an IPA, and one of the best at that. 493 charactersHopBomb515, Jun 30, 2016

Look-hazy orange.  thin white head.  a little bit of lacing, which is surprising for this style
Smell-citrus burst.  heavy pineapple and some grapefruit.  Also a little grassy on the nose
Taste-citrus burst as well, with a little more complexity than the nose.  Orange, maybe nectarines, pineapple for sure are all very present in a beautiful way.  A little mango, earthy, and bready
Feel-soft and creamy for a pale ale but not surprising based on the lacing as stated above.  Very refreshing and drinkable and kind of sticky.
Overall-this is a PHENOMENAL pale ale.  I've had this before a few times and they weren't as fresh and I wasn't nearly as impressed as I was with this one.  I already am trying to get more!  May be the best APA out there.  Thanks Trillium! 821 charactersrabbott2, Jun 08, 2016

4.51/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5A very beautiful pale when poured. It's hazy orange/copper with a full soft head that has just a touch touch of brassiness in color that dissipates to white. Lots of lacing when the head recedes in rest, but as you drink it the lacing becomes very speckled.
Smell is tropical and earthy up front. This has a saison characteristic that I pick up in Heady Topper as well. Very interesting. The finish has more biscuity malt aromas you'd expect in a pale. 
I love the balance in flavors. This is a hoppy beer, but the malts mellow it out nicely which allows for a long complex taste. Tropical fruits--mostly mango--hit me right up front, with pine resin and grapefruit in the finish.
The feel is amazing: soft, but well carbed; bitter but smooth; not boozy but the body is full yet very drinkable.
This is one of my favorite pales around. It's a fantastic beer that reasserts how a juicy beer can also be classically balanced. 927 charactersCayseyW, May 03, 2016

S- big tropical fruit, mango, dank, orange pith, garlic, onion, less overtly tropical than the mosaic dry hopped version  but honestly still just as good
T - same as the nose, big tropical fruit, mango, dank with garlic/onion/ganja, papaya, passion fruit, again less tropical than the mosaic dry hopped version but it's not possible to knock it
M- light to medium mouthfeel, alcohol covered, aftertaste is dank, breadth malts, orange pith. 
O- easily one of the best pale ales I've ever had. I have a few more bottles, I'm going to do a side by side with fresher Zombie Dust and see where it comes out. 677 charactersHopHunter19, May 01, 2016

That said, it's of course still very drinkable, and I'm glad to see where the roots lay for some of the better pale ales being made right now. 318 charactersLochnessmonster, Apr 01, 2016

I wasn't disappointed in the least - pours nice and cloudy, appropriately gold-ish in color. It straddles the IPA/Pale Ale line but the bitterness shows enough restraint to fall at the edge of the pale ale category. But it's close.
This beer gives off a wonderful tropical aroma. Taste-wise I'm picking up some serious orange peel to go along with pineapple and a touch of pine.
Wow. This may be the new gold standard for American Pale Ales. 662 charactersCeltics76, Mar 20, 2016

Pours a nice hazy medium to light honey color with two fingers of soapy head.
Aromatically, this beer is incredible. Note of candied fruit and pineapple juice mix with bread.
Flavors are nice, a little more muted than the aroma but delicious, hops and malt nicely balanced.
Mouthfeel was very nice as well.
Overall this beer is delicious, well crafted and beautifully aromatic. 421 charactersBoldRulerVT, Mar 02, 2016

Looks like an orange juice milkshake. Pours a turbid pale gold with a dense, creamy white foam head. Smells like peaches, mangos, and pineapple with cream, some citrus zest, spicy pine and dank earthy grass. Tastes like orange and white grapefruit juice with notes of mango, mild pineapple, peaches, with lightly bitter pine and dank earthy grass. Feels medium-full, smooth with low carbonation. Overall a really great, juicy and fruity pale ale. 475 charactersStoutElk_92, Feb 28, 2016

Look:  An orange yellow color, looks like an Arnold Palmer with 90% lemonade with 10% iced tea.  Can't see through due to the color by the end has a clear look to it.
Smell:  Agree with others when they say Pineapple is the fruit I smell.  That being said it is a very light tropical smell.
Taste:  Light passion/tropical taste with a slight bitterness on the end.  Very good and balanced.
Mouthfeel:  Slightly on the watery side.  Not creamy at all.  Good not great.
Very good beer.  Just not for me with other offerings out there. 573 charactersBEEPOP, Feb 27, 2016

Smell: fresh cut grass, citrus and tropical fruits. pineapple, lemon zest, peach fuzz. light pine. bread-like malts along with some fruity yeast. 
Taste: opens with a kick of citrus hops, orange flesh mixed with lemon zest. some fresh cut grass brings it around to tropical fruits, and mango. hops and fruit keep coming with a light peach fuzz. back end has a bread like malt base and a lightly fruity yeast. 
Mouthfeel: super drinkable, moderately bitter. a bit on the dry side. yeast and light sweetness clean it up leaving it fairly clean.
Overall: a top notch pale ale. bursting with hop flavor in a wide variety. but like a good pale ale the malts still show through. I really like the bready malt character along with the slightly estery yeast. 959 charactersSportsandJorts, Jan 22, 2016

Pours a hazy burnt orange. Thick head that lingers throughout. Don't get much a nose on it, it doesn't come at you strong at all but the malts are definitely there. The taste is wonderful and complex, mango and citrus finishing with a nice blend of malt sweetness and hop bitterness, neither overpowering the other. The mouth feel is the other place this beer shines, very balanced and smooth. 526 charactersbeantown_hopster, Jan 16, 2016

A: Golden color. Thick pea soup haze. Head is white, bubbly, and meringue-like. Chunky and clumpy lacing.
S: Tropical notes of apricot, mango, and peach. Pithy and leafy with a hint of hop spice. Subtle pine and earth too. Grainy and toasty malt base. 
T: Juicy flavors of peach, mango, pineapple, blood orange, and apricot. Grapefruit too. Leafy and spicy. Earth and pine pull through as the palate adjusts. Yeast. Grain and toast malt base. Tropical hop finish.
M: Medium bodied. Raw, unfiltered feel. Round, soft, and silky. Fine carbonation tingles the tongue.
O: A 'New Age' take on a pale ale. Southern Hemisphere hop-dominant, it leads with bold tropical flavors. Bitterness is extra tame and it has that raw and unfiltered feel too. Very much in line with the New England IPAs that top all the rating charts these days. 866 charactersryan1788a5, Jan 10, 2016

A: The beer is a dark gold color, with a large off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma is very strong and is an excellent blend of floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with strong flavors of caramel and fruity citrus. Then a strong piney hops bitterness quickly follows. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and provides an excellent balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet and slightly hoppy.
M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down extremely easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is an excellent beer to drink for a long time. 856 charactersTheManiacalOne, Jan 09, 2016

S: Really nice tropical fruit.  Mango, orange citrus, pineapple are just a few that come to mind.  Also has the dank, wet plant smell as well.  Picking up a little sweet malt as well, but this is hop forward.
T: Definately more subdued than the aroma.  There is just a touch of bitterness, actually quite light.  The malt has sweet/honey charactistics, and the hops bring forth the same fruity flavors as the aroma.
F: Quite smooth.  Goes back easy, not overly astringent or drying.  Somewhat silk in texture, though there is a slight bite from the carbonation.
O: Great beer, definately exemplary of the New England style, though the only issue I have is that the flavor seems somewhat weak on this beer.  The flavor itself is great I just feel that its dialed back a bit and could use some stronger malt or hop flavors to really drive it home. 1,000 charactersedward_boumil, Jan 07, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5200th beer! 195th review. Poured from a bottle, very fresh, dated 12/31/15, a hazy orange color with a while head that has large bubbles, fantastic lacing as I drink it out of the teku glass. 
Aroma is fresh and inviting,  nice citrus notes, quite tropical,  definitely get the Citra on the nose and palate. Peach is there subtly on the taste, as is melon and pineapple. Light pine notes too. Mouthfeel feel is also quite good, it's crisp, well carbonated and you get that fresh hop, unfiltered feel when you rub your tongue with the roof of your mouth. 
Overall this is an outstanding beer, maybe the best pale ale I've ever had. 630 charactersJordonHoltzman, Jan 06, 2016

I've had other since, but this one definitely stands out among some of the others I've now enjoyed. For a beer with such a "low" ABV, it's incredibly complex and flavorful. Has the right balance of bitter and juiciness. Would definitely seek out again. 310 charactersDolphinsmarlins1, Nov 07, 2015

I get sweet citrus and oranges and some tropical fruits and subtle grassiness. The body was juicy and satisfying with a subtle bitterness and finishes clean and refreshing. JC does no wrong in my book. 312 charactersW_Des, Sep 23, 2015

Nose is dominated by sweet stone fruit and orange with hints of dry hay.  Taste is orange, mango and guava fruitiness with just enough hop bitterness to balance thing out.  The hoppy bitterness lingers a bit longer providing a nice finish.  An absolutely lovely beer! 369 charactersmschantz, Sep 18, 2015

A. Opaque, dark straw/dull copper color. Poured a 2-finger egg shell, slightly coarse head. Sturdy laces.
S. Juicy and hoppy. Green, fresh hops - mostly tropical. Notes of mangos, pineapples, tangerine rinds.
T. Starts with a slight bitterness that comes through with juicy and floral notes. A slight hop resin finish.
M. Huge body, a little harsh, high carbonation.
O. Cloudy, but that seems to be the trend with Trillium beers. You can almost chew this beer. Very full body and amazing flavors from the hops. Not much in respect to malts, mainly hops and water, what else does one need? 643 charactersmacher0, Sep 16, 2015

Look: 1/4 inch head. Hazy amber; not transparent but not super cloudy.
Smell: Tropical hop aroma: citrusy mango. Grapefruit. Subtle grassy smell developed over the tasting. 
Taste: Again, CITRUS. More grapefruit, hint of lemon. Super crisp.
Feel: Creamy up front - coating on mouth that gives a serious but fleeting citrus burn.
Overall: I see the hype. Definitely a great IPA. Good from start to finish. In an over populated realm of tropical IPAs but this comes out ahead of most. 519 charactersdhitchcox, Sep 02, 2015

Pours a hazy, pale yellow with hints of gold. There is a finger and a half of off white head with good retention. Aroma is stongly hoppy with lots of citrus and a touch of pineapple.Taste follows the nose with citrus hops dominating; pale malts are subtly present in the background. The beer seems fairly well balanced, it is neither strongly bitter or sweet. Medium-light body with moderate carbonation and a clean finish. Overall this is an incredibly enjoyable beer if you love hops; its a great pale ale that delivers the hop flavor aroma and flavor of an IPA without the bitterness. 642 charactersmnj21655, Aug 31, 2015

Extremely well balanced beer and easy drinking. I haven't had a 'wow' beer in a while. I'm so glad I was able to try this amazing beer. ISO more!!! 391 charactersRyancthomas7, Aug 28, 2015

4.79/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 750 into a Trillium pub glass. Off white, cream colored head. The beer is a golden orange hue and between translucent and opaque. The aroma is like candied hops. It's not as aromatic as the DDH version, even if you stick your nose in the glass or in the foam. There's a ton of grapefruit. some pineapple/mango sweetness, and nice dank bitterness and citrus zest at the end. The mouthfeel is soft and inviting. It's not overcarbonated. All of the flavors in the beer pass over the palate when consumed. 
Overall, this is one of my favorite beers period. The mouthfeel is terrific and the interplay between the sweet citrusness of the citra and the dankness of the columbus is playfully complex without reducing its drinkability. 742 charactersSheppard, Aug 18, 2015

Holy crap, this is one of the finest pale ales I've ever had. Good amount of fruity, citrus hop on the nose, but not too much hop in the taste that a IPA would deliver, which is appropriate for a PA. Great hop/malt balance with a clean finish. Kinda reminds me of Alpine Nelson's younger brother with the hop difference. I need more of this in my life. 429 charactersRollzroyce21, Aug 17, 2015

Pours a hazy light yellow, with a soapy white head that dissipated quickly, leaving sporadic lacing. Nose was an explosion of tropical fruit: mango, grapefruit, candied orange, some pineapple. A very *dank* overtone on the nose as well. The mouth follows the nose, for the most park, with a harmonious blend of citrus, and a nice piney backbone. Not too much malt, and sweet in a way that is balanced. Not too carbonated, but very full and chewy texture. Overall exceptionally balanced flavors, tremendous nose, and thought provoking mouth feel. Hooray beer. 607 charactersNizzleEGizzle, Aug 14, 2015

4.77/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I'm writing this review after having had this beer a few times. I traded for 4 bottles and have tried to space them out (it's been difficult!) to let the taste develop as the bottle conditions a bit. Every time I've tasted it, the nose has been incredible. Big, beautiful citrus. It smells so good. This is what I want every pale ale and most IPAs to smell like. The taste is solid. When it's too fresh, you get the veggie/grassy dry hop taste that fades after a few days. It's also a tad too bitter (for an APA) if you drink it within a couple days after bottling, but going forward, my only complaint is that the ABV is a bit too high for what I'm looking for in a pale ale (though you don't taste it at all!) Expect tons of grapefruit, mango, orange. I get very little pine and that's a good thing! 801 charactersRobNewton, Aug 09, 2015

Pours a very hazy deep amber body with a 2 finger white head that reduces slowly to leave a little lacing and a a good amount of retention. 
On the nose is big citrus, fruity tropical aromas, mango, pineapple, really an explosion of tropical fruits. Very nice on the nose. 
The taste really follows the nose, I've never quite tasted a beer with this degree of tropical character.. big pineapple, mango, papaya, grapefruit, a splash of citrus, oranges, finishes with a light malt backbone and a slight bitter zing on the tongue.. citrus rind on the aftertaste. Mouthfeel is excellent, very easy drinker, medium carbonation and medium body. 
Very impressive.. the hop profile is outstanding and fruity. I've never tasted an IPA/pale ale/DIPA with this much tropical character. Would recommend. 927 charactersgcamparone, Aug 03, 2015

Smells very hop forward. Big mango and grapefruit nose with a hint of pine.
Taste starts sweet and the malt is present which is a huge plus for a hoppy pale.hops take over with some juicy full bodied grapefruit and pine flavors.

The color is golden amber with 2 finger white head with thick ringlets of lace and very fine bead. The smell is very citrus heavy like tangerine with herbal accent and light yeast ester which augments the subtle malt and vegetal aspect of the hop scents. The feel is very good with moderate body and medium bitterness with a light sweetness and slight astringent element with gently dry and spiced finish.
The taste is very tangy and juicy with fruity semi-tropical tasting like grapefruit with mild malt sweetness to back it up with mild herbal taste mid palate with slight spicy element and gentle lemony quality with subtle pine hop flavors as it finishes with a wild grassy sort of taste with astringency toward the mostly dry finish. Overall this is a solid pale with lots of hop flavor and very drinkable as it is balanced enough to have hops 1st and malt secondary 970 charactersSlatetank, Jul 20, 2015

A serious pale ale we have here, hop forward enough that it pretty much drinks like an IPA without the massive bitterness. There is some balance even with the big push of hoppiness, citrus rind, tobacco, pith, & earthy pine from the Columbus and Citra hops. Its obvious why this beer is so sought after. Kudos to Trillium for making such an exceptional American Pale Ale.

Look: Golden orange and hazy. Thick fluffy white head.
Smell: Citrus bomb. 
Taste: Explosion of lemon and grapegruits, and follow with a tart bite.
Feel: Very smooth and the right amount carbonation.
Overall: So much flavor in a pale ale. Not sure how this is in a pale ale category. Where's the malt? 342 charactersKMachHops, Jul 05, 2015

Smell:  Tropical fruit and grapefruit.  A touch of dankness.
Taste:  No detectable alcohol.  Tropical fruit and grapefruit.  A touch of pine.  Compared to double dry hopped Congress and Ataic, this of course, has a restrained hop bitterness.  Still hoppy, just more tame.
Feel:  The body is drying.  Short finish.  Even carbonation.
Overall:  This is a very desirable APA.  I like the taste of Zombie Dust better, but the overall experience belongs to this APA.  I am sure the double dry hopped versions enhance this beer exponentially.  A great APA. 690 charactersmabermud, Jun 25, 2015

L: Pours a hazy, straw yellow with about a finger or two of sudsy head. A little bit of lacing is left as I drink this. 
S: Smells of mango immediately invade my nose. A medley of faint orange and lemon also come through. A little papaya also comes through. I can tell that this beer has citra hops in it. I had the galaxy dry hopped edition and the nose was completely different.
T: The taste follows the nose pretty well. The mango and orange come through at first with a bit of lemon. The yeast is pretty prominent in the taste as well, which is something that many breweries cannot pull off. The bitterness on the back reminds me that this is a well hopped beer. Simply fantastic.
F: This feels heavier than 6.60%. I'm not used to such full flavor in an American Pale Ale. Regardless, I'm tempted to take another sip almost immediately after the sip before it.
Overall: This is a world class pale ale. The appearance is juicy, the smell is tropical and the taste is both. The mouthfeel is more of a regular IPA than a pale ale, but it's still pleasant. I think I might prefer the Galaxy dry hopped version to this, but this is still one of the best out there. I'm thinking I might have to do a side by side to settle the debate. 1,278 charactersRichD, Jun 23, 2015

Growler, fresh poured this afternoon at the brewery, and splashed into the souvenir pint glass I got there. (I know, I got pint glasses comin' outta the rafters!)
Gorgeous looking brew, golden, unfiltered, and aromatic. This particular offering was dry-hopped with Mosaic, a Simcoe hybrid I'm told.
It is a citrus monster with very fine carbonation. Balanced. One of the finest pales I've tasted, though a decade ago would have fallen into the IPA realm. 560 charactershudsonvalleyslim, Apr 10, 2015

A-Poured into a snifter, hazy straw colored with a three finger  white head that likes to linger
S-citra bomb
T-very similar too odd sides cpa but with a little lemon zest. Lots of citra flavor that is almost overwhelming 
M-carbonation is a little high but quite drinkable and not too much of a tongue buckler
O-turn down the citra and put this in twelve ounce servings and you have a great deal. Lots of flavor but this is a one bottle per sitting beer. 482 charactersbeerhan, Mar 17, 2015

Big fluffy/ccreamy white head that just sticks around forever. Pretty! Aroma is fantastic with lots of pineapple mango grapefruit, super tropical, papaya, light grass, a bit of lemon peel. Mhmmm. Flavor is dry pine and grass, less tropicalness as the smell might indicate, nice bitterness going on here, some pineapple and lots of bitter grapefruit skin. Interesting. Medium light bodied with adequate carbonation and a dry finish. Really nice. I was skeptical as to whether this would really be any different from the Galaxy Dry Hopped version, but this one seems a bit more dry and grassy, while the Galaxy version had big tropical notes. Both are fantastic brews. 750 charactersBMMillsy, Mar 04, 2015

Only better Trillium beer I've tried was Big Sprang; that is out of this world good!

That was the first and only time I'd ever done that. 310 charactersIvanhoes_Backpack, Feb 19, 2015

Appears a golden-orangish color, with a thick head composed of small bubbles. Relatively hazy, though less so than Trillium's IPAs. Smells orangy and citrusy, with a touch of bitterness. The taste is only slightly malty, with some mild breadiness....the flavor is overwhelmingly hoppy and fruity, with some tangerine and orange flavors present. Bitterness on the finish. The beer is exceptionally smooth and drinkable. Crisp and sessionable like an APA, but with the hop character of an IPA. Overall, an excellent, excellent APA. Will drink many times in the future, especially when the variant dry-hopped versions are available! 693 charactersTheElectricOne, Feb 15, 2015

Look - Beautiful light blood orange pours with 1/2 inch head that dissipates quickly.  hazy-yellowish-tropical sunset look
Smell - Forget it, one of the juiciest, tropical brews I can remember smelling, must be blood oranges/mangos
Taste - Earthy grass flavors pop out initially, tropical fruits in the end - light malt and forest undertones.  Very special brew here, as good as advertised
Feel - Soft and clean feel, perfect carbonation touch in the finish
Overall -  Excellent, one of my favorite Pale Ales - its already my favorite style of beer and I have to say this stands right up with the other giants in the Pale Ale world 670 charactersM_chav, Jan 12, 2015

4.41/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25750ml bottle, undated, poured into a Trillium etched snifter.
The beer pours an intensely hazy and cloudy orange color, hues of copper and light amber with a thick finger of soapy white head that has nice retention and leaves behind a wonderful amount of soapy lace. The aroma is super dank and hoppy, intense fruity Citra and Columbus hops, earthy pine, grapefruit citrus, grassy wildflower with a punch of doughy and chewy pale grain. The flavors mirror the nose very well, bitter, but fruity hops, citrusy with some pineapple and tropical fruit, lightly floral with some definite dankness, grassy and lightly piney with a bit of earthiness and the doughy malt, quite like the malt profile on Hill Farmstead's pale ales, lingers behind the bitterness. The mouthfeel is great, really thick and substantial, a touch of zippy carbonation, very coating that finishes with a creaminess but also a stiff dryness.
Verdict: A delicious pale ale from Trillium, incredible showcasing of the hops with a soft but anchoring malt profile. This is easily the best use of Columbus hops I've encountered and while the Citra definitely carries the flavors, the Columbus adds a nice bitterness but also accentuating fruity and dank flavors. This is top notch stuff, easily one of the best pale ales on the market. 1,300 characterskevanb, Jan 08, 2015

4.1/5  rDev -8.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Bottled yesterday (12/30/14).
A: Pours a gold-tinted straw color with two generous fingers of pillowy head.  Excellent retention and persistent retention.
S: Very aromatic, reaching at least a foot away from the glass when the bottle is first opened.  Citrus and a bit of tropical hops, a touch of bready malt in support.
T: Hop forward, with notes of citrus and pine.  This reminded me of a heavy dry hopping of Cascade or something the day after bottling, but it’s mellowed out substantially since.  
M: Medium body and light carbonation.  
O: Pretty good for a pale ale, definitely on the hoppier end of the spectrum, but enough of a malt character to stay to style. 676 characterspmarlowe, Jan 06, 2015

Thank you to Jlindros & Rudzud for this one.
App- In the glass this is a very hazy pour. A good amount of orange is there with a bit of a lighted yellow and golden center. Color radiates outwardly and with a good 2-1/2 finger head it leaves bit soapy and filmy cling down the glass.
Smell- Out of the shoot this has the markings of a fabulous smelling beer. Whispy notes come waving out of the neck. A good amount of hoppy bitter with intermixed tropical fruits and soft floral notes. Tangerine, Orange and a bit of a pine note. Not much. A bit of a soft peach note backs it up.
Taste- I am really enjoying this. For a pale ale, it delivers big flavor and saves on some of the booze. The flavors are more of a creamy note with a big fruit flavor. The hops are there but don't have residual flavors of too much bitter or pine. The pale ale flavors shine through more. I think they nailed this and didn't try to make this overly big or hoppy instead a wonderful beer with a mild ABV.
Mouth- Big, luscious and creamy. Not always the way I describe a pale ale,  but very billowy and medium bodied. The carbonation is like drinking some cream soda but instead of vanilla you get more fruit and cream flavors that lay down 
on the tongue
Drink- I had to wait a long time to get my hands on one of these locals from my RS guys and I am quite glad I did. I think I will have to search out more and get a glass and more of these guys delicious beers. This was a wonderful pale ale, rich of flavor and delicate and smooth in body and carbonation. Well done. 1,623 charactersFosterJM, Dec 10, 2014

Aromas of sweet tangerine, pineapple, and maybe a little mango are accompanied by a light touch of spicy grass and pine.
Taste follows the nose, with a very thorough blend of tropical juicy sweetness and dank, earthy, and spicy pine. Dry and slightly bitter on the finish, but incredibly well balanced with residual fruit and spice flavours. 459 charactersIan_B, Dec 03, 2014

L- Poured into a tulip glass. These guys get a healthy amount of carb on the beers. Somewhat restrained pour yields a creamy three fingers of head that sticks to the glass. Head retention is amazing. Color is a hazy goldenrod with some pale yellow on the fringes. She's a beaut.
S- Aroma is sweet tangerine, citrus rind, pine needles, hop resin, hints of sweet tropicals (pineapple), just a touch of sweet malt. A truly spectacular bouquet on this beer. I never want to take my nose from the glass.
T- Taste is a punch of tropicals up front, finished with some mild bitterness that's really pleasant. Add to the mix some citrus (oranges, tangerines) and There's a grapefruit bitterness that lingers, but not in a way that's overwhelming. The flavor isn't as bold as the aroma, but it's still just so, so good.
F- Spot on. Smooth, creamy, not too prickly on the carbonation. Love the lingering grapefruit bitterness which coats the tongue. 
O- A splendid beer that is right up there with the likes of PseudoSue (which remains my favorite). The Trillium boys know what to do with hops and I am an official fanboy of their beers. I would never turn down a chance at more. 1,258 charactersjbwimer, Nov 25, 2014

Generally, I'm sketpical of the pro-haze crowd, but I also can't deny that this beer, which was downright turbid when I had it, was fantastic, giving off great and true hop flavor, green, dank, tropical, all of it. Kinda have to close your eyes to drink it...but the proof is in the pudding, or taste as it were, and it's darn good indeed. 439 charactersbreadwinner, Nov 21, 2014

Revisited with a fresher bottle.  While better, like Congress St, I didn't feel like it warmed up well and by the end of the glass I wasn't enjoying it nearly as much as when I first poured the glass. 411 characterskscaldef, Oct 28, 2014

Pours apricot colored and pleasantly effervescent.  Smells like a giant burst of mango and other mellow citrus fruits.  If their website hadn't corrected me, I would have thought for sure this was a straight-Citra IPA.
Only, unlike lesser Citra IPAs, Fort Point mango-ness does not lead in to a rather disappointing, malt-heavy finish.  ATG's Citra Ass Down is an example of such a beer--excellent aroma and front end with a finish that's merely pretty good.  I don't know if Citra is just the Fruit Stripe Gum of hops or what, but balancing it out a bit with Columbus ensures a more lingering hop presence, which works excellently.
Not *quite* at the level of Zombie Dust or PsuedoSue, but damn close. 764 charactersmynie, Oct 20, 2014

A- Pours a medium amber color with a 1/2 inch of-white head that retains well before becoming a thin ring around the edge of the glass and a small center patch of surface foam.  Bubbly snowflake pattern of lacing sticks to the glass.
S- Sweet hop aroma with the bready malt working as a perfect template for the citrusy, grassy hops to play off of.  Amarillo hops?
T- Flavor is not nearly as hoppy or bitter as the aroma would lead you to believe.  The malt comes through more with its sweetness and more bread notes as the hops work as more of a balancing agent.  Very tasty stuff.  So drinkable, yet so flavorful.
M- Somewhat oily from the hops with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.  
O- Such a unique beer that somehow exhibits the best of both worlds in hoppy beers as it is sweet and earthy as well as citrusy and dank.  Remarkable. 948 charactersImmortale25, Sep 27, 2014

Cheers to Bilco for sharing this
A: Hazy honey-orange, apricot color - pours with a medium white head, fades to a few wisps, leaves some nice lacing
S: Bright with some big, potent hops - extremely hoppy without actually being aggressively hoppy - resiny, dank, wet, juicy-smelling hop cones - very fresh - extremely fruity with some juicy, tropical, and citrus aromas - tangerine, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, pine, and leafy hops - basically, a bag of hop pellets blended with some pale malts
T: Extremely hoppy without really being bitter - this is a matter of creative hop chemistry, a question of alpha acids and such - extremely flavorful, extremely drinkable - tangerine, orange flesh, ruby red grapefruit, tropical flavors, pineapple, mango - pale malts hold everything together
M: Medium body, nicely carbonated, smooth, and drinkable
O: I finally understand how someone could be obsessed with Trillium
This is the best thing I've ever had from Trillium, and it's also one of the best beers I have had in 2014. Truly a treat. 1,073 charactersangrybabboon, Sep 22, 2014

4.04/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Appearance: Slight chill haze on a dark gold tinged with orange. As it warms it pushes closer to the dark gold, dropping some of the orange hues. A touch of copper. Head is white, almost bright-white with ok retention. Starts with a fluffy head that drops to a small cap and slightly thicker collar. Solid notches of lacing.
Smell: Loaded with tangerine and tropical aromas. Hints of peach and mango with a solid punch of pineapple. Some grapefruit and pine needle thrown in as well. Very light pithy bitterness through the back. Malts are nice and bready offering a nice balance to the hop aroma. A touch of caramelized sweetness as well. Some pale malts add some cracker as well. Touches of flower petal run through the back. Solidly hoppy, but balanced. Mild yeast presence with a very slight earthy backing.
Taste: Slight bitterness sits on the back of the tongue. Initial sip hits with a flash of juicy peach and tangerine and slips away. Malts add a nice balance with some snappy cracker and whtie bread crust. Yeast adds a touch of a fruity character as well. A touch earthy with some floral elements added for good measure. A touch of oily pine bitterness. Hints of pith. Solidly fruity, running the gamut. Hints of pear, mango, and pineapple. Lots of fruitiness. Front of the sip has an almost woody bitterness to it. 
Mouthfeel: Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Body runs a touch creamy on the initial sip with a lingering pseduodry finish. 
Overall: Doing Boston proud.
A good pale ale. Has the same lingering bitterness (almost too much) that I expect from a Trillium pale ale, but it's good. Super drinkable on the sip. The finish hurts it in the long run, but the depth of flavor and the balance are spot on. Try this if you have the chance. 1,768 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Sep 17, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.9%Fort Point is, without question, the best APA I've ever had. Trillium hit it out of the park with this one. I picked up a Case 2 days after it was bottled, so I've had only very fresh bottles FYI.
Appearance - Pours cloudy amber with a nice 2-3 finger head. The color is a bit darker than you'd expect. Fort Point is darker in color than Trillium's Congress Street IPA by several shades.
Smell - Open the bottle and you'll instantly smell fruity hops. The Citra really shines in this one.
Taste - Follows the smell. There's plenty of lemon/lime, grapefruit, and other citrus flavors, but they're nicely balanced by the use of malt and wheat. The wheat adds a unique flavor compared to other APAs - just a hint of banana sweetness maybe?
Mouth - Perfect. Smooth, crisp, light, nicely carbonated.
Overall - I could drink this beer every day. It's also my wife's favorite beer. Everyone I've shared it with has given me a double take WOW. It's really that good. If you like APAs/IPAs and are in the Boston area, Trillium is a must stop. 1,038 charactersRichKent, Sep 16, 2014

Balanced and sophisticated with a citrus hoppiness. Smooth without the least hint of bitterness. Eminently drinkable. Seek this out. 232 charactersjjdc, Sep 07, 2014

A: Beer pours a vibrant orange/amber color. A little cloudy. Big fluffy white head, about two fingers that sticks for a while. The very definition of gorgeous lacing. 
S: WOW! Huge hop bomb on the nose. The Citra is exploding with grapefruit, tangerine, dank garlicky earthiness, pineapple, guava, and mango. Fresh bag of hops smell. One of the best beers on the nose that I can remember.
T: Boom! Follows the nose wonderfully with citrus, dankness, slight pine and tropical notes. Such a fresh and green taste. Not one aspect overpowers the other and very little bitterness in the finish for such a hop bomb. Nice yeasty taste on the back end as well. So tasty.
MF: My mouth was watering between sips. Great carb. My only negative is that I wish there was a little more malt backbone, especially since the beer is at 6.6% ABV. 
O: What a treat! This beer is easily up there with Zombie Dust and PseudoSue. 954 charactersbenloho, Sep 04, 2014

S - Tons of tropical fruit (mango and pineapple) and stone fruit (peach).  Sweet and sharp grapefruit.
T - Follows the nose.  Really well balanced.  Some grass complements the citrus notes in the finish.
M - Medium carbonation.  Just enough stickiness in the finish to make it fruit juice-like.

A: Pours an extremely cloudy light orange. So cloudy it almost looks like a witbier. A cross between a witbier and heady topper. Tall, frothy white head that fades out slowly. Nice retention and thick tendrils of lacing are left behind.
S: Oh geez. I've had a lot, and I mean a LOT of good beers in my life. This one still made me grin like a fool when I smelled it. The fresh, juicy hop aroma is off the wall. It's like fresh squeezed orange juice. There is some light, spicy, almost garlicky pine in there too. Tropical fruits, plenty of them. I swear I get kiwi and papaya? Is that even a thing? Really wonderful aroma regardless of my poor descriptions. 
T: More of the same, just a bit less juicy. Lots of spicy, herbal, garlicky pine. Must be citra I assume because I also get some light, juicy tropical fruits floating around. Wonderful balance of hop flavors and intensity. Light bready, almost cracker-like malt at times. Sits in the background and lets the hops sing their song. Mildly bitter on the back end but nothing over the top at all. Mildly dry, herbal and spicy aftertaste.
M: Medium bodied, lightly dry. Goes down easy.
O: The hop flavors in this are bold and vibrant but are somehow not overpowering at the same time. Bitterness is moderate. Drinkability excels for such a hoppy beer as a result. I guess this IS an APA after all. I can't really quantify exactly why this is so delicious, it just got a level of balance, hoppiness and drinkability that you don't find often. Absolutely delicious. This is a Zombie Dust level APA, period. 1,605 charactersDope, Jul 28, 2014

The taste of the beer is also pretty hoppy but stays within the range of pale ale vs an IPA. Overall this beer is an immediate classic.

Nose was really boisterous at first; calms down pretty quickly. Flavor is insane levels of citrus and pine mixed together. At first it seems way overboard. I suppose I get used to it as time goes on. This is no calm pale ale. Out there and in your face. How much you appreciate this one will probably depend on your personal flavor preferences. And how much the hype train sways your reviews. 475 charactersRblWthACoz, Jul 06, 2014

Look: hazy pale yellow with a hint of orange, pretty decent foamy head, ample carb.
Smell: fresh-grated orange rind, pine, some mild anise. Bright and sharp.
Taste: lots of pine/grass, and lemon/lime/orange. Subtly sweet. The sweet and bitter flavors are so well integrated that you don't even notice them if you aren't looking for them. Very nuanced, with several distinct waves of flavor.
Feel: really damn soft and smooth—not overly prickly, but just right to balance the citrus notes in the taste. Fairly dry, and a pretty hefty medium body given the ABV.
Overall: a fantastically well-crafted beer. The complexity and slight astringency keep it from being ridiculously crushable—though the feel tends in that direction—but this is a beer that deserves to be savored. Overall=4.625. 911 charactersneurobot01, Jun 17, 2014

A- Hazy orange-copper body with a fluffy two finger white head with good retention, awesome lacing. This looks very much like a Vermont style pale ale to be honest. 
S- Grapefruit, mango, pineapple, biscuits, a bit of honey. This smells awesome.
F- Grapefruit, biscuit, a bit of pine, more tropical fruit, some grassiness. Fairly bitter for an APA, but not so much that it's closer to being an IPA. The pineapple is nicely forward on the finish.
M- Soft, medium bodied pale ale with good carbonation. Finish is pineapple, some grassy bitterness that lingers a bit. Very easy to dome this bottle.
O- This was a surprisingly awesome drinking experience that I didn't expect since I received this as an extra in an IP trade when I visited Boston, and didn't look up this beer at all before cracking it open. I'll definitely have to seek this one out again; this is an excellent APA. 964 charactersStevedore, Jun 13, 2014

Appearance - Hazy orange body. Nice white head. Some lacing.

Taste - More monotonous. Orange. Grapefruit. Some pine. Grainy cracker malt. Mild grassy hop bitterness in the back.
Mouthfeel - Medium light body. Drops off quickly. Mild bitterness.
Overall - Really nice hop aroma. Doesn't quite live up to the heights of its aroma, but it's very drinkable. 506 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 03, 2014

O: Simply put, this is a very fine beer. Easily drinkable and quite enjoyable. 616 charactersFlorida9, May 23, 2014

Pours a gorgeous, hazy, nearly opaque orange, with a 2.5 inch head, massive and beautiful, leaving big spots of lacing down the snifter. Just a really awesome looking beer, honestly.
Smells incredible, like mango, peaches, oranges, pineapples, slightly floral, with a bit of pine and oil.
The taste is similar. Unbelievably crisp and smooth, goes down so easy. The Citra and Columbus hops are used masterfully. As the beer warms up it becomes even more citrusy- orange, grapefruit, peach, mango. Some slight sweet pale malt flavors are there as well. Mild bitterness, this is mostly juicy.
Medium bodied, much fuller body than a typical pale ale with little malt. It's just so juicy, almost tastes creamsicle like with the foamy head. Clearly quite sessionable, despite the slightly "high for a session" 6.6% ABV. Crisp, clean mouthfeel, fairly dry in the finish, but juicy up front. Medium carbonation.
If it's not clear from the review above, this is an amazing beer. Possibly the best regular pale ale I've ever had. Not many people can make beer like this. I need more! 1,162 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 16, 2014

4.6/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.7522oz (25oz?) bottle split two ways. Served in a pint glass.
Appearance: Hazy orange-ish yellow. Good head retention.
Smell: Fruity hops with a nicely pungent undercurrent. No grain around here, but the hop bouquet is quite good.
Taste: There's the balance. Lots of citrusy fruit, way more earthy/funky hop power than in the nose, with a crisp, dry finish and welcomely lively carbonation. From the first try this beer begs you to drink like 60 ounces of it.
Surprised there's no Nelson Sauvin in this, as it has that almost cheesy flavor (sort of related to the dank earthy weed element). The internet says Columbus and Citra. It has the dank I expect from both (and then some), but not really the lime/orange I expect from Citra. The cereal grain malt backbone does an admirable job fighting for some attention, and as is so often the case with these kinds of beers, that element interacts with the pungent hops to give sort of a melon-y flavor (which I love). 
Lot of clean flavor here. Outstanding pale ale.
Mouthfeel: Just perfect. Light side of medium body, highish carbonation, very dry finish. Just spot on perfect for a hoppy pale ale.
Overall: Impressed by my first taste of Trillium's beer. My final thoughts on it are that if I could drink this way every day, it would be a good life. 1,302 charactersPahn, May 07, 2014

Overall: All though I have tasted a beer from this brewery once before, this excellent APA (verging on IPA) was totally off my radar; glad to have had the chance to try it

The beer is a beautiful golden straw color. Lighter than I typically expect from a pale ale. It's a little hazy, which is nice too. Little bit of active carbonation. Relatively low amount of lacing and head retention.
S - Bursting with fresh hop aromas. I consider this floral, but could possibly be on the verge of tropical. Bit of sweetness and pine.
T - I was afraid that it would be all hops, but even though it is certainly floral-hop forward, there are elements of biscuity malts, a bit of pine, and a light sweetness.
M - Not too memorable.
O - I'm biased against these guys based on some of the other beers that I had from them earlier on, but this one has got to be my favorite so far. Their flagship farmhouse beer is right up with this one though. Solid pale ale from Trillium. 886 charactersAndrew041180, Apr 14, 2014

4.19/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4The beer pours a pale, greenish yellow with a nice, quarter finger’s width head of eggshell-white bubbles. In body, the beer is clear and clean with a slight chill haze, but no visible particles and a nice lazy carbonation. On the nose, the beer is a beautiful bouquet of Citra hops. Mango and tropical fruit blend with spicy pine needles, pine resin, and a just a faint whiff of cattiness. On the tongue, the beer tastes bitter, yet balanced by cracker smooth malt sweetness. Soft citric acidity snaps at the start and finish of the sip, providing nice, yet drinkable complexity. In flavor, the beer begins as lemon juice and pine, slowly unfurling into pine and tropical juice with a nice balancing cracker malt and light prickly, light pineapple flavors. The finish is a crisp burst of juicy fruit, cracker malt, and lime zest, and the aftertaste is soft and tame, ringing with bitter medicine, pine, and citrus. In the mouth, the beer feels crisp and on the light side of medium in body. Carbonation is soft, and the beer provides a nice smooth blanket for the tongue, even though it remains crisp as an overall sip. Overall, this is a great hoppy pale ale. Bitterness is definitely the dominant feature here, and the Citra hop definitely shines, making this a wonderfully balanced hoppy beer with great complexity. This is a borderline IPA, and I personally would label it as such, as the malt balance isn’t quite where I like it for an APA. Overall this is a tremendously quaffable, hoppy pale ale with some great refreshing flavor. A beer to try! 1,557 charactersMaxwell, Apr 07, 2014

Appearance: It has a nice hazy golden/orange color to it. It has a nice off-white head that dies down moderateely and leaves some nice lacing.
Smell: The aromas definitely give out hints of dank hops (citrus/papaya/mango), quite tropical, followed by plenty of pine resin and some bready malts.

Drinkability: It's a very smooth drinkable beer accompanied with by great flavors and aromas.

Smell: Citrus, peach, a bit of resin, bread. Definitely hop forward aroma, with some nice juicy citrus in there.
Taste: Matches the smell pretty well: citrus, some peach, creamsicle, resin, earthy tones, some malts. Definitely hop forward but has a malt backbone to go with it.
Mouth-feel: Well carbonated with a medium, slightly creamy body. Finishes a tad bitter.

Bright golden body with a bit of haze throughout and a bubbly white head
The scent of this beer is immense. Tropical fruits, citrus, and it just jumps out of the glass. This scent is as good as any ale I've had, and that's a long list.
This is a very complex but drinkable pale. You get the spice of the Belgian yeast character. It's not as juicy as the nose would lead you to believe. Got some bitterness and a bit of citrus rind.
Hopefully if this eventually gets bottled, it retains all of the great character that came through in growler form. 605 charactersPHBoiler, Feb 24, 2014

4.47/5  rDev 0%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Growler fresh from the brewery (thanks Alex) poured into a bulbed pint glass. The liquid portion comes out a straw yellow color. Very hazy with lighter straw yellow on the sides when held up to the light. Liquid portion looks more like a hefeweizen than an American Pale Ale. Nice thick frothy white head with pretty decent lacing to it.
An excellent smelling American Pale, you can tell this one is really well hopped, and definitely some West coast IPA style hopping. Plenty of ripe citrus, peel, and lots of tropical fruits (primarily mango and not quite ripe pineapple). Give the glass the ol' wine swirl and you can pick up the malt backbone a little more, it's slightly bready I'd guess some type of wheat based malt with a little bit of biscuit.
Taste is awesome, one of the best tasting American Pale Ales I've had in a long time. It's hop forward, but not quite as much as the aroma. Thanks to the hop combination, you can really detect distinct citrus flavors like clementine, grapefruit and even a little blood orange. Plenty of citrus peel and a little more mango, pineapple, and even hints of kiwi. As I said very hop forward but really not that bitter. Malt backbone is nice, as I indicated before I think there's some type of wheat based malt because it tastes a little wheat bready/grainy. Dried oatmeal flakes glazed with some honey. This is a really awesome tasting pale ale. 
Mouthfeel is really good, not very heavy, a nice medium body with a pleasant lingering flavor. Spot on carbonation level the whole way through. Slightly gushy, but overall nicely balanced. Starts initially a tart hoppy rolling to a nice gentle sweetness then back to a nice sharp, dry (very dry) bitter finish. Crazy drinkable beer, any beer lover could drink this year round. I refer to beers like this as craft beer crowd pleasers. Really happy to have finally gotten around to trying it. Huge props again to Alex for picking this up for me. Looking forward to seeing what else Trillium can do, but I'll gladly get this again. 2,026 charactersAndyAvalanche, Feb 21, 2014

Smell: Floral, citrus, tangerine, grapefruit, lemon, tropical, grassy, and pine with some bready and pale malts in the rear. It's like a symphony of aromas for my nose to smell.
Taste: Intense hop flavor. Pretty much what was mentioned above is true with the malts and bitterness in the rear.
Mouthfeel: Tingly bitterness, tart, medium bodied, medium carbonation, chewy notes, and some chalkiness in the rear.
Overall: You can't go wrong. Growler or draft and both have been solid. Speaking of growlers, this mini needs to get filled. 801 charactersFlounder57, Feb 15, 2014

4.67/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75The beer comes in a yellowish orange with a fluffy head.
The aroma is very citrus forward with dried orange, tangerine, and grapefruit, along with mango and pineapple. A bit of a light bready malt too. Fantastic aroma for a Citra and Columbus hop beer. Some grass, passion fruit.
The flavor follows with tons of that juicy tropical, a bit of citrus, mango, tangerine, and light fruit like grapes and apples. A bit of a malt backbone, but not much. Not much bitterness as well, but instead with just lots of hoppy flavor. Drying of grapefruit pith.
Extremely drinkable. Next to Peekskill's Amazeballs, small breweries are releasing some world class pale ales. 661 charactersdar482, Jan 08, 2014

Pours a deep amber color with one finger of off white head and moderate carbonation evident. Fruity malts, citrus hops, oranges, and some tropical notes. Medium body and low carbonation; super easy to drink. Some light pine as it warms more.
Overall less hoppy than Congress Street (to be expected), but very good. A very good, somewhat hoppy, APA that is easy to drink and worth checking out for sure. 487 charactersmdfb79, Sep 17, 2013

Poured in a shaker pint, the beer is a hazy, bright, yellow-gold coloring that is almost opaque, with a frothy, foamy, bright white head that sits low profile and doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Aromas of citrus initially, with a grassy undertone that anchors the nose a bit. Flavors are a citrus blast on the forward tongue, followed by a subtle biscuit backbone that balances well. Lemon and tangerine dance across the palate with every sip, and there is a grassy and peppery blend to keep the sweetness in check. Smooth, mid-bodied, with light, almost effervescence into the aftertaste of citrus sweetness. Slick, clean, slightly dry finish that leaves some citrusy linger behind. Easy drinker. 746 charactersGarthDanielson, Sep 16, 2013

A - Darker yellow, almost orange. One finger head after a center pour, lovely looking brew
S - Fruit, fruit, fruits! Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, oranges, passion fruit. Smells amazing! Just makes you want to immediately down it. Awesome aroma.
T - All of that tropical fruit aroma is exactly the taste you get! And I couldn't be more happy about it. Nose matches the taste and that's exactly what you'd want with this. A slighty bitter finish. Perfect.
M - Same thing with the smell and taste. Fruity. Very smooth hitting the palate, especially as it warms. Slight carbonation. A pleasant experience. Everything mixes well with this.
O - Almost a true, perfect 5 in my opinion. An excellent representation of the style. A fruit medley forward APA with a nice hoppy finish, this is brilliant. I could drink it all day or just enjoy a pint and it would leave me wanting more and more. I also personally love that it flys under the radar. 1,022 charactersrjp217, Aug 17, 2013

Very light head that dissipates quickly but that might be because the growler nearly 3-4 days old. the beer itself is a cloudy orange.
Smell:
The beer has strong hop scent that resembles citrus and orange. In addition the beer's smell has tropical fruits such as pineapple and mango.
Taste:
Taste like it smells but that the pineapple taste is stronger.
Mouthfeel:
Biting carbonation and a medium body that is thicker than usual for most APAs. A slightly dry finish.
Overall:
An extremely good APA and one that I plan to get again and again. 557 charactersHattedClassic, Aug 12, 2013

Served in a Trillium "pub glass"
Super cloudy, yellow ochre appearance. A thick, foamy, off-white crown topped the liquid. Excellent retention. The head deposited large, oddly shaped patches of lacing along the upper portion of the glass.
The nose was ridiculously hoppy and fragrant with boatloads of juicy, tropical fruit notes. Mango, guava and passion fruit dominated. Some dank, resiny, weed-like notes came through as well. Super intense, particularly for the style.
The flavor profile was just as impressive as the nose. Hoppy to the extreme. Again, tropical fruit notes were in full effect. Tons of guava, mango and pineapple. Beneath all the hops was a light, pale malt base. Some orange peel came through as well. The finish was slightly bitter with lingering notes of grapefruit pith. For a beer this intense, it was amazingly well balanced and uber drinkable.
The mouthfeel was perfect. Medium-full bodied for the style. Super creamy and supple on the palate. The liquid contained an ultra fine, tongue blanketing effervescence.
Boston's newest nano-brewery completely blew my socks off with their flagship offering. Dare I say this is an even better American pale ale than the venerable Zombie Dust? My only request would be to see this distributed to more places around town. 1,332 charactersDamian, Aug 11, 2013

Appearance- Hazy orange with a small white head that didnt last long. Solid lacing.
Smell- Fruity pear and pineapple mixed with pine. Some solid malts, but mostly fruity and piney hops.
Taste- Pineapple, pear, apple, green grapes. Medium malt backbone. No hop bitterness. Awesome.
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied with mild carbonation and light resinous feel. No booze heat. 
Overall- Phenomenal tasting beer. I'd like the ABV to be lower because I could drink it all day long if it was. Real impressed. 553 charactersSeanniek91, Jul 24, 2013

S: Huge bouquet of flowers and fragrant, juicy hops. Super fruity and citrusy. When they were filling the growler at Trillium, you could smell the hops. That's a good sign.
T: Equally as fruity, hoppy, citrusy, resiny, grassy, and delicious as the nose suggested. Seriously awesome. Caught me by surprise. This is top notch stuff.
M: This was fantastic when I drank it fresh from the growler but unfortunately it's pretty flat two days after opening it. So it goes without saying, it's incredibly smooth! But seriously, the feel and carbonation were spot-on with this was fresh. Otherwise, the palate becomes coated with resiny hop goodness.
O: An amazingly fragrant and delicious APA. This is probably an IPA, though. I expect growlers to last longer. Maybe I'm wrong. This is just a guess, but...growlers go flat quicker with a filtered beer? 969 charactersGatch, Jun 14, 2013

Big fluffy head hits 1+ fingers and fades semi slowly with lots of soapy lacing, slightly hazy mostly clear golden honey colored.
Nose rides plenty of fresh hops, lots of resin and musty hop oils, citrus galore, bit of mango and passion fruit tropical fruit, papaya, slight floral hop, light fluffy airy malt base.
Taste stats with a light fluffy malt, hint of sweetness and plain juicy pale malt. Then hop just take over, fresh citrus hops, again tropical fruit, mango skin, papaya, and the resinous hop character leads to passion fruit again and touch of vinous notes, juicy overall fruit, light musty feel. Finish is dry with a super long fairly bitter tropical fruit, guava, passion fruit, etc, and citrus and resin lingering for what seems like forever.
Mouth is med bodied, decent carb, slightly oily.
Overall very good. Great fresh hops, nice light malty base but enough to prop it up. 922 charactersjlindros, Jun 07, 2013

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a slightly hazy honey hue with a nice two finger head that leaves light lacing and slight blanket.
S - Aromas of big citra hop notes, light tropical notes mango and pineapple, subtle Columbus hop notes as well. Very pleasant and inviting.
T - Taste is just delicious, with loads of tropical notes tons of mango, and grapefruit. Light malty sweetness here. Super sessionable and hoppy, really solid.
M - Mouthfeel is nice, lightly carbonated. Drinkable
O - Overall I was happily impressed by this beer. Every bit add great add promised. Wish they were closer. 661 charactersrudzud, Jun 07, 2013

S-Boom! Citra right off the bat. Concentrated citrus and herbals. Earthy yet exotically bright and fruity. Super-hopped aroma. Right down my alley. Intense, complicated and ultra-juicy in its hoppiness. Also has a cute little malty sweetness of wet, sweet dough.
T-In line with some of the best APAs I have ever had. Just a blast of ever-evolving hoppy flavor. Citrus, grass, mango, peach. Then a cool Citra-derived mixture of flower stems and clementines. There is a balancing factor from the malt but I'd still put this well into IPA territory. 
M-So much flavor and so much drinkability. Bitterness with a purpose. Tingly bubbles. Very juicy, very ripe.
O/D-Thanks Trillium. What a great APA. Reminds me of a few hoppy beers from Hill Farmstead and the other two VT savant-breweries. Seek this out. 925 charactersVelvetExtract, Jun 04, 2013

Poured from a 32 oz growler into a Trillium saison style glass. About a finger worth of head that vanished pretty quickly. Nose is incredible. I'm getting papaya, mango, and grapefruit, followed by a hint of pine.
The fruit is also the first thing to hit the tongue but it's immediately conquered by a huge burst of hops, while not becoming too bitter. Finish is very clean, and certainly helped along by the addition of wheat to the grist. 
Very sessionable, but the ABV will sneak up on your quickly. I'll certainly be going back to the brewery to get that growler filled again. Phenomenal brew. 694 charactersSoPoSuds, Jun 01, 2013

Poured from a growler into a Hill Farmstead tulip. The nose on this beer is excellent. I'm getting a lot of citrus (grapefruit) and pine.
Extremely drinkable beer for the alc %. This beer boarders on IPA territory w/ the taste, but not the huge hop punch you get with an IPA. Nice and dry with a slight bitter aftertaste.
I have filled my growler several times with this beer and will do so again soon.
If you live in Boston/ Southie area, do yourself a huge favor and try this beer. 642 charactersDrugsDelaney1, May 30, 2013

A- Yellowish, slightly orange hazy golden with about two fingers worth of frothy head that has very nice retention and slowly recedes to a thin layer leaving behind nice layered lacing. Very inviting for a APA with a nice grape-fruit like appearance.
S- Oranges, a hint of lemon peel, balanced malt. Fairly aromatic, very pleasant smelling.
T- Bold orange flavors, some light vinous hops mixed with some lemon peel, just a hint of bitterness, very well balanced malt, finishes with a fruity lemony orange presence. Nice pronounced flavors with a nice citrus hop presence that comes out.
M- Medium bodied, decent carbonation level, incredibly drinkable.
O- I've had this beer at least a few times already including from a growler the day after it was brewed, double-dry hopped, and on draft. Never once have I been disappointed and this is easily one of the best beers coming out of the state of Massachusetts right now. In my opinion definitely a world-class APA standing up against some of the best I've had. 1,074 charactersjaasen64, May 26, 2013

After three shakers... yes, there were plenty of other taps to choose from, but this was too tasty to pass up... I was already at my limit.
Looking forward to trying other Trillium products. Well crafted ale, this was. 545 charactersjwjon1, May 26, 2013
