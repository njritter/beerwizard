Whereas the aroma of tropical fruit and some pine is the hallmark of Congress Street, this DDH version is all fruit and fauna . Taste of guava, mango, pineapple, apricot and orange. Massive hop kick as expected; but there's still a nuanced cascade of fruit flavors with a very light malt backbone that doesn't detract from the citrus...at all. Soft mouthfeel but the acidity is there on account of all the citrus. Light bitterness closes the proceedings. 478 charactersManapuaMan, May 09, 2017

A- Cloudy and murky hazed up pale straw yellow brew from the can to a lambic glass. Foamy cap forms to an inch high. Decent head retention and the lacing is spotty but plentiful.
S- Juicy tropical and stone fruit hops. Melon, mango, peach and soft citrus like tangerines. Trillium as usual with the bold hops and a ferment as clean as can be.
T- As the aroma but a bit more citrus for sure with tangerines for real as well as satsuma and clementine. Melon and a bit of a sharp citrus oil feel that is common lately in these brews. A bit of cereal and bread but the aforementioned hops own. Hint of juicy gum.
MF- Smooth and light-medium body. Foamy and frothy texture with a medium level of the bubbles. Sharp citrus bitter ending lingers for days.
Trillium brews another really good IPA. No surprise there at all as juicy fruits and soft citrus explode on the palate. 887 characterscbutova, May 03, 2017

Pours turbid gold with a short-lived head and retention. Aromatics are lush with fresh orange juice, mango, and grapefruit. Medium bodied with a textured, soft mouthfeel. Grapefruit then orange pulp on the palate. Tropical and dank with low bitterness and quite dry. The finish is lengthy and flush with ripe citrus and some pith in the very end. 
Great beer. An easy drinker dispite being such a showcase for tropical hops. Sunrise in a glass. 471 charactersbrewandbbq, Apr 29, 2017

5/5  rDev +9.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5From growler poured into pint glass - bottled 4/23/17
Pours an opaque pineapple juice color - so thick that it almost looks like cream is mixed in.  This is the peak of juice bomb expression for me and done to perfection.  Relatively thin head (maybe because out of a growler) but silky smooth and leaving nice rings on the glass.
Aroma is out of this world.  As this is a fresh batch 2 days out of the tap it is extremely pungent with dank citrusy tones mixed with pine and grass notes.  The clementine and peach notes are very faint for me.
Taste follows the smell - grass pine, dank pot notes with a thin underlying of orange and tropical fruit notes.  toasted malt in the background mixes in very well.  Aftertaste is slightly sweet with caramel malt notes.  This is done so well.
Feel is soft and creamy.  I almost expect to find cream settling to the top.  No heavy flavors at all, just a refreshing fruit juice feel with a minimal amount of seltzer.  Bitter is pretty light but maybe a touch more than some of the other street series beers.
This is by far my favorite IPA from Trillium, rivaling their epic Pow Pow collab.  The proportions here in all categories are just to perfection.  I am unabashedly giving this all fives as an exemplary take on the juice bomb NE IPA.  If this doesn't get it I don't know why they even have fives. Try it and maybe you'll see why this score is deserved. 1,404 charactersdigboy, Apr 26, 2017

Appearance- A thick murky orangish color that reminded me of pineapple juice. A thick foamy 2 finger of white head. Lots of nice lacing down the entire glass. 
Smell- A fruity monster of pineapple and mango. Also some grapefruit, peach, and other tropical fruits with an interesting mix of hops thrown in. Superior mixture of aromas
Taste- The fruit juice mixes superbly with the hops and a nice dry finish. The mix is so drinkable and an aftertaste that just keeps it going. 
Mouthfeel- A smooth creamy body and a nice medium carbonation. 
Overall- Definitely my favorite IPA from Trillium. Such a great fruity mixture and hops to boot. A nice finish for a classic NE IPA. 725 charactersKdouble, Apr 21, 2017

Smells of juicy grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, clementine and peach up front, with a mix of tropical fruit and citrus hops just bombarding my senses. The next wave is piney hops, biscuit, whole wheat crackers, faint caramel, floral hops/floral notes, and then peppery spices like coriander and dry tea leaf...trailing earthy notes bring the dry hopping front and center but can't take away from the potent citrus dominance.
Hop juice 101. Tastes like it smells with the same combo of juicy citrus hops and tropical fruit which includes grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, clementine, lime, peach, blood orange, melon, orange juice and a pretty intense citrus bitterness. It's a sharp citrus taste like red grapefruit, yet not offensive to me. The malty backbone has wheat, toasted grains, dry biscuit, graham crackers, and then the earthy dry hops kicks in with tea leaf, dried flowers, dandelion, chalky yeast, fresh cut grass and a powdery texture which has cardboard aspects. The website lists Galaxy and Columbus hops used which smelled great, but sometimes double dry hopping brings too much dry earth to the party - I think that's the case here as the juicy citrus flavors fade and leaves a chalky malt/yeast residue. Tastes great, but the twang at the end deducts some style points on this landing. It's a real good beer, but my least favorite from Trillium to date. 1,593 charactersCHickman, Apr 20, 2017

While it doesn't match up to Tree House's brilliant brew, DDH Congress is awesome in it's own right. Very sharp hop aromas that carry onto the taste.

A: Golden orange, more or less the color of orange juice - super turbid and murky, as one would expect from any DDH Trillium offering - pours with a small white head, fades to a small cap, tiny collar, leaves a few streaks of lacing
S: Galaxy hops for days -  as in, pureed hop pellets - orange and grapefruit juice, oil - hop pellets, lightly spicy, grassy, leafy, herbaceous - dank and resinous - juicy, with some sharp peach, mango, and passionfruit - some light malts and bread at the base - dominant aroma, again, is hop pellets
T: Utterly saturated with hops - so much hop particulate that it almost pricks your mouth and throat, but that's not a complaint, it's just an observation - juicy tangerine, orange, grapefruit - pithy - dank, resinous, grassy, spicy, herbal hops - lightly woodsy - lots of tropical fruit, with some peach, mango, melon, passionfruit, berry skin - some light sweetness at the base, moderate bitterness, finishes with lingering spice from the hops
M: Medium body, smooth and chewy, finishes mostly dry
O: Yo dog I heard you like Galaxy hops
I've had DDH Congress before, but this is the first opportunity I've had to sit down and actually review it. And guess what? I stand by my previous claims that I prefer the standard Congress Street. Congress is bright and hoppy while still remaining beer-like. DDH pushes the boundaries, with a beverage that may have actually replaced the water in this beer with more hops... It's an experience. 1,492 charactersangrybabboon, Apr 15, 2017

I think I like regular Congress St better, the hops are cleaner and less green. It does have a good taste and aroma and a refreshing bitterness, maybe the hops lose character to me at such a high dry hop rate. 601 charactersHoppy_Time, Apr 04, 2017

16 oz. Can
Canned On: 03/06/17
Poured into a Tired Hands glass a very nice cloudy yellow color, very nice carbonation, with a very nice thick/creamy two-finger plus white head, which also leaves some very nice creamy sticky lacing behind. The nose is hoppy, slight malt note, very citrusy/fruit (pineapple, grapefruit, peach), with some nice diesel/dank. The taste is very nice hoppy, slight malt, citrusy/fruity (pineapple, grapefruit, peach), very nice diesel. Medium body, with a very nice dry/bitter finish. Overall, this is a very tasty brew. Addictive. I like these NE style IPAs, very tasty, quite different than a West Coast IPA. So smooth, go down so easily. My first Trillium! Thanks Bill! 764 charactersWasatch, Apr 02, 2017

Aroma was mostly pineapple. The taste was fantastic though. Went from big candied pineapple over to strong grapefruit pith without ever achieving an uninviting level of bitterness. Not much resin, and that's a good thing for my tastes. Really fun to experience.
Feel was soft with a bit of bite. Just a great 7% IPA. 440 charactersGabrielEVH, Mar 31, 2017

Big fan of the street series of beers but I just don't get the DDH versions.  They are so over saturated with hop flavor and aroma.  The negative aspects of over dry hopping start to take over.  This beer is very out of balance in my mind.  Can is two weeks old and it's still very green and  sharp.   Amazed a Brewery held in such high regards would actual release this. 462 characterswasatchback, Mar 31, 2017

Taste fully follows the nose and is just a perfect balance of hop bite, sweetness, and luscious creamy full complex taste. Can't get enough trillium. 402 charactersGambyt20, Mar 24, 2017

4.48/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a distinct orange juice like look, complete with the opaque, pastel orange color. The deviating factors from a typical orange juice look are the two fingers of white foamy head that retain well, before falling into a heavy ring of foam after a few sips. Lacing is tight and splattered about the glass well. Aroma is citrus, orange peel, with flowery hops, and a grainy backbone. Flavor profile is juicy, with absolutely no bitterness at all. Notes of citrus, orange, flowery hops, flour, and raw grain mingle to form a IPA that despite screaming "hops", remains brash with notes smashed all together. Mouth feel is a little fizzy, but otherwise medium in thickness and smooth. It feels just a little thinner than a pulp-free orange juice with a little bit of carbonation added. Overall, this beer has a lot going on to the point of being almost overwhelming. Surprisingly, the hop notes are rather muted in this beer. It's almost as if there are so many stuffed into each glass that various notes drown and suffocate each other out. 
Served in a 12oz snifter. 1,066 charactersHarrison8, Mar 19, 2017

4.74/5  rDev +3.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75This one is a true legend, straight off the Mount Rushmore of NEIPAs. It pours a milky peach color with Trillium's signature opaque neon haze. 
The cream colored head is substantial and leaves a unique patchy lacing. Aroma on this one is HUUUGE with notes of pineapple, tart apricot, orange rind, and pine tree air freshener. 
The taste opens up with a blast of delicious tropical fruit juice and stone fruits but quickly gives way to dank resinous pine notes that linger. There is just a touch of Town House cracker malts. 
The 7.2% is barely detectable and the extremely dry finish brings a delightfully prickly bitterness that may be a bit much for the uninitiated, although it's what seasoned IPA drinker's dreams are made of. Mouthfeel is full and creamy. 760 charactersSenatorSpaceman, Mar 15, 2017

I poured from a 16oz can into a snifter. Pours a hazy, orange-tinted amber color with a cream head. Honestly, the pour is one of this beer's best attributes, IMO. For being a DDH, the nose did not impress me. Big citrus notes and some bright hop characteristics as well, but lacking some of the floral bouquets I've experienced with other DH and DDH beers. This beer assaults your taste buds on the front-end, with a lot trying to happen all at once. Plenty of citrus (grapefruit, especially) followed closely by heavy, bitter hop notes that overpower any complexity that may have been trying to emerge. Finishes bitter, which is to be expected, and lingers for awhile. Feels drier than I was anticipating, but not a big deal to me, as I tend to enjoy a drier beer. Moderate carbonation, wish there was a bit more feel there. Overall, a good beer when compared to what's available on the market today, but didn't live up to the hype. Would prefer to try the original to see how it differs. 1,169 charactersumichfan, Feb 27, 2017

Appear: pours a milky hazy yellow gold.  about half a fingers worth of head that at first was pillow but then went to soap suds and then dissipated all in about 30 seconds.  
Nose: citrus peel some overripe tropical fruits mangoes pineapple guava maybe a little kiwi.  a little something green and resiny.  the nose is very reminence of a lot of galaxy hopped beers.  there's some a little like damp mildewy in alot of these beers.  I know that sounds so bizarre but it really is kind of what's going on in here.  Considering this is DDH I'm not very impressed with this nose.  
Taste: disjointed.  The taste follows the nose but it's not smooth.  The slight citrus and tropical fruit notes are then interrupted by by a harsh bitter bite that really isn't very flavorful.  
Mouth: thin.  Not what I'd be hoping for from a Trillium NE IPA.  disappointing.  
Over:  Disappointed.  I did a pretty big trade of Aslin and RAR for Trillium and every single one of the Street series beers has been lackluster or straight up disappointing.  Every recent release from Parish Brewing (Ghost, Opus, & DDH Envie)  crush this beer not even close.  I gave it a 3.5 because it's not bad it's just average. 1,267 charactersGumbo_gravy, Feb 02, 2017

Beautiful unfiltered orange color that just screams NE IPA love. Nose has some mango with a hint of dank, not a huge nose though.  Taste has apricot, mango and grapefruit. Slight bitter finish. Fairly dry versus juicy.  Very nice mouth feel. This is a very nice beer, but not sure I get the super high ranking. There are several Trillium offerings that I like a good bit more.  Maybe just my taste. 457 characters11-52_4hops, Dec 29, 2016

Taste is that with a bitter bite with a wheaty undertone. Feel is crazy full, coating your mouth. Overall it is a different take to the original. I would rate both near the same. I'm sure letting this mellow out a bit more might balance the beer more. A great beer worth looking into. 360 charactersDamasen, Dec 29, 2016

I think I like regular Congress Street more, but this is very good.  Well worth seeking out. 326 characterstigg924, Dec 23, 2016

Smells of peaches, mangos hint of pine spicey-ness almost reminiscent of the scent of Swish
The flavor profile is near perfect. Congress St. is my favorite trillium offering and the DDH actually adds a lot rather than just muddling the base beer -sweet mango, touch of almost nectarine with a very slight hint of malt
Fairly typical feel to trillium beers albeit less grassy than other ddh st. ipas
Overall lives up to the hype, could drink this everyday 500 charactersBeantownBrews, Dec 21, 2016

S: tons of passion fruit, mango, and grapefruit; melon.
T: pssionfruit, guava, maybe some persimmon and other tropicals, with an odd grassy note, followed by an bitter bite. 
F: a little astringent. Creamy, but thinner than a good NE IPA should be.
O: a very very fine beverage, but I prefer regular ol' Congress Street to this DDH version. With its grassiness and bitterness this was a less pleasurable drink, and considerably less balanced than other Trillium beers that I have had. 573 charactersNizzleEGizzle, Jul 07, 2016

4.15/5  rDev -9.4%look: 3 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours very, very thick and smoothy-like. I know this really upsets some people, and while I’ll admit it’s not the prettiest of styles it’s still not bad looking. Also maybe people just don’t care about appearance anymore, since it’s getting cooler and cooler to drink your beer right out of the can like some kind of goddamn animal. Anyhow, it looks like a orange and pineapple smoothie. If you told me they put oil paint in it, or that it was made out of melted halloween masks, I would believe you.
And the smoothie appearance apparently primes my peanut-sized brain into expecting it to actually smell like a smoothie, which it does not. It smells like a beer with a hoppy fruit profile, and while a majority of us beer people haven’t been close to anything to containing vitamins in years and so are easily fooled, this doesn’t *actually* smell like fruit juice. Only kinda sorta. And while it’s a pleasant hop profile, and while this type of fruity-hop-foward beer style is only like 18 months old, it’s already been played out to death. Props to Trillium for being really good in general, but I’ve had and forgotten brews from upstart shitheel breweries that are like 98% as good as this, even though those same brewers couldn’t make a decent amber or simple APA to save their worthless lives. That tells me that this type of beer, while enjoyable, ain’t exactly exceptional, even if it is slightly better than something an amateur could do and therefore in the “elite” tier of IPAs that taste like Wrigley’s Juicy Fruit.
Does this make me a curmudgeon, like those guys who give the appearance of this beer a 1.0 just because it’s so thick and hideous? Have my tastes calcified? M-maybe? I don’t know. Like I said, this isn’t bad. It’s good. I have gladly drank two bombers of it over the past week. It’s just not worthy of extraordinary plaudits, I don’t feel. 1,911 charactersmynie, Jun 30, 2016

The aroma brings tons of peach and mango with some mild grapefruit. Smells like a fruit smoothie.
The taste follows the nose with plenty of mango, peach, and pineapple notes. Has a nice pine finish.
The feel is incredibly smooth and creamy, with the perfect amount of dryness. Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Leaves a slight fruity tingle as it goes down.
Overall, a fantastic IPA. I honestly prefer the original but this is beautifully well done regardless. 558 charactersScaryEd, Jun 29, 2016

Aromas of amazing fruit sweetness, juicy and bright, with notes of passion fruit, orange juice, melon, pineapple, and mango. Wow! Flavors are very juicy forward, heavy on orange and mango, with a solid acidity to boot. Solid highlights of pineapple and melon, with subtle grassy hops characteristics. Big bodied, but with a dry, crisp undertone. The aftertaste is all juice, heavy on orange, but with solid tropical characteristics once again. Minimal bitterness, with a subtle acidity building into the slick, dry finish. Very tasty beer. Very juicy. 692 charactersGarthDanielson, Jun 29, 2016

A- pours a perfect light orange haze we fluffy foam. Defines my kind of NE IPA that I love. Great lacing on edges and a perfect look
S- perfect pineapple, tangerine, and tropical NE hops profile that has just enough piney scent to keep it away from being a juice bomb. All hop no malt dominance with just enough bitterness to round it out. Fresh, exciting, and bursting with citric tunes! Just about perfect
T- coating tropics of flavor! Enrobe the tongue with orange and completed pineapple flavors that follow with a piney bitterness. It's just enough to round it off. The galaxy is strong in this one
M- massive flavors paint your mouth
O- what a treat from trillium. A tropical IPA that doesn't cross over the juice line due to the resin and bitterness. This is how I love my all hop NE IPA's! Well done 842 characterslovindahops, Jun 28, 2016

S - A harmonious blend of dankness and citrus. Hop juice, hop oils, pine, grapefruit, peaches, and apricots.
T - Bitter up front with weed-like dankness with a transition to the acidic grapefruit and fresh-squeezed oranges. Pine and sap have supporting roles. The end has some doughy/bready malts and the finish goes back to the dankness.
F - So thick and creamy (giggity), but not a syrupy mess that plague bigger IPAs. Makes full use of its weight and abv. Has some dryness, but it's not a desert.
O - A superb combo of dank hops and citrus juice. Galaxy overload, but used to near perfection. 690 charactersThrewRedButter, Jun 28, 2016

Super hazy, orange juicy appearance. This is what a New England IPA looks like. Boom. BJCP  folks can roll their eyes now. Unreal aroma. Glorious. Guava, melon, dank hops, grilled pineapple, grapefruit, lemon rind. Fantastic flavor, following the aroma. Hop juice. Absolutely delicious. One of the best hoppy offerings I've had from Trillium. 362 charactersHuhzubendah, Jun 26, 2016

A: Beer comes in a light gold to almost dark yellow color with about a finger of pillowy soft head made of mostly tiny bubbles (with a few soapier ones mixed in). Head doesn't stick around too long, but a nice film of white foam ultimately takes up permanent residence on the liquid's surface. Full haze on this one--don't let the light color fool you; there isn't much of any light penetrating through. 
S: Straight freshly cut overripe pineapple doused in orange juice with a side of mango slices with a few resin-coated Galaxy hop pellets thrown into the mix for fun. The aromatic profile on this is top-notch, a wonderful showcase of Galaxy without much else getting in the way. It's pretty intense for the ABV, but not quite explosive. That being said, I'm really splitting hairs if I'm saying this beer doesn't smell absolutely fucking fantastic. Shit, I need to take a sip...
T: Alright. Pineapple, mango, papaya, tangerine, and grapefruit... Literally so many different fruits with the amp turned up to 110%. The flavor profile of this beer pretty much crushes that of every other beer. It's incredible that Trill gets all this solely from a liberal addition Galaxy hops.. It seriously tastes like a blended up bouquet of tropical and citrus fruits with a bit of resinous hop thrown in to remind you you're drinking beer. The grassy bitterness that was a bit overpowering on the fresh cans has definitely receded a bit; at 8 days post-canning, this is drinking damn near perfectly. And while the fruit flavors dominate most of the taste, the backend features this creamy, somewhat assertive malt character and a light fresh hop grassiness. I get that orange/mango/creamsicle note in spades on the last 20% of the taste, but it doesn't last too long, as that grassy bitterness comes in and dries out the tongue, leaving you ready for another sip waaay too quickly.
M: Creamy and smooth with a medium-plus weight. There's something about the mouthfeel on this one that really separates it from the other Trillium offerings. It feels way silkier as it moves across the tongue and finishes almost like a melted down, sugar-infused fruit creamsicle--that is, until a really nice smack of medium bitterness makes its presence known. The pungency of the bitterness has definitely subsided over the past week, but there's still a very resinous, somewhat pithy, even slightly tongue scrapy note that sits on the tongue and cleans up that fruit assault that just took place on your palate with a welcome dryness as well.
O: After a week in the can, this is just as good as I remember it and rivals Tree House Green as my favorite single IPA. It offers one of the most delicious flavor profiles I've ever experienced in a beer with the intensity of a 9% DIPA while drinking with a weight and feel that makes this crazily drinkable. The nose is similar to the flavor, but less intense, which is one of the only areas where I'd knock this beer. But overall, this is a real treat, the best work that Trillium has done on the hoppy beer front, IMO! 3,082 charactersavas, Jun 25, 2016

aroma is candied orange, nectarines, peppery pine, light grass, sweet fruity hops, earthyness, yeast, plastic dankness, bit of pine and some mineral and herbaceous notes.
Juicy notes of peach and tangerine orange- followed by grapefruit and citrus zest, very light crackery malt.  finishes on a dank piney note that is slightly resinous and has a touch of peppery spice to it. 
Overall this beer is very good. However it has not been completely consistent, and I have had bottles that were only good. However having recently tried it in cans I had to re review, and this beer  was an absolute pleasure to drink - god bless Trillium, god bless NE!! 723 charactersHyptochrons, Jun 24, 2016

After 2 weeks I figured it would still be 80-90% of what it was ... and this is why I get so frustrated with Trillium.  I finally get to try the hyped IPA only to be stabbed in the heart by an average taste.
Don't get the hype at all and maybe, just maybe, it is a slightly below average yield this time but I just don't get it.
The highs are high and the lows are very low with Trillium.  So sad. 435 charactersBEEPOP, Jun 19, 2016

Nice creamy foamy rich head with tons of messy lacing, solid color milk shake murky yellowish orange juice color.
Nose starts with pine resin, little sap earthy spicy hop, some tropical notes, fair citrus juicy orange rind, little pineapple, herbal thing too, lots of pith and orange cream, but mostly pine sap.
Taste brings some pine sap, resin, spicy earthy hops, chewy, mild tropical notes, pineapple, orange citrus and big zesty pith, orange cream, a little creamy malt, little bubblegum, tangy. Finish is big pine sap zest orange, tons of grapefruit pith fair bitterness lingering.
Mouth is med bod, little creamy decent carb.
Overall eh, I had huge expectations for this beer with all the hype, it had some nice galaxy tropical citrus, but not sure if a weird Columbus or they threw in mosaic to f with us but bad pine sap resin. Not happy! The supposed big Galaxy is left behind, so need to try this on tap or something sometime. 948 charactersjlindros, Jun 18, 2016

Finish is dry with plenty of lip-smacking hop goodness. Like a honey biscuit with orange-hop-marmalade generously applied. Amazing. 364 charactersRothobinide, Apr 04, 2016

4.61/5  rDev +0.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Opaque tan yellow with a finger of creamy head that recedes to an ever present, thin blanket with an abundance of wobbly, round peaks of lacing.
The powerful aroma reminds me of the first time I opened Pliny--not the specific characteristics, but the effect it has of perfuming the entire room with its teasingly amazing scent. Piña effing colada, all the way! This is so mouthwateringly, mesmerizingly, and seductively aromatic it's insane.
On the tongue is a flavorful bouquet of citrus tang and some sharp pine bitterness with a lemon pot de crème smoothing effect. Orangey fresh hops are powerfully present but not at all dank--the hops are the freshest, most vibrant possible without going into cannabis territory. The flavor doesn't exactly reach up to the same levels as the aroma, but all in all I can't really fault DDH Congress St for that, or anything else, because it's delicious.
Crisp, fizzy but substantial--not thin feeling at all. It's not as creamy and thick as it looks--the 100% opacity is more of a hop oil and turbid liquid presence than it is some kind of thickening agent. Juicy, not really dry, but excellent all the same. Alcohol is only detectable if you begin eating any food with this, which I strongly advise against. This beer is in its own class, and should be consumed all by its lonesome in order to enjoy it to the fullest. 1,363 charactersSabtos, Apr 02, 2016
4.85/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Bottle shared by Curran, thanks man.
This one pours a ridiculously hazy, slightly milky bright orange, with a good one inch head, and lots of lacing.
Smells so ripe and purely juicy, so much tropical and citrus fruits, I get orange, grapefruit, and mango, with lots of others as well. There is some underlying pine on the nose, too.
It tastes like that big tropical fruit basket I mentioned above, orange zest, grapefruit rind, mango flesh, with a nice rindy and piney bitterness on the finish. The flavor is cranked up just enough to be ridiculous, but it's not too much. This is just hops in their rawest and most wonderful form.
This is medium bodied, with a super juicy and creamy mouthfeel, and a good level of carbonation.
This might be the best thing yet from Trillium. Trilli-yum, amirite? 802 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 02, 2016

A: Pours a turbid light orange color with a half inch of snow white head.  The beer is completely impenetrable.  A few streets of lacing and pretty good retention: the thick ring of foam sticks around for most of the glass.
S: A relatively subdued hop aroma of orange, a little mango and papaya.  Nice, especially once it warms, but not quite the burst of hop aroma I was expecting from the DDH’ing (or a Trillium IPA in general).  
T: Orange, pink grapefruit, grapefruit pith, a hint of onion/garlic, finishing with a mild-to-moderate bitterness and a bit of sugar.
M: Medium-full body and medium carbonation.  Creamy and chewy, almost.  A bit big for an IPA.
O: Pretty tasty, but decidedly a notch below their best IPAs (like Melcher St and Vicinity). 812 characterspmarlowe, Apr 01, 2016

Smell - Total tropical fruit bomb. Pineapple, mango, grapefruit, hints of pine, orange, some peach 
Taste - Up front you get smacked with orange and pineapple juice. Some grapefruit and citrus in there as well. The finish is grassy, herbaceous and spice. 
Feel - creamy mouthfeel, slight burn on the backend similar to HH's Everybody Wants Citra. Believe it's from the yeast. 
Overall - Another complete juice bomb from Trillium! Delicious! 543 charactersTonyjenlasc, Mar 31, 2016

A:  Opaque yellow/orange with a half finger off-white head that slowly dissipated.  Foamy lacing.
S:  Tropical fruits explode on the olfactory with mango, oranges and grapefruit.  Then some pine resin slips in for the finish.
T:  Big and bold tropical flavors pop up hard and heavy; like drinking the perfect breakfast fruit juice. Oranges, peachesand  mangoes intertwine with pine and grapefruit.  (This is one of the few tastes I've actually ever given a 5).  Light bitterness on the finish.  
M:  Low to medium with medium carbonation.  The fruits are actually thick enough to roll around on the tongue.
O:  Luscious, heavenly, to-be-savored.  Trillium is a killer brewery.  Find some if you can and impress your friends. 774 charactersbrewskifan55, Mar 28, 2016

4.92/5  rDev +7.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5500th BA rating! Excellent beer to reach that marker with.
Pours a dull, hazy yellow-orange. Completely opaque and milky; less vibrant than some of the other hoppy Trillium beers I've had. Large head of soapy white bubbles and a generous amount of lacing.
I've never had the strongest sense of smell, but the nose here doesn't jump out of the glass quite as much as other hoppy offerings. That said, it's still incredibly inviting with both tropical and citrus fruit notes, backed by some pleasant green dankness. Not as aggressive a nose as I was expecting after drinking DDH Sleeper Street two days earlier.
Absolutely wonderful flavor profile. Citrus fruits such as oranges and nectarines are definitely front and center, but I'm getting tropical notes as well. There's also a creamy, fruit sherbet note that reminds me quite a bit of Tree House's Green. Come to think of it, this is pretty similar to Green. Definitely less musty and dank, and a little more citrus/orange juice forward rather than pineapple, however. A little bit of biscuity malt on the backend as well.
Super creamy mouthfeel with some very nice lingering bitterness. No alcohol whatsoever. I expected to find this beer assertive on the palate, much like DDH Sleeper Street was to me, but this is actually insanely drinkable.
Overall, I'm thinking this might be my favorite Trillium beer to date. I wouldn't say it's a huge improvement over standard Congress Street, but it's enough to push slightly past it. I've yet to taste anything less than exemplary from Trillium. 1,548 charactersTomMorris, Mar 24, 2016

Smell:  Melon and pineapple.
Taste:  Melange of hops, some juicy but a surprising amount of bittering hops.  Some pineapple in there but not as strong as the nose, some citrus fruits as well.
Feel:  A little more lingering bitterness than I prefer, but it is similar to the lingering bitterness after biting into a grapefruit.  Not overly harsh by any means.
Overall:  Fantastic beer, ranks up there with the dry hopped hoponius union and mass rising that I've had as great examples of what can be produced from this. 608 charactersNewport_beerguy, Mar 20, 2016

L - thick and creamy.  White head, perfect carbonation.
S - zesty and dank.  Heavy lemon and grapefruit zest.  Really getting the citrus bursting from the beginning
T - tons of pineapple, mango, and orange.  Maybe a little grapefruit and even some mango.  Just a ton of balanced flavors throughout and lingering forever it seems.  Amazing
F - creamy and juicy.  The creaminess cannot go understated, but done in such an amazing way for an IPA.
O - I was not thrilled with Congress Street as compared to the hype, ratings, and how much I love Trillium hops.  Being the base beer, I am amazed at the level of complexity and how much I love this beer.  Really one of the best IPAs I have ever had.  I will certainly seek this out again 820 charactersrabbott2, Mar 18, 2016

Pours a turbid, milky-orange hue with a loose, quarter inch, bright white head that dissipates towards the edges into a tight band.  Nose expresses juicy orange notes as well as a hint of earthy/piney notes.  Taste consistent with nose; however, the earthy/piney notes are more prominent in the flavor profile and coalesce with the juicy quality present in the nose.  A light medicinal bitterness lingers between quaffs.  Taste is light-medium in body with a carbonation shy of lively and an easy acidity that lightly stimulates the salivary glands towards the back of the mouth.  Overall, the nose on this beer is exceptional; however, the juicy quality in the flavor profile is not as prominent as I would have liked to see; however, this IPA is quite good and will appeal to many no doubt. 857 charactersJwale73, Mar 13, 2016

S: Undeniably tropical fruit forward.  Orange, mango, peach, papaya, and pineapple, its all there.  A very sweet aroma, like honey.  Very fragrant, I wish I had a car-freshener that smelled like this.
T: Very smooth, has a minty/peppery note on the aftertaste.  Crispy malt graininess.  Sweet, some bitterness but not in a way that is astringent.
F: Body is very full, yet it goes back easy.  Carbonation is pretty high, which makes the body feel much lighter and frothier.  Astringency is low-medium, even for an IPA.

The beer comes in a milky medium gold color. A pineapple smoothie. 
The aroma follows with orange, peach, mango, pineapple sorbet. Orange juice. Deep piney resins underlying this. Chemically dank.
The flavor follows with orange peel, bitter grapefruit juice, apricot, nectarine, then onto grassy and herbaceous takes over the beer after that initial assault, that even touches on being a touch spicy as the hops attack the palate. The mouthfeel is creamy, and medium to medium plus. The finish bitters on with lingering herbal qualities. 595 charactersdar482, Mar 09, 2016

Wow! I don't think I've ever seen a beer so hazy as DDH Congress Street. This is straight orange juice, a vibrant milky creamsicle orange body, it almost looks pulpy. So thick and cloudy that light cannot penetrate through the glass. ,
On the nose is straight fresh hop goodness.. this smells like when you just open a pack of hops, that natural, beautiful, potent, dank citrusy, bursting fruity, resinous, tropical heaven like you're walking through a hop field. Lots of tropical fruit, grapefruit, mango, creamy orange. 
On the tongue it's just as bright as the nose - bursting fresh hop acids, tropical fruit, pineapple, guava, mango, peach, followed by a resinous fresh hop zing, a zesty almost spicy concentrated hop flavor, orange creamsicle. This must have been dry hopped a ton, I don't think I've ever actually gotten a slight spicy burn from the sheer amount of hop resins. Light bitter resinous aftertaste.  Creamy mouthfeel, medium low carbonation.
THIS IS HOP JUICE..
This is a straight masterpiece - if you're looking to experience a HUGE amount of flavor and aroma from a massive amount of dry hopping, try this beer. 1,261 charactersgcamparone, Mar 05, 2016

Pours a turbid dark gold with a dense creamy white foam head. Smells like mango, peach, nectarine, pineapple, orange juice, cantaloupe, with dank earthy grass and pine. Tastes like fresh pine with peach, plum and nectarine, mild mango and pineapple come through with fresh orange, some dank earthy grass with a bitter dry finish. Feels thick and creamy, medium-full bodied with low carbonation. Overall an outstanding double dry hopped IPA. 468 charactersStoutElk_92, Mar 04, 2016

S - Delicious, passionfruit, mango, citrus and of course, floral earthyhops. 
T - Juicy, just like the smell with a medium bite at the end. Piney resiney hops w the tropical notes mesh so noice. 
MF - soft, delicate, low carb, perfect. 5.
O -  god damn if this isn't a fine beer. brav-fucking-o and I bought it at a store too, not the brewery. Trillium doing great things. 499 charactersbeantown_hopster, Mar 03, 2016

Super hazy and vibrant orange with nearly 2 fingers of white head. Love the aroma, super intense, and jumps from the can and glass. Tons of peach, mango, cantaloupe, nectarine, orange rind, pineapple, and some grapefruit. Starts super juicy then turns moderately  bitter with a bit of a bite in the finish.Medium-ish body, moderate carbonation. Excellent beer, outrageously drinkable, might my new favorite beer. I wish that I had picked up a few more 4 packs, I could drink this all day.

Holy haze batman! I've said that some Trillium brews look like Orange juice but this one tops them all. It strongly reminds me of the OJ that I used to get out of a machine in the dining hall in college; it's very turbid with a minimal frothy white head. Great aroma bursting with mango, pineapple, some grapefruit, and pine underneath. Taste is lots of tropical fruit with slick resiny pine and a fairly noticeable alcohol presence in the moderately bitter finish. Solidly medium body with moderate carbonation. Overall this is a good but not great beer; it started out with a great aroma but fell off a bit in the taste with the flavors being a bit disjointed. I picked up a bottle and I think I'll let it mellow out in the fridge for a week or two to see how it comes together. 1,413 charactersmnj21655, Mar 02, 2016

The nose is not as big as other Trillium brews like Artaic but it is still fantastic with citrus fruits, orange and tropical fruits/melon in the back end. The beer itself is juicy and super easy to drink. I easily went through my first glass in no time. Really refreshing with flavors of orange peel, orange juice, melon and finished with a very soft restrained bitterness. 465 charactersW_Des, Aug 30, 2015

Pours a murky yellow-orange with a foamy bone head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Foamy patches of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, tropical fruit, and earth aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, tropical fruit, and earth flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer that is tasty, but the hop aspects come through slightly better in the smell to me.

4.35/5  rDev -5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5this phenomenal and rare beer comes to me by great generous courtesy of philbolt, a fellow BA from across the country that was far too kind with his access to cool beer that before now only existed in my dreams. thanks new friend! this is a hectic brew, totally east coast. looks like a vermont one with its hazy beige color, thick and yeasty looking, lovely head on it, but man, this is cloudy and dense beyond the level of even the other east coast monsters, almost looks less refined, intense, no light passing through this milky brew. the smell is its best feature, i wish they said which hops were used, but i can only stab at that, its super floral and citrusy both, short of tropical, but i get fresh cut pineapple, tangerine, even lemongrass in here. the malt base is odd. seems like it almost has to be wheat centered, but the texture isnt there all the way, and its hard to pick out what else is in here, maybe oats with all this density. it has a remarkable hop flavor to it too, scaled back just a little from the smell, but its pungent and different, and taste like something hill farmstead would make, or has made. the process here is very cool, and i immediately want to know more. i think it came through just a bit heavy for perfection, yeasty and really viscous for the style, and where it flatters some of its peers, its overdone here by a small margin that makes it a slower drinker and a weird one all in all. very awesome to taste this beer ahead of my trip to boston next week where i will surely get my hands on some more of their stuff, and its really exciting to get to taste beer like this out here. thanks again philbolt, looking forward to sharing a beer with you in real life! 1,706 charactersStonedTrippin, Jul 04, 2015

t/m/o - as suggested by the look and smell, taste also resembles orange juice and tropical fruit juice of that family. another homerun from trillium in the ipa family. 400 characterscosmicevan, Jul 03, 2015

A: Milky pale orange body under an imposing head of white froth. Spectacular retention and lacing. Gorgeous unfiltered IPA.
S: Intense hoppiness, with orange, kumquat, mango, and pine. Fan freaking tactic. 
T: Follows the nose, gloriously. Rich, mouth-filling hop extravaganza. Tropical fruit, herbal resin, and citrus. Long, mildly bitter, resinous finish. Delightful. 
M: Soft, smooth medium body with light carbonation. Great. 
O: One of the best IPAs I've ever had. Truly stunning.

Or you could call it a peachy body.  The coolest looking body in a beer I have seen.  No movement, nothing, just stillness.  The white head is fine, dense, fluffy, and sticky, .  Impressive.  
Smell:  Sweet pineapple with a sharp hop aroma.  Candied tropical fruit and cotton candy.  Impressive.  
Taste:  Soft flavors that standout.  Hopped up.  Sweet pineapple, the perfect amount of hops, candied tropical fruit and cotton candy.  Alcohol is almost undetectable...mild.  Short-medium finish.  The taste described by my wife - "Yummy!"   
Feel:  Medium body.  Medium carbonation.  Smooth and velvety on the palate.   
Overall - This beer looks outlandish, and It seems to melt in my mouth.  I have given this beer the most fives I have ever given a beer.  This is the best IPA in my book.  The new standard.  Impressive. 911 charactersmabermud, Jun 24, 2015

Once in the glass it is closer to orange juice than beer.  This is the hoppiest beer I've ever come across, the tropical aromas just fly out of the glass.  The taste is 100% american hops with massive tropical notes.  Full bodied it is exceedingly smooth for such a hop bomb.  Simply, this is the best IPA I've ever had. 427 charactersCTFalcon, Jun 23, 2015

The smell was great as soon as I popped the bottle, however I was a little let down with the taste. Maybe my expectations were off but it just didn't hold up next to some of the other NE ipa's I have had recently. Obviously we are all spoiled on here in terms of having great beers 1 after another, so im sure this is just another case of splitting hairs but at the end of the day this wouldn't crack my top 10 ipa's 444 characterscalitrie1486, Jun 14, 2015

4.77/5  rDev +4.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75042015. The definition of unfiltered. You could see it in the bottle before pouring. Beautiful orange gold color with a massive white head. Such an amazing bouquet of fresh, ripe tropical fruit, flowers, hops, a bit of sap and pine. But this is mostly fresh mango and pineapple. Same with the flavor/taste. I wish this bottle would never end. Feel is slightly dry and bitter but absurdly drinkable. Hop juice is what this is. If you didn't know any better, you would drink this until passing out thinking it was not beer. Top notch quality stuff. Up there with the best "New England IPAs" (which is dominating the craft beer scene at the moment) and has the same qualities as Hill Farmstead. Price is a bit steep at $12 for a 750ml but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Thanks to judkinst again! YDM! 803 charactersGatch, May 13, 2015

The unbelievable smell quickly kicks that notion to the curb though.  This is right in the sweet zone of that "Vermont Nose" that is just about my favorite thing going in beer at the moment.  Lots of fruit (mango/pineapple is how I think of this - though you could probably find a whiff of just about any tropical fruit if worked at it a bit) as well as very fresh, green, cannibis tinged hops.  The taste is much more the latter than the former. 
I don't think I like this quite as much straight Congress Street, which is just about perfect as far as I'm concerned, but it's absolutely delicious just the same. 763 charactersmeefmoff, Apr 22, 2015

Super hoppy aroma: peppery, green, and dank.
Flavor follows: this is the greenest, hoppiest, dankest brew I've ever had. Unreal.  It's like chewing on a hop flower.
Mouthfeel is unreal. This is a creamy, thick brew, with flavor that comes across as a DIPA at the ABV of a single IPA.
If you want a green, vegetal, hop cone IPA, you have to try this.  It's absolutely incredible. It's so purely hop-focused it's honestly hard to rate. 553 charactersRoguer, Mar 25, 2015

4.75/5  rDev +3.7%The beer pours some bubbly white head that takes a while to dissipate. The beer leaves a lot of lacing. The beer itself is a hazy yellow with some very light orange notes. The beer smell has some very strong citrus fruits with a hint of pine and resine. The citrus notes consist of lemon and orange and hints of papaya. No malt notes to speak of. The beer taste is different than the smell and very juicy. The hops are very strong with mainly orange and pine notes with the other citrus notes being very subtle and dominated by the orange and pine. Bitter aftertaste. The mouthfeel is medium bodied but very soft and bubbly and very refreshing despite the carbonation. Overall, a fantastic beer from Trillium and worth getting. This has to be the best offering overall. 769 charactersHattedClassic, Sep 11, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +3.7%A - Two fingers of dense, white head.  Hazy body the color of a blend of pulpy OJ and grapefruit juice.  Great lacing.
S - Sharp grapefruit. Candied tropical fruit notes. Apricot and citrus.
T - Again with sharp grapefruit.  Tropical fruits.  Intense citrus.  Bitter, slightly grassy finish.
M- Medium-high carb.  Not as full bodied as Congress St.  But like Congress St. it's not sticky at all and the bitterness makes for a clean finish.
O- Excellent dry-hopped brew.  I enjoyed the M more on Congress St., but otherwise this variant is just is good if not better with regards to complexity of smell and taste. 616 charactersAirBob, Sep 09, 2014

A- Very hazy straw-yellow body. When I say hazy, I mean it. Two finger white head with great hang time. Drops eventually into a thick collar with a thin film on top. Lacing is left throughout. [4.25]
S- Hops galore. It's almost overwhelmingly resinous. At the same time, there is plenty of tropical fruit juiciness on the nose; almost overwhelming the base beer's citrus. Sweet caramel in the background. This smells like a Hill Farmstead beer in the sense that it's clearly hopped up and very resinous with the malt backbone being barely just enough to balance out the hop aromas. [4.5]
F- Excellently hop-forward with a lot of peach and mango up front, citrus in the middle, and a quite bitter pineapple finish. Throughout all of this, the malt backbone offers up a small bit of resistance- sweet caramel and biscuits. [4.5]
M- Medium bodied, soft yet substantial mouthfeel that starts out incredibly bitter and resinous and oily; making you think it was overhopped, if that were possible. Then after a few sips, the bitterness recedes, the finish becomes drier and the juicy hops come forward. [4.5]
O- Excellent IPA that is obviously hopped up but surprisingly seems to evolve over the short time it spends in my glass. Reminds me a lot of a Hill Farmstead pale ale- tons of hop aromas and juiciness with as little pale malt the brewer can get away with and a soft, velvety mouthfeel to boot. Highly recommended. [4.5]

This one cold conditioned in my fridge for a few weeks, a whole lot of chunks and sludge left in the can ... poured it out into a smaller glass and it was not pretty at all. Even then this beer did not clear up much at all, perhaps on the edges some light comes through. Smells of guava, white peaches, mint, pine, orange pith, and some breadiness within. A little chewy with an ample hop bitterness, lots of pungent citrus and piney flavors. Grassy with some pineapple skin, green tea, and grapefruit rind. Slightly warming, smooth and a bit slick on the palate. Lingering bitterness stays on the palate, not much way of the malt other than a kiss of breadiness. 
Wish this was a bit more clean, much prefer the single dry-hopped versions and obviously the original. 875 charactersJason, Sep 05, 2014

4.55/5  rDev -0.7%Drank from a 25.4 fl oz (750 ml) bottle purchased at Trillium Brewing Company, Boston, MA
Served in a pint glass
Super turbid appearance. The opaque, dull straw yellow liquid was topped by an inch-tall, creamy, frothy, off-white crown. The head quickly faded to a thin, resilient cap. Spotty drops of lacing clung to the glass.
The aroma was outstanding. Super fruity and bright. Very tropical with intense passionfruit notes. Guava was noticeable. Loads of peaches and apricots. Good amount of ruby red grapefruit. Moderately sweet. 
The flavor profile was amazingly hoppy and fruity as well, but a bit more pithy and dry than the nose. Super citrusy. Grapefruit dominated. Lots of orange peel. Passionfruit and mango appeared up front. Touch of pinesap on the back end and in the finish. Some bitter, grapefruit rind-like notes came through in the finish as well.
Fantastic mouthfeel. Fluffy, soft and slick on the palate. Ultra creamy and smooth. The liquid contained a super fine, plush effervescence.
Double Dry Hopped Congress Street is a terrific IPA that shows a noticeable improvement over the base beer. Of the recent Trillium limited release bottles (Galaxy Fort Point Pale Ale, Heavy Mettle and this beer), I would probably rate this as my least favorite of the three. That said, it is still better than 99% of IPAs I have ever tried. 1,351 charactersDamian, Sep 01, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +3.7%Appearance - Hazy golden brew with tangerine tint.  Frothy head, and just looks hoppy
Smell - Lots of tropical and citrus fruits.  Mango and orange dominated my nostrils.  Slight pine in my final whiffs
Taste - very smooth and slight graininess with sweet and bitter fruits.   Actually get a little nectarine and virtually no intense bitterness  although it grows with each sip
Mouthfeel -  Nice and dry with a touch of sweetness from the hops.  It has just enough body to hold up to the obvious late boil aand dry-hop additons.
Overall - great version of a ubiquitous style.  Very delightfully drinkable.  Extremely hoppy without being a palate destroyer.  Look forward to more beers from this gem of a brewery 715 charactersfatsnowman22, Aug 31, 2014
4.52/5  rDev -1.3%750 mL bottle purchased at Trillium. Poured into a HF wine glass at 39F
Reviewed using the old scoring system.
A: 4.25 Foamy white head 1.5" thick with full carbonation.  Cloudy to murky straw colored body with fine carbonation. Head regenerates with gentle swirling. Fine lacing remains on the glass.
S: 4.50 Overwhelming dank hops with notes of pine and resin. Citrus fruits so present in the standard Congress Street are less obvious here. Notes of peach and papaya. Malt backbone remains muted.
T: 4.50 Juicy, piney hops all the way. This screams West Coast IPA. Loving that n east coast brewery can make this. Pineapple and mango flavors areresent but subservient to the hops. Lingering bitter aftertaste, but pleasant. Missing the dryness of standard Congree Street.
M: 4.00 Very sticky and oily. This coats the mouth and lingers. Good carbonation balances the richness. Nrmally, I prefer a clean finish, but the hoppy remnants work here
O: 4.75 Glad to see the east coast representing a West Coast IPA style so well. This is a nice improvement on an already great beer. Highly recommended. 1,102 charactersF2brewers, Aug 31, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.2%Poured from a 750 ml bottle into a pint glass, bottled yesterday.  My first impression of this was "liquid gold" and "Trillium has knocked this one out of the park".  Super fresh, super tasty, perfect mouthfeel, perfect head - just doesn't get much better.  Note that the optimal temperature for this liquid gold is just a few degrees below typical refrigerator temp.
If Trillium decides to can this in black and silver quasi psychedelic cans, it will compete with the best from our northern VT neighbors.  
This is a frigging great beer!!

4.61/5  rDev +0.7%Double Dry hopped Congress Street...can it improve upon an exceptional base beer? It pours a turbid yellowish color. Well-set head is white and frothy. Head leaves bubbly lacing remnants. Nose is dominated by tropical fruit hops and I am far from surprised. Fruit-hop perfume. Mango, pineapple and peaches in the nose. Some mild green onion (which I pick up a lot in Trillium's beer and which I love).  Sweet citrus flesh, mango and even some pear. The flavor is dominated, again, by wet, ripe, juicy, fruity, hoppiness. Squishy pineapple and juicy melons. Some grass and soft green onion. Peach and apricot. Fruit smoothie. Pale malt cushion. Dry, not overly bitter finish, yet the bitterness, albeit it modest does linger. Soft carbonation. Hop oils. Almost a cask-esque feel. Trillium's new releases have been an exhilarating experience. Very happy I bought four of these. Long live the brewers in Fort Point!
Enjoyed from a bottle. 936 charactersVelvetExtract, Aug 23, 2014

4.83/5  rDev +5.5%Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a willibecher. This was bottled yesterday, and picked up from the brewery an hour ago.
Appearance: Pours a very, hazy, opaque peachy amber, and leaves a couple fingers of white head that fade at a medium pace to a white layer atop the beer (4.6)
Smell: The smell is dominated by big peach, apricot, pineapple, mango and citrus. There is also just a hint of some grassy aromas. (4.9)
Taste: Big citrus (especially grapefruit) take the lead in this one. It's all hops, but is surprisingly un-bitter. There is a bit of pineapple and mango as well, along with a dash of peach. Really juicy and really refreshing. Amazingly smooth finish. (4.9)
Mouth-feel: Medium to well carbonated with a medium, creamy, smooth body. You can almost feel the pulp (semi-joking, because there is no pulp). (4.6)
Overall: This is a unique IPA for me - this captures all the great fruity characteristics of the hops without being overly bitter or sweet. It is refreshing, delicious and very well crafted. (4.9) 1,024 charactersResuin, Aug 21, 2014
