3.59/5  rDev -20.6%look: 3.25 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75On-draught @ my favourite bar in NYC.
Currently, this has a 100 on Beeradvocate, and is #57 in the Top 250.
Notes are regrettably brief given a bar environment.
APPEARANCE: Hazy orange body. Soft creamy white head. Thick coating of lacing adheres to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.
AROMA: Very faint and muted, actually. Pale malts, citrus, a hint of yogurty tang.
Aromatic intensity is surprisingly low. Quite a reticent beer aromatically.
TASTE & TEXTURE: Coating, smooth, wet, refreshing, tangy. Perfect carbonation. Medium-bodied. Soft.
Taste is less well executed than the mouthfeel. Flavours of yogurty tang, faint citrus, and pale malts. None of the juiciness and orange flesh vividness I love about Citra hops is showcased here. Still, it's quite well balanced even if it lacks intricacy and adequate depth.
Hop-emphatic without being bitter.
OVERALL: Undeniably good, though I think counting it amongst the best imperial IPAs currently brewed is a bit optimistic. I'm glad I got to try it, and it's ludicrously drinkable, but it isn't mindblowing work and fails to showcase the more impressive characteristics of the Citra hop in my opinion. Hill Farmstead erases any bitterness from this Citra-hopped ale, but some concomitant bitterness is desirable in an (imperial) IPA in my opinion.
Absolutely worth trying, but far from incredible or world-class.

3.89/5  rDev -13.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75On-tap @ As Is in NYC. Notes from 3/22/2017.
Light amber and hazy with a soft, creamy white head sitting on top.  Orange, grapefruit and peach make up a fruity and floral aroma. Smooth citrus flavor. Although it's difficult to pick up any malt flavors, it's clearly there providing a substantial base for the hops to be showcased. Bitter at the tail end, creamy and full without becoming too heavy. No sign of alcohol despite the 8% ABV. 
Overall, I wasn't wow-ed like I thought I would be. A citrus-forward beer with restraint, but a little too much so. That being said, what a rare treat to be able to walk into a bar in the city and drink this without having to trek to rural Vermont. NYC drinkers, you are fortunate indeed.

Pours very hazy golden orange color with a 1-2 finger dense white head with fantastic retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Awesome webby soapy lacing clings around the glass. Fantastic appearance. Aromas of huge tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange zest, light pine, honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange zest, light pine, honey, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Light pine/grassy/citrus peel bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, orange juice, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, guava, berries, lemon/orange peel, light pine, honey, bread, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; with a fantastic malt/bitterness balance, and zero lingering hop astringency after the finish. Slight dryness from lingering bitterness, lightly increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-plus body; with a very smooth, moderately creamy/bready, and lightly silky/sticky balanced mouthfeel that is fantastic. Slight resin/rinds near the end of the glass. Zero warming alcohol for 8%. Overall this is a world class DIPA! All around insane complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/fruity hops and moderate bready malt flavors; very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV, thanks to the smooth/mellow bitterness. Super dank, juicy, and vibrant on hop flavors; great malt balance without feeling sweet or heavy for the ABV. An absolutely mind blowing offering. 2,067 characterssuperspak, Mar 25, 2017

Pours a hazy light orange.
Smell is grassy, with great lashings of mango and pineapple.
Taste is soft and tropical. Mango and pineapple blends with a great burst of hoppy bitterness.
Mouthfeel is soft and smooth, maybe slightly low on carbonation.
Once again Hill Farmstead deliver a great hoppy brew. This is so well balance and drinkable. Great stuff. 390 charactersJamFuel, Mar 14, 2017

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My favorite HF hoppy beer!
Tapped/filled growler on 2/22, drank on 2/25.
Look was a very pretty cloudy/hazy dark orange. 
Smell hit me from a foot away when I popped the growler. The citra hops are beautiful on this! Strong mango, melon, tangerine, grapefruit, peach. I spend a lot of time just smelling this.
Taste was great also. All of the aroma points, but not so much the melon. Very easy-to-drink, and very pronounced citra flavors.
Very smooth. No sharpness on the aftertaste. Almost sticky in your mouth. 
Overall, this is quite easily one of my favorite hoppy beers, and certainly my tops from HF's hoppy offerings. I wish HF canned their IPAs/APAs to make them more accessible. I want this beer a lot more! World class! 729 charactersraspy22, Feb 27, 2017
4.54/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy, almost milky, pale yellow with a rich frothy two finger head that slowly dies down. Very nice lacing.
The aroma here is big on orange and lemon zest. Lighter bits of peach. It definitely leans more into the fruity aspects than the herbal ones but there is a tinge of lemongrass. It's also got a little bit of cattiness but nothing disruptive.
Taste is sweet up front, actually right up until the grapefruit bitterness kicks in, it's sweet. I note the sweetness first because it takes all the fruit flavors and makes them candy flavors. Like the nose, it's orange lemon and peach, in the mode of orange creamsicle, the lemony flavors are sharp and almost come across as tart. The herbaherbal cattiness comes through for a blip with the bitterness.
The mouthfeel is light to medium bodied, very smooth, slightly sticky, and a crisp and biting carbonation although the carbonation is a smidge low (could be attributed to growler format).
Overall this is one of those first brews from a brewery that hooks you and makes you say 'Okay I'm going there and trying everything.' If they excute as many styles as they brew as good as this, they are a superb brewery (and I hear they do). This is a very well made beer, perhaps a bit sweet for my taste buds, but I can sip this all day 1,292 charactersHoppy_Time, Feb 27, 2017

4.25/4/4/4.25/4.5
Murky brown and yellow, muddy, with a finger and half of tight head. Heavy lacing. 
It smells, predictably, like loads of fresh, citrusy-sweet hops. A lot of the hop scents on HF's beers tend to be muddled and thick, but powerful. Same here, with a smack of wheat alongside the grapefruit. 
Yum! It's weirdly not obviously hoppy. More balanced than anticipated, and fruit sweet, tropical. Drying endtaste is the only tipoff of incredibly pleasant bitterness. 
Expectedly balanced, and well-crafted, with more of the fruity top notes of Citra than the citrusy ones. Minimal detectable bitterness. On point. Highly recommended. 668 charactersAgentMunky, Sep 07, 2016

Aroma is very familiar. Mostly citrus fruits. Tangerines and oranges. Not overwhelming aroma, but solid nonetheless. Smells very similar to many other citra hopped beers. Taste is citrus as expected with a touch (a very slight touch) of dankness. Goes down easy as none of the flavors overwhelm. There is just enough to let you know it's a highly hopped beer without destroying your palette. I'm not getting any bitterness whatsoever. Mouthfeel is medium and soft. Pretty much perfect as always from Hill Farmstead. This is a very good beer, but I think it's just a tick below the other great HF IPA's and IIPA's that I've tried. 734 charactersdaudelin2000, Aug 06, 2016

A: Pours a nice hazy amber orange with a thick two-finger head. 
S: Almost candy-like Tropicana orange juice aromas. Dangerously appetizing. 
T: Citra overload. Orange, tangerine, grapefruit. Citrus pith on the end. Incredibly juicy, though a bit one dimensional in the fruity quality.
M: Super smooth until the finish when the medium citric bitterness hits. Unbelievably drinkable for 8%.. Not a hint of alcohol. 
O: My first of hopefully many from Hill Farmstead, I'm damn impressed. After being lucky enough to have some Alchemist, Tree House, and Trillium over the past few days, Double Citra holds its own against all of them. 653 charactersavas, Jul 10, 2016

This one tastes like bad orange juice. is that a thing? it tastes like oranges that were juiced too young to be juiced and are a little too tart and not juicy enough.

The taste is amazing, grapefruit forward, and some bitterness, but very sweet.  Also tastes and smells of candied orange, honey melon, and sweet honey.
All around great beer, would absolutely seek it out if available. 433 charactersedward_boumil, Jun 26, 2016

4.14/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Like a floating, cloudy orange orb, with a large, fluffy head leaving a thick, creamy blanket and tons of wavy lace.
This smells really fruity, but also gives off a very tart, almost acetic aroma as well, but not quite on the sour scale. This is a very complex nose. Double Citra is herbal and floral yet dank. Powerful and delicate aromas all at same time competing for attention yet not overtaking one another. Pine, with verdant green foliage, berries, oats, straw, mint, spent grain, limeade. In the end, I began thinking margarita.
I taste graham, pine, with a bit of yeast heat on the back end. Mostly, the hops shine here without trying to mimic any of the aromas I've described that might recall actual fruit, although maybe I'm detecting some peach, kiwi, and wild mint.
Obviously, the aromas on this one were the focal point for me, there was so much going on and it really is the showcase. While you can find them in the flavor, they aren't as present. Overall Double Citra, as you might expect from Hill Farmstead, is very balanced, drinkable and soft on the palate. 1,081 charactersSabtos, Jun 24, 2016

4.38/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25On tap at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury. Served in a tulip glass:
Appearance: bright golden-orange color, slightly hazy, with a super thick white head on top. Dissipates slowly, leaving a foam circle on top. Some carbonation visible through little bubbles.
Aroma: powerful and pungent aroma of citrus peel, tangerine, and tropical fruit. Very little malt, basically all hops.
Taste: slightly sweet and juicy, but also packed with tons of lemon-y, citrus flavor. Maybe a touch of light malt, but it's mostly all hops, with the Citra packing tons of lemon zest, fresh pineapple, and orange. Not much in the way of bitterness, it's all juice here.
Feel: full-bodied and smooth as silk, with no heat to speak of or booziness. 
Overall: Hill Farmstead makes some of the best hoppy beers in the world. This is no different. 821 charactersTheElectricOne, Jun 18, 2016

Another great balanced beer from Hill Farmstead worth picking up when available. 364 charactersTrevor11, Apr 03, 2016

Mellow, well-rounded and extremely pleasant aroma combining citrus, floral, and tropical elements. Melon rind, mango, grapefruit, peach and tangerine.
Nice, firm and assertive hop derived tartness. Dry without being puckering so with a rather soft body. 
Taste is sweet and tart; a cross of tangerine with blood orange. Peach nectar and lychee on back with some grapefruit peel. Underlying honey malt sweetness throughout sets a very good contrast. 517 charactersorcrist_cleaver, Apr 03, 2016

L. Light copper orange with a 2 finger head and sticky lacing. Full haze. 
S. Citra jumps right up at you with a good amount of pine with a ton of tropical fruit notes. 
T. Some bitterness up front with a nice sweet finish. Very well balanced and quite complex. 
F. Medium mouthfeel with same carbonation. 368 charactersDopen993, Mar 30, 2016

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Growler fill poured into a HF bulb glass. The color is a yellowish-orange with a decent amount of cloudiness. The pour formed a small amount of white, fluffy head. There is substantial lacing as you get through the glass. The aroma is awesome; smell of ripe citrus juiciness. Sort of reminded me of Tree House Juice Machine. The taste is definitely juicy with tangerine, orange, mandarins, mango and other citrus fruits. There isn't much alcohol evident with this one. Medium body and low carbonation. Mouth feel is definitely smooth. Overall, there aren't many beers that are better than this in my opinion. This is an excellent beer and an amazing example of how the citra hop should be utilized. Cheers! 706 characterstregan_20, Mar 29, 2016

So amazing a wound up getting a 64 growler and shared it with some friends (it solidified my friendships even more) and just enjoyed an amazingly great beer.

A: Pours a very cloudy orange. Tall, fizzy light tan head. Great head retention but very little lacing. 
S: Well, typical citra. Lots of tropical fruit. Pineapple, citrus, mango, yum. Sweet, like candied fruits.
T: More of the same. Sweet candied tropical fruits up front. Grainy, bready malt and then a good-sized wave of bitterness leading into the finish. Drying, bitter floral and herbal characteristics with hints of that tropical fruit. Long lingering bitter aftertaste with perfume and herbal flavors. 
M: Full, soft and smooth mouthfeel. 
O: Nice. Pretty much what you'd expect from a single hop citra brew. Tropical fruit is everywhere and quite sweet, juxtaposed with a super dry and bitter aftertaste. Works out quite well. Typical HF soft and smooth mouthfeel lends excellent drinkability. 843 charactersDope, Nov 10, 2015

I knew I would probably love this given that Citra is my favorite hop and I love the handful of HF IPAs/APAs/DIPAs that I have had.  However, the 3 times I had this in the past 2-3 weeks (on tap at the Jeffrey and at Milk and Hops in NYC, and from a 32oz HF growler picked up and sent to me by SDRedDevil) it was so delicious that I literally had to force myself to not just drink the whole thing in one sip.  So delicious and nice dry finish with just the slightest bit of hop bitterness on the back end that just makes you want to take another sip right away before you even put your glass down.  Definitely one of the handful of beers I can honestly say that I wouldn't mind if I could only drink that and no other beer for the rest of my life.  Definitely the best hope beer from HF of the handful I have had (Edward, Susan, Harlan, Abner, S&S 4), there really isn't anything I would really change about it! 917 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Oct 01, 2015

The color is peachy golden hued with moderately thick hazed appearance and thick ring of white head with fine beads and lasting lace clinging as a film on the glass. The smell is pretty great with nice herbal quality not as grapefruit/tropical as some Citra beers but very nice hop smell and perhaps a light spice element. The feel is very tangy with medium high carbonation, just right bitterness and mostly dry finish.
 This is one of the double IPA's I have been looking forward to since most do not focus on a single hop and this is all I Imagined perhaps a little less enjoyable than the Galaxy but still has a great hop profile with slight citrus herbal and mildly spiced accent with almost no alcohol detectable. I would love to have this again ...I didn't have the chance since it was not available at the brewery but I would recommend getting this if you are a fan of citra hops. 986 charactersSlatetank, Sep 28, 2015

Pour - golden haze
Smell - not great at identifying smells yet, but the citrus comes out fast
Taste - I'm usually not a fan of the double IPAs, but this one was different. the sweetness of it masks the bitterness nicely and makes it much more drinkable. nice balance of everything, but citrus does take charge
Overall - amazing choice even if you're not a bitter fan 448 charactersChrisP802, Sep 27, 2015

4.53/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5This beer pours a beautiful hazy honey color, murky and unfiltered, can already tell this is gonna be full of flavor. The smell is pretty spot on for what you would expect from something named double citra. Tons of citrus on the nose, lemon, orange, grapefruit, kumquat, lots mores, just a juicy smelly beer. The taste doesn't disappoint either. You get hit with a wave of citrus, sweet orange, slight lemon, some tropical fruit, maybe slight sour apple, can't really put a descriptor to it, but man oh man the citrus here is amazing. A nice breads malt balances the flavors perfectly, making for a beautifully balanced beer. My only complaint is slight, but I definitely think the use of citra as a bittering hop is a bit fruitless, leaving some bitterness on the table, but for single hop citra, they squeezed out some decent bitterness. The mouth feel, as you would expect, is fantastic. Creamy, mouth coating, almost like a cloud in your mouth, and goes down so smooth. Like your drinking a fresh squeezed orange juice. This is my first HF brew, and the hype makes sense now. Not the best hoppy beer ive ever had, but easily in the top 10. 1,143 charactersDustin_Sallitt, Sep 27, 2015

As most HF hops, this has an amazing hazy body that is so bright. Nice fluffy head that lasts and lasts. The smell on this beer is out of this world! First sip is an explosion of citrus, orange peel, grapefruit. Nice hop character follows through and just keeps you coming back for more. The body mirrors its appearance and it has a great mouthfeel. I had massive expectations for this beer when I made the trip and it surpassed them. Truly an exceptional beer and a must try bucket list type of beer for everyone.

Smell completely avoids the pungent / dank / catty side of Citra for a soft citrus melange (clementine, kumquat, meyer lemon) and slightly leafy (like crushing the leaves of a citrus tree) note.  Biscuity malt is present, not simply hop water, but with such an incredibly airy and creamy mouthfeel. Somehow both substantial and light. 431 charactersKurmaraja, Sep 24, 2015

4.45/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed this out of a 750 mL swingtop "growler" courtesy of BA wuntrikpony. Bottle was filled 9/3 and is adorned with a tag marked "enjoy by 9/11/15"--lucky me, as it is 9/11 as I set to consume this. Very happy to get my hands on it, as I've not had any of HF's "hoppy" beers before and I do love me some Citra hops. Poured into a Speigelau IPA-specific glass.
Appearance (4.00) - Pours a cloudy tangerine orange hue that is fairly flat along the color spectrum. Down near the bottom of the glass, the shade takes on a "dirty" orange look, but that's to be expected from the shadow of the volume of liquid above it. Atop the body sits a finger of stark white head that has a mildly soapy look to it, but at a week out from bottling, we are probably at the edge of this beer being up to it's optimal standard. The head fades after a minute or two, leaving a ring around the edge of the glass and faint, intermittent film across the surface of the liquid. Some isolated dots of lace pepper the sides of the glass.
Smell (4.5) -  A wonderfully fragrant bouquet of tropical fruit rises out of the glass, with notes of mango, cantaloupe and passionfruit dominating. There is some contrapuntal acidity taking the form of orange and grapefruit zest, but they only serve to offer the formality of a retort to the dominant argument coming from the tropical fruits. At this point, I get very little grain presence--just a touch of water cracker.
Taste (4.5) - Very similar to the aroma in being dominated by tropical fruits, with just faint hints of citrus and malt vying for attention. It's very good, and dangerously easy to drink--there is so little bitterness that at times it's easy to forget that you're drinking beer... in a good way. But I think this is where I run into problems with "bigger" beers like IPAs and DIPAs that rely solely on Citra--they are very delicious, but become monotonous. Perhaps it's because they are often so drinkable that I'm drinking them too fast and wearing out my palate, but whatever it is, I'm usually ready for something new by the end of the bottle. That said, this one was still remarkable, as I got through the full 750 ml before getting a bit tired of the taste. Still, I think this problem is  a combination of the properties of Citra and my own palate, as HF has done an excellent job with this beer.
Mouthfeel (4.25) - Feel is on the light side of medium and the carbonation is moderate to low (although it's entirely possible that the carbonation is the result of consuming this from a growler after a week). Still, the body and carbonation were enough to carry the wonderful characteristics of the hop in question. Finish was slightly sweet.
Overall (4.5), a delicious beer and a great showcase of Citra. I'd love to find out someday what this one tastes like at the source, straight from the tap. 2,844 charactersLambicPentameter, Sep 14, 2015

The nearly teeth-churning fruit flavors on display to seduce the senses and refresh the palate with the intangibles that go far beyond what's expected of imperial IPA.
Though its unadulterated and hoppy haze, the ale pours like fruit juices with a pillowy lemon-stained froth. With the overwhelming scent of tropicana orange juice at the precipice, the unmistakable twang of passionfruit, lime, gooseberry, red grapefruit and blood orange is ripe and vibrant to the nose; evoking mouth watering at its mere scent.
To taste, the racy flavors of citrus and tropical fruit engulf the mouth entirely. A malty backdrop of seemingly tangy fructose, faint honey and confectioner's sweetness and a light drizzle of honey- all just enough to bring out the brightness of fruit. Yet, the culmination of sherbet precedes the smooth bitterness of fresh pine shavings, grassy verbena and tea-like sassafras.
What is a lush and velvety fruit tang up front dries wonderfully into a resinous dryness to house the bitterness and promotes its more herbal hop essence. An aftertaste of cream sickle with accompanying bitterness outlasts the sweetness and gives the ale its transcendent acclaim. 1,344 charactersBEERchitect, Jul 29, 2015

Citra nose through and through. Nose isn't quite as intense as some other top-tier Imperial IPAs but the overall aroma is definitely attractive. The flavor of the hops is a mixture of several tropical fruits and some musty/stemmy hoppiness. Malt is semi-sweet, pale and bready. Citra hops are marvelous. Very drinkable. Not overly bitter. Flavor and aroma are great but a little less potent and pungent than I was expecting. I would still crush this if it was available to me. A long time want; just slightly below my lofty expectations. 625 charactersVelvetExtract, Jul 19, 2015

Taste is incredible, sweet juicy hops that taste like candy. Very easy drinking for a couble IPA. Smooth great carbonation.
Overall, this is an amazing beer, and after having a week filled with Heady Topper, Second Fiddle, and Sip of Sunshine, each of them are excellent in their own way. 488 charactersJordonHoltzman, Jul 13, 2015

A: Orange haze in a golden brew.  Thick white head that lasts and offers a ton of lacing.
S:  Big citrus hops that come in waves.  Lemon, orange, grapefruit, juice, rind, zest.  Makes you want to take a sip.
T:  Follows the nose.  Lots of hop flavor that hits on many levels.  Does not overpower the malt.
M:  Pretty light considering the ABV.  Moderate carbonation.

Everything about this beer screams fresh, juicy, sweet fruit; from the appearance (hazy, orangey golden color), through the absolutely bursting fruity nose, to the taste, it is all a poem to oranges, tangerines and mangoes.  One of the best hop driven ales out there, bar none.  All hail citra hops ;) !! 359 charactersmtomlins, Jul 06, 2015

A-  nice yellow straw color.  Looks creamy and unpasteurized.  Two finger white head frothy head.
S-  bursting with fruity, citrus goodness.  Mangoes, peaches, guava, etc.  Love this hop and this is a premier example of how well it can be used.  
T-  very juicy and hop forward.  All the fruits from the nose are present.  This drinks very smooth and one of my favorite parts was the smoothness and drinkability of this ale.  Definitely crisp and refreshing and something I'd want on a hot summer day.
M-  although this has a crispness and freshness, it also had a nice creamy feel to it.  Doesn't get much better than this.
O-  love most things HF does and this should be on the top of their IPA list.  Well worth the beautiful drive to the Hill. 782 charactersEveningCordial, Jul 04, 2015

Smell is ok. Getting a little "cat pee" from the citra
Taste is above average but not spectacular or transcendent or majestic. 
Mouthfeel is average. 
Overall I find myself searching for what makes this such a highly rated beer by so many people.  Doesn't live up to the hype for me. 366 characters2ellas, Jun 04, 2015

Poured from the 25.4 oz. growler into a Hill Farmstead stemmed tulip.
a: Hazy orange with a finger plus thick white head which receded to patchy surface foam and dense lacing.
s: Moderate citrus and pine.
t: Follows the nose along with a considerable hop bite which lingers on the mostly dry finish.
m: Smooth medium to full, great body and considerable carbonation tingle.
o: Outstanding quality DIPA, as expected.  Hefty and tasty.  A sippable joy. 489 charactersscotorum, Jun 03, 2015

10 day old fill.
Pours cloudy yellow-tangerine color with large whitish head.  Huge tropical aromas emerge from the glass.  Taste is very citrus/tropical juicy. Mango, pineapple, and orange with moderate bitterness. Very well made and highly drinkable brew. Would love to try fresh at the source someday. 358 charactersd5001986, Jun 02, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I got this from Hopasouras who was on a business trip up in the NE and I could hardly believe what was in front of me. If only this was available across the US everyone could enjoy the majesty of this brew.
A - Awesome dark gold, orange color. Extremely opaque from all of the hops that emblazon this glorious beer. Perfect fine white head and lacing for days.
S - Extremely strong hop fragrance with tons of tropical fruit literally squeezed into the glass. Mostly a mango, pineapple, and orange mixture that I can barely describe the awesomeness. Could smell it immediately. Definitely the best smelling beer ever!
T - Absolutely incredible hop flavor with a full fruit bouquet hop character with tons of tropical fruit, citrus, some pine, and dank resin hops to round yield one of the greatest beers ever made. If you like tropical flavored hops by the bucket full this is a great beer. Something about this beer that is different than other Citra DIPAs is the malt flavor. In the middle right beside the crazy hops is a sweet malt, buttery cracker, oats flavor that makes this the best beer I've ever tasted. The bitterness is there and adds to the resinous character but doesn't bite at all. The finish is perfectly in the middle with some sweetness from the malt and some fruit and bitter resin.
M - The perfect medium mouth-feel with perfect carbonation. Basically only the hops sit on the tongue and is very refreshing.
Overall, this is my new "best beer I've ever had" candidate. Amazing aroma, flavor, feel, appearance, and anything else you would desire in a DIPA. Without a bite but huge unforgettable flavor, refreshing drinkablity, and perfect balance. I would drink at least 2 of these every week if I lived anywhere near the brewery. Probably a good thing I don't! :P If you are ever within even a couple hours drive from getting this you definitely should because it may just be the best thing you've ever tasted.

I love citra hops and this beer didn't let me down.  Lots of citrus smells and flavors.  Smooth, very drinkable and the lacing on the glass was great.  I usually don't mention lacing but this was noticeable and added to the drinking experience.  My second favorite citra based beer after ZD. 487 charactersELS, Mar 08, 2015

Taste. Easily the best Citra IPA I've expereinced. Fruity, resinous, bitter. But alas I do not like Citra. I keep hoping that my taste buds will adjust but it doesn't seem to be happening. I just don't like the spicy, bitter burn that accompanies it. That being said this one is very nicely balanced.
Overall a really nice beer and definitely worth a try. Especially if you like citra. 
Though this isn't my favorite HF IPA it's still very good. 627 charactersZaximus, Feb 28, 2015

It pours a deep golden color with a nice white head with small bubbles. Laces the glass nicely as it goes down. Slightly hazy pour. First smell is pungent grapefruit. Some mango and maybe pineapple? Strong smell. First sip is an explosion of hops. Mango, grapefruit, piney, resinous, a little dank, and a very soft malt backbone. It's medium bodied with a low bitterness and a wonderfully soft mouthfeel. Impressive. 
It lives up to the hype. Period. 521 charactersPSU_Mike, Feb 14, 2015

Pours a deep orange, hazy body with a 2 finger white head that reduces slowly, leaving lots of lacing. 
Aromas a sharp and inviting, super tropical and piney at the same time, lots of citrus, pineapple, pungent grapefruit.
On the tongue is tons of citrus, grapefruit, mango, with an aftertaste of resin and citrus rind, slight hop bite on the finish. very nice. Easy on the tongue with a medium body and drinkable mouthfeel. 
Overall it was everything I expected - super tasty, highly aromatic, and very drinkable. Up there with the best. 709 charactersgcamparone, Feb 10, 2015

The aroma has juicy oranges and grapefruit, mango and peach tropical for a bit of sweetness. 
The flavor follows with that bright Citra tangerine and citrus peel flavor throughout. A generally light beer as the mid palate empties from that light flavor onto a floral flavor of mostly drying. A clear transitioning from fruit as the Citra hop offers. I almost got a hint of "rubber," but not necessarily in a bad way.
In general, a restrained CItra DIPA. It tastes like a bigger brother of the Citra Pale Ale, which despite being world class, is still one of the weaker DIPAs out of HF. As "disappointing" as going on a date with the least desirable Victoria's Secret model could be... 743 charactersdar482, Dec 18, 2014

Tasted against Abner, Legitmacy, and Nelson Single Hop. Of the four, I ranked this one 4th. 
It probably has a lot to do with comparing this to other Citra DIPA's I've had. Compared to KR Citra and NAW Citra Showers, it falls short. It's got this weird herbal presence in the middle of the taste. Still a top tier IPA! 415 charactersRollzroyce21, Nov 08, 2014

3.4/5  rDev -24.8%Many thanks to baybum who schlepped this thing across many county lines to get it to MN. 750ML growler best by 10/31/14, so I still have 96 minutes. I better get to it. Split with my lovely wife. 
The pour is thick, chewy-looking orange with plenty of carbonation…a bit actually leaked out when I popped the top, which is always a good sign on a growler. Smells like 64 degrees in January in Minnesota: oranges, citrus, mango, pretty much every fruit lighter than purple. Not bad. 
Double Citra is a nicely balanced IPA, which is akin to saying you liked the dialogue in Star Wars. The hops are less about the ex-bitterness & more about the tropical fruity breezes. Mango, oranges, all the stuff that crept up my nose is here creeping down my throat. The mid-palate is more about the mouthfeel, thick, juicy, sticky, incredibly decadent for a hoppy beer, & that’s what saves it in my mouth. Mild bitterness, big malty sweetness, honey combine to tame the hops & smooth everything out. Smooth is my kryptonite.  I’m not having any trouble drinking this, but I won’t be weeping uncontrollably when the glass is empty. 
I’ve been consistently wowed by HF stuff in the past, but this one left my taste buds distracted by…I’m wondering who the new Twins manager is going to be. Glad I got to try it. Pretty good. 1,324 charactersmaximum12, Nov 01, 2014

A: Lightly hazy, tangerine orange with some gold and honey tones - pours with a large, bright white head, fades to a wispy cap, leaves a nice web of lacing
S: Ripe, juicy, fresh citra hops - very potent, but not extreme, with some very nice depth - juicy, ripe tangerine flesh with some orange and grapefruit - resinous and a touch dank - nice range of tropical aromas with some peach, pineapple, mango - light sweetness with some pale malts
T: Juicy, tropical, and very bright - ripe, fresh tangerine slices - tangerine, orange, and grapefruit flesh and juice - floral notes - hint of pine and resin - moderately bitter - nice tropical flavors with some ripe peach, pineapple, and mango - moderately bitter - pale malts with a hint of caramel - starts off a bit sweet, ultimately may be a bit sweet
M: Medium body, nicely carbonated, smooth, finishes bitter
O: Prepare for trouble, and make it double
This is a solid use of citra hops. It has more depth than some beers that use 100% citra... But it still feels a little one-dimensional. Tasty and well-done nonetheless. 1,155 charactersangrybabboon, Oct 25, 2014
3.94/5  rDev -12.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Split with angrybabboon.
Appearance: Hazy gold/dark yellow. Head is bright-white and fluffy. Drops to a small cap and creamy collar. Streaks and splotches of lacing. Moderate carbonation on the pour. 
Smell: Citra. Deeply tropical with notes of tangerine and peach. Slightly floral with some pine bitterness layered in the back. Big juicy fruit push. Malts are light and bready with some powdery yeast notes. Mild fruity esters. Orange peel, zest and pith. Malts add a touch of needed sweetness with some undercooked bread dough. As it warms it takes on a sharper floral edge and a vague spiciness creeps out as well. A bit leafy.
Taste: Follows the nose...it's Citra. Tropical fruit, mostly tangerine on the initial sip. Slightly bitter in a woody branch sort of way. Some peach and mango as well. Orange peel and a slightly oily rind. A touch floral and bitter. Malts are lightly sweet and slightly bready with some raw biscuit dough. A touch of raw honeycomb. Some pineapple as it warms with a touch of grapefruit as well. Surprisingly balanced. Almost crackery snap as well. Almost buttery at times.  Slight caramelized sweetness with an herbal push as well.
Mouthfeel: Mediumish body with a moderate carbonation. The typical smooth pseudocreaminess that all Hill Farmstead pale ales possess. Slightly dry on the finish.
Overall: Double down - win one hand.
It's Citra through and through. If that's your jam this will blow your mind. As it stands, it's solid, but that's not surprising. 1,497 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Oct 25, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +5.1%Nose of orange, lemon zest and hint of alochol. A scent of freshness tells me: stop smelling and drink!
In mouth, that's a fruit party. Everything fits together. Citra hop is dominant, fresh, tasty. Aromas of orange, lemon, grapefruit and pineapple. Small astringency but at 8 abv, that's normal. 
Bitterness is strong, traces of pine and orange zest.
Overall, it's an other masterpiece by HF. It's like drinking a juice at breakfast. I'd drink to that everyday 461 charactersFranck, Oct 25, 2014

A: Pours a hazy, light golden color with two fingers of fluffy, dense head.  Very good retention and some nice, intricate lacing.
S: Citrus hard candy, orange peel, floral notes, and breadiness meld wonderfully together.  A hint of rye or spice?
T: Gorgeous tropical (mango) and bright citrus, a pretty hefty dose of yeasty breadiness, with a light sugar sweetness rounding out the taste without negating the mild, rough grapefruit pith bitterness.
M: Medium, soft carbonation and medium body.  No hint of alcohol.
O: Very nice DIPA from HF.  Exceeding drinkability is only limited by the sweetness, which becomes a bit fatiguing after a half pint or so. 697 characterspmarlowe, Oct 19, 2014

Forms a moderately sized, fluffy white head. Head is quite stable. Lots of patchy lacing on the way down. Aroma is pungent - I could smell the ripe citrus juiciness as I was pouring the beer. Aroma is intensely citrusy. Juicy tangerine and orange blossom. The taste is more of the same. There is a mild sweetness to the beer that complements the juicy citrus. Tropical fruits, mandarin, and mango. Finishes with a touch of earthiness and an uplifting hint of alcohol. Medium bodied. Moderate bitterness. Lower carbonation gives this an extra smooth mouthfeel. 
An excellent beer and about the most perfect expression of the citra hop that I've come across. 732 charactersFlorida9, Oct 17, 2014

A - Hazy yellow hay, capped with a froth of delicate white , laced all the while.
S - Tangerine, tropical fruit, some lemongrass touches the ends. A sunrise of the senses.
T - Finesse displayed here, tropical feel, fine light malt, a kiss of dryness. Constructed to impress.
M - Fabulous feel, the mid palate is the treasure here. a stunning entry, gentle glide to the end. Like 
Fred and Ginger on a winding staircase. A delight to be had.
O - This may well be the best constructed IIPA that I have had. Easy on the palate, clean in its finish. So 
very good.

If I could only choose to drink one beer for the rest of my life, this would be it.  You need to try this beer.  This is truly the best IIPA in the world in my eyes and I think if it came around more than 2-4 times a year or in bottles as well as growlers then this list would reflect that as well...  Trade away whatever you have to or drive/fly any distance and sample this beer... 640 charactersVTLocal420, Aug 26, 2014

A: A swampy and orange apricot brew topped with a sudsy white rocky foam. The foam clings to the sides in fine and delicate sheets of lacing. 
S: Smells as though fresh pine wood has been caramelized with musky mangos & melons spiked with grapefruit and orange rinds. 
T: Wow - first, the malts balanced with hops are expertly layered in such a way that both the malts and hops sing together harmoniously. The sweet maltiness is a mild caramelized richness, notably buttery and fatty. The hops are a soft pine, with a grapefruit pith hit mid-palette. The finish is slightly dry pine, herbaceous, slightly sweet and refreshing.
M: Pin pricks on the tongue upfront, light and effervescent. The lightness opens up to a rich malty feel, like a thin caramel sauce. Perfection. 
O: This brew expertly pairs the rich buttery malts with solid hoppy pine and grapefruit, supported by a mouth feel that smooth and chewy. Incredibly lucky to have this growler sent cross country! 1,022 charactersFondueVoodoo, Jun 15, 2014

A: Thick, aerated white head over a golden-yellow body. The hed hanges on for &gt; 5 minutes and leaves dense lacing on the sides of the glass. Gentle swirling reinvigorats a 1/4 inch head. Body is translucent, but cloudy.
S: Grapefruit, orange and lemon...this is double citra, right? Slightly dank and resinous hop scent well laid over a faint malt backbone. A touch of residual sweetness hangs over the beer. Well done.
T: Citrus fruit, slightly astringent bitterness balanced against a malt backbone that compements the hop forward nature of this beer. Refreshing and light, the alcohol is well hidden. This is an aggressive beer fornhop lovers, but it remains approachable.
M: Sticky, resinous texture coats the mouth and lingers, but the bitterness doesn't seem to build to unpeasant levels as insome DIPAs. Light-medium body thanks to medium-high carbonation that prevents palate fatigue in such an intense beer.
O: I am partial to Citra hops and this is, IMO, a world class expression of this hop. A lovely beer thst I hope to be able to try again. Hyped? Sure. But this beer is worththe effort to obtain. Highly recommended. 1,240 charactersF2brewers, May 07, 2014

Poured on tap at Farmhouse in Burlington.
Pours a glowing bright deep yellow, hazy. One finger of foam.
Smells of grapefruit rind, hoppiness and sweetness.
Taste incredible. My palate erupts with juicy grapefruit citrus, but not too bitter.
Mouthfeel is chewy and perfect for the style.
This is a reference beer for a single hop citra DIPA. World Class. 378 charactersBoldRulerVT, Apr 17, 2014

Pours clear and golden orange, with about one inch of fizzy head.
Smells like citrus hops, with tons of floral notes as well.
Similar taste. The signature slightly catty Citra taste is there, but is a bit restrained, which is good. Light to medium bitterness, lots of grapefruit and orange.
Light to medium bodied, low carbonation, crisp mouthfeel.
Wish I could have more of this, this was a good way to start out the release. 489 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 16, 2014

Location: Hill Farmstead Brewery
Glassware: Tulip
Appearance: Pale dried grass in color with a thumb size off color white head. Minimal cascading as the beer is devoured. 
Aromatics: This beer comes with a big floral nose. The hops just add so much to this beer, starting with the floral whole hops nose and including pineapple, mango and even some lime. A good deal of wheat grass flavor.
Flavor: The fruits jump out at me in the beginning, moving to the grassy. The tasting definitely gives me more of the pine nose flavor. Finishing with a little of the spice and pine resin but with no flavor being harsh. 
Mouthfeel: Silky smooth. Only in the finish does the beer build to a different note. 
Notes: I had this beer both on tap at HF and in a 750ml growler. I'm in love. 788 charactersKornWallace, Apr 15, 2014

Pours a hazy straw colour, fluffy white head that's probably about 2 finger lengths. Good retention, as usual per HF, a beautiful DIPA. Good lacing, good retention.
Smells great, but delicate and more subtle. Lots of grapefruit and passion fruit, some tangerines. Very tropical fruit forward, not complex but delicious.
Flavourwise, this is a very tasty beer but not one of Shaun's best. It's got some grapefruit, passion fruit but its not a total citrus bomb if that makes sense. Its more balanced, more malts to it than the likes of Permanent Funeral and Sosus, for example. The hops are a bit less subdued but the overall experience is very good- succinct indeed.
Mouthfeel is typical HF- creamy, well carbonated with a medium body. So easy to drink, not terribly bitter at all. Aftertaste is a semi-bitter citrus flavour that sticks with you.
Glad to have this one, not one of Shaun's best (look at Abner and Ephraim for better DIPAs) but it's certainly a phenomenal double IPA that's worth trying anytime it's on draft at the brewery.
Re-review: Thanks to a generous VT trader, I got a growler to drink a half year from when I first had this beer. Thanks buddy! Poured into a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass today, 4/13/2014. Basically, it's better than I remember it, but not by a lot. This beer smells like wet hops, in that it's very dank and floral with a bit of the tropical fruit and citrus that's associated with Citra hops, but I think it had a lot of room to develop the enjoyable flavour profile that shows up in pseudoSue and Zombie Dust. It just doesn't end up in that regard, but at the same time it's a very balanced, well-executed and not too bitter DIPA that works very well. It's not King Sue, but this is a good DIPA as long as you ignore the "Citra" hype in the name. I know this isn't saying much, so if you're more inclined to think about the "Citra" hop in the name of a beer rather than enjoying any DIPA, you are better off ignoring this one and going after Double Sunshine or Ephraim. As it is, this is still a real treat and a well-crafted beer as far as I'm concerned. 2,240 charactersStevedore, Apr 14, 2014

Appearance-pours a cloudy yellow with a 1 inch foamy white head that lingers
Smell: Aroma of sweet citrus like the smell of a freshly peeled orange rind. Wonderful. 
Taste: Similar to the nose of freshly peeled orange rind that is prominent and very well balanced with the malt backbone. The bitterness is there but not in your face. The 8% abv is no where to be found. Really like fruit juice and refreshing. Really dry finish.
Mouth: Had a smooth silky/oily feel with a perfect amount of carbonation that adds to the smoothness of this beer.
Overall: Really quite a pleasure to drink this beer. There is probably no perfect DIPA out there, but this is pretty damn close. I was quite upset when this 'experience' was over. I may have to move to Greensboro. 823 charactersPapparoachy, Apr 07, 2014

The concentration of hops hits you hard at first, but once you acclimate this is perhaps the best IPA I've have encountered. Tons of various citrus notes, smooth drinking without any of the overt or longstanding bitterness that many of the great IPAs demonstrate. If I resided anywhere near the brewery this beer would turn me into the town drunk. 441 charactersSirElton, Apr 02, 2014

Appearance: Pours a peach, slightly light amber color and leaves a finger of sticky, white head, that lingers for a while before fading to a layer atop the beer.
Smell: Big citrus hops up front, some pineapples and peach as well, honey, a hint of pine. Very clean and crisp flavors.
Taste: Honey, grapefruit juice, clementines, just a hint of lemon zest. The grapefruit is quite prominent, as well as delicious. Very drinkable flavor, not too bitter. Alcohol is masked by the citrus. Quite juicy.
Mouth-feel: Medium to well carbonated, with a nice smooth medium body.
Overall: Lovely grapefruit flavor to this one - definitely the best citra hopped beer I've had. Lovely mouthfeel and this is extremely drinkable for a DIPA. 820 charactersResuin, Apr 01, 2014

Totally hazy lemonade colored body, huge lemon flavor, pulpy and flavorful. Nice fleshy fruit in the aroma and taste plus a decent baseline of bitterness, quite refreshing. HF knows its way around hops. 269 characterspapat444, Mar 24, 2014

Do not know when it was poured into a Growler. Opened the day before (due to impatience, and rightly so) then refrigerated over night. Sat out of fridge for at least an hour and a half. Drank straight from the growler in a moving car (not while driving, but admittedly not smart).
Despite all of this... the beer was still ridiculously fantastic. Top 5 DIPs List for sure. 
Hops on the nose stand up to any West Coast example of a Double. Bitterness was present but not overpowering and supported by a solid malt backbone that did not come across as overly sweet.
This beer is a perfect example of balance. Each mouthful courted the taste buds before slinking out prepping the palate for more. Even the Lady, not a hophead, was craving another sip. 826 charactersBeerSnobDougie, Dec 27, 2013

The beer pours a hazy, golden straw color, obviously unfiltered, true to Shaun's style with hues of lemon and orange when struck by the light. A soft, fluffy, white head, only a finger or so high rises from the beer that yields a nice network of soapy lace and maintains good retention throughout. The aroma is soft and delicate with lovely citrus, both tangy grapefruit and sweeter lemon and tangerine, mild pine and light earthy spice with some great tropical notes that really brighten the beer. I can't say it's exceedingly complex, the malt is a bit doughy as are more Hill Farmstead beers, but it's so well refined and expressive. The flavors are spot on, tangy grapefruit, lemongrass, tangerine, mango, pineapple with a bit of earthiness and crisp spice and just a subtle layer of cereal grain cross the tongue. It's bitter, but not overly so, the flavors do the talking, not the bitterness, although the nice, bitter dry bite is certainly at the finish. The mouthfeel is nice, it's juicy and full bodied, coats the mouth well, could possibly do with some more carbonation but it finishes so smoothly with a dry snap that is assertive, but not intrusive. 
Verdict: A immaculate expression of Citra hops, and an artful IIPA. Certainly one of, if not the best in Shaun Hill's arsenal of hoppy beers. It's beautifully layered, yet enjoyably simplistic that really showcases what hops, barley water and yeast can do when put together in just right quantities and conditions. A masterclass. 1,601 characterskevanb, Nov 19, 2013

Aroma: Tropical at first, then more piney/citrus.  as it warms some sweet malt and some orange notes dominate.  When it's close to room temperature there is a also a distinct smell of alcohol.
Taste: Fruitness upfront, a little more alcohol on the finish then I normally like in an IPA.  It also has the taste of pine and citrus as well at the end.  The beer starts sweet and finishes dry and bitter (pleasant, but firm).  The balance between sweetness and bitterness/dryness are great for the style.  As it warms orange/tangerine start to really come through.  This orange/tangerine flavor as it warms to close to room temperature helped me elevate the beer quite a bit.  After the first half of the beer I had this beer at 3.89 overall.  By the end the beer was a 4.19.  
Feel: Very easy to drink, full mouthfeel, leaves a resiny coating and a bitter taste after for a while after swallowing.  Helps the next sip, because it tastes that much more refreshing. 
Overall: Seems to be lacking something.  I have not had any food or anything but water to drink in a few hours.  I am not sure, but surprised on how it tastes.  Remember it being very different from years ago.  This beer really needs to be drank close to 60 degrees.  3/4 of the way through my first glass out of the growler I pulled the 750ml growler out of the fridge.  Realizing that I wanted my next glass to start much warmer.  When cold the beer is meh, once it warmed it was much better.  I 1,549 characterslic217, Nov 16, 2013

The pour is a cloudy, bright orange color with a 2 finger white head. Great retention and great lacing. Just a beautiful looking beer. 
The aroma has lots of citrus to be expected, but also plenty of tropical fruits and some piney hop resin to balance out the sweetness. The caramel malt is very well hidden, but it's there. The aromas here just work so well together it's impossible to stop sniffing the glass. 
The taste, like the nose, is a citrus bomb. So much orange peel and juicy grapefruit and tangerine. There's plenty of dank, resinous hop flavor as well to once again balance out the sweetness. The back end is held up by a subtle but pleasant malt bill. Incredible balance. 
The feel is medium-light bodied with moderate carbonation. It's creamy, smooth, crisp, and refreshing. 
Overall, this is not only my favorite IPA/DIPA, but my favorite beer period. For me, it just does everything perfectly The aroma is intoxicating, and the flavor is complex and extremely well balanced. The only knock on it is that it's relatively light bodied for a DIPA. But this is merely a small blemish on an otherwise flawless beer. 1,177 charactersScaryEd, Nov 09, 2013

a - Pours a hazy medium yellow-orange color with one finger of fluffy white head and moderate carbonation evident.
s - Smells of citrus hops, pine hops, tropical fruits, mangos, pineapples, fruity malts, light floral notes, grapefruit, and earthy malts. Awesome nose; this growler was 5-6 days old and was amazingly hoppy and fresh. Love the nose.
t - Taste follows the nose very closely; super hoppy with lots of mangos, tropical fruits, pineapples, citrus hops, lemon zest, grapefruit juice, fruity malts, honey, and floral notes. More tropical fruits than the nose, a tiny bit of a step up for me.
m - Medium body and low to moderate carbonation. There is a light bitterness but not too much at all, and it is pretty smooth and creamy.
o - Overall I thought this was another fantastic DIPA from HF and it did not disappoint. Tons of fresh tropical fruits and citrus hops in both the nose and taste and pretty easy to drink, with not much bitterness in the taste. We had no problem taking the growler down between the two of us. One of the better hoppy HF beers IMO, would love to have it again. 1,241 charactersmdfb79, Nov 05, 2013

Aroma is of the most strong and consistent "cat pee" odors I have ever gotten from a DIPA. Beyond that, dry hops, citrus, and wheat come through.
The beer is wonderfully sweet and hoppy, and very well balanced - the only malt I get is of grain and wheat. I don't get much in the way of particular citrus or tropical fruit; just an overall sweet hoppiness.
HF avoids the syrup DIPA trap: this beer has a fantastic mouthfeel. It's sweet, hoppy, and balanced, and very drinkable.
This won't go down as my favorite DIPA, but that's really more a factor of the hops chosen rather than the craftsmanship; it's really an exceptional brew. 761 charactersRoguer, Nov 03, 2013

This is a spectacular, gorgeous brew. It's orangy-yellow, and appears go glow when fully poured. The aura of this beer is mesmerizing. 
The aroma with this brew is a blast of of citrus- orange and a bite of grapefruit. 
Delicious beer. Every Hill Farmstead brew has the same base flavor profile, clean yet rich and earthy. But this hop profile puts this beer among the elite. Slightly sweet, slightly dry, a little grassy and earthy, but orange and grapefruit above all. No booze flavor to speak of, just an easy drinking, flavorful IPA. 
A slightly sticky, but clean finish. 
Just like three or four other HF IPAs I've had, if they bottle this to the exclusion of all other beers, they'd have a mass-produceable, world class beer on their hands. The base flavor of HF brews is distinctive- presumably due to the well water. But whatever they add on top comes out clean, crisp, and delicious. 943 charactersstonermouse, Oct 27, 2013

4.06/5  rDev -10.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4Picked this up from the brewery yesterday. Enjoyed the taster they offered so I picked up a couple growlers. Review is from the growler.
Beer pours a golden yellow. Very cloudy likely because Hill Farmstead does not filter and there is a good amount of suspended hops and likely yeast. I find the unfiltered double IPAs are much better fresh than the filtered variety, but don't age as well. Anyway this is a tangent. Glad to have this fresh. 
This is my first commercial beer I've tried with the citra hop variety. Strong citrus smell from the hops. Hints of pineapple, orange, lemon and grass. Very light scent compared to more dank, piney or grapefruit hops. Gives an impression of effervescence just by smelling the beer.
First taste gives a lighter than expected mouthfeel that does detract somewhat from another wise excellent and superb beer. The taste is not quite as complex or as strong as the scent. Very hop forward, but not overly bitter. The malt profile is simple and provides only balance to the citra hops. The hops are very citrus oriented in the taste, yet less complex than the scent. Notes of pear, apricot and pineapple. The pineapple takes center stage in my impression. 
Overall it is a very enjoyable beer that obviously is centered on the citra hops. It seems to me that a more complex malt and/or hop bill would help elevate the complexity, although that could detract from the citra focus. That said I believe that the the focus of a beer should be on the sum of the parts rather than a focus on any one ingredient. Really I'm nitpicking though as this is a very fine brew. 1,605 charactersJmamay22, Oct 25, 2013

4.68/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Serving Type: Poured into a tulip glass from a 2L growler filled yesterday and stored over night in the refrigerator.
Bottom Line: Great beer. Very drinkable with flavors that are enjoyable and multi-dimensional without being overwhelming at any stage in the tasting process. The beer is especially nice served cool but not freezing. It is unfortunate that Hill Farmstead's process does no justice to the quality of this beer. Hill Farmstead clearly knows that their Double Citra is in high demand, therefore understandably limiting its customers by only selling the Double Citra by 750ml refillable bottles. Nonetheless, the Hill Farmstead process also requires its customers to wait an unbearably long period of time in not very long lines - solely due to the fact that the brewery can only fill one bottle of a specific beer at any given time. It is not quite clear to me why popular beers, like the Double Citra, are not hooked up to more than one tap, or why these beers are mostly being poured from inefficient sixtels, that must be frequently changed, as opposed to kegs or standard half kegs.
A: Opaque, golden orange pour with a 1.5 cm head. Medium-sized bubbles that slowly fade down the side of the glass, whispering faintly a promise of hope flavor and texture.
S: Hoppy notes, with faint, yeasty, alcohol vapors. There is a slight smell of grapefruit or citrus, but there is not a lot of scent coming out of this beer overall.
T: Excellent, complex, subtle flavors that are never overwhelming. Hops mixed with grapefruit juice and orange juice on the front end, with a nice sweetness reminiscent of watered down orange juice in the middle, and a nice long-lingering grapefruit character on the back end. Very enjoyable. A long time after each sip, there is a long lasting hint of subtle bitterness, but this beer is not very bitter at all.
M: Well-balanced, medium carbonation. There is no thickness or syrup texture here. It drinks fast and doesn't stick. Very pleasant.
Overall: Amazingly drinkable (refreshing beer drinkability, not bud light drinkability). If anything, my biggest complaint about this beer is that the flavors are not robust enough, that I fear it would quickly be overshadowed by any food or other drink consumed side-by-side. I could quickly polish off a glass or 750 of this on a warm summer day or a cool fall night or whatever season it happens to be right now. 2,406 characterstkdchampxi, Oct 20, 2013

S- The aroma is intensely mandarin orange forward, with lemon zest and grassy floral notes in the background. A good bit of pineapple comes through later in the aroma, and there's some nice biscuity malt as well. Smells glorious!
T- The flavor is more bitter grapefruit forward, and the lemon zest and grassy/floral flavors are more pronounced than in the aroma. The mandarin orange and pineapple are still there, but not nearly as pronounced. This is a week old growler, and they don't use a tube to fill, so this could be why, since I've had a small pour of this before and it had more of these sweeter flavors. The biscuity malt is very prevalent in the finish, which is dry and bitter.
M- The mouthfeel is nearly perfect, medium bodied, buttery smooth, and just the right carbonation. 
O- Overall this is a top notch DIPA, and I can't wait for the next batch to be released! 996 charactersSadMachine, Oct 20, 2013

The pour is a cloudy, glowing, yellow with a whipped cream, bright white head. Nose is fresh kumquat and creamsickle with orange sherbet. Taste is full sweet melons with peach, kumquat, sweet grapefruit, Valencia orange, even getting a little meaty like durian and jackfruit. Palate is wildly soft, nearing that ridiculously fluffy softness in FFF Apocalypse Cow. Overall, it could be mistaken for pineapple milkshake. This is how DIPA should be. Just delete all those cheesy, syrupy, sticky, red and brown and orange DIPAs that have taken over the world and replace them with either Hill Farmstead Double Citra or FFF Apocalypse Cow. Then I might not hate DIPAs anymore. 715 characterstarheels86, Sep 25, 2013

This is the biggest and badest citra hop beer out there, IMO. Huge citrus notes of tangerine, grapefruit peel, and pineapple. I also detect some honey sweetness and bready yeast underneath it all. So complex and big. 
Taste follows the smell. Its big and reminiscent of the other big citra beer. Wonderful, complicated, and explosive citrus flavors hit all parts of my palate. A nice (and unique) sweetness followed by an almost creamy aftertaste. It must be the yeast or well water that gives this beer such a unique flavor. It's so damn good.
Medium MF, medium carbonation, creamy texture. Fantastically drinkable. This is on point.
Overall, one of my favorite citra beers. HF does not disappoint. What a wonderful treat! 865 characterslunarbrew, Jun 01, 2013

A~ darkish copper orange, nice fluffy white head and a crazy amount of lacing!
S~ lots of citrus, it almost smells like some kind of juice. slight pine earthnessy follows and of course some bitterness.
T~ of course theres a lot of citrus just like the nose. pineapple, orange, lemon, lime, etc... followed by a big piney flavor. and is it appropriate to say this tastes "imperial"? haha aside from the thicker, sightly boozy (not so much in the taste, you can just tell. you know?) its almost the same as regular Citra.
M~ nice carbonation as to be expected from HF, slightly thick, smooth, and a little dryness from the hops.
O~ not bad at all, but nothing compared to the Ephraim that i drank last night lol i love all the citrus notes and thats probably why this stands out for most people. theres not one HF thats not worth a least a taste! 912 charactersSkrip, May 17, 2013

Juicy and fruity right up front with that wonderful citra aroma. Grapefruit and mango notes with just of hint of floralness make for a wonderfully inviting beer. 
Taste follows suit with lots of bright fruity flavors. Nice mellow malt presence provides a nice base for the citrus flavors to build upon. Finishes well with just a bit of flowery hop character and slight bittering note.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and damn smooth. Makes for a damn fine sipper (or gulper). Overall, I think I'd give a slight edge to Double Galaxy and Abner as my favorite HF DIPAs but until them I'll just dream of the day I can compare all three side-by-side. 794 charactersKinsman, May 08, 2013

Meeting Shuan Hill was a pleasure, and no different than meeting any other down to earth rural Vermonter that knows how to do their job and do it well. We arrived first on a Friday afternoon and it was the better part of two hours driving from NorthWest Vermont to get there.
Double Citra is one of the more recent offerings from the distinguished Hill Farmstead Brewery and it was poured into a 750 ml bottle for take home enjoyment. Tastings are served at the brewery, but I neglected the four tastings for $5 offer as I was the driver.
Pours a cloudy off yellow with an elegant cotton head reaching 1 finger and lacing brilliantly in the glassware. Playfully effervescent without being overly carbonated and an exceptional nose consisting of pineapple, kiwi, clementines, and ruby red grapefruit with a smidgeon of mango, yet the aromas are more subdued and subtle than their Vermont counterpart that is also an all citra hops concoction (to be named later in this review).
Initial taste is tropical fruits, juicy sweetness, followed by resinous piney herbal hoppiness that is simply top shelf, leaving a bitter aftertaste that lingers pleasantly, inviting another sip.
Quaffing Double Citra cold does this IIPA a disservice: letting it breathe in proper glassware for no less than 15 minutes brings about the complex qualities that are accentuated with some warming (same observation with Lawson's Double Sunshine). Whatever malt used to balance the double citra whammy is strictly a platform to showcase the rock star hops under the spotlight taking an awesome solo all over your palate!
Mouthfeel is medium, slightly oily, and the overall impression is that this is a highly refined IIPA that shows no signs of booziness, and is made with quality and care. 
I can understand how letting it breathe while enjoying appetizers/entrees at one of the fine Vermont eateries that serve it could be challenging: the tendency is to drink it down and order another one, but I can tell you from my perspective, it misses the point of the total enjoyment experience consuming it cold.
My BA buddy PlinyMafia that took the pilgrimage to HFS with me did take the tastings offered, and spoke "sacrilegiously " when asked if Lawson's Double Sunshine was better than HFS Double Citra, but that comparison will be covered thoroughly in a soon upcoming beer forum thread to be titled "Hill Farmstead Double Citra goes head to head with Lawson's Double Sunshine: the Battle Royale!" 2,698 charactersHendry, May 05, 2013

Smells very tropical with mango and pineapple notes. Pours a pale dirty orange which is also pretty cloudy. In the mouth it its the perfect level of hops and isn't overwhelming at all.

A - Pours a beautiful straw yellow color, with an appealing haze. A white two-finger head absolutely erupts off of the top. Absolutely exquisite lacing throughout the pour.
S - Unmistakably citra here. A great tropical presence of mango, pineapple and sweet fruits galore. Incredible freshness. 
T - A beautiful hop profile that is almost unfairly balanced. Sweetness and bitterness are in perfect harmony, with an exceedingly clean finish that Hill Farmstead has absolutely nailed for my taste buds.
M - Nicely medium-bodied, with a good carbonation level. Lightly sticky residue is left on the lips.
O - It won't blow your balls off with bitterness like a lot of DIPAs, but that is the beauty of this beer, in my opinion. Restrained elegance. 906 characterswyatt13, May 04, 2013

Thanks, baconsausage!
A truly gorgeous IPA. A slightly hazed, glowing, golden orange. Moderate, large-bubbled, eggwhite-colored head. Lots of stick left down the glass. Truly gorgeous, as are most Hill Farmstead beers. 
Very citrus-forward aroma, as expected. Bright, juicy tangerine and clementine aromas erupt from the glass. Just a hint of a biscuit malt, but this is a showcase of hops, to be sure. There's just a touch of a green onion or chive character, interestingly enough, and though it's not distracting from the overall experience, I wish it wasn't there.
The flavor is even more successful than the proven aroma. Bitter and juicy citrus and tropical flavors come together very nicely. A little bread. No alcohol presence. If I were given this blind, I'd probably guess it was a ~6% ABV IPA. 
Medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation. Very appropriate. Extremely drinkable.
Fantastic. Would drink again...durrrr. 964 charactersehammond1, Apr 30, 2013

Smells of huge juicy citrus and tropical fruit, mandarin oranges and pineapple and mango, some plant like hop character, really just an explosion of sweet juicy fruity hops.
And yep this is amazing. Huge juicy fruit again, all the same stuff as in the nose, sweet and incredibly hoppy at the same time, this is amazing.
Like all the HF hoppy beers this has a fantastic mouthfeel and fantastic drinkability, soft and perfect carbonation.
He best HF beer I've had and one of the best IPAs I've had, fantastic.

A- Pours a hazy orange golden that is mostly opaque, about two fingers of white frothy head forms that has great retention and slowly dissipates coating the glass in light layered lacing.
S- Lots of fresh grapefruit, some greeny hops, a bit of peach, balanced with a nice malt presence. Fairly aromatic with a better aroma strength then your average IPA.
T- Lightly bitter grapefruit, fresh green hops, a bit of peach juice, finishes with more bitter grapefruit and vinous hops with a fruity juicy aftertaste.
M- Juicy, very easy drinking, nice carbonation, lightly creamy.
O- This was another fantastic IPA from HF although maybe not my favorite. It had a great grapefruit taste but did not have the same tropical citrus qualities I've enjoyed in other IPAs. This is easily a world class DiPA though with a very good drink ability and I highly recommend checking it out. 1,020 charactersjaasen64, Apr 26, 2013

Served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass
Big thanks to OtisCampbell for generously sharing this growler.
A frothy, near two-finger, eggshell colored crown topped the super cloudy, yellow ochre liquid. The head slowly faded to a lasting cap. Thick rings of drippy, sticky lacing trickled down the glass.
The nose was quite hoppy. Crisp and citrusy. Lemon zest came through strong. Good dose of orange peel. Touch of malty sweetness. A hint of alcohol warmth appeared as well.
The flavor profile was very similar to nose. Lots of lemon zest and pithy grapefruit rind. Some peach notes. Hints of orange peel. The finish was super hoppy and semi-bitter with notes of pine sap.
The mouthfeel was slick and smooth. Medium bodied for the style with a fine, moderate effervescence.
Out of all the hop-centric Hill Farmstead beers I have tried, Double Citra was one of the least impressive offerings. While tasty and quaffable, it seemed a bit one-dimensional. 1,000 charactersDamian, Apr 25, 2013

All around one of the best DIPAs I have ever and I STRONGLY recommend another great beer from HF. Not surprisingly the Citra smell hits you right off the bat with grapefruit and sticky sweet orange- some other tropical fruit as well make their way to the nose. Well again not surprising that the citra flavor comes through like a train- the slight bitterness and tartness of the grapefruit is perfectly balanced with the sweet orange. Not too much malty flavor but it comes through in the faint background. I get the bitterness that I would expect. however its not at all overbearing-might help to mask the 8+% booze. Hop character lingers in the best way possible.
I really have nothing bad to say and I will certainly get this again. 813 characters80x2HopHead, Apr 22, 2013

Score: 98
One week old keg pour served in a clear plastic tasting cup at The Beer Temple's second anniversary celebration and enjoyed on 03/23/14. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Pours translucent, dull golden color with a half finger layer bubbly head. Good lacing and retention, even in a plastic cup. 4.5/5
Smell: A dank fresh assault of tropical fruit, with a little pine-like character. Apricot, mango, nectarines, grapefruit and pineapple. Everything in wonderful, fresh harmony. Wow. 5/5
Taste: Tastes just like it smells -- like a hoppy, tropical fruit syrup that you would find inside a can of pineapple or pears (but in a delectably fresh way). The mango/nectarine flavor is so bold, so delicious. Has a little bitter bite upfront, which quickly mellows out amidst the juicy, lightly sweet fruit flavors that linger nicely. 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Quite viscous and syrupy mouthfeel for an IPA, good carbonation. Very juicy, with a little dryness to the finish. Has a nice light bitter bite, but no big bitterness here. 4.75/5
Overall: Simply one of Shaun's best hoppy beers, along with Society & Solitude #4 and Ephraim. Unlike many other pure citra hopped beers, this one has a little bite to it. Seeks this one out, and drink it fresh. Cheers!
Cost: $10 for a 750 ml growler. 1,387 charactersjegross2, Feb 08, 2013

A - Pours a hazy hazy very nice orange hue with a massive, creamy two finger head that fades incredibly slowly leaving tremendous amounts of sticky thick side lacing and a wonderful creamy dense blanket. Awesome.
S - Sooo much citrus here. Wonderful orange/tangerine/tangello notes with just a faint, faint hint of malts and tropical notes.
T - Mind blowing. More of those excellent citrus notes that just burst in juicy explosions on the pallet. Slightly pine notes but this is mostly tropical notes with big bright pineapple, papaya, and tangerine. There is a nice slightly bitter hop finish. 
M - Mouthfeel is standard for Hill Farmstead beers. Nicely medium bodied with solid carbonation.
O - I remember working The Festival and getting a few pours of this before going on my lunch break and sipping at it with my brisket sandwich. This beer, this brewery, is outstanding. So freakin good. 1,043 charactersrudzud, Nov 07, 2012

Sampled 22JUL12
[A] A fluffy snow white head, compact creamy head with wonderful retention. Eventually, complete sheets in concentric rings coat the glass. The body is a soft, pale goldenrod color and is hazy to the point of being opaque. A light murkiness keeps the appearance from a perfect 5.
[S] Clean, bright hops. Citrusy, tropical and sweet with a touch of dank pungency to provide the right amount of balance. Orange pith stands out just above a light grapefruit component and a deeper layer of grainy mango. 
[T] Wonderful sweetness from front to mid palate to prepare for the upcoming bitterness, which is somewhat restrained. This stuff is insanely drinkable.
[M] The mouthfeel is smooth, creamy. Carbonation is perfect, perhaps on the softer side of the spectrum but the gentle effervescence integrates well with the flavor profile. Modestly sweet with a lingering drying finish. 
[O] In one word: masterpiece. 953 charactersFeDUBBELFIST, Sep 17, 2012

Color is a cloudy, peach yellow. Spotty and stringy lace with great stick. .5 finger frothy white head with low retention. Again, clarity suffers but everything else is very good.
Nose is citrus, pine, papaya pulp, mango, with a light hop presence that tickles the nose. Aromatic and very fresh. 
Opens sweet citrus, bit malt backbone with some pine, papaya, and more citrus notes towards the end. Grapefruit in the finish with a citrus hop aftertaste. Really tasty.
Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth in the mouth and quenching and slightly dry going down. Sticky finish with a lingering aftertaste. Perfectly average for a Hill Farmstead IPA.
This is a pretty middle of the road hoppy offering from Hill Farmstead... which is to say that its still better than 99% of other IPAs out there. Definitely worth a try but big brother SS #4 is similar and a bit better. 967 charactersSpeedwayJim, Sep 03, 2012

Pour: Bright glowing, hazy pale orange with two fingers of frothy, white head. Some nice sticky lacing throughout. Head retains well throughout the glass.
Smell: Big burst of grapefruit and mango, mixed with some tangerine and a light white peppercorn. A hint of dough, but very slight. This is one juicy smelling beer.
Taste: Follows the nice with grapefruit juice, tangerine pulp, and a touch of mango. The light hint of white peppercorn follows to the taste, and augments a nice, citrusy bitterness. A touch of doughy sweetness gives the beer some body. Finishes juicy with bright citrus and lightly bitter. 
Mouthfeel: Incredibly refreshing and drinkable. The bitterness lingers nicely, but isn't overpowering in conjunction with the citrus taste.
Overall: Still one of the best Hill Farmstead beers I've had, and nearly tied with Society & Solitude #5 for my favorite DIPA. 926 characterscfrances33, Jul 26, 2012

Pours a hazy orange with one finger head. It recedes to a thin head leaving beautiful lacing during both pours. As with all HF pale ales, the appearance is outstanding.
Aroma is full of grapefruit and orange. It's a wonderful citrus aroma that fills the nose. I keep swirling to get a punch of citrus before each drink. Theres also a hint of piny resin and malt to balance things out.
The first drink punches you in the face with orange, lemon, and grapefruit citrus. It gets a little sweet and piny next and finshes with a subtle bitterness. A true Citra hop lovers dream.
Mount feel is creamy and full. This is one of my favorite things about Shaun's beers. The texture and feel of these beers really takes the flavor to another level. They fill their growlers with care and even with 2000 miles on them to CO it pours like a champ.
Overall, this is my favorite yet from HF. I love Citra hops and this brew really makes them shine. 990 charactersFishPondManager, Jul 23, 2012
4.62/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Double Citra pours cloudy and light amber (yellow/orange) into the glass. A small frothy, white head fades away quickly to a thin ring, leaving behind only a few spots of lace on the glass.
The aroma is loaded with hops. Orange and grapefruit citrus and a fair amount of pine are dominant.
Each sip of this medium bodied beer is smooth with a firm carbonated fizz. The flavor is loaded with orange and grapefruit citrus. Hints of pine area also present. In the background there's enough caramel malt and tropical fruit notes of mango mixed in to balance out the beer. It finishes dry and bitter with lingering orange citrus when gone.
This is a very tasty beer that's loaded with hops. However, there's enough malty sweetness to make it relatively balanced and drinkable. 774 charactersWanderingFool, Jul 23, 2012

4.32/5  rDev -4.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap @ Capone's in Norristown PA (5.5oz pour). Glad I was able to try this one - somehow it lasted on tap for 5 days, and today was the first day I could get over there.
A - Looks like an IPA. A bit cloudy from the hops, and a bit paler than I expected it to be, but no complaints.
S - Really nice - a lot of citrus (mango, grapefruit, a little bit of orange), and a little bit of "dankness". I love the citra hop, and this smelled basically the way I thought it would.
T - Again, lots of citrus. I was a little surprised at the bitterness; I thought that it would be a little bit more resigned and really let the fruit flavors in the hops come through, but it did have noticeable bitterness. It wasn't unwelcome, just a little surprising given the smell. Absolutely no alcohol presence at all...dangerously drinkable for 8+%.
M - Awesome. One of the best I've had on an IPA.
O - Another really good offering from Hill Farmstead. I think if I had to pick one brewery's pale ales to drink forever, I'd have a really hard time picking anyone over HF. 1,055 charactersGreenplastic615, Jul 19, 2012

looks like every Hill Farmstead hoppy pale ale. unfiltered. cloudy golden color with a huge pure white head that sticks around a while and leaves chunks of lacing.
very dank with lots of citrus behind that. citrus pith and some grass clippings. 
soft malts give way to a huge citrus punch that is not overly bitter, but juicy, juicy, juicy and resinous. finishes with just a touch of bitterness before the juicy/resinous hops linger pleasantly forever until you are forced to take the next sip.
medium bodied with the perfect level of carbonation with a resinous, yet juicy feel lingering.
fucking awesome. Yet again, another home run. Even though it's a 7 hour round trip and all my friends force me to pick up numerous growlers for them every time I go.... It's worth it for beers like this.

Pours a hazy gold, reminds me of a 'dirty' champagne. 1 inch head settles to a film and leaves a healthy lacing.
Smells dank and bitter. 
Tastes like there is some tropical fruit in the background, but dominated by the bitterness of the hops. It works very well together.
It coats my mouth, I can feel the oils covering everywhere...Every sip just makes me want another!! The alcohol is hidden well and it is perfect in body, definately not too light and not cloying or too heavy...just right!
This stuff is the real McCoy....I think Kern River might have edged the Citra thing out by just a hair, but it's really close. HF can do no wrong, awesome beer!!! 709 charactersDaveHack, Jul 11, 2012

M - Light-medium body and carbonation. Resinous, prickly, not real thick but just right.
O - Fantastic brew; best of the day at this Hill Farmstead event. Better than regular Citra. Would love to have it side-by-side with Abner for a fair comparison. If memory serves, it is at least as good. Comparable to Lawson's Double Sunshine. 703 charactersTucquan, Jul 09, 2012

Hazy peach-orange color, with a finger or so of fluffy white head that receded a bit but never fully disintegrated. Nice aroma of citrus and tropical fruits, fresh, with hints of a bready malt base. Tastes like a good AIPA should, hop-dominant, fresh citrus zest, pine needles, tropical fruits, enough bready malt sweetness to give balance but to leave the hops clearly in charge. Medium body, crisp and drying, higher alcohol barely noticeable. Another great IPA selection from HF. 524 charactersRifugium, Jul 09, 2012
3.97/5  rDev -12.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - Extremely hazy gold approaching amber. Moderate carbonation with a white head that fades rapidly to a coating.
S - Lots of hop aroma, tons of citrus with some sweet tropical fruit. Hidden behind the hops is a light but solid malt profile with some sweetness left behind.
T - Much like the aroma but the tropical and luscious sweet hop flavors take charge with some citrus on the finish. Nicely balanced with a large malt bill balances the extreme hop presence while staying in the background.
M - Moderate body, a bit heavy for an American DIPA, definitely coats your mouth. Would like it to be a bit more crisp.
O - Solid American DIPA, will definitely fill my growler there again. Not the best you will find, but the place has their fans...driving down that dirt road to the brewery must make them feel hardcore. 822 characterssteelerguy, Jul 08, 2012

Gorgeous pour, as with most other HF beers (IPAs or otherwise). More cloudy than most IPAs, though not as hazy as Nor.
Awesomely juicy citrus aroma. Sweet malts, fruit, grapefruit, fresh hops. Smells like Zombie Dust, and that makes me giddy.
Citra hops are out in force! Grapefruit, mandarin oranges, hints of pine, and plenty of malt to support it all. Low carbonation; nearly perfect body. Sweet and tangy, delicious citra at every turn. Mmmmm.
Significantly better than the Citra single IPA, which smelled incredible but was severely lacking in the flavor department. Even though Citra is my favorite hop, I slightly prefer Nor to this and definitely prefer Abner. Still, Double Citra is another stellar IPA from one of the best breweries in the world. 807 charactersbrystmar, Jul 07, 2012

Pours a peachy orange color with a nice off-white head. Smell is a very light, citrusy bitterness with almost a peachy fruit character. The power of suggestion is strong here. Smells nice. The taste is cleanly bitter, with a really nice, light citrus character. Finishes surprisingly bitter, but balanced and not overly sweet. Good mouthfeel without too big of a body and good medium carbonation. They have really nailed this beer. It is not as citrusy as Double Citra sounds, but it is a fantastically drinkable and balance DIPA that has a nice juicy hop character. These guys know their way around hops. Wow. 658 charactersseeswo, Oct 10, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I got this one as a 12oz pour in a tall, thin glass at the Rattle n Hum.
Hill Farmstead Double Citra pours an opaque orange. It almost reminds me of a glass of orange juice. That is, if orange juice came with a finger of white foam sitting a top the beer. The head displays solid retention, and leaves a fairly nice coating of lace trailing down the glass. The nose is a great display for the Citra hops, and shows why they're one of my favorite hop varietals. The best way to describe the aroma would be to say that it's perfectly walking the line between citrus and tropical fruit, without veering too far towards either. It's also more pungent than the glass of Galaxy I had right before this. The flavor leads off with a bit of cracker sweetness for balance, before a big, yet rounded bitterness sweeps through mid palate. I really find myself liking the way Hill Farmstead packs the IBUs into their beers. The rest of the flavor profile is a perfect recreation of the nose. I love that some sips lean more towards grapefruit and pineapple, while others taste decidedly like mango and passion fruit. The body could stand to be a bit more substantial, but the bright and active carbonation is spot on. This was the last of the three hoppy Hill Farmstead beers I had that night, and I was very impressed with all three. 1,322 charactersaxeman9182, Sep 26, 2011

Hazy, peachy amber color with a large, dense off white head. Nice retention and lacing. 
Aroma is intensely tropical; mango, pineapple and juicy grapefruit with light alcohol and irrelevant malt. What you would expect from citra hops...
Flavor is not nearly as sweet, but still less bitterness and rind then I remember from batch 1. Strong pulp and rind balance out the juicy tropical flavors. Medium thick, chewy well-carbonated body with strong carbonation.
I like this better than batch 1, but I'm still not crazy about an imperial IPA that only uses citra hops. Not particularly subtle or complex; I'd rather have HF Galaxy or Abner or Edward or Ephraim... 737 charactersyourefragile, Sep 18, 2011

The first thing I think of with the aroma is peach, followed by grapefruit and other citrus notes, some pineapple. The aroma is very crisp and refreshing, I could sit a smell this for a while.
The flavour is very juicy, like biting into a hybrid fruit of all the aromas in one. There is only mild bitterness and a nice sweetness that cuts through it. 
The mouthfell is smooth, a little more creamy and thicker then I was expecting, moderate carbonation. Though, as a whole everything works well together. 
This is an incredible beer, the best DIPA/IPA I have had. I have found myself turning away from IPAs recently, but this beer has brought me back to the IPA corner. As a side note I took a 5 hour detour to get to Hill Farmstead and this beer was definitely worth the extra time. 833 charactersmmurphy525, Sep 13, 2011

Unwrapping the electrical tape that held the pop top in place was a feat of nervous anticipation. So very excited to try this beer. The bottle was finally opened and then the hops rained down from above.
Unbelievable dank, fruity, tropical, zesty, intense, resinous and floral aromas that are distinct to the world of hop forward beers came through in such clarity, I couldn't hesitate with quickly taking a big first sip.
Just unreal. The first flavor was so clear with tropical hop intensity that I tried to think of the last beer that this could be compared to. Nothing came to mind, as this was so expressive and bright with that sticky and dank hop flavor. I understand why Citra is getting all the talk. Some light richness was apparent within the flavor but was so throughly enjoyed. Lovely and seamless in every regard. 
Finishing this bottle was like taking lessons as how to taste beer. I was floored by how good this was as I'm usually not someone who feels that the quality of hoppy beers aren't a product by which their origin designates. Hill Farmstead is a destination and can easily be put up next to the big west coast contenders as a brewery that knows how to handle their hops. I'm saying all this without even tasting Ephraim. I can only imagine how good that will one day be... 1,392 charactersBardwashrind, Sep 12, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big Thanks to BearsonAcid for picking this up for me yesterday. Just picked it up from him about an hour ago and I’m already sitting enjoying it in front of some football.
Nice looking pint of beer. Creamy bright white head rises to about a finger and a half. Slowly falls and starts depositing clumps of lace on the inside of the glass. The beer is a slightly hazy gold color with some orange peeking through.
Aroma is obviously full of hop notes, floral, a touch green, citrus peel and some juicy fruits. Very nice, but not quite as thick as I was expecting.. 
What’s great here is the match between the aggressive hopping and the malt profile. Nice bread tones, a bright toasty flavor. Of course, lots of juicy tropical fruit from the new crack version of hops. Seriously, I think PBR w/Citra would be a special beer. (sorry, NOT comparing this to PBR in any fashion) Fairly easy drinking for a DPA, but there is no doubt there is a little more of a kick here.
Carbonation is spot on. Overall alcohol is very well hidden amongst the fruit and hop notes. Just shy of creamy actually. Nice.
This is a very nice beer. Chris told me that he thought it was better than the Kern River Citra. I have to agree. Could b e a freshness thing, but I’m not sure.. My Kern River bottle was also very fresh.
It’s quite a treat having Hill Farmstead on the east coast. Always fun pouring their beers into my glass. 1,409 charactersReagan1984, Sep 11, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Presentation: Split a 64 oz. growler of this with a friend. Served chilled directly into pint glasses. Got this filled on Saturday at the Brewery.
Appearance: Pours a nice, two finger, creamy head with really impressive retention. This held very well in the growler and clearly did not suffer from being stored at all. Hazy, straw yellow in color. 
Aroma: Big bursts of mango, pineapple, grapefruit and other citrus. Some pine notes in there as well. The malt note is quite subdued so the citra hops really get to shine. This definitely showcases the tropical fruit and citrus aspect of that hops.
Taste: Big citrus and tropical fruits. There is a lot of sweetness here too. Big candied hop notes really come through. Some bitterness and pine come through but it matches well with the sweet notes. Really easy to drink for a double IPA.
Mouthfeel: Crisp and medium bodied. A nice creamy head. Very refrshing, with spot on carbonation, even on the second and third pours from the growler.
Overall, a really excellent DIPA from Hill Farmstead. I have yet to have an even average beer from them yet. I'm not sure if I prefer this or their Double Galaxy, but both are nonethless outstanding. Highly recommended if you have the chance. 1,235 charactersGosox8787, Sep 06, 2011

S - Very aromatic, a bouquet of tropical notes. Orange, mango, papaya, peach, and grapefruit. I'm honestly happy to just sit and smell this one for a while, beautiful. 
T - Follows the nose, very fruity and a tad creamy. The malts really smooth things out. The fruit character is balanced nicely by a touch of honey-slathered bread. Sooo good. 
M - A bit resinous, medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy, with a dry finish.

Growler from bring. Thanks, Barry!
As with the other Hill Farmstead IPAs, Double Citra is rather cloudy, amber hued and topped by a lasting bubbly white head.
Pretty awesome aroma. Loads of tropical fruit, papaya and mango in particular, along with a bit of citrusy grapefruit. Little bit of subdued sweetness, a hint of alcohol. Really showcases the citra hop well.
Like the aroma, the palate has a lot of great fruity hop flavor. Peach, pineapple, grapefruit. The malt foundation is solid, but not necessarily sweet. Very slight buttery note that softens the palate a bit. Dry finish with huge biting bitterness that never feels astringent, the signature of HFS DIPAs. Easy to drink, excellent stuff. 719 characterslargadeer, Aug 13, 2011

3.62/5  rDev -19.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Thanks to Tony for sharing this growler with myself and others.
Appearance -- Pours a hazy peach hue with tuft of sudsy white head.
Smell -- Tangerines, peaches, bergamont peel, honey sweetness and a amber-roasted malt. Quite nice, definitely the best feature of this beer.
Taste -- Surprisingly bracing hop bitterness with the flavor of grapefruit rind, a sharp contrast to the fruity/zesty aroma. Nice malting, light with a soft honey sweetness that, unfortunately, doesn't really stand up against the double-dose of Citra.
Mouthfeel -- Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation. Pretty good.
Overall -- Somehow I'm not thrilled with this beer. It seems that the double-dose of Citra has really muddled the subtlety and nuance of this particular hop strain. Well-crafted, certainly, but not the most evocative use of Citra. 835 charactersyeahnatenelson, Jul 04, 2011
4.27/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've had this twice, and held off on reviewing it as the first growler was as flat as the Earth circa 1491. Composite of two reviews here - Russian River tulip and plastic cup serving vessels respectively. Thanks to Sean and Eric for sharing.
A - A finger-plus of white foam settles to a persistent cap, leaving tiny spots of lace. Hazy peach flesh body. When carbonated this looks like pretty good for the style.
S - Unsurprisingly there is a lot of Citra flavor - sweet oranges and ripe grapefruits, light chive note, some tropical fruit juice as well. Malt character is a tad more pronounced than the regular Citra. I like it, but perhaps just the slightest bit less than its lower ABV brethren.
T - Orange sweetness, grapefruit bitterness, a faint touch of of burnt sugar and bready malt character in the periphery. Finish and aftertaste are both quite bitter, but alcohol is extremely well-disguised. I doubt anyone would guess this had ~50% more alcohol than the regular Citra.
M - Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, dry, with no obvious alcohol, and some resinous oily hops lingering on the palate.
D - I prefer regular Citra, if only for its crushability, but this is quite enjoyable as well. The bubbles helped quite a bit, as the flat growler was a chore to drink after a while. In any case, another fine offering from Shaun E. Hill. 1,350 charactersMasterSki, Jul 03, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -10.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Served in a tulip, on tap at Teresa's with one of the sickest IPA lineups I have ever seen. Consumed earlier today, 7/1/2011.
The color is a hazy golden straw. The beer is topped off by a fluffy and sticky looking 1-finger head that displays good retention. Sticky thick web of lace results from consumption. A quick swirl clears the legs and throws tons of spotty bubble clumps on the sides of the glass, but there is no film or legs that result. 
The aroma features grapefruit and piney hops in front of the dank bitterness that their use imparts. In the flavor, lemon zest and grassy hop notes come through to complement those found in the aroma. There is just a hint of malt sweetness, enough to show a vague attempt to counter some of the bitterness, but fleeting, as a DIPA should be. As the beer warms to approach cellar temperature, a warm alcohol characteristic overshadows the hop delciousness that I have been enjoying. A shame, really. This is such a balanced and aromatic DIPA.
Sticky and resinous with a medium texture, this is pretty spot on for what I expect an imperial IPA to FEEL like. A very solid offering, I will now try Abner to determine my favorite of the two. 1,188 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Jul 02, 2011

The beer is yellowish, on the fringes of orange. It's ever so slightly hazy, appearing clear for the most part. The head is about 1/2" thick and leaves a healthy amount of lacing behind.
The aroma tells me I am in for a treat. Tropical citrus galore, with oranges, grapefruit, mango, pineapple. Oh yeah...
All the wonderfully fresh fruit and hop flavors shine through brilliantly. Malt presence is virtually nonexistent, as it should be.
The beer is medium bodied with a creamy feel. The finish is dry, with a lasting hop bitterness. 
Superb. Highly recommended. 612 charactersHuhzubendah, Jun 30, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks Andrew for the sample of Hill Farmstead Double Citra 
This is a beautiful, glowing yellow beer with a nice, tight white head of foam. The beer bursts with bright citrus and fresh mango and pineapple. The DIPA is faintly malty that serves to showcase the glorious hops. The hops are just in full bloom, showing juicy fruit and a hard-to-describe hoppy fullness and flavor that few beers come close to reaching. I've come to the realization that beers like this are best served from the keg that's been transported, and served cold--even the best DIPA's in bottles seem to suffer compared to fresh draft versions like this. This is a great, fruity-hop forward beer, in which faults are hard to find. 705 charactersSoonami, Jun 29, 2011

A: Warm orange-gold body with an inch of frothy, quickly-dissipating tan foam. Pretty good.
S: Yup, that smells like Citra. Nothing but dank, sticky, leafy, fruity Citra goodness. Wow.
T: Follows the nose, with creamy fruitiness joining the sharply leafy, resinous, fresh hops. It's a tad one-dimensional, but what a delicious dimension.
M: Lively, almost prickly medium body. Nice.
O: Terrific DIPA. I love beers of this strength, where the hops have enough backing to shine, but not so much malt as to distract from the primary focus. Yeah, I'd rather have Heady Topper if I could only have one 8% Vermont DIPA, but this one is awesome as well. Yet another winner from HF.

A - Pours a golden hazy yellow color, white head, thin cap, and thin collar. 
S - A nice dose of hops, bitter dankness, cirtus, orange peel, slight lemon zest. The citra hops are really enjoyable to get a whiff of. There also some grassy notes, in there as well. Very enjoyable.
T - Lots of bitter hops, citrus orange peel, some resin dankness. No sweetness, just a nice straight forward dose of fresh citrus notes and bitterness. Very juicy, bitter, and zesty. The 8% is very well hidden.
M - Light to medium, good carbonation, oily finish.
O - Really enjoyed this one and it's easy to fall in love with yet another citra hopped beer. Juicy citrus, hops, and the hidden alcohol make this beer easy to enjoy. Recommend! 802 charactersSean9689, Jun 26, 2011

Pours a very hazy, dark golden orange color with pale golden tangerine hues and a 2.5 finger frothy, soapy white head.  Excellent retention only slowly fading into a lasting cap.  Large chunks of soapy lacing left behind.  
Dank, earthy hop aroma with hints of pine, tropical and citrus fruit.  Earthy and soily with a subtle vegetal character.  Hints of mango and pineapple and a grainy malt backbone.  
Chewy full body with a blast of earthy, dank, dry, bitter hops that linger into a long dry finish.  This is balanced by nice tropical and citrus fruit.  Lots of pineapple along with a ton of grapefruit juice.  Also mango, papapya, orange peel and tangerine.  Dry finish.  Full bodied and very well balanced.  Subtle heat in the finish.  Very good.   788 characterscorby112, Jun 24, 2011

S - Lots of citrus, and sweetness. There is tons of citra on this one, and it's pretty pleasant. A little more grass than I would like, but still really good.
T - Lots of orange zest and citrus hops. It's pretty good, with a bit of piney hops and resin finish. Very nice, although it doesn't taste as clean as I want from a pure citra beer.
M - Medium bodied, moderate carbonation, something of a juice-like consistency.
O - Really good beer, I don't like it as much as their single citra IPA, but I'd recommend this to anyone who likes beers of this style. 663 charactersAgentZero, Jun 19, 2011
3.68/5  rDev -18.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Hazy golden yellow color with a soft white head that retains well. Nice lacing. Nose of oranges, grapefruit and some grain, almost cracker-like. Pleasant, but not particularly aromatic. Taste definitely gives a good presence of orange flesh and tropical fruit. Has a firm bitterness, but not astringent. Some grain comes through as well. It has an interesting blend of almost sweet fruit flavors and then moves into a bitter finish. Medium bodied, sits on the tongue nicely and then finishes nice and dry. I'm a little torn here; I like the beer, it's very well made (no astringency, no alcohol coming through), but even though my score feels honest, it doesn't fully paint the picture. I'll have to revisit this beer if I'm lucky enough to do so. I'm still very excited to try anything else (especially IPA's) made by Hill Farmstead; the quality of brewing is there. 867 charactersbadbeer, Jun 18, 2011

Pours a hazy deep orange.... almost brownish. A nice touch of white head. Looks pretty good especially since the carbonation suffered a bit from the growler. 
Smells ridiculously hoppy. pine, citrus of course, and a touch of cat piss. Tastes sweet and citrus heavy. This is certainly the most orange I've ever tasted in a DIPA... there is a burn almost from the hops. Very strong presence that crushes the malts into oblivion. A Nice thick mouthfeel. Again, carbonation suffered slightly from the growler but still very tasty. the sweetness balances the hops and leaves it quite drinkable!

A: Pours a hazy light golden-orange with a thick bright white oily head that slowly faded into a thick film that left great rings of sticky lacing down my tulip.
S: Sweet smelling, with citrusy notes of orange and grapefruit along with some more tropical type of fruit notes. 
T: There is a touch of sweet syrupy malt but for the most part this is a sweet, fruity and hoppy beer. I get huge notes of tangerine and citrus rind. There are some exotic notes of tropical fruit nectar as well. Malt is toned down but still present. Alcohol is hidden well. 
M: Clean and easy body with a fairly light mouthfeel over a medium body with smooth, even carbonation. The bitterness in this one is highly manageable. 
O: Overall a solid and balanced DIPA that I would gladly drink again. It’s a bit sweeter than I like them, but I’m definitely loving this brewery. Thanks again Michael. 949 charactersscottfrie, Jun 14, 2011
4.28/5  rDev -5.3%Growler thanks to Michael (yourefragile). Awesome to get to try another Hill Farmstead beer!
The beer looks great with a semi clear darker orange hue with golden highlights. Truly amazing sticky lacing on this one and a small ring of head. 
The smell is very open and there is obviously a lot of juicy citrus up front. Fresh cut grass, candy corn sweet honey aromas, and some spicy kitchen notes. Not super complex smell but nice and hoppy. 
The taste has a bit more to it in terms of complexity with a huge bitter hop finish and citrus bittersweet notes with fresh baguette bread malt. Fresh grass certainly is there again. Very raw hops, dry grains, and a little bit of alcohol flavor without the heated edge. 
Much more body than I would have expected from this beer and a great dry finish. Exceptional feel!
Overall this is a nice beer and another great effort from Vermont. Yeah New England is making a run at California. 931 charactersDreadnaught33, Jun 12, 2011

Super-delicious brew. Notes were taken from a growler. Served in a Hill Farmstead long-stem tulip.
Pours a clear golden-orange color with a large white head and a moderate amount of lacing on the way down. Thin collar throughout. The nose brings a super-heavy hop presence with loads of tropical and citrus notes, as well as a few floral notes. The flavor is overpoweringly full of orange zest and other citrus skin with a bit of mango and other tropical fruits in the background. Taste sticks around for a long time and ends with a beautiful bitterness. Medium body and really nice carbonation. Bitter and dry. Delicious. Highly recommended. Wish I had more. 785 charactersThorpe429, Jun 10, 2011

This poured a cloudy golden orange with a finger-and-a-half, off-white head which settled to a coating. Lacing was spotty. Nose was citrus, especially orange and grapefruit, and pine with a slight alcohol back. Taste includes the citrus, of course, but there is a strong caramel malt presence as well. The finish is dry and bitter with little hint of the 8% alcohol. Body was slick, medium with moderate carbonation for a DIPA. This is a very drinkable and I would not hesitate to go for it again. 538 charactersregspeir, Jun 10, 2011

Growler courtesy of Barry (bring), thanks! Enjoyed during game 5 of the NBA finals. Snifter.
A: Vibrant yellow gold (great color). The white head is frothy and massive with very good retention. Lacing is all over the glass.
S: A fruit cornucopia. The hops are bright and very aromatic, lending characteristics of mango, passion fruit, orange, peach, tangerine, and grapefruit. Pretty incredible fruit profile. Malt is covered up by the fruit, but I get a whisper of saltine cracker.
T: The flavor continues the pattern of excellence with an initial blast of fruit accompanied by an upper moderate smooth bitterness. Notes of mango, grapefruit, and orange (flesh and pith) suffuse the palate. No alcohol is evident in be flavor. I don't pick up any taste from the malt. The finish is dry, bitter, and fruity, with an increased level of orange pith and grapefruit rind.
M: Lower medium in body with lower moderate carbonation from the growler. It could use a bit more carbonation, but it's not detrimental. Mouthfeel is sticky and very dry.
Overall: An outstanding Double IPA. Highly recommended. 1,109 charactersHopHead84, Jun 10, 2011

4.23/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Shared by the very generous ejyoung, this was poured from a growler into my Lost Abbey tulip during an impromptu tasting in a parking garage. No venue is off-limits!
The beer looks like a tropical beverage on a beach at sunset — dark, hazy tangerine, with hues of ruby grapefruit and mango yellow. It’s capped by a full two fingers of marshmallow fluff that seems like it would stick around for hours and leaves tons of spotted lace as it slowly descends. 
The aroma is so potent I can smell it from two feet away. Tons of bright, fresh-cut grass in the nose, along with grapefruit peel and stone fruit. Not much sweetness, but there is a nice balance of biscuits and crackers. 
Resinous flavor marked by grass and a wonderful blend of citrus. Orange juice, grapefruit peel, lime, stone fruit, a mild jolt of alcohol. The flavor and accompanying moderate bitterness linger on the tongue a while after the finish. 
Marshmallow-soft and velvet-smooth, the medium body may be the most incredible aspect of this beer. Light carbonation tingles the tongue like electricity while hints of alcohol warmth appear in the chest. It’s so, so smooth. 
Comparing this brew to another DIPA from Hill Farmstead, Ephraim, I’d say that while the latter displays more complexity and smacks you in the face with hops and bitterness, Double Citra is alternatively subdued, balanced and much more drinkable. A damn fine brew that’s able to pull great complexity from a single hop. 1,474 charactersPhelps, Jun 09, 2011

A - Pours murky orange with a nice pillow of one finger tall white head leaving spotty lacing down the glass.
S - Smells of strong, floral, citric hops throughout this one. Hints of tropical fruits, mostly grapefruit, and some light pine round out one awesome nose.
T - Huge blast of citric hops up front never really leaving the picture throughout the experience. Some strong grapefruit and mango flavors emerge once the hops die down a bit. Only the faintest trace of booze toward the end. Finish has plenty of lingering hop bitterness in it. Damn, this is one tasty hop bomb. Glad I got to try it!
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Slick, hoppy, feel with plenty of bitterness lingering thru the finish.
O - I am not sure which I prefer, this one or the regular version. Either way both are excellent hop bombs. It is easy to drink and is packed with delicious hops. When it comes to hoppy beers it seems Hill Farmstead can do no wrong. 1,139 charactersorangesol, Jun 08, 2011

A: Hazy golden orange. Moderate off-white head. Spotty lacing.

T: Tasty. Upfront there is a health dose of grapefruit, orange rind, and other citric notes. Back end finishes nice and bitter with more earthy notes of oily pine. 
M: Medium bodied. Moderate carbonation with a healthy dose of bitterness.
O: I thought this was better than Ephraim, although I am still not sold that the HF IPAs can hang with greats like the Plinys, Furious, HopSlam, etc. 570 characterscallmemickey, Jun 07, 2011
4.08/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Seriously growler side by side with several big IPAs and some boring stouts. Thanks to Mike, Mike, Ben, Jeff, and me for making this whole thing happen. Very awesome afternoon.
Beer is like orange with a mild haze to it, the head is thin and white with small bubbles and lots of lacing, looks good.
The aroma on this one is really really disappointing. Very disappointing. Seriously bummed here. It is plain, mildly hoppy, you really do a disservice to a hop like citra by not including a lot of late additions. This is not due to the growler at least not mostly as several people who have had this on tap were present and said that this was pretty typical.
Beer tastes way way better than the aroma would indicate. Thin in the body and moderately bitter on the finish. No alcohol or malt in the forward, nice fruity hops on the midpalate and overall a good beer all around. It was probably slightly my least favorite of the IPA growlers we had. 948 charactersdrabmuh, Jun 06, 2011

A - Slightly hazy amber/orange liquid with a golden glare and fairly dense cap of white foam on top that yielded some spotty lace around the glass.
S - Intense, fresh Citra hop note with lots of citrus and tropical fruit character, especially grapefruit. Virtually no alcohol fumes here.
T - Juicy hop bitterness up front with a strong citrus fruit character and not much alcohol heat whatsoever. While the hop bitterness is quite assertive, this still remains amazingly drinkable.
M - Medium bodied with mild carbonation and minimal alcohol heat. Finishes slightly dry with plenty of bitterness on the palate, although it doesn't obliterate the tongue.
D - Another fantastic DIPA from Hill Farmstead. I am really looking to visiting the brewery this coming weekend! 864 charactersffejherb, Jun 06, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had this one during PBW at Capone's....
Appearance: Pours a mandarin to tangerine orange with a nice 2 finger white crown that displays retention and lace.
Smell: Lots of citra of course....some grapefruit, some pineapple, some mango to papaya smell, and a hint of spicy pepper. I'd give it a 4.2 if I could on BA, so I'm rounding down a bit.
Taste: Same as the nose but sans the pepper. Comes together very nicely. I'd give it a 4.3 if I could on BA, so I'm rounding up a bit.
Mouthfeel: A touch thin for an 8% abv DIPA but that just makes it all the more drinkable.
Overall: A very nice beer in my humble opinion. Worth seeking out! 639 characterskoopa, Jun 06, 2011

Pours a pretty orange body with a fluffy bone white cap. Good staying power and moderate spider web lacing.
Aroma is of fresh ruby red grapefruit, papaya, and pineapple. Assertive hop aroma. I love the way citra smells. Clean malt backbone.
A very clean beer. Well-crafted. Ruby red grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and papaya with a good shot of bitterness. Not knee crippling, but definitely gets its point across. This guy doesn't quite assault and run the way the elite in this category do, but its in the ballpark.
Medium body with a hefty bitterness in its wake. Extremely smooth and clean.
Overall, I really enjoyed this guy. More than enough bitterness, delivers a solid fruity profile and extremely clean. I'm not willing to say this can take over a PTE, but its definitely playing at the same level. A great beer. 903 charactersColForbinBC, Jun 05, 2011

Whoa - smells like you're sniffing a bag of hops, strong citra qualities, fruited sweetness with spice and barely any alcohol. 
Huge hop flavor right up front, bitterness and dry citric notes. Strong citra with spice and citrus juice. Some fruity sweetness with tropical notes. Lighter malt body with biscuit tones. Finishes dry, bitter, and hoppy with slight alcohol.

The beer pours a slightly hazy orange color with good head retention and lacing. The nose is pretty outrageous in this beer, showcasing tropical fruit, pepper, dry citrus and skunky marijuana. Yes boys and girls, this is one fine smelling IPA. The flavor profile replicates the nose in this impressive IPA, but I'm impressed by how well balanced this hop bomb of an IPA I'm drinking. The finish is very dry and bitter, despite the initial tropical fruit flavor. Mouthfeel is full, long and bitter, but with a bit of an alcoholic bite in the finish. Regardless, this is another outstanding beer from the folks at farmstead hill. 653 charactersJohn_M, Jun 03, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5HF Double Citra pours a hazy straw color with a two finger head that dissipates rather quickly. Sticky, resinous lace patterns are deposited on the sides of my Hill Farmstead cabernet style tasting glass with each subsequent sip.
The smell is an onslaught of citrus - tangerines, grapefruit, tangelo - with a slight dankness of herb. Light notes of pine and evergreen accent each deep inhalation. Wonderful!
Taste is bitter from the get-go, but in a restrained measured way. A lip-smacking pithiness that one gets from fresh citrus registers on the palate carrying the nose of the beer to fruition as it washes across the tongue. A very nice backing of sweet malt rounds out the edges and gives this DIPA a nice balance. The whole thing vanishes rather quickly and dryly as it is insanely moreish. The eight percent alcohol is nowhere to be found.
The mouthfeel is silky smooth as carbonation is slightly fleeting. Perhaps a little thin- but only slightly so. 
Overall this is another great IPA/DIPA from Shaun, who is, to me, the undisputed master of the styles on the East Coast. 1,085 charactersRochefort10nh, Jun 03, 2011

A- Double Citra comes to me looking a shade lighter than the regular citra with some faded white bubbles up top and some small amounts of stick. The color is a light shade of orange.
S- This is citra upped to the max. If you had the regular or exit 16 you know what im talking about. Dank fruit with citrus bursting out of the seams. that about sums it up but some caramel malt backing it.
T- This is an all out assult of everything deemed citra. All the players come out, sour grapefruit, mango, papaya and the like. It's just citrus and some a bit, a small nibble of caramel malt, it's an afterthought after everything is said and done.
M- Bitter, fruity, medium bodied, maybe a bit lighter than that. The taste stays on the tounge for a few. Very nicely carbed, although I would of liked to see more bubbles.
D- Very delicious and very drinkable. While I was a bit let down after the regular Citra from HF, this more than made up for it. 1,001 charactersBARFLYB, Jun 03, 2011

Double Citra (AKA Citra Imperial IPA)
Pours a hazey orange color with a 4" head in my Duvel flared tulip glass, nice. Over time the head vanishes but decorates the walls of the glass with lacing in the form of polka dots and curvy lines. Swirl the glass and a creamy head reappears like whodini, this bitch looks hot...
The aroma is full of fruit and something you would expect on an island. This is what should be served in Saint Lucia. Orange, grapefruit, mango and lemon are all present and remind you of summer.
The taste follows suit with the aroma. Pretty much a fruit bowl of flavor on top of a layer of biscuity malt which keeps it balanced. Well done and the taste compliments the name.
The mouthfeel starts out refreshing followed by a tangy sensation. The finish has a mild bitter feel and is sticky. Very little sign of dryness and perfect for this time of year.
Overall this is well balanced and another home run from Shaun. I really dig this beer. It's not as sessionable as the original due to the higher alcohol content but it's smoother than Abner and Ephraim IMO. 1,153 characters05Harley, Jun 01, 2011

Strong aroma of grapefruit, orange and tropical fruits. The fruity hops dominate the palate and are well balanced by a buscuity maltiness that makes its presence known more in the full mouth feel than in the flavor. The malt flavors are well integrated with the hops. Trying to pick out the malt seems like trying to pick out the yellow from the blue in a green pigment. 
I am not sure I would consistently choose this over Abner. But it does stand out as a distinct DIPA well worth seeking out on its own right. Citra seems like a great choice for a single hop beer. 721 charactersCliffBrake, May 31, 2011

Pours with classic HF haze, orange amber with slightly off-white head that leaves great lacing. Nose is full of that Citra citrus/forest-floor thing: a little leather, a little orange, a lot of lemon...boom.
Palate is biting with hop bitterness and implies acidity (although there isn't any) with it's powerhouse lemon rind hop flavor. Some grain notes come across from the malt, but that slick, hop oil-like smoothness of the Vermont IPA fashion slides across the palate leaving nothing but the idea of deliciously ripe, fresh hop flower/pollen.
My only complaints with this beer are with the Citra hop, as it's not my favorite, especially when flying solo. That being said, I find this more enjoyable to drink than other Citra single hop beers. 867 charactersSFLpunk, May 30, 2011

Very full, creamy mouthfeel, great carbonation.

A: Pours golden orange, completely hazy, 2 fingers of tight white head. Leaves a ton of lacing. A picture perfect IPA.
S: Citrus and more citrus. Tangerine and lemon are the primary citrus flavors with hints of tropical fruits. Has just a touch of sweetness coming off the nose. It is a little muted for what I was expecting, but otherwise great.
T: Just as the nose, this baby is all citrus. A little depth of tropical fruits and hints of pine with a tiny bit of bitterness, not much at all. The malt base is toasted grains with a little crystal malt sweetness. The citrus lasts long into the finish and lingers on for a pleasant aftertaste. Finishes dry and just the slightest bit of bitterness and still tons of the citrus. 
M: Medium to slightly light bodied, moderate to slightly high carbonation, just a little sweetness to give it a balanced, but overall dry character and finish. 
O: While not my favorite kind of IPA (I tend to prefer bitter bombs) it was extremely well balanced and the citrus nose and flavors is hard to beat. Unlike the overwhelming majority of IPAs I've had, I didn't find a single "off" or unpleasant character/note anywhere in this. This is about as drinkable, refreshing, and fruity/citrusy IPA as I can imagine. 1,303 charactersSatchboogie, May 29, 2011
