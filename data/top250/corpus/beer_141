4.29/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Picked up a 16 oz can from TW Arrowhead 3-12-17 for $5.49.  Canned on 2-9-17 and stored in the beer fridge since purchase.
Beer poured an unfiltered golden orange with a nice white head with the initial pour.
Nose is awesome, juicy citrus dominates with some hints of tropical and stone fruits in the background.
Taste is very good; a lovely juicy citrus greets the palate and pretty much dominates the flavor profile.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and both smooth and refreshing. 
Overall this brew is very good and i would repeat buy if a fresh batch comes into Arizona.  Not quite comparable taste and texture wise to the classic Alpine IPA's but very enjoyable nonetheless. 679 charactersarizcards, Jun 10, 2017

4.46/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Glad to see that others have found this unfiltered now!  Floaties are present and it threw me off with the picture on the Surly website.
Have had this on draft a few years back and now glad to see it in cans.  Even though price point is on the high end for a 4pack of 16oz cans, it still works out compared to buying equivalent bombers.
Look is golden haze unfiltered, looks juicy and the head quickly dissipates.    Excellent lacing.
Smell is dank and more fruit forward, tropical, mango, peach, melon.  Hint of malt and like the fact that it is a single type malt ipa.
Feel juicy, juicy, juicy and dry.  Still feeling the tongue tingle a good minute after a sip.  Look of an NEIPA but the bitterness lingers.  
Overall an awesome beer worthy of the ratings across the Interweb on this site and the others.  Get this fresh and you will not be disappointed. 862 charactersPBIU, Jun 01, 2017

L: Unfiltered with sediment throughout, burnt orange/amber with loose white head that quickly fades
S: Straight from the fridge it's pretty two dimensional: dank resiny hops and malt. As it warms, I get more sweet fruits--mango, guava, apricot--and it's fantastic.
T: Very well balanced with the malt sweetness balanced by grapefruit and resin hop bitterness. After warming in the glass, those sweet fruits came out more. There is a very long lasting mild bitter aftertaste.
F: Slicker and boozier than I'd guess for the style and ABV, but not unwelcome. Mild to medium carbonation.
O: This drinks more like a DIPA with just a bit less sweetness and a bit lighter/more carbonated. Very nice, though, especially after it hit 50°/55°. 774 characterse_oly, May 20, 2017

A: Pours slightly hazy golden orange amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a nice layer and leaves some spotty lacing. 
S: Fruity, tropical and orchard fruit, some citrus, underlying dank and resinous pine, biscuity almost bready malt, and caramel sweetness. 
T: Resinous piney undertones do battle with juicy citrus and tropical fruit, orange, apricot, mango, lemon lime, passion fruit, pineapple, peach, slightly dank, biscuity malt, and caramel sweetness. 
M: Medium body, moderate carbonation. 
O: Lucked into finding this can while on a road trip. Probably just a bit past its prime, but still a very nice beer. Should I ever get my hands on another I will update this review. 759 charactersRyanK252, May 16, 2017

4/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to umichfan for this beer. Poured from the can. 
This was a nice departure from all of the NE IPAs I've been drinking recently. It has a really solid malt profile which helps give the beer a larger body than you'd expect from the nose. Aroma is grapefruit and some faint pine resin in the back, with the barley showing up as you pull away. Has a pretty heavy mouthfeel for the style, and there is definitely a boozy kick at the end of each sip. 
Overall I enjoyed this beer. Pretty heavy hitting, even if the ABV is on-par with some other easier drinking brews in the same style. Maybe not something I'd drink one after another, but definitely a treat once in awhile. 676 charactersbmrattay, May 01, 2017

Aroma is citrusy with lots of grapefruit pith. Some juicy smelling tropical fruits. Absolutely delicious smelling beer.
Taste is on the thicker side with a surprising alcohol bite. A little unbalanced in this regard. I get a ton of bitter and aggressive citrus pith. Pure bitter citrus peel. Some pine notes and herbaceous hops. Very green tasting.
Overall, this beer smells better than it tastes. I enjoyed it but it was a bit unbalanced. I see it pairing well with pan roasted chicken with a citrus forward spinach salad. It gets a 86/100. 594 charactersDaverCS, Apr 28, 2017

Pours a hearty orange color with 1/2" slightly off white head.  Aroma is pungent in its Mosaic and the Citra rounds things out behind it.   Easy to see why its rated high from the aroma, it pops with that tropical mango all over it.
Taste, bigger beer, plenty hoppy, bitter, dank.  The alcohol is also noticeable here unfortunately.  I feel like a lower abv by 1% might have pushed this one to a much better score, because its pretty much the only downside to the beer.  The ibu seems high, but its still plenty manageable. 671 charactersrodbeermunch, Apr 18, 2017

Pour is a nice glowing orange with very little head going on. Not many bubbles and hardly any lacing.
Smell is of citrus pine and grassy lemon and tropical fruits.
Taste is very similar to smell. An aggressive bitter and dank taste is at the forefront combined with more citrus / lemon and it has a tangerine quality to it. A nice creamsicle vanilla flavor seems to be there also.
Full bodied and not overly carbonated. Fairly easy drinker.
Overall a very nice beer. This had just over a month of age on it and it still was insanely good. Well done Surly! 583 charactersaoampm, Apr 18, 2017

4.45/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a fiery orange with a solid level of haziness in such a way that when held up to the light, it looks like a Dragon Ball. Head foams up to a finger in height and white in color. Lacing nearly non-existent. Aroma is dripping with hops. Tropical fruit, papaya, pineapple, with a good resin stick in the back. Biscuit and sweet malts help substantiate the aroma. Flavor profile is less tropical fruit then the aroma, but still features papaya, with a hint of tropical fruit beyond that. Biscuit, sweet, and bready malts give the flavor profile a hearty drinking consistency. Finish is resin, with a glimpse of pine hops. Mouth feel is medium in thickness, with a smooth feel. It has a little bit of a watery feel around the edges. Overall, a flavorful IPA that throws out quite a lot of hop notes in a balanced, and non-bitter way. 
Served in a 12oz snifter. 861 charactersHarrison8, Apr 08, 2017

Soapy white head that stands 1 finger tall with good retention and sticky lacing.Hazy orange colored body with low clarity,and distorted light showing through the glass.High amounts of sediment floating around in the glass,and heavy fast moving carbonation.
On the nose I get heavy amounts of citrus and tropical fruit notes,mango,pineapple,tangerine,and oranges.I also get a good balance of floral and piney hops blended with sweet,breaded,and earthy malts.Trace elements of spice in there as well.Very complex aroma on this one.
The palate follows the nose with piney bitter,and floral hops up front,balanced by sweet and earthy malts.On the back end I get citrus and tropical fruit hops also balanced by sweet and earthy malts.Grapefruit,tangerine,orange,and pineapple in the middle and on the back end,and sweet malts balancing the brew from start to finish.
The mouth feel is medium heavy with a sticky and chalky texture,and a dry finish.Heavy amounts of oxidation popping on the tongue.
To be honest this is probably the best IPA I have ever had.Now keep in mind I have only had what is available in Florida,so I still haven't delved into the east coast IPA's that I hear everyone in Massachusetts raving about,but I am moving to Massachusetts in five weeks so those are coming.This is a very well crafted,and amazingly well balanced IPA.I'm probably going to pick up a couple of 4 packs after this.I would HIGHLY recommend this one not just to the hop heads but to anyone who loves craft beers.And I will definitely be drinking it again.Perfect combination of all of the different hop characteristics.Well done Surly,well done!!! 1,705 charactersDraconusDesanctus666, Mar 19, 2017

4.27/5  rDev -4.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.2516oz can into snifter. Murky dark orange body with a fine ring of lacing and a small head that dissipates quickly. Not hazy like the current craze, more just...murky. Not the prettiest beer but that seems to be of little import for hoppy brews these days.
Aroma is exceptional, very fruity and tropical, with a little sweet biscuit thing detected underneath. The flavor falls just slightly short, not quite as bursting with those fruity characteristics as anticipated, but still quite lovely. The overall vibe is much more Dipa than single; the malt flavors arent simply playing second fiddle, providing some depth and sweetness and mitigating the slightly bitter, grapefruit rind finish. 
Body a bit bigger than medium and carbonation slightly under; again these characteristics give the impression of a double. Blindfold I would have guessed this closer to 9% abv.
Good stuff from Surly if not absolute upper echelon or super cutting edge (for what that's worth). 968 characterstobelerone, Mar 10, 2017

Very effervescent and slightly hazy golden color with a head that foamed up, then relaxed to a fizzy, thin layer.  Smells apricot sweet up front, maybe leaning towards a melon side that wraps up with just some hints of pine.  Taste follows the nose for the most part, but pine kicks in a bit faster, but otherwise very much like the nose.  Bitter yet sweet with apricot melon pine in a solidly medium bodied beer that leaves behind a hint of sweetness. 471 charactersgopens44, Feb 11, 2017

CAN: 1 pint format. Aluminum. Standard pull-tab. Metal-inspired label design. Canned 01/27/17.
7.20% ABV. "India pale ale." Brewed with Citra and Mosaic hops.
Served cold into a tulip per the label's instructions.
HEAD: ~5-6cm in height. Frothy and creamy, with a soft yet robust consistency. Recedes within 8 minutes, leaving no lacing. I've seen frothier and fuller more inviting heads, but this is to style.
BODY: Nontransparent. No yeast/lees are visible within, but it does seem unfiltered. Translucent. Colour is a pale copper-orange.
Appears well-carbonated. Not a unique or special appearance for an IPA, but a generally appealing one.
AROMA: I don't think either citra or mosaic hops are particularly well showcased, with this lacking the fresh pungent citrus and blueberry you'd expect from those hops. It offers only mild aromas of both along with some oniony and floral aromatics. I guess some of the kids these days might refer to this aroma as "dank" given its suggestiveness of a coating, fruity, deeply flavoured hoppy brew, but I'd have to refrain myself.
If anything, onion is dominant in this aroma, bringing it more into line with a simcoe-hopped IPA than a citra or mosaic hopped expression of the style. Aromatic intensity is moderate.
TASTE & TEXTURE: More tropical in its fruit profile than classically citrusy, emphasizing mango and tangerine above classic orange or grapefruit. Oniony indeed; I'd guess this was brewed with simcoe in a blind tasting. Mosaic's signature subtle blueberry is absent here to its detriment, but I guess the Mosaic does contribute some of that less interesting tropical fruit flavour. Floral as well. The warm boozy pineapple I despise in IPAs does emerge here, unfortunately.
All hop bitterness is balanced nicely by the pale malt backbone, and I think I find some caramalt in there too.
A very coating medium-bodied mouthfeel emphasizes the onion. A more fresh zesty acidic texture would play better to the citrus. Could be softer and more oily. Smooth and wet, but not too refreshing. Overcarbonated. Not gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, harsh, rough, or scratchy.
The mouthfeel suits the taste well enough without elevating the beer as a whole. There's no ideal harmony of flavour, but this texture does the job and doesn't get in the way of the flavours.
Far from the most complex IPA out there, let alone within Surly's own impressive lineup. I'm not too thrilled with the hop profile, and that comes as a shock seeing as Citra and Mosaic are some of my favourite hop varietals.
OVERALL: Fails to deliver on its Citra and Mosaic hop premise as well as the best expressions of the style (and since those hops in particular are so popular as of late, it's an easy comparison to make). Even single hop Mosaic beers like Lone Pint's Yellow Rose easily exceed this in terms of quality, but regardless it's a drinkable enjoyable take on the style and I'll enjoy finishing the 4 pack I bought. As much as I adore Surly, I can't count this as amongst the best beers in the style, nor would I recommend it to friends over more widely available and more affordable go-to IPAs from the likes of Deschutes, Lagunitas, and others, but I'm glad I tried it once and I wouldn't mind trying it fresh on-draught. If it disappoints, that's only because we've come to expect the best from Surly...and they so often rise to the challenge.

A- pours a clear deep golden-amber color with a one-finger foamy white head that has good retention and leaves some lacing behind
S- bright citrus and tropical hop notes up front, followed by some herbal dankness and some weed aromas.  slightly sweet honey-like malt
T- slightly sweet up front before giving way to a blast of citrusy hops; orange peel, grapefruit zest and tangerine.  Mid-palate turns into some tropical notes of mango and pineapple before giving some herbal & earthy notes in true mosaic form.  The finish is dank, with more herbal notes and just a hint of malt sweetness
M- medium body and carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel that continues into a semi-dry bitter finish
O- one of the most hop forward 'single IPA's' that I've had in a while.  An onslaught of citra and mosaic 838 charactersTreyliff, Jan 20, 2017

Taste: Too malty. Again, not West Coast.
Can't see how this beer achieved a 99% rating. An almost perfect score with IPAs like Building 8 or Societe out of SD and about 50 others that should rank well above. 420 charactersmckag001, Jan 06, 2017

Pours lightly hazy/cloudy golden amber/light orange color with a 1-2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with decent retention, that reduces to a thin lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass, with a fair amount of streaming carbonation. Good appearance. Aromas of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, berry, light pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Incredible aromas with fantastic complexity and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of huge tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange peel, berry, light pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, light caramel, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Moderate pine, citrus peel, herbal, spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, peach, passion fruit, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, honey, biscuit, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance, and minimal lingering hop astringency after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness, increasing through the glass. Medium carbonation and body; with a very smooth, moderately crisp/sticky/resinous, and grainy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is great. Zero warming alcohol as expected of 7.2%. Overall this is an amazing IPA! All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/pine hops and moderate pale malt flavors; very smooth, crisp, and easy to drink for the ABV. Insanely bright, juicy, and dank on hops across the board. A really amazing offering all around. 1,962 characterssuperspak, Jan 01, 2017

4.19/5  rDev -6.1%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4From a 16oz can, dated 11/29/16. Served in a nonic.
Pours a hazy bronze-gold with a meager half-finger of head, gone too fast to really get a good look at, and very little lacing. By the time I get it to the sofa it looks like it was poured yesterday.
Smells of peaches, pears, pineapple and cantaloupe with faint notes of balsam and cookies.
The taste is beautifully bitter with pineapple and papaya, grapefruit pith and seville orange overlaying a crisp sugar cookie body. Finishes with more grapefruit, piney, resinous hop oils on the tongue and a boozy smoldering in the gullet.
Feel is thick and slick, a little soapy, medium-and-a-bit bodied with so-so carbonation and some boozy warmth.
Overall, this is a resinous hop bomb but built over a satisfyingly substantial malt body if a little lifeless in the glass. But, still, a great-big, flavourful AIPA. 864 characterspapposilenus, Dec 28, 2016

3.79/5  rDev -15%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3.75Pours a murky, nearly opaque, amber color with a modest cap of coarse, white froth.  Hop aroma evokes pineapple and tangerines along with biscuity, crackery malt and a dollop of honey and alcohol.
The taste features sharp, unabashedly resinous hops that subjugate the maltier tones suggested by the nose.  Even after affording it time to open up, the best my discriminating palate can do is to label this a pure hop-bomb.  Medium body, mild carbonation, and copious amounts of hops yield a slick, slightly oily mouthfeel.
If you’re a slave to the bitter stuff, this will give you all you can handle to be sure.  For more moderate connoisseurs such as myself, the unilateral assault on the taste buds could do with some diversification. 739 charactersMaximalC, Nov 23, 2016

Smells of cake coated citrus pulp, together with a subtle blueberry quality. Citrus fruits are dominating the nose in a pleasant way, getting depth from a pithy quality, as well as a flowery softness and dough. There is also a bright note of orange pulp atop the lemon, together with some old ginger, producing an awesomly well smelling beer.
Has a soft medium carbonation, perfectly illustrating the refreshing nature of this beer, while displaying a noteable flavor depth, featuring a solid, sweet malt balance. The beer stays soft on the tongue throughout, while its different flavors come together perfectly.
Tastes of an initial lime bitterness, which immediately gets coated by toffeeish, cakey malts, with the lemon regaining a flowery depth afterwards. The hops take a fruity turn then, revealing passion fruit and orange, which are tied to the omnipresent lemon all the time. Develops a powerful, bitter dryness during the finish, in which a herbal note adds to the hops, and the present malt backbone shrinks to a balancing minimum, providing a note of required dough.
This is an awesomly well made ipa. It is juicy, bitter and refreshing, while integrating a nowadays almost uncommon malt note. This maltiness really does enrich the hops though, which would be a little to harsh and one dimensionally straight forward on the palate otherwise. 1,434 charactersaleigator, Nov 19, 2016

4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Tried this some months back, in a can that the owner admitted was several months old and wasn't very fresh.  However, relatives from Minneapolis brought out a fresh can for me, and the difference was night and day.  
The beer pours a slightly hazy light orange amber color with good head retention and lacing.  On the nose, you can tell right off this is going to be a pretty tasty IPA.  There's dry citrus, moderate tropical fruit and a boatload of pine.  A hint of dankness in the aroma profile rounds out the impressive nose in this beer.  However, as good as this smells, it tastes even better.  The flavor profile generally replicates the nose, but there's just more of everything.  The finish is dry and refreshingly bitter in this excellent beer.  Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile in this intensely flavored IPA, and drinkability is terrific in this fairly full bodied beer. 
Quite excellent.  This reminds me very much of fresh batches OTWOA I've had from DC Brau.  Very impressive offerring from the folks at Surly. 1,044 charactersJohn_M, Oct 30, 2016

Served chilled into a tulips glass, Todd the Axeman is a hazy copper orange with thick white head. It's settles slowly and leaves some spotty lace on the glass.
The aroma is super fresh and hoppy, dank, citrusy. Wonderful.
Flavor is sweet up front with candied citrus fruit. It leads into a strong hop bitterness but in balance with the malts. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. It's very bitter leaning from IPA to double IPA.
Overall a fantastic IPA that I've been looking forward to trying. I'm glad to see Surly bringing some of their best to Colorado for GABF. 612 charactersGilGarp, Oct 14, 2016
3.99/5  rDev -10.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Review from BeerAdvocate magazine issue #112 (MAY 2016)
Bold, Full, Bitter, Citrus
Pours from the can with lovely suds and a mildly hazy appearance. Citrus rind, cattiness, cedar, black tea, ripe pears and hay in the nose. Todd The Axe Man offers ample bitterness and deep crispness with a bit of malt body. The initial balance is laid out on the palate knowing it will be somewhat decimated by a wave of hops. I love the use of the Golden Promise malt though, American IPAs need more than the usual American and/or Canadian 2-row. Citra and Mosaic, two damn tasty hops, also make themselves known. My palate surrenders to Surly, but it’s never a chore to take another sip. This one’s a real treat. [Jason]

S:  Huge nose of citrus greets you on the first sniff.  Notes of grapefruit, sweet orange, lemon peel.  Very little noticeable malt character.  Some pine in the background, but the sweet and tart fruit is forefront.
T: Very similar to the aroma.  Lots of tart grapefruit, sweet orange, lemon peel.  Not a lot of malt, and some pine near the end.  A very tasty, fruity IPA.
F: Medium to full body and creamy carbonation.

Canned 08/17/16 at 42 degrees into a hand washed and dried JK snifter
Aroma – resin and citrus
Head large (Maximum 6.5 cm, aggressive pour), off white, frothy, diminishing to an irregular frothy zero to four mm ring and partial layer
Lacing – none
Body medium yellow, hazy (Chill haze?  Won’t know because the beer won’t last long enough to warm up!)  Some sediment from the bottom of the can.
Flavor – Damn!   I have to open another can, the first is gone!  There.  Hoppy, citrusy, is that a hint of peach?  Malt is hard to find but might be there.  Very refreshing!  No alcohol, no diacetyl.
Palate medium, watery, lively carbonation
One of the better IPAs I’ve ever had.  I see I’ll be making beer runs to MN now.

Aroma is Mosaic hops, piney, berries, slamming. Flavor is more Mosaic hops, no wonder I liked it so much.

Nose and taste is nothing but hop bomb. Pungent mosaic and citra goodness. Be warned however that this beer falls off fast. Significant flavor changes by week 6. I'm a freshness fanatic, and consider 6 weeks to be "old", but most beers still retain their goodness, just less of it, at 6 weeks.  This beer actually changes, as the malt seems to morph and the hops pull back. Great beer, but drink quickly. 501 charactersquindog, Oct 01, 2016

Aromas of wet hops characteristics like sticky pine pitch, pepper spice, and moss, with a tangy caramel backbone, and solid citrus notes of grapefruit, orange, and lemon. Heavy, robust aromas coming off of this one. Flavors are dank and sticky forward, a blast of wet, green characteristics like pine needles, moss, and wet grass. Solid richly sweet backbone, with highlights of grapefruit tartness, orange rind sweet, and lemon zest. This has a ton of flavor, dynamic and balanced throughout on a rich, slick, oily body. The aftertaste is more of the sticky and resinous hops characteristics, with the citrus blend sliding into a supporting role. The finish is slick, bitter, and dry, with a lingering resinous character. Great beer. 935 charactersGarthDanielson, Aug 31, 2016

3.3/5  rDev -26%look: 2.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Appearance: unappealing dark copper with a chill haze, almost no head.
Nose: mosaic is prominent with some sweet malt.
Taste: taste is pretty decent but nothing mind blowing. It's enjoyable. First you get the mosaic on the top of the Tongue followed by a syrupy finish from the golden promise. I do wish it was less syrupy.
Overall: there is no way this beer is a 99. It is under carbonated and not very juicy. Like many of surly beers it is overrated. I think it scores high is because Minnesota does not have any good ipa's even that are distributed to us.  I'd give it a 92 overall. If this is a 99, what is Julius? A 150? 628 charactersRossi24, Aug 27, 2016

Appearance: hazy gold-amber with medium bubbles to the body. White head rising to a of one finger's length. No lacing whatsoever, dropping to nada after two sips or so. 
Smell: heavy citrus scent, you can smell it even when the glass is down...super potent.
Taste:  Deep complex grapefruit. Heavy floral with hops. Can't quite get it, but there something about this beer that is so thirst quenching and super addicting. 
Mouth: Malty finish, little chewy. Feels like bread with a light sour note to it. 
Overall: Power house brew, Easily an plus rating on my end. Drink with love and don't leave it on the shelf. Salud! 665 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Aug 23, 2016

Really damn good beer. Smooth flavor and easy to drink. Oddly enough I think it was a bit light, I enjoyed Furious more. I bought a 4pack of cans while in MN and had it on draft at Surly and it was super good BUT i know I do a better assessment in the friendly confines of my home.
pours a gold hue with a solid head, looks great.
smell is mild hops.
taste is fruity, i get mango in this. hits hard on bitterness but a clean taste.
oddly enough i don't think is anything mindblowing BUT it does pretty much everything well which is a special trait. 612 charactersWiffler27, Aug 23, 2016

Smell: orange citrus and peach. Very fruity and sweet. Just seems a little faded. 
Flavor: taste of orange, peach and other notes tropical fruits. Its not as bitter as I expected, just fruity and sweet with some malt. This is far more balance then many IPA's I have tried. The after taste has a nice lingering orange flavor. 
Mouthfeel: light to medium bodied, very smooth and clean. 
Overall: a winner. I love notes of peach - I could almost swear peaches were added. Must be the Citra hops. 554 charactersBenish, Aug 07, 2016

4.37/5  rDev -2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy opaque orange with almost no head. Steams of tiny bubbles course upwards in the beer - the only sign of any carbonation. Without that it would look completely flat. 
Smell is a wonderful aroma of pine, citrus, orange, orange zest, and a bit of an herbal aroma that takes a back seat to the citrus and pine notes. You certainly get some dank notes on this one, but its not too bad. 
Taste is a refreshing and crisp array of flavors. From the pine and sappy like flavors to the orange, grapefruit and hints of mango, the flavors are strong and distinct. Some prickly carbonation initially provides some punch to the flavors, but that quickly gives way to a bitter pine finish. 
Mouthfeel has some prickly carbonation initially. There is an oily feel to the beer, with some sappy bitterness that coats the mouth. 
Overall a phenomenal IPA from Surly. The lack of any head on this beer is disappointing and affects the smell and feel, but the flavors are great. 974 charactersFBarber, Jul 03, 2016

3.21/5  rDev -28%look: 2.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3Poured from the can into a Spiegelau IPA glass.  Canned June 15th 2016.
Slightly dull orange amber, but with a bit of opaque brightness to the body color.  Head is off tan, hardly any retention to this at all, and dissolves in bubble bath light suds to barely a pencil thin collar.  Looks like a dead brew, and lack of head on this for an IPA is pretty lackluster on the appearance scale, with hardly any rising carbonation going at all.
Very nice mix of dank earth and juice hop varieties.  Sticky and stinky notes of weed and mild dank orange citrus character.  A solid aggressive one, that doesn’t leave much to the imagination.
Palate is pretty much flattened.  Cola thick flat juice of earth and a lifeless limp body.  Dead carbonation, with depth of malt and a bunch of lively hops that are just left to hang.  Dead flat beer, a mouthfeel that just doesn’t liven up anything and comes across as something that didn't even attenuate.
This is such a dud compared to the Amager version I had, this is totally lifeless.  Pieces are there, but missing the body entirely. 1,079 characterssmakawhat, Jul 02, 2016

4.49/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5When it comes to Surly and IPA, there's no shortcuts allowed. Greatness will be achieved. And it all comes down to Todd, you know- the axe man to see it through. Beatings will continue until morale improves!
But those beatings probably let up a little with Todd The Axe Man which pours a hazy golden amber color with dusty silt settling, and while casting a loosely knit cap to greet the rim. Its bright hop bouquet is eye-opening- illuminating with citrus and tropical fruit and the herbal dankness that reminds us of the similarities of hops and cannabis. Fragile sweetness of light caramel and honeysuckle soothes the early palate before the onslaught of hops set in.
As the middle palate unfolds, the hops come spewing out- pink grapefruit and tangerine strike the tastebuds first with a quick follow of pineapple, dragonfruit, mango, lemon and peach. Shaking its early sweetness, the beer trends dry in order to let the hops shine. Becoming more and more bitter, the final frame is one of fresh grass clippings, citrus peel, and that herbaceous leafy cannabis charm.
Medium-light on the tongue, the beer's dry taste and texture proves to weigh effortlessly on the mouth while the taste tightens; circulating around the smooth hop bitterness and its deeply resinous grip. A long aftertaste of citrus peel and pine resonate deeply and expanding with bitterness. 1,367 charactersBEERchitect, Jun 24, 2016

S - Mild, but has orange, cedar, and black pepper. Overall ok.
T - Tons more citra on the taste with oranges and mango. A lot of peach juice here too as are minty and piney hops.
F - Undercarbonated, but not totally flat. Goes down easy. Citra presence makes it easy to drink.
O - Lack of carbonation and a bland nose are wiped away by delicious Citra hops. A minor juice bomb with enough hop bitterness to balance it out. 488 charactersThrewRedButter, Jun 23, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Had this on tap before a huge show our band played. I usually don't retroactive or back-date reviews, but this still deserves a vote. 
It tapped out a beautiful hazy mango-pineapple blush, with plenty of depth and light on the edges. The head was of course typical world class on tap, with a heavy head but one that didn't get in the way of imbibing. 
Aromas off the teat are a total bouquet of mango, grapefruit, pineapple, fresh squeezed orange, and light pine. As it warms it smells a bit more like armpit sweat, but hey that's part of an IPA's nature. 
I have to admit - some hopheads are a bit too gushing on IPA's and I was a bit skeptical. I was unwilling to invest ina  four pack, nor was I unwilling to shell out $4 a can for a single. Luckily this was on a cheap tap night during a week day...and holy freaking crap...what a total explosion of fresh fruit, juiced mangoes, and light pine resin. It keeps drinking easy and just doesn't quit. Have these guys perfected the IPA style?
Feel was equally on par - just amazing overall with a creamy finish and ample carbonation to keep the love going 'round. 
Overall, Todd the Axe Man was a total experience. I figure $18 a four pack is still a bit steep, HOWEVER, if enjoyed by each can slowly over a few weeks, it's well worth the price of admission. 1,312 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Jun 23, 2016

16oz can purchased at a Family Thrift Center in Rapid City South Dakota, driven to Denver, and then flown to Chicago. Served in a pint glass. Dated 05/10/16. I drank a lot of this in Rapid City and brought four or five cans home.
Pours clear golden with a slight brassy tinge and a coarse, medium-sized head. Moderate to low carbonation. Smell is terrific, strong clear fresh hops, honeysuckle and flowers.
Taste is a nice blast of piney/grapefruit floral hops with a little tropical hint and a honeysuckle sweetness. Finish is super bitter.
Mouthfeel is resinous and dry. Overall, very good beer. 611 characterssnaotheus, Jun 11, 2016

A beautiful dank and tropical bouquet of spicy cannabis and sweet tarts comes off the nose.
Grapefruit and tangerine flavors come first, followed by fresh hops with a peppery bite and light bitterness. Some biscuits emerge and peach is the predominant fruit characteristic in the flavor. Drink fresh, because this falls off quickly and becomes a caramel and prune mess.
Tangy, with a medium body, Axe Man is a little tingly on the tongue. 595 charactersSabtos, May 20, 2016

AROMA: Smells like a big glass of piney citrus juice. But I also get melon, pineapple, mango, and stone fruit. Nice caramel notes, too. Big orange and pine here, very nice.
TASTE: Pine, citrus/ oranges/grapefruit. Caramel, pineapple, basically everything from the aroma. 
FEEL:  Medium full body, above average carbonation, a little sticky/oily and drier on the finish.

4.04/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4L: Pours a quite murky bright glowing gold with tinges of orange and a mild quickly dissipating head. Tiny specks of yeast sediment held in suspension, with no head retention or lacing to speak of. This beer’s got a very pretty hue, but really could have used more carbonation and foam in the pour.
S: Lots of Mosaic and Citra coming through right off the bat with notes of papaya, mango, ripe apricots, lemons and some candied watermelon. There’s also a decent amount of thick bread crust-like malt.
T: Very approachable with some grass and stonefruit from the hops. Hops are fruity, revealing citrus and mango, but on the whole more grassy than I expected, particularly in the finish. Not as dry as I would imagine, a decent amount of soft bready malt that accentuates the perception of sweet, juicy tree fruits. Finishes semi-dry with bitter lemon rind and a lingering herbaceousness.
F: Medium-plus body with surprisingly little carbonation. A bit lush and silky on the palate.
Thoughts: A pretty solid IPA with a really nice nose, but I didn't find this to be nearly as jaw-dropping as many BA's have led us to believe. Despite employing some of my favorite hop varieties, I found there to be a bit too much grassiness, as well as more malt than I look for an IPA of this strength. 1,294 charactersthepenguin, May 08, 2016

I haven't been wowed by a beer since my first Heady Topper, but this has just done that. This is a must try. 496 charactersHoppinDad, May 08, 2016

S- Strong citrusy and tropical fruit smell, with a malty sweet-corn aroma 
T- This beer has a hefty amount of late additions hops/dry hops. Crisp bitterness right away that fades quickly to mango/pineapple/papaya fruit flavors. Malty sweetness present too. No piney or earthy flavors with this. 
F- Low carbonation, which fits this beer well. Medium bodied. 
O- One of the better beers I’ve ever had. Certainly not under hopped, providing a lot of flavor. If only it didn’t cost so much… 695 charactersolelion, May 05, 2016

A - Hazy golden-orange with a 1.5-finger white head and moderate lace
S - DANK/onion, very ripe pineapple, orange, papaya, earthy spice bordering on funk.  Lots of aroma.
T - Flavor is initially hop forward like liking a gooey hop bud, then some orange flesh, pineapple, plenty of pine, sweet biscuit and burgeoning orange zest bitterness.  These flavors hang in for a long time and remain balanced; albeit with no lack of bitterness.
M - Medium+ body and medium carbonation.  Substantial, resinous and prickly.  Very nice.
O - A killer IPA for sure.  Jam-packed with aroma, flavor and feel.  My only quibble is I'd have liked less dankness in the aroma as it is very forward. 810 charactersTucquan, May 04, 2016

3.39/5  rDev -24%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.25Aroma - strong cat pee immediately after the pour.  This disappears after a few sips, thankfully.  What's left behind is lemon peel,  pine, pineapple skin, caramel malt, cracker malt, light onion and mild mango.
Taste - practically no bitterness.  Lemon, melon, pineapple and a pine finish.  Weak for an IPA.  Decent for a pale ale.
Overall - this is one of the most disappointing highly rated beers I've had in the past year.  The price is absurd for what you get.  The verdict is weak sauce. 495 charactersBrew_Betty, May 01, 2016

There's a nice deep hop burn on the tongue and the body is resinous and a bit thick for an IPA, but I suspect it is due to not being filtered. 391 charactersFranziskaner, May 01, 2016

Kenwood Liquors - Homer Glen
Canned: 3/31/16
A touch of haze runs through the Axe Man while the body runs toward the pale golden side of the spectrum. The carbonation is tiny and running to the surface in streams from what seems like every surface of the glass. The foam is dirty white and a little on the soapy side, bubbles of all types, growing to a finger in height on the pour. The foam dissipates rather quickly to a thin skim and leaves behind some patchy lacework here and there. A good looking beer.
This beer can be smelt from feet away. As it's cracked the hop profile fills the room. It's dank off the bat with big resinous notes and a big funky parmesan cheese character. This whole thing is quickly followed, and actually overtaken, by citrus zest and tropicals in the form of pineapple and mango, a touch of tangerine as well. The citrus zest is pretty bold yet softly sweet. All this over the top of a pale malt, barely noticeable base maltiness of sugar cookie.
The flavor profile is much like the nose. It seems to me there is a decent variety of hops used in this beer but they all seem to work well together. It's dank again upfront but not showing much of the cheesiness. The middle is loaded with big tropicals; mango, pineapple mostly and, although not tropical, tangerine. The finish is mostly citrus peel, orange and grapefruit, some candied most pure. A little bitter aspirin on the swallow. The malt base is sugar cookie pale and a base for the complex hop profile. Very good beer.
The body is silky smooth with a soft carbonation. Moderate in weight with a growing bitterness that runs along the sides of the tongue from the get go and really takes hold on the swallow. The bitterness eventually grows to a touch higher than moderate and while the finish is juicy upfront it dries up quickly, accentuating that lingering bitterness.
Todd the Axe Man is a damn fine beer and that much can be told from the second the can is popped and the hopping fills the room. While it's hugely hoppy and brightly bold it is in no way tough to drink in quantity. It sits right in that 7% sweetspot for IPAs. While the price tage is rather hefty, I'd pick this up in a heartbeat before I'd pick up any other overpriced Surly 4-Pack, Wet comes immediately to mind. 2,304 charactersjoe1510, Apr 24, 2016

Smell is nice blend between tropical and citrusy. Getting some mangos, papayas, and cantaloupe. Some orange peel and lemon zest is creeping through. Nice subtle sweet bready malt.
Similar to the smell. A nice medium between tropical flavors and biscuit-like malt. Very light bitterness, very accessible. 
Mouthfeel is actually pretty velvety

Citrus and orange fruit notes followed by malty sweetness

Feel- carbonation much lighter than most imperials. Allows malt and hops to figure more prominently in the experience
Overall-  great beer I was glad to have opportunity to try this .  Will b seeking this out again for sure.  One of my top 10 iPas/ imp IPAs of all time.  It's that good 594 charactersjcflorian, Apr 11, 2016

S: Dry smelling grapefruit with some light tropical notes
T: It has that hint-of-Surly flavor (you know what I mean).  The tropical component isn't as thick as some other recent IPA's that I've had, and that's a good thing.  It balances well with the more citrusy flavor.  Melon after taste.
F: Smooth with light carbonation.
O:  A great IPA with a GREAT hop combo.  I taste this one differently on my palate - all over.  Others seem to hit only one area or another.  Again, the tropical hops are more subdued.  I think other IPA's overdo it. 611 charactersSchimms, Apr 10, 2016

Appearance is amber/orange, without much head.

Taste:  grapefruit, pineapple, fruity, malt.  A bit of dank and piney.  There's a bitter kick at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end.  Very intense.
This has such a punch that it must be a DIPA, right?  But the 7.2 ABV keeps it technically in single IPA territory.  Regardless, it's competitive with the best DIPAs for over the top hoppiness.  Or is that happiness? 589 charactersVashonGuy, Apr 07, 2016

4.65/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The nose starts out so bright and shiny, fresh but not raw. An amazing complement of fruits comes on strong- pineapple, mango, papaya, berries (straw and rasp ;)), tangerine- although the impression is mostly tropical. It is balanced by a touch more than a suggestion of that dank/weedy/sweaty quality; just enough to keep things from going off of the fruity rails. The malty sweetness augments the aromas to give it a rich, juicy feeling. 
The palate is more dominated by the dankness, although all of that fruit is not all that far behind. Mouthfeel is moderately full and rich, and the bitterness is strong yet seemingly intertwined with the residual sugars and malt flavors. Any thoughts of a cloying experience don't even get off of the ground; the sweetness is there for support and has been made to know its place. Pineapple plays a great initial role, but citrus is dominating the second half of the glass. By the end the flash and rind are having an evenly matched tug of war.
According to the can, this beer wants to be really brash, but thankfully doesn't succeed. Instead it is very bold and aggressive yet ultimately balanced; and very, very palatable. Masterfully done, Surly. 1,192 charactersTongoRad, Apr 04, 2016
3.96/5  rDev -11.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 416oz can courtesy of the largesse of @Ri0. My first beer from Surly, this was canned on March 1st, 2016, per the stamp on the bottom of the can. At first I somehow got the idea this was an Imperial Red Ale, but the can does say IPA, on it. Not sure how I initially misread it, but glad @Ri0 reminded me of it’s need to be drunk soon.
Poured into an imperial version of the Sam Adams Boston Lager glass (I don’t own an actual tulip glass, so I couldn’t follow the instructions on the can!), this is a hazy, orangey-amber colored brew. Initially featuring a 1 ½ finger, bone white-colored head, said head dropped fairly rapidly, leaving behind no lace.
Tropical fruit-like hop aroma, though not hugely pronounced. I get some strawberry-ish sweetness as well. There’s an earthiness to the aroma as well. Rye malt? Wheat? Very interesting.
Tropical fruit beginning, but with a substantial earthy, spicy malt backbone. Imperial-ish (7.2% isn’t quite Imperial territory for me, but it’s pretty close, and this actually seems like a bigger beer in a non-boozy way) Midwest IPA? Seems about right for that scenario. The maltiness prevents the finish from being really dry, but it’s dry enough.
The body for this is somewhere between medium and full. Oily, resiny mouthfeel.
For an American IPA, this is a malty beer, certainly more malty than I am used to. I like it, but more than one per session is something I’m not sure I would want to do. Big shout out to Ri0 for breaking my Surly cherry! 1,508 characterswoemad, Apr 03, 2016

Taste:  Lemon and grapefruit follow the nose; mild pine. 
Feel:  Light carbonation, tongue coated in hop resins.

Appearance: Dispensed a hazed, orange-hued body with a tall, off-white head.
Smell: Nicely tropical papaya and citrusy aromatics raised above the lightly sweet-scented, lightly grainy malts.
Taste: A light pale maltiness with a minimal albeit appreciable amount of cereal sweetness on hand. Tropical-minded pulpy pureed fruitiness with a backing of sharp citrus and touches of dank herbs. Moderate bitterness. Closes out fairlydry and bitter.
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied. Medium carbonation. A touch of oiliness on the mouthfeel.

4.85/5  rDev +8.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Another A+ beer from Surly. Personally I enjoy it way better out of the can over what I experienced in certain bars. May have been the awful cleaning chemicals in the glass or the rinsing of the glass with water. Anyhow, this beer is the sister (palate-wise) to Abrasive Ale. If I had to put their (D)IPAs in order it would be 1. Abrasive 2. Todd 3. Wet 4. Furious. 365 charactersTwinCities, Mar 30, 2016

4.05/5  rDev -9.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured a copper gold color with decent head which quickly dissipated. The aroma was very strong and immediate - grapefruit, citrus and hops. Taste is strongly citrus, but very bitter all the way through the aftertaste. Body is quite full for this type beer. The bitterness makes this beer less desirable than Abrasive, or PseudoSue which are more balanced. 356 charactersjaypaul522, Mar 30, 2016
4.78/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a Dogfish traditional oversized snifter.  Bottom of can says Canned On: 03/09/16.
A- Pours a slightly hazy medium amber color with a 1/2 inch off-white head that retains decently before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a half sheet of surface foam.  Semi-resilient lacing leaves tiny clots behind.
S- Full on tropical fruit explosion with the perfect amount of cereal grain malt sweetness in the back.  Notes of pineapple, mango and grapefruit.
T- Taste follows the aroma and adds in an assertive but graceful bitterness to the mix.  Totally nails that aggressive but balanced concept.  And the ABV keeps it in the sweet spot where I could crush these all day.
M- Sharp from the hops with medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- I love it when I trade for a beer and it lives up to all its hype.  Highly recommended and definitely up there in my top ten single IPAs. 931 charactersImmortale25, Mar 29, 2016

However, I'd take PsuedoSue over this 10/10 times for its reduced bitterness and additional meatiness. 
Also lost a bit in my overall for being too expensive. 346 charactersElumbeer, Mar 29, 2016

Taste is a bitter hop bite up front that washes into citrus and peppery notes.  Has a nice balance that should work for a hardcore IPA drinker and someone who just likes drinkable beer as well.  Really nicely done by Surly. 307 charactersanteatr23, Mar 14, 2016

Big tropical nose and hazy, unfiltered look invites you in. Overripe mango and pineapple sweetness edged with hop bitterness, and both the citra and mosaic hop profiles get to shine here. The feel is full and yet not overly sticky. Top notch. 357 charactersBarnoloid, Mar 12, 2016

4.63/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75COD 2/1716.  Copper/orange pour with a touch of haze and garnet.  World class head volume, lacing and retention.
Quite aromatic world class nose of mango, orange, pineapple and a touch of pepper with light pine and rind forming the hop base.  Underneath is a slightly sweet biscuit and caramel malt base.
Medium body with a very smooth texture that is oily and has light creamy aspects.  Superb carbonation with a fair burst of effervescence in the middle and a finely bubbled prickly finish.
The flavor profile is World Class and shows how good an IPA can be.  All the flavors of the nose appear over a slightly sweet malt base that is bready, yet toasted and crisp, coupled with a caramel undertone.  Bitterness is moderate and balance is perfect.  Tropical hop flavors arrive first with orange flowing to pineapple and finishing with mango as the mid-palate sweetness arrives.  The middle produces a moderate rind bitterness with a pine aspect underneath.  Here is where the ride begins.  From the middle on, bitterness rides on a rising wave of sweetness that sees it shift from rind based to pine and ends with a light peppery spruce by the finish.  Underneath the bitterness, mango and passion fruit frolic in the sweet base.  The finish is slightly dry and the combined flavors and bitterness of the finish linger.  This beer takes its competitors to school and is a must try. 1,386 characterstillmac62, Mar 09, 2016

Picked these up the day my local shop got them in...the freshness shows.  Pours a hazy-ish light amber-orange color, haze clears up some with time.  The aroma makes this beer...it's phenomenal.  Smells of citrus fruit, some tropical fruit too, and you can smell it all from feet away.  My wife commented on the smell from across the room.  The taste matches, with grapefruit, passionfruit, citrusy goodness, and it finishes with a dank bitterness that's not overwhelmingly (but definitely there).  It's not one that I would call "balanced", and that's a good thing.  Medium body, well-carbonated, finishes somewhat dry.  Overall, my favorite beer from Surly aside from Darkness. 727 charactersScooter1027, Mar 06, 2016

Look:  The beer pours a hazy orange brown.  Off white head, maybe a finger of head from a somewhat aggressive pour.  Carbonation seems a little low.
Smell:  Holy crapeth, the aromatics are excellent.  Passion fruit initially, pine, and after a swirl of the glass, some mango and other tropical fruits.  One of the best beers I've had, aroma wise.  
Taste:  Taste is pretty close to the nose, there's some passion fruit and tropical fruits throughout, and then I get a little bit more pine near the end.  
Feel:  The carbonation seemed a little low on the beer, but not really awful.  As my can warmed, it seemed a bitterness appeared in the finish.
Overall:  Wow.  I've had Todd on tap several times, and have always loved it, but for some reason this can really did it for me last night.  The can seemed hazier than the tap I've had at Surly.  Seek this beer out if you're into tropical, fruity IPA. 1,057 charactersCfred371, Mar 03, 2016

Beautiful, brilliant burnt orange color with a nice white head.  The smell and taste was perfect for an APA.  The citrus, resin, and funk smell and taste was big for an APA, but all in goodness.  The balance achieved by additional malt still allowed the funk to come through which I like.  I am so glad I finally got this. 439 charactersGobearswalter34, Jan 31, 2016

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had on tap in a tulip glass while at the Surly Beer Hall. What an amazing West Coast Style IPA.  Wonderful tropical fruit, especially grapefruit, hits your nose instantly.  On the palate it is extremely well balanced with juicy citrus peel, grapefruit and hints of pine resin.  It packs a nice bitter punch on the end but nothing overwhelming.  The finish is extremely long and smooth.  This is one of those IPA's that sets the bar high and keeps you coming back for more time and time again.  Full marks for this amazing brew. 527 charactersDrinkzumbeer, Jan 21, 2016
4.47/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516oz pint served on draught at Monk's Pub in Chicago, poured into a shaker pint glass, reviewed from Tasting Journal.
The beer pours a very hazy and cloudy copper color, apricot and gold hues with a finger of taut, white, foamy head, great retention and wonderful lace. The aroma is fantastic, bursting with hops, dank, resinous, but also bright and floral, loads of citrus, floral, juicy, piney with crisp cereal grains offering a bit of sweetness. The flavors are great, just a massive hop profile, tons of pine, dank grassiness, wildflower, citrus peel, juicy tropical fruits, really snappy and crisp, assertively bitter to boot with a great bite. The mouthfeel is great, coating, crisp, lively, medium body, exceptionally dry, big biting finish that isn't unwelcome.
Verdict: A damn fine IPA from Surly and Amager Bryghus. Exploding with hops, juicy, crisp, intensely flavorful and fantastically bitter without losing any flavor. Easily one of my new favorite IPAs and one I hope to see in rotation as frequently as possible. 1,031 characterskevanb, Jan 21, 2016

A: Deep, hazy orange-gold body under an inch of off-white head. Decent retention, moderate lace. Pretty nice.
S: Intense hoppiness, with lots of pine and grapefruit. Some tropical notes, too, as well as a surprising amount of crystal malt sweetness. Hugely aromatic, and very inviting.
T: Follows the nose: flavor abounds. Fruity hops, resinous hops, caramel malts, everything that you expect to find in a DIPA is here in spades. Citrus, spruce, and malt are all huge presences, but no one element overwhelms the others. Plenty of bitterness on the back end to keep the sweetness in check. Terrific.
M: Medium-to-full bodied, with plenty of carbonation. Works well with the flavors.
O: Excellent beer, much in the vein of the now-old-school DIPAs that turned me into a hophead years ago. Well done, Surly.

From a 2.5-week-old can, pours a hazy glowing orange with a couple fingers of fluffy white head. Not much lacing. Good bit of fine particulate matter suspended in the beer, and I have no problem with that. Head dies down to almost nothing after a few minutes, and lacing is minimal. Nonetheless, a good-looking beer. 
The moment I popped the top on the can, the room filled with the smell of oranges and pine. Just from popping the top. One of the most deliciously aromatic beers I've ever had. Once in the glass, I also get layers of tangerine, pineapple, peaches and some dank. Underneath is a bit of overripe melon and just a little sweet malt, though the fruits and pine dominate for sure. 
Taste is everything in the smell, and it's awesome. One of the best IPAs I've ever had the pleasure to drink. Feel is perfectly medium, with just the right amount of prickly carbonation. Lingering fruity aftertaste mixed with piney bitterness, though nothing crazy. 
Overall, this is just fantastic. Killer like an insane person with an axe, and not of the guitar variety. 1,088 charactersBeers-es, Dec 14, 2015

S: The huge citrus aroma reaches out and grabs your olfactory senses; in particular, there is orange, grapefruit, and a slightly floral aroma. 
T: A full range of citrus hop flavors dazzle the pallet with grapefruit, orange, pineapple, and a layer of floral flavors. And with the hop flavors are strong and present, it has measured dimension that is not overly bitterly. In addition, the hops are supported and somewhat balanced by a a solid malt base. This has a certain sweetness that many other IPAs do not possess. 
M: Solid base malt and moderate carbonation and of course the resin from the hops provide modest mouthfeel.
O: A pleasant delicious and distinctive IPA that is one of my favorites. At 7.3 percent ABV this is not a lightweight session IPA. 826 charactersParnellJoseph1138, Dec 04, 2015

4.14/5  rDev -7.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Such a solid IPA!!!
This one opens with orange honey hue. White head leaps up two fingers, and quickly subsides.
Smell is glorious. Some non-pithy citrus. A bit of pine and malt comes through as well.
Taste is even better than the aroma. Citrus hops meets hints of tropical pineapple. But there is an earthy hop bite also that dances gracefully with a solid malt backbone.
Finish is full enough to be totally respected and loved.
Great stuff!!! Thanks @Kevinpitts 463 characters2beerdogs, Nov 20, 2015

4.46/5  rDev 0%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Three month old can, kept well.
Look:  Amber and orange body that you can see shadows through.  White head.  Slippery lacing as I move the beer around in the glass.  There is no lacing left behind as the beer disappears from the glass.
Smell:  Top of the line.  Rich overripe tropical fruit, sharper pine, and more overripe pineapple.  The aroma is strong and heavy.  The finish is longer and almost clean.  What is left in your chomper and on your tongue is desirable.      
Taste:  The majority of this beer is described above.  Tropical fruit is big in the taste, dominated by pineapple.      
Feel:  Medium base.  Medium low carbonation.  Thick lather in the mouth, some of the thickest I have had in an IPA, not the thickest, but one of the thickest.  Resinous and you could call it tacky on the tongue.
Overall -  This beer is delicious and drinks well, it has a big bold taste.  It tastes like a double but, has the ABV of a single.  Bravo.  
I am sure a fresh can will boost the score.  Someone send me one... 1,020 charactersmabermud, Nov 05, 2015

So this is almost 3 months old, so take that into account with this rating, although it is still pretty damn good at this age, so I don't think I'll be pulling down the rating with this review.
It's a fairly cloudy orange-yellow leaning toward the pale side.  Head doesn't build too much at this point, but does linger on the surface and at the edges.
Nose is an alcohol or spruce laced fruit basket.  I get the impression of tropical fruit, some sweet melon notes, and definitely some grapefruit rind.  I also get piney hints behind it all.
Opening seems a little melon combined with grapefruit pith.  There is a sweetness to this that has a hint of alcohol to it, and is perhaps a sign of age; muted sweet fruit notes (tropical, I think) are there as well, but also have likely faded due to age.  By mid taste, the bitter pine and tingling spice notes have taken control of the taste, though there is a lingering honey sweetness that keeps them from overwhelming the palate.
At this point, its a bit of a heavier feeling brew, and the flavors paint my tongue with a stickiness that almost forms a film on it.
I am pretty sure I would have really enjoyed this fresh.  I enjoyed it quite well with 3 months on it, and there are some aspects that seem to me they could be from age (based on other experiences).  Given the other reviews, I'm willing have faith that it would be even better fresh. 1,419 characterscjgiant, Oct 30, 2015

4.09/5  rDev -8.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pint can into my Duvel tulip.
A:  Pours a pretty vibrant, slightly hazy copper with 1" foamy white head that lingers at first, then dissipates quickly.  Retention is above-average, lacing is so-so.
S:  Amazing - huge notes of honeyed citrus, pine & lemongrass.  Caramel & almost a lemon-drop candy note come into focus as well.  Exquisite.
T:  Comes on with flat out lemon/lime, very assertive leading into the mid palate which begins to show more depth.  Initial graham-cracker malt helps to temper the citrus, which then leads to a caramel/honey sweetness that is trying in vain to compete with a sudden blistering bitterness.  This mid palate is truly something special - there's an elasticity to the flavors here that I just haven't seen before.  The finish is bitter as well, although it diminishes smoothly into a mellow doughy malt note tempered once again by citrus.
M:  Moderate-to-slightly high carb married to a fairly full, supportive malt frame.  It's just a little bit soapy & finishes surprisingly crisp.  Well above-average.
O:  This is one of the more well-thought-out & generally impressive IPAs to have passed my lips. 1,142 charactersMUTINY, Oct 12, 2015

A - Looks great, opaque golden orange with 2 fingers of head.  Leaves very little lacing.
S - Aroma is awesome, rivaled only by Heady in strength, explodes out of the can the moment you pop the top.  Like getting hit in the face with a sliced grapefruit.
T - I'm still getting grapefruit, perhaps not as direct as GF Sculpin, but very obvious.  Bitterness comes along to finish.
M - Medium carbonation and mouth feel.
O - Outstanding IPA.  I'd love to see Surly put this in some type of regular rotation. 534 charactersspacecake9, Oct 08, 2015

4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Awesome can art. Pours a very murky orange with a moderate white foam head that quickly recedes. Leaves a thin ring of lacing around the edge and a very thin layer at the surface.
Aroma is exploding with tropical fruits and citrusy hops. Intense mango, grapefruit and pineapple. 
Taste is dominated by hops and a strong bitterness. Pine takes a stronger hold than in the aroma, and the tropical flavors take more of a backseat (although its still strong). Orange comes on strong as it warms, joined by some nice, grassy floral notes. Hops fade considerably as it warms, allowing the tropical notes into the spotlight, where they do well paired with a bitter finish. 
Mouthfeel is light bodied and an easy drinker for a hoppy, bitter IPA checking in at 7.2%. Could easily down this entire 4-pack, possibly even two of them. Finishes dry.
Having the taste of Pseudo Sue relatively fresh in my mind probably hurt this one, but still an excellent IPA. Looking forward to the rest of the 4 pack, as I'm thinking my view will only improve. 1,037 charactersmajorbase2, Oct 07, 2015

4.44/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Surly Todd the Axe Man. India Pale Ale. Originally brewed by the Danish brewery Amager in honor of Todd Haug and his musical skill. The bottles that were imported here sold out quickly and were never seen again. It wouldn't be like Omar or Todd to make a beer and name it after themselves. They merely re-created Amager's tribute and kept the self-aggrandizing name. Nothing wrong with that. And now, it's in cans, and now I'm drinking one. "Beer to shred your face, in a can." Let's see if my face gets shredded.
1 pint, 7.2 % alc. by vol.
Appearance: Lightly hazed, bright golden/amber-hued, solid ivory head, leaving a little lace.
Aroma: Ah, there's the stuff, that's the spark. A bit of tropical fruit character is mixed in with the usual citric suspects. Some pineapple and mango to match orange and grapefruit. The gentlest whiff of cat pee takes time with the scent of the pine forest floor. Some floral meets the fruit, and it's quite lovely. (Gosh, that didn't sound metal at all....perhaps I should imagine it reminds me of great suffering and horrible pain? Conjures images of demonic hordes and rivers of blood, etc., etc?)
Taste: Fierce flood of hoppy delights ensues from the onset. Nice and bright, aggressive, assertive, all
the wonderful things you want from a big and bold IPA. "Wonderful things"? How utterly un-metal of me. How about: "fills the fateful warrior with the pleasure one only gets from vanquishing foes underfoot and defiling their families with vileness and violence." Man, I should go to Munster, Indiana and work for Three Floyds.
Hops deliver the goods, but the bright, buoyant Golden Promise malts really do the trick with this one. Medium-bodied, long, bitter finish. Tasty as heck. Incredibly enjoyable. No, I can do better than that. "Rewarding as the moment of perpetrating unthinkable evils upon an unworthy world." Hmmm. Not great. I shouldn't write heavy metal lyrics. 1,920 charactersfeloniousmonk, Oct 03, 2015

4.58/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer was just outstanding.  I am way late getting on the bandwagon.  No matter, as a beer drinker that thinks hoppy beers as an after thought this American IPA acts so un-American in that it is not overly hoppy, not overly citrusy, not overly bitter.  Surly’s Todd the Axe Man is an American India pale ale that belongs in its own category.  There are the  the tropical fruit  aromas that emanate from the glass —pineapple, grapefruit, mango - not heavy on citrus or grassy aroma.  There is even a suggestion of honey sweet malt.  The grain bill of this beer is made of only one malt, which is  Golden Promise. This Scottish base malt is not seen much over this way which has been a signature malt used in many of Surly’s brews.  The Golden Promise single malt gives the beer a pale-ish yellow orange  hue which is slightly different.  On the palate bitterness is medium but nicely and slightly understated.  It does not overpower the palate going in or the finish.  It is playing in accompaniment with honey malt and fruit and slight grassiness singing in harmonious ahhhhh!    The mouthfeel is medium-bodied with medium carbonation. and  creamy.  This beer is  remarkable in how it is so drinkable and off-dry going off the beaten path of bitter and bone dry.  My palate is talking like a mature cheeze -it. 1,320 charactersAlequine, Sep 30, 2015

A: Moderate pour yields 3/4 finger white head which quickly becomes lace.  Hazy brass-colored liquid.  Lots of little floaties, so this could be evidence of copious dry hopping.
S: Deep wafts of mango and pineapple during the pour!  Orange, delicate and clean malt.  Dank, deep prickly evergreen.
T: Ruby red grapefruit juice, mango, slight rustic bread.
M: Dry, citrus pith bitterness.  Grat biter dry finish, but not a tongue buckler.
O: Amazing.  The best I've had from Surly yet.  Clean malt base with terrific hop aroma and flavor.  I had Heady Topper last night and this holds its own against it. I must admit that I had this after a great 3 mile run also. 728 charactersdfillius, Sep 29, 2015

Pours cloudy orange with two and a half fingers pale head. Pale floaties hang in suspension throughout the body. The wide, persistent collar leaves a good deal of clumpy lacing. 
Bright citrus aromas. Orange, tangerine, peach, grapefruit, melon and a hint of sweet malt. Outstanding.  
Bittersweet citrus and tropical hops rule the flavor. Grapefruit, orange peel, mango, peach, pine, pepper and a little cracker. Delightfully balanced and incredibly easy to drink. 
Slick, medium feel with moderate carbonation. Finishes with a bitter yet flavorful blend of citrus and tropical hops. 
Todd The Axe Man is a damned tasty, distinctive IPA with a good mix of hop flavor and bitterness. I'm happy to have finally had the chance to try this much lauded IPA. 838 charactersThickNStout, Sep 26, 2015

The taste is dominated by the bitter fruity hops, with a nice sweetness and hints of the pine and resin. The Citra and Mosaic are well showcased in this hop bomb. Orange, grapefruit, pineapple and mango are all present. Creamy texture with a good amount of carbonation, very smooth and a good body that lasts and makes you want more. The smell and taste of this pleasant looking beer makes it one of the best american IPAs i've had. The depth and aggressiveness is reminiscent of a DIPA, which is nice with an IPA abv. 686 charactersbeersdmf17, Sep 24, 2015

Flavor is heavier on the sweet malt than I would like, bitter citrusy hops. Really reminded me of OTWOA. Would have loved to try this hyper fresh, though. 281 charactersShanePB, Sep 18, 2015

Purchased: N/A; Received Sept. 14, 2015
Consumed: Sept. 16, 2015
Misc.: Collaboration with Amager Brewery; Canned on July 29, 2015
Thanks Sam!
Poured an orangeish, honey, hazy color with 1-to-2 fingers of greyish, off-white head. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom of the glass. Minimal wet lacing on the sides of the glass. Average-to-below average retention. (Sight - 3.50)
Smelled a potent whiff of Mosaic, Citra, resin, tropical, juicy red grapefruit, mango, passion fruit, tangerine, pine and earthy citra rind. Very nice. (Smell - 4.75)
Taste was pretty good, although not quite as good as the nose. Got juicy Citra, Mosaic, tropical, juicy red grapefruit, Juicy Fruit, bitter grapefruit rind, passion fruit and mango. Could practically taste pulp. (Taste - 4.50)
Medium body. Creamy-to-oily texture. Average-to-lively carbonation. Long, juicy Citra finish. (Feel - 4.50)
This was just an awesome IPA, which might have been slightly lower for me if it was a DIPA (which is what it tastes like). Really looking forward to the other three. (Overall - 4.50)

S (4.75) - Great Aroma!  Big floral hop smell.  No maltiness, but I don't like that in an IPA.
T (4.75) - Great tasting IPA.  Nice hop-forward beer with a slight malt backbone.  Clean, crisp, all that an IPA should be.
F (4) - Not super carbonated, but that makes it easy to drink.  Smooth
O (4.5) - Very happy with this beer.  One of the best I've had in the category.  I had my first one quite fresh after canning, and one a month afterwards…both tasty.  Will buy this every time I see it. 621 charactersNickTheGreat, Sep 15, 2015

S: Pineapple and guava.
T: Papaya and citrus. A tad sweet; would be nice if a bittering hop came through in the finish.
F: Right on target for this style and ABV. Sufficient body.
O: A great IPA that drinks more like a double IPA, especially in the sweeter character. 331 charactershoppymcgee, Sep 15, 2015

This smells super fresh and hoppy. Herbal, piney, dank and grassy with layers of fruity quality and slight tropical appeal like mango. A hint of cheesiness comes out as it warms.
This tastes herbal, pithy and pulpy with some citrus and slight alcohol fruited aspect. That slightly cheesy hop aspect makes itself known mid-palate with a clingy oily hoppiness but with plenty of depth of flavor and resins.
This is medium in body boasting moderate levels of carbonation. This stuff is pretty awesome and I can see why so many people were talking about it. If you have access to this, you really should scoop some up. Wish I had more. 826 charactersstakem, Sep 10, 2015

Also get resin, cedar, pine, and definitely some sweetness. Maybe some papaya or passion fruit. Taste is pine, resin, grassy hops and biscuity caramel malt. Fruit flavors follow the nose, but taste is not as fruity as the aroma. Getting some grapefruit on the finish. The mosaic hops add a nice bite to balance the malty sweetness. Light to medium mouth feel. Lightly carbed too, but the bitter hops keep it moving across the palate. It's a malty IPA with bright and bitter hop presence and great fruit profile. 594 charactersdanh53, Sep 10, 2015

Pours a bright, golden color, medium head, some cling.  Smell brings lots of dank hops, some citrusy hops, light malt, a little yeast.  Taste follows the nose with the dank, Mosaic hops, still picking up some citrus.  A little more malt than usual for the style, providing a nice backbone for the hops.  Good bitterness throughout, but this is no face ripper like Abrasive.  Really not that bitter, overall.  Smooth, solid body, refreshing.
Not a big fan of regular IPA's, tend more towards Imperial IPA's, so even though I thought this was a really good IPA.....  I can understand the big reviews this gets, though.  Was surprised the Mosaic hops were more prominent than the Citra hops. 734 charactersstortore, Sep 09, 2015

The aroma is strong, and one can pick up the smell from a distance- citrus, white bread, and piney hop resin. Taste is of pronounced, but in no way harsh, bitterness, white bread, some bread crust, and citrus. Mouthfeel is high or heavy medium, and Todd The Axe Man finishes dry, puckering, and drinkable (to me).

Smell was definitely encouraging with hoppy citrus notes,.... Flavor was similar with citrus and grassy hops... not much in the pine-y or tropical fruit department,... However, I have the same gripe I have with every hoppy beer I've had west of New England---too much malt, yuck.... But then again, I used to love brown ales now I can't drink them---tastes change!! Still, well-made and one of the best I've had outside of the trio (TH/HF/Tr) 526 charactersReady4aHeady, Sep 08, 2015

The taste does not dissapoint. Light, but somewhat sweet, malts hit for just an instant before the taste of tropical fruits and strong citrus hit and blend all together. A wave of Orange and slight lemon hit about 70 percent through the mouth, before a firm hop oil grapefruit finish hits you. The balance here is amazing, definitely in my top 3 ipas to date. Well done. 459 charactersDustin_Sallitt, Sep 08, 2015

3.92/5  rDev -12.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from the 16oz can to a sip of sunshine tulip glass. Canned on 8/04/15. 
Pours a amber/orange hazy color, with half a finger of head if that. Head dissipates quickly and minimal lacing on the glass. 
Aroma is very malty and caramel, slight pine and citrus notes. 
Tastes is citrus, lots of maltiness, grapefruit with grapefruit bitterness, alcohol hidden well. 
Overall disappointed with this. After hearing so much about this beer I expected a little bit more. Dont get me wrong this is a great beer but definitely not a top 5 maybe not even top 10 IPA I have had. But that being said different strokes for different folks, I am not a huge fan of malty IPAs and this beer has a good amount of maltiness. 710 charactersvicinandp, Sep 07, 2015
3.9/5  rDev -12.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 16oz can into a tulip glass. Acquired in a trade. Canned 7/29.
Pours a deep amber slightly hazy body with a modest off white head that reduces fairly quickly to leave not a lot of lacing or retention. 
Aromas are mild, caramel, pine, resin, citrus, peppery. On the tongue is caramel and pine, resinous bite on the follow through, crushed advil bitterness on the finish. Mouthfeel is OK, medium body and carbonation. 
Overall not very impressed.. there are dozens of more easily to acquire IPAs i'd rather have. 527 charactersgcamparone, Sep 07, 2015

4.51/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A: Moderate murk in this orange-bronze beer, sprite bubbles rise through the suspended sediment. I hate sediment. Head doesn't last, I wonder how intense this is really going to be if it can't maintain a billow. I also wish the description was more offense, a la Arrogant Bastard. If they are going to threaten to shred my face and use all the cliche aggressive adjectives, I feel like they should put an outright "Fuck You" somewhere in there too. Get some balls.
S: The nose has got it all. Citrus, floral, earth, pine. Nearly the full range of what hops have to offer. Slight sourdough malt, bitter. Fantastic.
T: Also great. Not as emotive of flavors as the nose had, but still robust. Orange juice and peel, pine, vegetal, some good spice like rye, also very, very bitter. Malts keep it palatable, but never really show their face directly. Pulpy woody pine on the finish, observable upon retro-olfaction long after the last sip.
M: Medium-full body, nicely thick for an IPA. Carbonation makes it lively, but not biting.
O: Despite being neither intimidated nor offended by the label, this was still a great experience. Great variety of hop flavors, intensely bitter, but somehow not too off-balanced. A nuanced, complex, encompassing, structurally sound hop bomb. Expensive, but definitely worth a one-time purchase. 1,326 characters1000lbgrizzly, Sep 05, 2015

Body is light to medium with a bit of bitterness on the back end.

S: A nice mix of pine and tropical hops. When I poured this, I got a blast of bright hops to the nose and I was a few feet away. Some mango, rich piney hops, smooth malt and some bitter resin.

Smell - The nose is largely spicy pine with slight citrus notes. 
Taste - At the front, spicy pine comes through with wonderful sweet malt notes. Toward the back pine continues with hints of lime. The taste fades fairly quickly but is worth it. 
Mouthfeel - The thickness of a DIPA exists, though the staying power does not.

A - A beautiful deep, rich, hazy orange.  Half a finger of off-white head, with small bubbles.  Plenty of carbonation rising to the top of the glass.  Pretty!
N - I could smell it even while holding the glass up to the light.  TONS of orange complemented by grapefruit.  I get virtually no hop bitterness at all.  This is amazing.
T - There it is.  Too bitter for me, but still very tasty.  Lots of pine, not nearly as much citrus as I expected from the nose.  Perhaps it's too much mosaic and not enough Citra for me.  Very well-crafted, however.
M - Nice and frothy.  From swirling it around for a second or two the whole thing becomes froth, and I always find that impressive.  This is really a well-made beer.
O - Not my favorite from Surly, but extremely good stuff. 897 charactersCraftFan5, Sep 01, 2015

The onion is hard to taste but easier to smell. Super complex well brewed beer that is up there with the best in the world. 356 charactersFriedSlug, Sep 01, 2015

Look: Poured into a snifter.  Hazy orange with a small amount of head.
Smell: One of the best smelling American IPAs I have ever had.  Citrus and funk smell with the combination of the Citra and Mosaic hops.
Taste: Tastes just like it smells - citrus bomb with a subtle malt backbone.  Not a ton of bitterness as expected with a regular IPA - just enough.  
Feels: Hides the alcohol very well.  Lighter/Medium bodied.
Overall: On par with the best IPAs I have ever had and makes Surly's own Furious seem ordinary. 630 characterstmryan21, Aug 31, 2015

A bright-orange and cloudy appearance. 3 finger head with strong carbonation 
Tons of fruit and citrus in the nose. There is an onion smell that creeps in as well
Taste is fantastic. All the citrus fruits from the nose come through, with a perfect amount of hops. 
Medium body with strong carbonation. It has what is best described as "juicy" characteristics. 
Overall this was an amazing beer. Fantastic in every category. I will absolutely be seeking this out again. 537 charactersAllDayIPA23, Aug 31, 2015

Taste- Pineapple, passion fruit, and mild grapefruit. A bit of fusel alcohol in the finish. 
Feel- Oily and slick with a pleasant bitter hop bite. 
Overall- I missed getting this in cans and I'm so glad I found this on tap. This is one world class tropical juice bomb. I would love to see this as a seasonal or regular in their rotation. 579 charactersPrager62, Aug 29, 2015

Pours hazed deep golden amber with a thin white head. Spots of lacing stick.
The smell is of very intense citrus.
The taste is of boozed-soaked citrus (especially grapefruit) with a bit of caramelized malt. It has a perfumy/grapefruity aftertaste lingers.
It is full-bodied. Somewhat astringent. Raw alcohol lingers on the palate.
Almost too intense, it is a "sipper". Good for a boozy hop fix. Don't know that I'm impressed enough to think that it is worth the 5.25 a single / about 18 a four-pack. 602 charactersjwc215, Aug 29, 2015

Damn good stuff. this is bigger and more flavorful than most IPAs. Bordering on a double.  However, this is currently the 25th best beer in the world. Don't think it's that good. In fact I passed on grabbing another $17 4 pack yesterday. Little expensive for a single. 498 charactersDrunkAl, Aug 29, 2015

Settles into a hazy  orange with minimal head after a very bright almost shiny orange with nice foam on the pour. Reminds me of a double IPA in its strengths - strong citrus and pine notes on both the nose and taste that balance nicely with the high hoppiness. The great thing is it has very few of a double IPAs faults-it's not a malt bomb, and it has only slight bitterness on the aftertaste of a semi-whole mouth filling feel. I'm bummed I only got to get one of these, but I'm damn glad I got to try it. 550 charactersmschrei, Aug 28, 2015

4.38/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25So I had heard rave reviews about this beer and decided to do something that i'd promise myself not to do again: trade for.  Luckily, the person I traded with is among the best traders out there (literally, what a great guy!). 
A: Hazy dark orange, apricot like in color. Has a golden orange color when held up to the light with half of a one finger white, foamy head that very quickly dissipates into nothing (really, this beer lacks substantial carbonation).
S: Dank! Super dank combined with a fresh hop punch to your nostrils. You really have to sniff hard to detect anything else. I noticed a hint of peach, some pine and perhaps pineapple and mango. There is a distinct sweetness that is detected besides the very apparent dankness.
T: Very similar to the nose. The sticky hop oil like dankness is the first thing I taste followed by a tropical citrus like sweetness.
M: Mild to zero carbonation wise, thin-medium mouthfeel, hops are prickly to the tongue with a substantial dry, bitter finish. The stickiness seems to cling to the mouth upon finishing a sip.
O: Very glad I can put the rumors to bed! Sorry folks, this beer is good, but more of a "Lupulin River" by Knee Deep Brewing (CA) good. This is not on the level of any New England IPA that i've had (8 of the 9 top NE IPA's). 1,290 charactersMA_hops, Aug 28, 2015

A: Dirty murky amber very small head 
S: Peaches, cantaloupe, pineapple with a very little bready nose on the end
T: very juicy lots of that nice harsh pineapple giving way to light cantaloupe and peachy stone fruit with a nice light crackery malt backbone 
M: light with just a shade of syrupiness low carbonation 
O: This beer is fantastic if you want a fruit explosion from your IPAs its so juicy and just a very light cracker malt backbone if you ever had Swish by Bissell Brothers or Epiphany from Foundation Brewing you are going to absolutely love this beer. 614 charactersSomethingClever, Aug 28, 2015

4.5/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a glorious pounder can into a Teku glass.
L: Pours a dark orangy yellow that is a breathtaking golden orange when held to the light. There was about a finger or 2 of white head that disappeared into a ring around the glass.
S: Smells pretty damn dank. Mosaic and Citra hops are an incredible combination and I've been waiting for a brewery to do this. Strong orange, peach, and papaya notes are what I smell immediately. Some grapefruit also comes through in addition to a little bit of pine and even some mango. Man the depth of smell is wonderful.
T: Pun intended, this is a bit abrasive, but not really (if that makes sense.) The taste follows the nose pretty well. The zesty orange and peach come through immediately with the grapefruit, mango and papaya notes coming through shortly after. This is damn good. There is a nice amount of bitterness, but it's not overbearing at all.
F: This has a supreme amount of flavor for a beer that is 7.2%. The carbonation is prickly, but it works with the beer very well. The alcohol is not present, but I don't think I could have more of one of these in a sitting. I can't say that for other IPAs that even go up to 8%.
Overall: This is a really nice beer. I am quite spoiled with all the wonderful IPAs that are available to me in New England, but I am glad that I was able to see what Minnesota has to offer. The bitterness is nice, as well as the flavor. I am a sucker for citra and mosaic hops and to see them combined in an IPA is something that I've been waiting for. This is my first beer from Surly and I'd love to try some other IPAs that they have. Especially if they're as good as this one. 1,662 charactersRichD, Aug 27, 2015

Look - slightly hazy, light amber color. Small amounts of fine sediment.
Smell - fantastic.  Fresh and powerful citra and mosaic hops are obvious.  Would like this as an air-freshener.
Taste - follows the smell. Citrus is abundant but balanced.
Feel - Smooooooth.  Ever so slightly bitter at the very back end.  
Overall - I would make this my go-to beer if it was more abundant.  Warrants the hype.  Should be considered among the top IPAs out there. 475 characterseifster82, Aug 23, 2015

4.07/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4I remember having this at the brewery this last summer, and being surprised by the fact that I did not enjoy it that much considering that it is one of Minnesota's highest rated beers. As such, I've been meaning to have the Axe Man again for quite some time, just to see whether my opinion of it would increase if I had it during different circumstances. 
Pours a small and relatively bubbly head. The body has a hazy golden color, with little visible carbonation. 
Smells of citra-laden hops, with some floral undertones. I also got quite a large degree of fruit in the nose, both of exotic fruits, but also of apple. 
Quite a nuanced taste, with both piney and bitter hops, and the sweetness and juiciness of the exotic fruits. The taste also features a grassy and dank aftertaste. The bitterness of the hops become more prominent as it warms. Carbonation is delightfully light, and mouthfeel is medium-light, and quite dry. Even though, I tend to prefer my IPA's to be juicier. 
I can really appreciate this beer, while also conceding that this is not for me. The admittedly moderate, yet present bitterness is above what I would consider optimal. Furthermore, and probably more importantly, its dry nature aggravated the bitterness. It is undoubtedly a case of me not seeing eye-to-eye with the vision however, as my problem with Todd is more the case of me not appreciating what this beer is going for, rather than it not being a phenomenal brew. As made evident by the fact that I feel apologetic for 'only' giving this a 4.07. 1,537 charactersWer34truh, Aug 23, 2015

Pours a cloudy dark orange color with about a finger of bright white head. Some yeast floaties in the beer.
Smells of extremely dank hops. One of the dankest beers I've ever smelled. Also get pineapple, mango, papaya, orange juice, and grapefruit. All the fruits are very sweet and juicy. Also get a bit of pine and chive.
Taste is a complex assortment of juicy tropical and citrus fruits and dankness. Some of that chive makes an appearance as well. A wonderful dry finish with a significant citrus pith and pine resin bitterness. 
Medium body. Slightly crisp and creamy. No carbonation issues here.
This beer is extremely hyped up and for the most part, it lives up to the hype. Really shows what intensity and complexity Citra and Mosaic can have. One of the better, if not the best, single IPA's coming out of the Midwest right now. 875 charactersbrewskis, Aug 23, 2015

It pours a hazy but pretty orange color with a 2 finger head that fades rather quickly.  The nose is very strong and very dank.  This might be the most dank beer I have poured.  Also strong citrus with this.  
The taste is strong citra and mosaic hops dankness.  That is the primary mover of this beer.   Juicy citrus also makes an appearance.  There is a nice blend of bitterness and sweetness as well.  The 7.2% ABV is invisible.  Very well hidden. 
Some have had cans where the carbonation was a little weak.  My 7/16 canning was too.  Other canning dates have had no carbonation issues.  Poor lacing, but who cares?!
This is a fantastic beer worthy of the ratings you see.  It is a bit spendy, but worth the price.  My face is shredded.  Glad I have more of this waiting for me.  
Can did have the date canned. 852 charactersBeer-vortex, Aug 21, 2015

Great fragrant nose of tropical fruit and pine.  One of the best IPA aromas I've had.  Taste is right in line with aroma.  Well balanced with nice malt. Finishes with what I'd expect from Mosiac hops (one of my favs).  Could easily mistake this for a DIPA 291 charactersRoland7792, Aug 21, 2015

Surly makes some great beers, but this one is just above average. It uses some great hops and this beer is not overly bitter(which is a nice change because Surly loves to make brutally bitter hoppy beer most of the time), but its just good not great. I would take masala mama any day over this as the best hoppy beer in minnesota. 410 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Aug 20, 2015
4.58/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a pale gold with white head, typical IPA appearance. Nose is incredibly fragrant with heavy tropical notes paired with dank resinous hops. The mosaic seems to be a little more prominent than the citra, the two jive together nicely. Notes of melon, mango, pine, and earth all come to mind on the aroma. The flavor is smooth with juicy tropical notes up front, moderate bitterness, and a refreshing finish.  This is a fantastic IPA... $18 for a 4pack seems a bit steep, but it's definitely worth a try. 506 charactershomebrew311, Aug 20, 2015

The aroma is the best and hits you as soon as you crack the can: grapefruit, candied fruit, orange pith, pineapple resin. All coming at you in waves.  Stunning.
Taste is excellent although a step down from the aroma. A get a big wave of citrus and tropical fruits up front, a bit of sweet OJ in the middle and a piney finish that lasts till the next sip.
Mouthfeel  is medium.
Overall, it's pretty damn good 564 charactersSD-Alefan, Aug 19, 2015

Quite cloudy with a white head that settles out rather quickly, esp. for style.
Complex flavors, but as with the aroma, not all are that pleasing.  Fruit for he hops and mild to moderate and growing bitterness, which isn't too bad.   Heavier malt than most.
Rather thick for style and moving towards a cross between IPA and DIPA.  Almost chewy.  A bit lower on carbonation, which is fine.  
I don't know.  Just something isn't striking my fancy on this one.  I'm not inclined to search this out, esp. at this price. 702 charactersgarymuchow, Aug 19, 2015

4.66/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I wanted to try this one for a while but had come to terms with the fact that it was draft only at Surly, and then like Christmas come real early this year, they announced they'd be canning it.  After tasting it, all I can say is I sincerely hope that this is released on a somewhat regular basis.  What a fantastic beer that easily surpassed my expectations.  I hadn't tried any other Surly offerings so I didn't know what to expect, but how can you go wrong with an IPA hopped w/Citra and Mosaic (my 2 favorites)?
Smells citrusy and tropical notes, but I wasn't necessarily blown away by the smell; just solid.  However, the taste was something else.  I'm spoiled by drinking Tree House and Trillium APA/IPA/DIPAs every day, but the Axe Man had a lot of citrusy and juicy flavor packing a punch, with a very smooth finish.  I do not agree that this has a strong west-coast bitterness to the finish at all; it's just got the right balance of bitter with a smooth finish that I associate w/the Mosaic hops.  I think the Mosaic takes center stage, but the Citra helps supplement it and give it a more in depth degree of citrus fruit taste.  I could easily drink this beer every single day and be very happy. 1,207 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Aug 18, 2015

A: Pours a beautiful, thick yellow-orange hue with 1/2 inch white head that fairly quickly dissipated.
S: Bursting with citrus (orange and grapefruit) and mango.  Moderate pine resin too.
T: Follows aroma fairly closely with orange, grapefruit, mango, and pine hop notes.  Reminds me of Furious, but less hop forward and more sweet fruit notes.
M: Medium body.  Sweet citrus and mild-moderate hop bite.
D:  Excellent drinkability and very refreshing.  Not overly complex, but doesn't have to be.  If you find Furious too hoppy, then check this one out...don't think you'll be disappointed.  Well done, Surly! 654 charactersmwilbur, Aug 17, 2015

4.74/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Fresh pungent hop aroma in the nose. Beautiful golden color with two finger cream head. The taste is like drinking an orange or mango juice more than a beer. It coats the mouth and tongue and draws out every drop of saliva as the fruit and tropical notes cascade over the back of the tongue. The only thing my mind is thinking after tasting this is "why isn't there more?" This doesn't quite hit the level of Abrasive Ale (not many beers can) but this is a masterpiece in its own right. Hats off to Surly as this is hands down the best single IPA I have ever had and another outstanding beer in their lineup. 608 charactersWiscoBrewsco, Aug 17, 2015

A - Pours medium gold color with a light lacing ring.
S - Very pungent and dank tropical fruit: spicy mango, papaya, pineapple, and lime.
T - Intense tropical fruit hoppiness from start to finish: follows the nose with spicy tropical rind of pineapple, mango, juicy red grapefruit, and some orange while finishing with a spicy pine resin bitterness that lingers on the palate.  Juicy.
M - Thick, heavy body and coats the mouth with spicy tropical resin followed with dry piney bitterness.  Finishes wet which migrates into a dry finish with lingering fruity bitterness.
O - A serious IPA that packs a ton of flavor into a can without tipping the ABV scale. 706 charactersjzeilinger, Aug 16, 2015

Smell is mostly mosaic. Very melon forward. The flavor starts as being very piney, bitter, classic west coast. Then as the beer warms, it transforms and becomes a juice bomb. Tons of melon and citrus with an underlying earthy, zippy, dankness to balance it out. 
Overall, very good.

4.51/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5This beer didn't wow me.  After reading many great reviews and hearing about the big additions of  citra and mosaic hops I was looking forward to a world class IPA.  It's good but certainly not in my top 10.  The smell is excellent with big citrus and mango and the first taste is more citrus/mango flavor but then the dank bitterness hits and it just doesn't leave my palette with a clean finish.  It lingers and I'm not digging it.  I'm glad I tried it but wouldn't seek it out again.
Just had a second can of Todd.  I can't explain it but this beer was much better than the first Todd I had.  Maybe my palette was off?  The taste was a good punch of mango and citrus that had a much better finish than the first beer.  I'm adjusting my rating accordingly. 759 charactersELS, Aug 15, 2015

4.52/5  rDev +1.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75I'm so glad a bought a lot of this smashing hop juice...review based on a pour into my standard IPA glass from a batch canned 7/21/15.
Pours a fairly opaque amber. Lacing is spotty, and not very robust. Head is standard eggshell white without much heft. It looks inviting enough, but I think the least impressive element of TTAM.
Nose has such a fresh, buzzing green overlay to the fruit basket of papaya, mango, pineapple, and citrus. The hint of scallion is just right. Tropical hop bitterness jumps out of the glass. It almost pulls my tongue in.
Opens with bright lemon-led citrus, papaya and mango laced with its characteristic unripe pine. Then that dry, pine hop bitterness slide in behind a firm malt note that re-introduces sweetness by way of bread yeast--brilliant! A touch of resin mixed with a grassiness and more fruit in the end and finish. Hop oils create more of that synesthete fun, bridging flavor and feel and bouquet all at once.
The nearly light body is a surprising counterpoint to the heavy complexity of a DIPA. Smooth and almost thirst-quenching; so easy to drink more and more.  Finishes dry and filmy with a long, lingering, balanced astringency. The feel just doesn't encourage savoring...
I've heard this beast is the best DIPA in the Midwest. Haven't been here long, but so far, I must agree. On tap, it was too pithy and sharply acidic right up front in a way that wrecked the whole experience. But in the can, it's a work of art. Like all great creations holding so much vibrant complexity, when it's just a bit off, the problematic sharp edges are unpleasant, but when it's all in balance, it's heavenly. 1,643 characters1sophrosyne1, Aug 15, 2015

This one pours a golden orange, with a off-white head, about one inch, and lots of lacing.
This one smells awesome, dankly citrusy, lots of grapefruit orange, orange peel, and pineapple. Smells so inviting and bangin'.
Unsurprisingly, this also tastes quite good. So much tropical and citrus character, fruits galore, with a dank character underpinning everything here, grassy and pine, with a really bitter and awesome finish. It's so easy to just gulp this down, it's so delicious.
This one has a very crisp and juicy mouthfeel, full, but not thick or syrupy at all, with a moderate level of carbonation.
One of the better IPAs I've ever had, a really excellent beer here. 711 charactersGreesyFizeek, Aug 14, 2015

Pours a messy, coarse, 1.5 finger white head with moderate retention. Beer is a slightly cloudy orange mango. Lacing is spotty, patchy and thick with good stick. A solid looking beer.
Nose has hints of papaya, mango, citrus and cane sugar. Tropical fruit hop bitterness wafts out of the glass. Really juicy and appetizing! 
Opens citrus, papaya and mango. Juicy and very tropical fruit forward in the middle with a touch of cane sugar balanced by a nice, dry, pine hop bitterness. A touch of resin mixed with a grassiness and more fruit in the end and finish. Hoppy, tropical fruit aftertaste. Astounding!
Light bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and quenching in the mouth and slightly bubbly and dry going down. Finishes dry and filmy with a long, lingering, bone dry aftertaste. Really nice!

4.56/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Color: standard IPA.  Bit opaque.
Nose: Tropical as all hell.  Pineapple, oranges, maybe a touch of mango.  Super inviting.
Taste: Lots of tropical hop notes- the aforementioned pineapples, Florida oranges, bit of malt, pretty bitter.  Some mandarin oranges and a bit of resin at the end.
Feel: Standard IPA, not syrupy but with good presence.
Totally in your face, and yet with good malt profile.  Better than Abrasive! 424 charactersRobinLee, Aug 13, 2015

Appearance: Pours a beautiful hazy amber with a steady stream of bubbles. Thin white head lingers on top.
Smell: oh the hops! The shining citra hops are just so bright. 
Taste: surprisingly smooth for the hop smell. Crisp hop notes that are bright but not over the top. Very drinkable.
Mouthfeel: hop aftertaste lingers.

A - Cloudy dark shade of orange with a 2 finger white bubbly head that fades quickly. Thick collar forms with a good amount of lacing on the glass. 
S - Ripe mandarin oranges, bitter grapefruit, sweet mango, and pineapple are all the scents that billow from the glass. A nice citrus and tropical hop aroma that mingle with a pleasant and sweet malt backbone.
T - It's a pretty big tropic hop bomb in the flavor department. Juicy citrus of mandarin orange, tangerine, and some bitter grapefruit. More sweet juicy mango and pineapple are followed by the sticky sweet malts. Finish  is slightly bitter but quite juicy. 
M - Sticky and juicy with a medium body for a killer thirst quenching experience. 
O - Nice one Surly! 773 charactersRi0, Aug 12, 2015

4.74/5  rDev +6.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Aroma is a wonderful mix of pineapple, blueberries, honey, and wild onion. Some piney quality as well. Fresh and floral with some grassy notes. Very strong and pungent. Funky passion fruity, mandarins. Very difficult to smell anything past the hops. Clean yeast and malt, malt perhaps supplying a bit of a honey note. Maybe some toasted bread is there as well.
Pours slightly murky light orange with a small off-white head. Ok lacing, with moderate head retention.
Big tropical fruit and citrus on the palate. Again wild onion, garlic, and blueberry characteristic of Mosaic in my experience. Some honey is notable too. Orange and mango with a hint of biscuit. Grass, kumquats. Big flavor without being heavy on the palate. Dry finish with lingering resiny hops and honey. 
Medium low carbonation with medium body. Mouth filling hop flavor with little bitterness in comparison. Almost refreshing.
Quite the beer. Crazy complex hop character. I could see people saying things like hops this interesting could mask flaws, but that seems untrue as I've recently had an all Mosaic beer that had interesting hop flavor, but drinkability was marred by yeast esters and under attenuation. This beer is clean and bone dry allowing the hop flavors to really come out without being too sticky or bitter. 1,297 characterssjccmd, Aug 10, 2015

4.44/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Look-definitely the beer's least impressive feature, color is a very cloudy orangish yellow, with a brown tinge. Pours two nice fingers of white, frothy head that retains well, leaving nice chunks of lacing on the sides of the glass.
Smell-Wow. A burst of complex, hoppy goodness. Grapefruit, tangerines, nectarines, mango, and a strong, distinct, tropical presence  that i thought to be very similar to guava.  Then comes a punch of floral and earthier hop notes, Definitely a little malt in there on the back end, supporting the bright hops.
Taste-Like the aroma, waves of hops, the tropical and citrusy notes are balanced by more hop notes of pine and grass, the malt is particularly sweet, almost caramel like, but very subtle, just cutting off the hops to crossing over from intensely floral and citrusy to bitter. Amazing Balance.
Feel-Body is very heavy, but not oily or even creamy, the intense carbonation keeps things refreshing, and the beer finishes juicy.
Overall-Review says it all, this one to me is right up there with Heady Topper and Pliney Elder in the the league of world class hoppy brews.cheers 1,116 charactersSteveB24, Aug 09, 2015

Cloudy copper body. Wispy and foamy white head. Lace trails abound. 4.5
A bit of cat piss, a bit of mango, a bit of pineapple and passionfruit. Light and sweet malty creaminess. Subsequent attempts to soak in the nose become fruitier and fruitier. 4.25
Fresh and unripened mango are all over the flavor. Pineapple, passionfruit, orange juice and grapefruit juice blends... All these flavors find harmony on the tongue. Zesty grapefruit develops on the finish as the beer warms and has a lingering quality underscored by a sweet melon and mango flavor that are very nice. 4.25
A touch floral, a touch zesty, a touch citrusy and even a very faint, yet pungent funk make up this beer. It's got a light quality to it but still plenty of body and fullness. 4.5

Green, bitter-smelling, potent hops along with some blended tropical fruity hops. Flavor is interesting because the first sip demoralizes my bitterness sensors. It's got such a bitter initial zip. Then once my buds are blown into an abyss of confusion and massochistic sadness, all the sweetness and tropicality of the hops come out and dance on my tongue's vanquished soul. Lots of squished citrus, pineapple, nectarine and mango. The dank and grass slithers in and out of my mouthpiece. Finishes with a fruity sweetness and maltiness that tames the mouth dragon. Medium bodied. Reminds me of a grouchy, spiteful and diminutive Abrasive Ale. Very good! Thanks Todd? 753 charactersVelvetExtract, Aug 08, 2015

Pours a deep, golden orange color. Very hazy. Large , thick, soapy white head that results in a quarter thick ring. 
Smells of malts, ripe citrus, and mosaic hops. Pretty dank and funky. 
The citra hops are on full display here. It comes off the top ropes with a blast of orange. Tastes like I just ate a juciy clementine, rind and all. A little bit of peach juice, some sweet malts, and then some bitterness that just seems to snowball all the way till the end. Very clean finish. 
Pretty full bodied beer here with significant resin feel. 
This beer is right up there with Sip of Sunshine for the best ipa I have had. Even better than Head Hunter, Columbus IPA, and White Rajah. Dont tell anyone. 725 charactersWesMantooth, Aug 07, 2015

The pour is liquid orange pulp with a head that falls like a sack of quartz, leaving behind fiddly white patterns skulking along the surface. Nose is very citrus & mango forward, leaning into a mucker of tropical fruit baskets. Pretty nice. 
Todd the Axeman is one of those beers that I have to block the pedigree in order to savage it fairly. The tropical hook in the nose is still present in the taste, but the minimal carbonation flattens out the flavor profile, & not in a good way. Big peeled mango, razor-sharp bitterness, grapefruit, mild pine sap. Big malt sweetness that cuts the hops, but the bitterness makes a Vanilla Ice-style comeback to dominate the finish. Too heavy to drink much of. 
I guess I’ll be that guy: I’d take Furious, Overrated, Abrasive, & several other local IPAs over Todd. The lack of bubbles might be impacting my enjoyment. A good beer, but not worth the price & I recall it being much better on tap. 1,026 charactersmaximum12, Aug 07, 2015

Bright orange fire poured into a Surly tulip. Sweet citrus hop taste with biscuity malt backbone. Smell is not overpowering but it doesn't need to be - subdued citrus, grapefruit, mangoes on the nose. Could use more carbonation, but maybe that adds to the insane drinkability. At $20/4pack I can't really afford many of these, but maybe that's for the best. Surly really knows what they are doing! 556 charactersgregy55902, Aug 06, 2015

4.54/5  rDev +1.8%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.75Canned on 7/16/15.
Appearance: Awesome can art. The beer is medium caramel in color with some clarity and also hop sediment. Poured a dense off-white head that quickly dissipated. Looks quite different than when I've had it on tap, darker and tepid looking from the can.
Aroma: Resinous pine and that signature citra funky mango. Smelled the most explosive right after I cracked the can open. 
Taste: Huge bitterness throughout paired with soft caramel notes from the malt and a bouquet of hop flavor. I'm not sure the ratio of mosaic to citra or additions but I'd bet on a large quantities of finishing hops. While the obvious comparison is to that of Abrasive, the main difference is less perceived sweetness and more raw bitterness. The hop flavor ranges from resiny to juicy fruit gum. The finish is smooth followed by a last burst of bitterness that fades in the aftertaste while bringing back some of the fruitier hop notes. If I didn't know that this was 7.2% ABV it would be difficult to guess. While it doesn't feel like a big beer there is a heat on the back end that pairs nicely with the dying bitterness. Another excellent beer by Surly.
Mouthfeel: Just above medium in body. I always find it to be over carbonated on tap, but it has about average carbonation for the style when given a healthy pour from the can. Good drinkability, but it's hard to resist the flavor so that's a given.
Final Thoughts: I was very surprised and happy to see this on the shelves. The $16.99 price tag is a bit much but I understand citra hops are not cheap. I will say that the appearance and mouthfeel leave a little to be desired but the flavor and aroma speak for themselves. I assume it will have rotating availability so I look forward to each new batch. Would I drink it again? Yep. 1,788 charactersJamesMN, Aug 02, 2015

The combo of Citra & Mosaic is a proven winner, but it needs to be brewed with the right malt base. This is not quite on par with some of the Trillium brews, but it's damn good. 260 charactersKramerbarthomer, Aug 02, 2015

I was absolutely blown away when having it on tap at Surly. 
Canned was also amazing - but not as much of the hazy color. Pours a beautiful darkish orange and the aroma is what draws me in. Unbelievable huge citra, mango and orange notes. 
The taste is just as good and the nose hits with malty sweetness and excellent hop balance. The malt lingers and the hop stops a bit before that.

i'm not sure this one lives up to the noise. i'm not seeing the haze that other folks mention, and there's no head or lacing to speak of. smell is the best part of this one so far, which is saying something. taste is bitter but not lingering. mouthfeel is clean but thin. 
maybe on tap this one is better, and reading some of the reviews below it sounds like a completely different beer. i'll finish the other three and move on to something else. 525 charactersEvilyak, Jul 29, 2015

It did not win me over at fist sip...but Todd seems to get better as you drink it and acquire the taste.. A rarely mentioned but important quality of a beer is its staying power the diminishing marginal utility of todd is very low. Todd is just getting better and better as I drink it which is great because e many other beer taste great a first sip but get old quick. Much more fun to grow in to a beer that out of one. loving this IPA. 510 charactersJosh012012, Jun 21, 2015

Comparison wise, it's certainly as good as anything Half Acre has ever made (Beer Hates Astronauts comes to mind). Tastes like a double Akari Shogun, minus the wheat, plus Citra hops. Really good stuff. Would love to blind-taste this against Anicca, Spiteful IPA, BHA, Space, Broo Doo, etc. to crown a true Midwest IPA champ. 373 charactersRMelyon, Jun 12, 2015

4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4On-tap at the new brewery restaurant (my first visit). Tasted 21 April 2015.
Pours hazy bright golden-orange. One finger of white head, excellent retention and lacing.
Smell is incredibly fruity, bursting with big citra hops. Remind me of TG's PseudoSue. Oranges, pineapple, mango. Full underneath that with sweet caramel malts.
Taste is really good, but those amazing aromatic hops are beaten down by a powerful bitterness. I get them for a second, then they're going down as the bitter rises, the two crossing paths.
Feel is decent. A little flat, a little heavy. But good and bright.
Excellent beer, super aromatic in the nose, and delightfully fruity. 660 characterszeledonia, Jun 03, 2015

Smell: Citrus and tropical fruit, pine	
Taste: Really nice balance emphasizing the hugely aromatic and citrus-tropical fruity hops with just enough malt to give it some body but not enough to make it oversweet. Not very bitter for the amount of hops character.	
Feel: medium body, smooth carbonation.	
Overall: A great fresh IPA with ideal balance that highlights the awesome fruity hops character while providing a good malt backbone. Seamless blending of flavors. 518 charactersmaedhros09, May 30, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +8.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Passed a goblet of this at the Surly tap house in Minneapolis.
L: Pours a beautiful bright, hazy straw color with an inch-and-a-half of white head that lingers for a good bit and leaves nice lacing on the glass. Moderate visible carbonation where you can see through at the edges.
S: Big, bright citrus and floral hop notes. Some bubble gum and freshly cut grass. Biscuit malt notes underneath. This is a beautiful bouquet.
T: Incredibly tasty IPA. There's really bright citrus hops right in front, mingling with the biscuit malt underbelly. Grapefruit, tangerine, cut grass, and bubble gum notes follow. There's a bit of clear alcohol in the middle, but you really don't sense it much--surprising for an ABV this high. The close is delightful hop bitterness. It's more clean than sticky, but it definitely lets you feel the bitter.
F: Medium-bodied and expertly carbonated. It's smooth and creamy but also bright and bitter in turns. This one went down a lot easier than I thought it would.
O: I try a lot of IPAs. I'm a big fan of citrus bombs and pine bombs, but I also enjoy Belgians and more traditional West Coast and Midwest varieties. That being said, this might just be the best IPA I have ever tasted. It's really that good. You would do well to go out of your way to try this one on tap. You won't be disappointed. 1,330 charactersDabblinWiscCraft, May 25, 2015

Orange-yellow body, nice one finger white head, although this was a plastic cup pour. Smelled like oranges, grapefruit in the truest sense; very grapefruity without much grainy sweetness. Awesome. Tastes very similar, mild-moderate resinous and grapefruit rind bitterness; overall tastes like grapefruit hops. Fair amount of pale malt sweetness, but not too sweet. Mouthfeel is a bit thin, but there is plenty of flavour to bring it through. Not too bitter, very drinkable. Overall a very juicy IPA that impressed me quite a bit. I will have to agree with everyone else and say that Surly needs to can this beer, STAT. 636 charactersStevedore, Apr 26, 2015

Beautiful looking golden color with a bright white head that sticks around. The nose is very fruity on this one with mango sweetness. Very hoppy flavor, lots of grapefruit with a decent amount of light malt flavor on the end. This is a super easy drinking IPA. Definitely worth the price as a seasonal treat. 367 characterscl3, Apr 04, 2015

This beer pours a hazy dark orange color. The head is half an inch in height, and recedes slowly leaving nice lacing. The aroma is strong. There is a lot of citrus: passion fruit, mango, pineapple, and tangerine. There is also a nice floral thing going on in the background. The taste is a bit drier than the aroma leads on, but still quite juicy. There is the same citrus bowl, but the malt sticks and balances things a bit more. The mouthfeel is medium bodied with velvety, almost chewy texture. Carbonation is appropriate for the style. Overall, this is a very nice IPA. If it wasn't priced outrageously it would be a regular in my rotation. 685 charactersKarlHungus, Mar 03, 2015

Appearance:  This brew was a beautiful hazy golden orange color with a lingering white head.  Nice sticky lacing clung to the side to the glass as I drank.  
Smell:  Loved the aroma on this one.  Tons of ripe fruit, citrus, some pine, and some earthy dankness.  I absolutely love the Citra and Mosaic combo, they go very well together.  Faint sweet malt and yeast esters linger just under the wall of hops.
Taste:  Absolutely awesome!  There's a nice bitterness up front, but not aggressive.  Tons of citrus flavor, more orange to me than grapefruit.  Some pineapple and mango too.  The Golden Promise malt lends a nice sweetness to underlie the hop flavors.  
Mouthfeel.  Medium body and carbonation.  This beer has an almost creamy texture to it.     
Overall:  One of the best standard IPAs I've ever had, reminded me a bit of Focal Banger, though its been a while since I've had that.  IPAs just don't really get any better than this.  It's everything I want in the style. 1,010 charactersBrams17, Mar 02, 2015

4.29/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This brew was served on tap from the upstairs walk-up bar, at the new Surly taproom in Minneapolis, Minnesota.  They poured into Surly tulips, with the beer showing through a glowing golden pumpkin coloring.  A one finger head of chunky, soapy white bubbles topped the liquid, showing solid retention.  Lacing was spotty, and a cheesecloth film formed across the surface of the beer.  Heavy haze reduced light and clarity, but no sediment was found.  Carbonation appeared to be minimal.  Aromatics included saltine crackers, heavy grapefruity and citric hops, evergreen piney hops, sweet caramel and honey sugars, pale, crystal, and wheaty malts, tropical pineapple and passion fruit fruitiness, chlorine, green onion airs, concrete dust, lactic creaminess, raw barley dust, soft amber and wheaty inclusions, light white sugars, dill weed, glue adhesive, and aluminum.  With warmth came spicier dried herbal and grassy hop pellets.  The flavor followed with cucumber skins, wheaty and Rice Krispie maltiness, big herbal, piney, and hearty citric hoppy blend, green bell peppers, fresh green twigginess and wet mossiness, vegetal celery stalk and parsnip root, potato starchiness, raw organic oregano spiciness, corny malty vibe, medicinal phenols, clean pale malt toast, simple raw caramel graininess, and clay-like mineral.  The body was medium, and carbonation was a bit lighter.  Nice slurp, smack, cream, froth, and crisp finishing pop enhanced each sip.  The mouth was left chalked and astringently dried following a flash flood of wet and drippy creamed coating.  The abv was appropriate, and the beer disappeared super easily.
Overall, this is advertised as their “west coast” bitter IPA.  We felt this to be a bit of a stretch, according to the humble opinions of our collective palate.  Much of that dense, labelling bitterness of the hops was subdued and balanced by booze, and what were nearly cloyingly sweet, residually sugared graininess.  That said, this was one of the most pine-forward hoppy beers we’ve had in a long time.  If you’re not sure if the hops you’re tasting are piney, compare to this beer, and you’ll have your answer.  This was enjoyed immediately following our first glasses of Abrasive, so as a direct comparison, Todd was not as robust, but did show some similarities in their skeletal makeups.  We try not to do side-by-sides like that per se, but we were just so excited to have all these heavy hitting Surly beverages at our fingertips.  Regardless, this was a very pleasurable experience, and we are glad it came back onto the taplist for our return visit to Minneapolis. 2,623 charactersTheBrewo, Feb 10, 2015

A: bright shiny golden pear, a little bit hazy, a 1 finger head that sticks around.
S:  Ambrosia.  I think it's the best bouquet I've encountered on a beer.  White grapes, blueberries, apricot, and also some light mango, passion fruit, and pineapple...not the dank juiciness of Abrasive, say...sweeter and lighter (but not too much).  Some bright flowers.  Also some crackery malt.  And maybe something interesting from the yeast. The nose doesn't knock you over, but it draws you in; close to perfect.  
T: More aggressive than the nose and not quite as subtle, but still good complexity and very delicious.  The citra combination of pine and citrus comes out more strongly on the back end (and the more I sip).
M: good body, medium carbonation, surprisingly creamy, moderately dry finish, hops bring some tingly sensations to the tongue. 
Overall:  Excellent 918 charactersTaybeh, Feb 04, 2015

5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is a beer that has the best of both worlds when it comes to hops, malt bill, and some resemblance of many of the delicious New England IPA's.  The Mosaic and Citra hops come blasting out of the can on the nose. Grapefruit, tropical fruits, cantaloupe are the major aromas. The taste matches the nose. The malt bill is simple, light and crackery to let the hops shine. it also makes the beer very drinkable at 7.2% without a heavy caramel malt bill. Delicious beer. 469 charactersWynnDavis, Feb 01, 2015

Appearance: Cloudy light gold with decent head.
Smell: Definite mosaic and citra aroma with the blueberries, tropical notes and sharp citrus. 
Taste: Holy Mango! Strong tropical and citrus notes.  Extremely hoppy, very oily, with almost nonexistent malts. Bitter finish.
Feel: Medium body, moderate carbonation, very dry finish.
Overall: Better West Coast IPA than Overrated IMO. Still prefer Furious.
Adjusted scores slightly after having a 4-pack, but same overall thoughts. 499 charactersbsp77, Jan 30, 2015

Pour was hazy light orange with a pale pillowy straw colored foam that laced up.  Wow..smells of mango, pineapple, oranges and tangerines. Love it and Fantastic. Taste is mild-medium bitter showcasing Citra with ripe pineapple, papaya and mangos, a light complexity of citrus.. tangerines and mandarin oranges.  All this woven into a just barely there malt canvas of crackers and biscuit.  Moithfeel is medium, creamy and holds together well.  Finishes dry but juicy.  Eminently drinkable.

The aroma smacks you in the face with sweet grapefruit, lemon, and pine. When I say smack you in the face, I mean it. On smelling it I did a physical double take. The flavor is not quite as intense, but is is still a straight up citrus bomb, with hints of pine in the background. Balance, screw balance, this beer is pure, unadulterated hoppy fun. If this was sold regularily I would bet it would outsell overrated. 464 charactersCzequershuus, Jan 19, 2015

Fortunately for me I tried it again... This is the closest thing i have EVER tried with a clean palate to Pseudo Sue! Wow. I mean i hate to say it but Surly ya out did yourself this time. For ONCE a surly beer that lives up to the hype. This one should be called "underrated". Cirus BOMB soooo balanced and easy to drink. Easiest to drink. Mouthfeel is medium light, slight malty-ness.  Aftertaste doesnt linger until it warms a bit then it lingers but you WANT it to... The only thing Sue has on axeman is that Sue is a pale ale and drinks like one, Axe man is marketed as an I.p.a. But drinks like a pale ale. Im sure this was a mareting ploy on Surly's part, since they have yet to make a PALE ALE!!! I can just hear Todd asking Omar "should we call this a pale ale?" "Nope we will sell more if we call it an i.p.a."... 990 charactersBeerlover, Jan 19, 2015

4.23/5  rDev -5.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Bottle. Golden, little cloudy. Medium, semi-densed, white head. Very aromatic. Striking combination of tropical fruits (lychee, pinnaple, mango) and citrus (mainly orange) aromas. Light malty character (toast).  The beer taste more like APA than AIPA. Due to used hops (mosaic, citra) it’s sweet. The bitterness is medium, I’d even say bearly medium. Aftertaste is dry and bitter.
It's semi-dry with medium carbonation, light to medium body. Thin texture. Highly drinkable. In general it’s like good, very very juicy session-beer, really nice combination of malts and US hops. The bitterness could be higher (it’s AIPA), but still worth trying. Another good beer from Amager in collab. with Surly. 705 charactersBlazerT, Jan 02, 2015

It's absolutely bursting with hop flavor, but maintains a pleasant, balanced bitter kick. It's floral citrus with fruity undertones, so rich in hoppy flavor you could sip a glass for hours.

A - Super hazy straw body. Thin white head with ample lacing.
S - Pineapple, tangerine, pollen, and mango.
T - Tons of orange, mango must, and pineapple. The malt is pleasantly crackery and dry.  The finish is all tropical with mild bitterness.
M - Great dry yet creamy mouthfeel.
O - Fantastic beer. The scent and taste are Heady Topper meets Dirt Wolf. Also a great showcase for Golden Promise malt. Simply outstanding. 456 charactersporter_collie, Dec 28, 2014

4.46/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.512 oz draft served in a small goblet.
High clarity golden orange with a thin layer of white foam that sticks around the edges nicely, forming an unbroken collar. Drippy lace forms as the glass is sipped. 
Very pungent tropical aroma, mango and dried pineapple, nectarine.
Definitely a big west coast vibe already.
Taste is packed with tropical hop fruitiness, more mango and pineapple from the Citra and Mosaic, with a light undercurrent of clean crackery malt underneath. Moderate bitterness, though perfectly balanced and very drinkable. Light to medium bodied with little to no residual sugars. Highly sessionable. 
A comment was made that "Surly made a Half Acre beer", then the bartender came by and said the exact same thing. 734 charactersemerge077, Dec 04, 2014

haven't reviewed in a long time, but compelled to review this one. fwiw if i had the time i'd go back and lower a lot of my old ratings. currently my favorite beer ever.
oddly i liked this much better out of the can than when i had it on tap.
no carb issues. explosive citra and mosaic aroma, like smelling a bowl of pellets. dank and fruity. flavor is the same juicy hops and a restrained bitterness. overall a phenomenal beer and i hope it's canned from time to time. a game changer for me, if i have access to this i'll pass on trading for HT and sue.
*update: undercarbed. head dissipates quickly. fine dark sediment on the bottom of the cans after a few weeks. 724 charactersMrMcGibblets, Dec 03, 2014

Excellent sweet blueberry flavor combined with mangoes and fresh citrus.  All day long.  Such a juicy beer that has a very clean finish.  No head retention?  Who cares, get me another! 282 charactersPetcha, Oct 26, 2014

Hugely aromatic with aromas of orange, graperuit and mango. Taste follows with lots of fruit notes and a complimentary bitterness. Finishes nice and dry with a lingering bitterness.
So easy to drink. Fantastic beer. 286 charactersPowderhornphil, Oct 26, 2014

Appearance: Color is a bright golden orange. Moderate amount of bubbles and about one finger of white head that settles into a thin creamy layer. Leaves some good lacing. 
Smell: A juicy and dank hop forward smell with a big scent of citrus fruits. Big upfront presence of citra hops with hints of passion fruit, orange peel, grapefruit, mango, lemon zest, pineapple, and apricot. Also some floral and earthy hints behind the citrus. Soft pale malt presence with hints of grains, cracker, and yeast. A very good juicy smell. 
Taste: Like the nose indicates, a very ripe and juicy hop forward taste with a big presence of citrus fruits. Upfront juicy taste of citra hops with notes of grapefruit, passion fruit, mango, orange peel, lemon zest, pineapple, and apricot. Earthy and floral notes with some pine. Backing of pale malt with notes of biscuit, cracker, and yeast. A really good hoppy taste. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Crisp, creamy, and juicy with a drying finish. Very smooth with no sign of the alcohol. 
Overall: Another top notch IPA from Surly. Very citrus dominant with a nice smooth body for such a hoppy brew. 1,222 charactersMattyG85, Oct 18, 2014

4.46/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.510 oz goblet at the brewery. 
Served with a finger of white head that recedes to a thin layer on top of a clear golden brew. Doesn't have the orange hue that so many of these IPAs do. 
Aroma is more mosaic than citra-not as dank. Plenty of tropical notes-passion fruit and pineapple with some orange on top. 
Taste is beautiful. Hops for sure but the malt is present and carries the tropical and citrus flavors of the hops so nicely. 
Mouthfeel is where this shines. Creamy not resiny. Clean yet hoppy finish. With an ABV over 7% this isn't boozy at all. 
Overall this reminds me of Deschutes Fresh Squeezed with more malt body and a cleaner finish. I love fresh squeezed but if Surly canned this I would have this in my beer fridge a lot. Well done! 750 charactersdeebo, Oct 02, 2014
