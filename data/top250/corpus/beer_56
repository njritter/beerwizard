Appearance- The beer was a bright straw yellow with a bright white head.
Smell - The sour meshes with the oak.
Taste - This gueuze is so well  balanced and far from acidic. It is smooth and oaky with plenty of green apple. 2016 is thinner and not a sour as 2013.  To a degree the 2016 seems a bit watery. 2016 even lingers during the 2013 sampling. This is a green apple bonanza. The sour oakinessthis linger so well.
Mouthfeel- I am a little amazed at how well balanced this is. It is sour, but not burning acidic.
Overall- This gueuze is out of this world. 632 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jan 23, 2017

Thanks to eyebereej for sending this bottle!
2013 bottling. Consumed on Dec. 18, 2016; reviewed from notes. Poured from the 750 mL bottle into an El Catador Barrel Aged glass.
A: Pours a hazy, glowing gold. Forms a thin white head that fades quickly with a relatively low amount of visible carbonation. This isn't bad-looking by any stretch, but appears fairly still. I don't know if that's a consequence of aging or not.
S: Earthy and funky barnyard. Oaky dry tannins, and notes of stone fruits (especially apricot, though I don’t think this that's actually in there. Some lactic tartness, and light biscuit malts in the background. I'm getting more Lacto funk primarily, with lesser Brett notes. A really nice, complex aroma.
T: Lactic tartness and more sour, juicy stone fruits (like a dried apricot). Earthy funk again – Lacto again, and some Pedio I think. Dry citric acid and tannins. The light biscuit malts are still getting snowed under here - it was necessary to search for them. Some dry white wine character. It finishes with some stone fruity juiciness and a drying sourness, and the dry flavors ultimately win out.
M: Light body, very low alcohol presence. Carbonation sensation is just a bit on the low side.
O: Wow…after sitting for three years, this lives up to both the hype and my expectations. And both of those were quite high. Especially as a non-fruited, non-adjuncted sour, it succeeds with a complex and balanced funk and sourness. I guess you could argue provenance vis-a-vis the “authentic” gueuzes of the world, but this absolutely could stand on its own in the conversation. 1,690 charactersmacrosmatic, Jan 07, 2017

3.83/5  rDev -15.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 3.75Did a side-by-side tasting with DDG,  Allagash Coolship Resurgam and Jester King Spon Methode Gueze as part of our annual Xmas eve tasting.
DDG was universally agreed to be third in the group and Resurgam remains, hands down, the best gueze-like American beer and the only one that can go head-to-head with the likes of Cantillon, Drie, and Tilquin.
DDG was good, not great. 
It was, visually, quite lovely. The aroma, however, prominently featured an off-putting porta-potty characteristic that very much distracted from the more pleasant funk and citrus fruity esters.
Fortunately, not much of off-putting aroma carried over to the flavor. However, it was a touch sweeter than I'd expect for the style and it seemed that a bit of wine flavor from the barrels came through in the beer-not a bad thing per se but not really appropriate for a gueze style beer.  
Overall a good but not overwhelmingly great sour, more of an American Wild than gueze stand-in. 960 charactersWilliamWS, Jan 03, 2017

A: Pours pale straw colored with a half inch of foamy head.
S: Off dry, light brett character (horseblanket, earth), soft fruit (pineapple, orange, candied tangerine), some supporting vanilla and oak.  Balance is towards the brett.
T: Follows the nose, with light but firm tartness and moderate creaminess.  
M: Medium-light body and carbonation.
O: Tasty, elegant, and well constructed, though the flavors were a bit more muted than expected.  Overall, I liked the Veritas 017 and 018 a bit better. 567 characterspmarlowe, Nov 25, 2016

A nice refreshing crisp sour/gueuze.  Certainly one of the better gueuze that I have had.  Lemony tartness is present and balanced.  Not too tart.  The red wine barrels definitely are prevalent with a little boozy and nice oaky presence.  Glad I can finally cross this one off the list!  Very tasty and worth pursuing 358 charactersrabbott2, Oct 06, 2016

looks fantastic and smells great! nice funky and sour up front on the nose.
taste is a bit sour and some nice sweetness. great oak. beer is full bodied for a 7%er.
overall this a good beer, but don't make my mistake. give this a year or 2 to pucker up and get funky like the nose, right now it's a bit too young. I'll bet the 2013 is drinking fantastic right now. 491 charactersKevSal, Sep 05, 2016

A must have for gueze and wild ale lovers alike. 337 characterssposter4, Aug 28, 2016

Pours a hazy amber-yellow color with a small, fizzy white head, which leaves back no trace.
Smell is old potatoes, glue, blue cheese, bright and crisp citrus peel with a soft, flowery note to it and a slightly acetic tartness. Very well balanced, not pungently sour, while producing a nice, funky blend. Got some wet hay on top of its aroma foundation with dried tomatoe bush, adding a light herbal complexity to the nose. 
Has a lower to medium carbonation, complimenting perfectly to the refreshing, tart, yet complex and balanced beer.
Tastes of fresh squeezed lemon juice, accompanied by a funky mushroom quality and a soft mineral aspect. Its mid palate produces a wood bark covered acetic sourness with a hint of white grape skin to it. This results from a sugary malt sweetness, which becomes recognizable only as a minor note against the omnipresent sourness, while being able to cut through it. Finishes utmost soft, very silk with a pungent, dry acetic tone among lemon zest, and leathery, matured oak, still carrying its subtle grape flavor. 
Wow, this is pushing AWAs to a new level for me. This is balanced and complex like no other American sour I've had so far. It got the typical vinegar sourness, which is dominating in many examples of american sours. This is different though, its acetic flavor is setting the balance in this, which to me is remarkable by itself, since it allows a pungent, refreshing lemon sourness to open up the palate to many flavor layers, creating an intriguing complexity which at no point gets boring. 1,574 charactersaleigator, Aug 26, 2016

4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.752013, poured into a teku.
Pours a slightly hazy orange-light amber in color, with a minimal-to-no foam head upon pour.  Smells of a rich, fruity farmhouse-wild ale with a mild funk note.  Taste has loads of sour green apples, with some pear and very small amount of lemon like taste.  Clean, crisp end which is quite easy to drink and imploring you to go back to continue sipping.  Despite the clean and crisp end, the sour green apple flavor lingers long after the drink in a pleasant way.
Quite a wild ale.  Would love to be able to drink this on a more frequent basis and get a taste of the '16 version.  However, the feeding frenzy around each release and the steep asking price for trading makes this virtually impossible.  Russian River sours remind me of DDG, and for the time being those are going to be the ones I will seek out until DDG becomes easier to obtain. 874 characterseifster82, Jul 31, 2016

Aroma is bursting with fruit - apple, pear, apricot, peach, and white wine. Oak and soft funk also comes through. Strong flavors on the taste. Everything comes through so balanced and well integrated. I get tons of vanilla as well. There is a soft funk in the background - wet hay, barnyard, some band aid. It's there, but the fruit is still center stage. The flavors are bright and vibrant, but they don't fall off quickly either. Complex, intense. This is the best beer I've had to date. 604 charactersdanh53, Jun 23, 2016

Pours a golden orange, slightly hazy body with a white head that reduces slowly, leaving spotty lacing. 
Aromas are tart and lactic, with a solid amount of oak, funky yeast, citrus, grassy. Oak/wine barrel is the dominating aroma here. 
 On the tongue is a delicious tartness, interesting oak character, grassy, white wine, hay, barnyard, fruity yeast, super dry with a crisp funky aftertaste. Mouthfeel is light with high carbonation, very dry and crisp. 
Lived up to the hype! This beer is amazing. Delicate and balanced. 597 charactersgcamparone, Mar 29, 2016

Taste delivered another super dry citrus, lemon for the most part, some orange underneath that, real dry virgin kind of oak impressions.  Astringent all over.  Very expensive so it doesn't hit that pleasure zone, and they only break it out if you're cool enough or some fake hype limited scarcity kind of stuff.  But there is no denying its av very good beer and seems to stand the test of time as this is a 2013 bottle. 
There's a lot of gueuze out there, American or Belgian that you can get for so much cheaper than this.  Unfortunately Lost Abbey is in the collectible make it scarce hype business model so it is what it is. 771 charactersrodbeermunch, Mar 13, 2016

The wine barrels explode on the nose. Bright, tart taste with nice red wine and oak flavors popping through. The mouthfeel is nicely carbonated with quick dissipation leaving an incredibly smooth feeling on the pallet. Incredible beer, now I can see why it's so sought after 375 characterscostanzo_mike, Dec 29, 2015

Taste is a perfect blend of tart and sour balanced by the oak. Has a slightly slightly thicker feel that is wonderfully smooth. Perfect tang and carb. This is as good as a sour gets. 277 charactersHootie159, Dec 28, 2015

Perfect level of tartness and love the touch that the wine barrel adds to the taste.  I would have to do them side by side to be 100% accurate, but going on memory I would say DDG beats CC.  Both wonderful but DDG has a little more subtle complexity. 353 charactersMilwaukeeBeerMaker, Dec 02, 2015

---------
2013 vintage poured into Tulip, an amazing funky citrus aroma. Taste is perfectly tart and sour with a great musky cheesiness. This is a great american gueuze. I think they nailed it out of the park on this one. Age is going to treat this brew very nicely. 535 charactersAB_Inbev, Sep 14, 2015

A - Very crisp Golden/yellow with zero lacing and head dissipates immediately. 
S - Citrus, funk, acidity, and sour apple
T - Apple, lemon peel, white grapes, mild vinegar and slight oak barrel presence. Nice little sweetness finishes each sip leaving you ready for more
M - Lighter-medium bodied. Very easy to drink and carbonation was well within respectable limits
O - Fantastic beer, glad i was passing by the tap room and was able to sneak in just in time to get a pour! Will be ISO bottles 668 charactersThe_Wozz, Jul 27, 2015

4.55/5  rDev +0.2%look: 5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Aroma - Prominent notes of acetic/citric acid as well as some cherry, tropcial fruits,  and Brett funkiness.
Appearance - Yellow/orange in color with a thin layer of white bubbles.
Flavor - Well balanced tartness with some funky barnyard yeast flavor.  Some additional fruity ester flavors of melon and mango.  Well balanced tart and fruity fllavors.  Low malt presence of a buttery cracker. 
Mouthfeel - Low bodied with a good deal of effervescence.  Not overwhelmingly tart or astringent but well balanced.
Overall - The strength of this beer is in its balance and its ability to change from tart lambic to estery Belgian to dry saison with a simple swirl of the glass.  Not showy or flashy, just simply well made. 720 charactersadnauseam007, Feb 24, 2015

3.22/5  rDev -29.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 2.75 | taste: 3.25 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5A:  Pours a slightly hazed golden/yellow color.  A minimal white head forms, and not much lace either.
S:  Not much in the nose.  Light apple skin, with a bit of tartness.  A metallic, even tinny aroma.  Not much of a yeast character, not much funk, oak, or much of anything else.  Disappointing in the nose.
T:  Light white grape flavors with apple skins.  Cider like, with a bit of tartness and vinegar flavors.  Again, no real funky yeast character.  Really not much of anything but light tartness.
M/D:  A light to medium body.  Certainly not flat, but I wish this was much more crisp.  The light tartness is enjoyable, and makes this fairly simple and easy to drink.  Though I feel like this needs something more...probably a more distinct yeast character.
One dimensional, and just a little boring.  After several try's over the years, I was hoping this would click, but it never has.  I have never gotten much yeast or substantial tartness out of this.  Don't know why my experience is that much different than most others. Though I think  there are much better Wild Ale available, and ones that are so much easier to get as well. 1,138 characterschamp103, Feb 14, 2015

A big thanks to joshwith for sending this long time want over in a trade!
A: Pours a crystal clear golden yellow with a very small fizzy white head that dissipates almost immediately.  Lots of carbonation bubbles can be seen rising to the top of the glass. Leaves essentially zero lacing.  4.25
S: Lots of sour characters, lactic acidity tartness, oak, citrus, some funky plastic like aromas.  Everything comes together quite nicely.  4.25
T: A delicious puckering tartness, sour apple and citrus, some sweeter fruit notes, vinous notes that are reminiscent of sweet wine.   Lots of oak and vanilla characters on the finish. The sourness builds throughout the drink.  Excellent.  4.5
M/D: Medium body, carbonation on the lighter end for the style but alright, drinkability is excellent.  4.25
O:  Excellent beer, well worth seeking out.  Thanks again Josh!  4.5 905 characterszac16125, Oct 26, 2014

A: Pours a clear, dark gold/nearly copper color with a thin, off-white head that simmers down to nothing fairly quickly. 
S: Right away there's a nice blast of cheesy funk and lacto with a big hit of lemon. Light oak and just a touch of apple cider vinegar. 
T: A juicy push of tart Granny Smith apple, lemon and underripe pear upfront followed by a smooth middle of oak and lemon meringue. Finish leaves a lingering lemon flesh sourness. Has just a touch of white wine barrel to it, cherry skin and just a breath of funk on the finish. Doesn't carry the funk of something like 3F Oude Gueuze and doesn't have the sourness of a beer like Cable Car, but it's fantastically rounded and just keeps pummeling you with a variety of flavors, none of them bad. An absolutely phenomenal beer. So glad I finally got to try this. 834 charactersnotchucknorris, Oct 14, 2014

A-Pours a bright golden yellow with a thin lace that dissipates into a thin outer lace. 
S- sweet lemon and with some deep funk. 
T- follows the nose really well. Has a real nice juicy taste. Like i'm drinking a sweet juice followed by a strong funk that completely covers your mouth. Then there is a sweetness on the back end that finishes the beer perfectly.
M- fully bodied and sour. Brings your mouth to a pucker. 
O- a very delicious brew. Perfectly balanced between sour and sweet. So glad i got to try this. 561 charactersmlhyatt, Oct 13, 2014

4.29/5  rDev -5.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes.  Pour is a yellowish orange with white head that retains nicely.  Nose starts with acid and funk.  Heavy notes of lemon zest, green apple, and funky notes of hay and farm.  The taste is moderately tart with a nice layer of funky complexity. Notes of oak come in and play  nicely with the funk qualities.  Reminds me of an authentic Belgian gueuze.  Mouthfeel is effervescent and light.  Overall, a very tasty American take on a gueuze. 456 charactershomebrew311, Sep 29, 2014

750ml C&C bottle; vintage 2013.
consumed on 9/21/2014 and at 4 Elves party this past winter; both times were the 2013 vintage was sampled.
poured into tulip glass.
Appearance: yellow bodied beer with thin white cap. 
Smell: white wine barrels and some light tartness. Not much going in the nose. Light musty funk.
Taste: Light tartness and a buttery richness. Lemon and green apples.  Getting some hints of oak as well. Minimal amount of funkiness that is a combination of plastic and mustiness.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low carbonation. Feels slick and buttery. Almost flat carbonation this beer needs some life put into it. 
Overall: This must be a beer that gets better as it develops in the bottle. As of how 2013 DDG is drinking, I just don't understand all the fanfare surrounding this Lost Abbey sour.  Not much complexity and it doesn't really impress me all that much. 908 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Sep 21, 2014

4.9/5  rDev +7.9%Beer #1000 for me. Poured from a 750 mL bottle into an enlarged snifter. 2013 version.
Appearance: Pours a medium orange-amber (opaque) and gives a finger or two of white, fizzy head that doesn't last long and leaves a white layer atop the beer when it's done. (4.6)
Smell: Ripe oranges, lemon rinds, lemony malts, floral apple blossoms, green apple, nice barnyard funk, a bit of vinegar. Clear big wine influence in the aroma. Big citrus with just a bit of nice funk. (4.8)
Taste: Perfumey grapes, ripe oranges, sour green apple, sour lemon/lime, peach, some grassy funk. Finishes a bit sour with lime and green apple. Everything is integrated insanely well, and that opening note of flavor is just spectacular.  Fairly acidic but the flavor is wonderful. (4.9)
Mouth-feel: Medium carbonation with a slick, medium, creamy body. Just a tad dry - really nice. Long finish. (4.75)
Overall: Really well balanced, absolutely delicious gueuze-style beer here. The wine barrels come out nice and strong but do not dominate. Well integrated flavors with a nice slightly dry mouthfeel. A wonderful beer here. (4.9) 1,111 charactersResuin, Sep 04, 2014

4.73/5  rDev +4.2%2013 B2 Bottle shared with my buddy David after passing the Series 7. 
Pours a bright golden-orange yellow color that looks so appetizing. Decent white foam hear that lasts a bit then recedes back into the glass
Smell - hints of straw, hay, grape vinous smells followed by the slightest note of red wine barrel character that gives it a dry tart funk smell
Taste - White grape, Lemon, yeast, straw, funk, tartness that is slight at the front with an amazing finish and as it warmed the red wine barrel character really shined. 
Mouthfeel - Dry medium bodied and extremely crisp. Very well done
Overall -  Fantastic beer from Lost Abbey and I am so glad I was able to track this one down. Well worth the wait and definitely one of my long time wants. 755 charactersdrmcleod10, Sep 03, 2014

4.79/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This beer is amazing. The appearance was golden and brite, slight orange, crisp with very little head only brief lacing that didnt linger at all. Carb bubbles were present throughout. 
The smell was sweet & sour with a good funk, slight notes of tart apple and pear. I thought after smelling that this was going to disappoint honestly.
The taste though, wow. Tart apple, granny smith, bright farmyard funk, the taste lingered as well and was slight bile lemon and finished with sweet spice notes and some orange grapefruity effervescence. This taste for me was perfection. Even as I cherished the last couple sips that had warmed it was even more complex with some malt, bread, salt and dank balanced funk. So good, better on the cold side but I cherished it all through the pour...
The mouth was crisp and dry, the tart wets the cheeks afterwards and it lingered in a good way
I really was close to a 5 on this beer, its definitely in my top 5 and left me craving desperately for another 988 charactersGrumpyBeer, Jul 15, 2014

Pours a deep golden-orange with a frothy, roughly one-inch off-white head. Decent head retention, no lacing to speak of.
In the nose, a massive dose of wet, yogurty lactobacillus funk dominates the initial whiff, as well as notes of white grapes, oak, dry yeast, crabapple, and a subtle hit of vinegar. Not getting the red wine barrels so much--there's definitely a vinous quality, but it doesn't remind me of any red I've ever had.
The taste is where Duck Duck Gooze really flexes its muscles. Yogurty funk, vinous white grape, lemon juice, dry bready yeast, white oak, crabapple, and tart Granny Smith apples. Again, a small hit of vinegar towards the back. Most excellent.
On the tongue, fairly dry and medium-bodied. Sprightly carbonation enlivens the palate but falls a bit flat towards the back. A lingering coat of yogurty lactic sourness clings to the back of the throat.
On the whole, what truly impressed me about DDG was its ability to present a bevy of delicious flavor profiles that managed to be at once distinct unto themselves as well as graceful partners to the other notes present in the beer. A fantastic beer, and one that I'm incredibly grateful to have gotten to try. 1,332 charactersLjudsignal, Jul 07, 2014

S - A gorgeous citrus aroma with the likes of lemons, oranges and persimmons. Citrus galore! I'm getting a little bit of pineapple as well. It doesn't quite have the funk that the Classic Cantillon Gueuze offers (drinking side by side). The aroma is complex and concentrated where I could just sit here and smell it all day.
T - The taste is very similar to the aroma. Citrus with some funk. Very complex and very refreshing!
M - Wonderful acidic feel and mouth coating. Very sour presence on the back edges of your tongue. 
O - This beer is awesome! I don't think that it's worth the fuss, but well worth seeking out and trying. Thanks again, Mike! 866 charactersCubatobaco, Jun 22, 2014

A- Yellow, hay-like color. Very foggy and some swimmies apparent from the yeats. Small quarter finger head with little lacing. Lots of effervescence.
S- Dank with a big bouquet of layers. Grapes, vines, and a little vinegar upfront. Gives way to some other earth smells like hay, straw, and a hint of lemon. Chardonnay and oak in the back.
T- Like the smell, this ale has a lot of business taking place. Pretty tart and sour upfront with the acidity noticeable. Chardonnay and oak are still here. A little citrus and dark fruit accompanied by the tartness of a cider. 
M- Light to medium bodied. You can feel the wild yeasts in this one and the fuzziness. 
O- My absolute favorite wild to date. Very sour, but it balances out perfectly with the other flavors. There is a lot of depth in this ale and is if fun to sip and play with the flavors. Glad I got the chance to try this one and it definitely lives up to the hype. Awesome job by Tomme and the crew at Lost Abbey. 983 charactersEveningCordial, Jun 02, 2014

ugly boring cider like yellow. smells and tastes of flat, yellow lemony vinegar. if I want a lemon I'll eat one from my tea. I'm actually one of those people who loves bitter lemon, but this is not that. vinegar. who the fuck wants vinegar in your beer.
you want a good, no great, beer? go get yourself a Weyerbacher Riserva, now that's a great, sour, barrel aged beer. bottom line, this was fucking terrible.'good thing I only wasted $7 on it. never understand how these kinds of beers get ratings around here. 738 charactersRacerX5k, Jun 02, 2014

2013 release. 750 ml bottle poured into a Cantillon balloon glass.
Appearance: Pours a light golden orange color with some wispy patches of white foam and a thinnish ring, but no real head. Body is clear with steady levels of fine visible carbonation.
Smell: Damp oak, green apple, pear, wet hay, red wine, lacto and a hint of melon. Really oaky.
Taste: Similar to the aroma, the taste is super oaky. Additional notes of red grape, funk, slight red berry character, lemon and a mild peachy/apricot type character in the finish. Sourness is medium.
Mouthfeel: Light bodied, with medium fine carbonation. Maybe a little thinner than ideal, but not watery by any means. Finishes mostly dry. Surprisingly refreshing and easy to drink.
Overall: One of the best american wild ales out there, and still holding up really well in the bottle after almost 3 years.
**Original review from June 2014**
On tap at Capone's during Philly beer week. Served in a mini snifter.
Appearance: Golden yellow in color with no head (These were all poured from the keg at the same time and then brought out all together at the same time, so it's possible any head had already dissipated). Body is slightly hazy. (3.75)
Smell: Grape, lacto, oak, funk, slight vinegar. Overall quite vinous. (4.25)
Taste: Follows the aroma pretty closely. Red grape, quite strong lacto presence, a bit more oak then in the nose and some barnyard like brett character. Sourness is medium. (4.5)
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium/low gentle carbonation. Relatively soft mouthfeel. (4.5)
Overall: An excellent American wild ale. You'll never mistake this for a gueuze, as the name might lead you to believe, but this is still a excellent beer worth seeking out. (4.5) 1,759 charactersJonada, Jun 01, 2014

Graceful, layered flavor of sour citrus, lemon meringue, slight orange and melon, with a tart finish that doesn’t overpower the well-balanced taste. Effervescent and slightly prickly palate. 352 charactersjbaker67, Apr 26, 2014

Review #551.
A- Straw yellow-brown body. One finger white head, fair retention, not a ton of lacing. In comparison to Beatification, this looks pretty much just like Sour in the Rye- aka a darker hued blonde.
S- There is a lot of lacto here, as evidenced by a thick, wet yogurt acidity that somewhat comes to dominate the nose. There is some vinous qualities, a bit of vinegar, tart apple flavours, sharp yeast flavours and a nice dry oak contribution. No real red wine barrel notes, but the vinous notes I do get seem to remind me more of a dry white wine.
F- This is where DDG shines the most. This is easily one of the more complex American wild ales I've ever had the opportunity to try. Dry oak, vinous grape, lactobacillus & yogurt, vinegar, a bit of breadiness, tart green apple, chardonnay. It's definitely a pleasure to drink and dissect. Very complex palate profile.
M- Medium bodied, not quite custardy but a bit thicker than a typical sour that's intended to be fashioned in the style of the Belgian lambic. Nice carbonation that leaves a nice fizzy finish initially, but that's lost after a little while.
O- This is probably one of the most complex American wild ales that I'll ever have the chance to try. It does seem to fade in the nose and flavour as it warms up, but I still enjoyed this a lot. I believe people when they say this and Beatification are better than Cable Car, and I'm very happy to have the opportunity to try a good one-third of a 750ml bottle of this to dissect and enjoy. Its certainly not an Armand'4 geuze, but as far as American wilds go, this is excellent.
Re-review: 2009 cork and caged bottle, served in a minisnifter 4/30/2016. I would argue that this is much  more well-rounded than the 2013 bottle we drank concurrently; a fair bit of ground peppercorn and lemon remain prominent, but much less of the green apple tartness on the nose and on the palate. It's more elegant and well-constructed compared to its successor, yet just as complex and aromatic. Now I understand why people put a big premium on the 2009 vintage as compared to the 2013 vintage. 2,193 charactersStevedore, Apr 24, 2014

4.17/5  rDev -8.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Have tried this beer on several occasions, so figured I might as well review it. It's beers like this that convince I'm just not much of a sour lover.
The beer pours a golden amber color with very good retention and considerable lacing. The nose is pretty one dimensional in my opinion, though if you're a sour lover, I guess it's great. I r eally pick up considerable lemon lime, but with some noticeable vinegar as well. It's a presage of what's to come on the palate, as I get mouth stingin lemon and lime acidity, albeit with some noticable underlying grape as well. Still, the sour component really dominates in this beer, and it's almost painful drinking this. Mouthfee lis medium bodied at most, with a long, sour, acidic finish. Alcohol is very well integrated into the flavor profile, and so if sours are your bag, I'm sure you'd be in heaven with this stuff.
Have had this several times now, and I'm able to appreciate it more than I first did when I sampled it with some friends in DC years ago, but this still is just too much sour for my palate to handle. That being said, this is always a fun and interesting beer to sample, and it's amazing the amount of flavor it delivers. 1,191 charactersJohn_M, Mar 25, 2014

A - Bright gold body. Fine white head settles quickly into a thin halo. Low lace. Nice effervescence in the glass. 
S - Round, super smooth nose. Tart green apple skins, white grapes, sweet wonder bread, tangerine, touch of salt, lemon zest. Soft sourness makes your mouth water.
T - Soured apple puree, sharp sour lemons, spiced pears, orange zest, Riesling, savory spice, oak, and yellow raisin. Salt and vinegar chips on the finish.
M - Silky smooth, medium-full body with an outstanding, absolutely show-stopper finish. The beer simply does not die out at all, lingering for ages your palate.
O - Awesome flavor, stellar balance, surprisingly smooth, and possibly the best finish of any beer I've ever had. Truly world class. 811 charactersvfgccp, Feb 02, 2014

Review #875
The beer poured a slightly hazed, straw yellow color with a subtle amber tinge. A one-finger tall, frothy, bone white head topped the liquid and quickly faded to a ring of bubbles. Spotty drops of lacing tricked down the glass.
Lots of interesting stuff happening in the aroma. Crisp, dry, powdery yeast notes came through initially but were soon washed away by a moderate tartness. Good dose of brett. Strong wheaty notes. There was a subtle, grape-y/wine-y presence as well. Even though this beer was aged in red wine barrels, I seemed to pick up white grape notes. The dry, tart qualities were balanced by a subtle, bready malt sweetness.
The flavor profile was quite similar to the aroma. Like the nose, it too was crisp and tart. Quite wheaty. Grape-y with strong notes of white wine. Again, considering the barrel aging method, this was a bit surprising. The beer was anchored by a crackery malt base. Touch of sweetness. Some moderately acidic, candy coated lemon notes were apparent as well. I can definitely see why some people have mentioned Sweet Tarts when describing this beer in their reviews. The beer finished with lots of bretty tartness, lemon and hints of vinegar. The lemon-like notes lingered on my palate long after every sip. All in all, very balanced and drinkable, especially for the style.
The mouthfeel was creamy and smooth. Medium bodied for the style. A fine, zippy effervescence gave the beer a light, supple, fluffiness.
Given the hype surrounding this beer, I was expecting it to be a bit more unique and complex. Nevertheless, this is a very tasty and well crafted American wild ale that I am grateful to have had the opportunity to sample. Big thanks again to my friend Sean for sharing this. 1,898 charactersDamian, Jan 26, 2014

From a cork and caged 750ml into a mini snifter
Both the 2013 and 2009 were drunk side by side. Review is for the 2013 with notes comparing the 2009. 
APPEARANCE: Pours a medium sized white heat with good retention. Clear gamboge in color with lower levels of carbonation evident. Ring remains with traces of lace leaving some lacing down the glass. The '09 was slightly darker in color with less head on it. 
SMELL: Tart lemon citrus notes, green apples, light musty and moldy aromas with some acidity on the nose. The '09 was less intense, or more refined perhaps, softer, with less acidity.
TASTE: Follows the nose. Lemon, green apples again, tart lemon sourness and some acidity at the finish. Bolder aftertaste is acidic with sour lemon, apples and light mustiness. There is a lot of potential here, but the acidity is in the way a bit. Enter the '09. Less acidity, softer and more refined balance between tart lemon notes and some funk. Much preferred the older vintage. 
PALATE: Lighter body with higher levels of carbonation. Creamy but a bit of an acidic burn at the swallow, finishing dry. Some tartness with acidity lingers on the palate. The '09 has less carbonation and less acidity in the finish. Softer and more refined overall. 
OVERALL: This was a lot of fun. Putting the '13 and the '09 beside each other really showed the superiority of the older vintage. The newer '13 is still too young, as it's a bit harsh with too much acidity in the way of the flavors. The '09, however, has matured nicely and reminds me of some aged gueuze here in Belgium. A soft, integrated and refined sour that was very much enjoyed all around. Not to offend the newer bottling, but most people at the tasting agreed the older vintage was superior; I certainly would have scored it a 4+. Thanks again for bringing this pair along. Lots of fun man! 1,948 charactersJeffo, Jan 21, 2014

Poured into a tulip glass from a 750ml bottle.
Vintage: 2013
Pours a nice crisp and clear bright golden color with a nice half-inch white head that is pretty dense. Head recedes pretty quickly down to a nice thin matt.
Aroma is of vinous tart notes. There are very slight balsamic notes with more of the lemony Gueze like character. Delicious white wine tart notes in the aroma, champagne and white wine yeast notes are present in the nose as well. Nice mild fruit juice sweetness that help balance the tartness. Notes of apple juice and pear mixed in with mild citrus fruit sweetness.
Flavor is where this brew takes the cake, especially as it warms. Starts off with amazing green apple tartness and sweetness (but mostly welcoming tartness). Huge yet not overwhelming puckering tartness starts things off along with dryness and woody funk notes. The brew is pretty musty and dry with a perfect balance between the tartness and the funk. Amazing tasting sourness that isn’t overwhelming with a great crisp, clean and fluffy body. Overall, this is one of the better sours I’ve had out there. It is clean and not too overwhelming but has some amazing fruit tartness balanced by some nice fruit sweetness. 1,238 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jan 06, 2014

pours a cloudy dark yellow with an inch thick head. smell is acidic and lemony .. vinegary. the taste is absolutely perfect. the sourness is not too strong and not too light. perfect flavor. I'd never guess red wine barrels but its so smooth. literally perfect gueuze.. medium carbonation and medium bodied.

FYI I'm going to use Beatification B5 as a reference for this. 
A - For appearance, it's almost identical. Very hazy medium golden. Thin, spritzy forth of an eggshell head. Some yeasty trails at the bottom of the glass.
S - Really well-balanced across white wine vinegar, soft citrus juice and rind, champaign, farmhouse hay, late summer grass, and orange creamsicle. Just a pinch of fresh oak.
T - Definitely not as puckeringly sour as Beat or most Cantillons. That being said, the level of tart is pretty excellent for my palate. Plentiful of upfront black pepper. Rounded lemon juice, vitamin c tablets, and herbs underneath. Oak tannins into the finish.
M - Light body, very high carbonation as expected, very dry, lengthy finish.
D - I think this is easily more balanced than Beat, pretty on par for complexity and more accessible for someone not looking for stomach-churning sourness. Easy recommendation. 1,044 charactersAuracom, Dec 02, 2013

Had it via taster and bottle, although I feel the bottle was better than what was poured from the tap. This is probably the best Wild Ale (or technically 'a geueze but really not a geuze' bc not in Belgium). Yes, there's a lot of hype with DDG, but well deserved. Would I pimp slap an angry football player for seconds? Yes, I would. Now the review: carbonation is perfect and a very clean mouthfeel. Tasty as hell with a long and the right amount of sour finish. Very well composed and should improve with age, which is scary to think of its potential. 640 charactersSaltySizzle, Nov 21, 2013

A lot going on in the nose, mainly funkadelics, earthy, bretty, aromas of horseblanket, lemon zest and apple peel, leaving no doubt that this will have some sourness to it. Very acidic on the palate, almost too much actually, nearly wrecking. After adjusting for a moment or two, out come flavors of acidic citrus and sour stone fruits, lemon drops, lesser notes of earthy funk, horseblanket, distant crackery malts. Dry and crisp mouthfeel, medium body, and--if you conquer that initial blast of palate-wrecking acidity--a pretty easy drinker for the style. Pretty good overall, but not worth trading an arm and a leg for. 810 charactersRifugium, Nov 17, 2013

Straw-yellow in color, clear and effervescent. The nose is distinct notes of citric acid and vinegar with a touch of honey sweetness lingering. The flavors are sharply sour at the front, with unraveling notes of citrus and unripe fruit, perhaps apple. Bubbly and light on the palate, especially for the ABV. Notes of pepper toward a short, citrusy finish.
A refreshing, compelling ale, but not as well-rounded as the first release, and not as good as the hype or the price would lead you to think. There are plenty of other sour brews with more depth and complexity. This probably could use a year or two in the cellar as well. 663 charactersrand, Nov 11, 2013

Lots of hype around this bottle, but I have tried to keep it in perspective and not get caught up in the glamor of the contents. 
Nice color, clarity and noticeable carbonation. Really appealing. I swear I started smelling it once the cork came out. BIG tropical fruit notes with enough vinegar to really tingle in the nose. I'm picking up a little Granny Smith green apple skins with that sour, tannic dryness that it is known to possess. You get that funk, but not in the sense of the other Belgians we had next to it. It's more subdued with that stinky gym bag sense (never thought i'd ever get to experience that).
Flavor is filled with that tropical fruit in the aroma. Orange and tangerine really come to the front of the flavor onslaught with really delicious slightly sweet apple cider hitting mid palate. The finish is dry and where the funky aspects really come alive. Seriously, a delicious beer that I am glad I got to return for second. 
Worth the hype and definitely one of my favorite of the night. Whenever a personal whale is slain AND you get to keep your money is a wonderful day. 1,206 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Nov 07, 2013

The head settles and doesn't leave much in the way of lacing on the glass. The smell is pretty funky, with some subtle citrus in there as well. The taste is sour with some nice soft graininess in the finish. Overall it's a very solid beer and was fortunate to try it. 343 charactersKnapp85, Oct 13, 2013

Pours a deep gold color with medium to small white head that leaves a good amount of lacing on the sides of the glass after dissipating to a small crown atop the WELL carbonated liquid contents. 
Aroma on this is freshly squeezed lemon juice, peach, grape, passion fruit, a touch of earthiness/mustiness, and a faint floral note much like rose petals. The nose on this is just as inviting as any Cantillon or Drie Fonteinen that have traversed my nasal cavity. 
The taste brings sweet lemon, astringent white grape, peach, and hay upfront with lemon warheads from the middle to back of the tongue. Sweet orange balanced by sour pucker and a slight bitterness for the finale. So much balance! 
Mouthfeel is perfect. A heavier side of light body with the perfect amount of carbonation. It makes this so drinkable for a sour.
Overall. This is world class. Period. The balance present in this is what makes it so phenomenal. Im a fan of bold flavors, balance, and drinkability in any beer style. This is the epitome of those three descriptors summed up in the American Wild Ale style. This is ready to drink now. NOW! More sourness may appeal to some, but not me. The bottle is almost done. All by myself in less than an hr and a half. I'm in love... 1,356 charactersMarcWP, Oct 04, 2013

A: Pours a straw-orange with a small effervescent head that recedes quickly to a rim around the edges. 
S: Jesus this smells like somebody poured malt vinegar on top of hawaii. And I mean that in the best way possible. Big notes of both sweet and sour fruit up front: grapefruit, big lemon, tangerine, and sour apple all dance like prepubescent naked teens conjuring satan in the forest during the salem witch trials. This fruitiness is pulled by an acidic tartness that is surprisingly more sweet than the vinegar sourness that has been known to plague a select few LA sours that shall not be named. 
T: First few sips were an overwhelming acidic pucker that kept my anus clenched through the end, where it finally faded into a funky and musky finish. Some subtle fruit sweetness, but mostly vinegar and acidic. Not like shitty Bruery sour-gone-bad vinegar, but the typical LA vinegar as mentioned above. As it warmed, the vinegar started to fade, and morph into a more juicy and fruity sour as the initial aroma would have suggested. By the time my first glass was empty and the second was poured, I fell in love. This beer is the pinnacle of what an AWA should strive for. Sour as fuck, funky as shit, but also unbelievably juicy. Green apple, lemon juice, and sweet nectarines stood out once it warmed. Finish is dry and full of unicorn semen. Like sucking on a green apple jolly rancher. Wo0ah daddy like.
M: HOLY SHIT WHO TAUGHT TOMME HOW TO CARBONATE PROPERLY?
O: Admittedly I am lost abbey fanboy, However, I don't hesitate to criticize them when they fuck up. They do fuck up a lot, but when Tomme gets his shit together, they are 100% fucking all time...this beer would be an example of being 100% fucking all time. Like an otter pop blended with lemon juice filtered through sweaty gym socks. And yeah, that was intended to be a compliment. 1,912 charactersDmouthCaliBrewz, Sep 25, 2013

A-Pours an opaque peach juice hue. Thin layer of white foam. 
S-Funky and musty. Oak and sour lemon juice. Light sweetness and a grassy component.
T-Starts off firmly tart. Lemon rind and wet woodiness. Grass and lingering, zesty sourness. Hints of malt sweetness. High acidity. Quite complex.
M-Has some body to it. Dry. Softer carbonation. 
O/D-A huge treat to be able to try this beer. I was not blown away but it is clearly a great Wild Ale. This one is a bit over hyped. Still, not much else to complain about. 538 charactersVelvetExtract, Sep 14, 2013

Initial Tasting: September 11, 2013
A - Pours a vibrant orange hue with a slight haze and a spritzy evolving foam. Decent two-finger head with a vigorous pour that quickly settles to a nice white layer of small bubbles at the surface.
S - Smell is loaded with sour, citrus zest and potent Belgian-style yeast. Fresh and bright aromas of green apples, coriander, and lemon peel. Some bready tones with a nice biscuit backbone.
T - Initial sip is bright and tart . Immediately bombarded with citrus and sour tartness that blends into some sweet stone fruit, like an early nectarine or peach. There is a slight tartness derived from some cherry cabernet and a subtle oak undertone. Delicious.
M - Nice sparkling texture with a quaffable presence. Lends to a nice drinkability, but its depth beckons a quiet, soft sipping approach. There is a slight acidity that dulls the tongue at first, but blends well with the rest of the body. Finishes wetter on the palate than others with a salivating finish that feeds the next sip. Only thing keeping the mouthfeel from a 5 is the acidity.
O - I was skeptical on how great this Wild Ale offering could be, even with all the hype, but I am pleasantly surprised. While I was intent on writing off this acquisition as foolish (internet purchasing debacle, road trip to San Diego, etc), I am content in saying it was worth it. It's definitely one of the more stronger wild ales I've enjoyed yet. I can't wait to age this a bit and hopefully mute out some of the acidity that is present. Go little bottle yeast ducklings, go! 1,631 charactersStrongAleSkeptic, Sep 12, 2013

Floral notes, lemon, sour apple, dried apricot, not so ripe grape..
Will vanquish any sour craving, sour apple, lemon/lime tart, refined oaky background.
Light and fizzy mouthfeel - extremely drinkable, although there is an acidity to this that can be overbearing.
I'd like to age this and drink all my bottles now. I wish this was more available - quite delicious. 481 charactersptykozoon, Sep 08, 2013

This wonderful elixir was served in a plastic cup. I did share a bit with my GF who I've been introducing to sours over the last couple years. Kind wished for a DDG glass taster, but hell I was happy just to get a taste without cracking a bottle. 
A: Very clear light golden color. You can tell something interesting is hiding behind that veil of beauty. 
S: Tart with fruity esters only inviting your senses to get closers. 
T: The initial taste is of mild fruit with a very drinkable sourness, that makes you want to go for the next drink. 
M: Very smooth, with some wetness. 
O: I love this beer, but I'm hesitant on opening a bottle now. When I do I'll be revisiting this review. 737 charactersSirSmedley, Sep 04, 2013

A: Deep orange and radiant hay/illuminated foxtails at the edges of the glass, bubbly frothy eggshell carb, nice lacing dropping doily webbing like Peter Parker down the edges. This is what was inside of Marcellus Wallace's briefcase.
S: Incredible fruit esters, apricot, lactic acidity, tangelo, nectarines, tangerines, a subtle sweetness and a light musk on the backend like wet hay.
T: This just rips up the mouth carpet like a day laborer and lays acidic laminate like a licensed ph3 contractor. There is shocktarts, sweet tarts, lemon zest, grapefruit dryness, and a musky leather aspect on the backend that keeps the acidity in check. Absolutely phenomenal.
M: This is incredibly drying and just drills your gumline like a Peter North video. Incredibly acidic and rolls back those bicuspics and leaves your mandible aching in the best possible way. She is raw with your mouth but you wouldn't have it any other way, you already are waiting for her to return in 3 years for another tryst in the hay. Cankersores await in the morning but it is the sweet succor of a casual duck sesh.
D: this is exceptionally drinkable despite the incredible acidity and if you can't handle it, work your jaws up with some Petrus and take your complaints elsewhere. The price and availability of this is a complete testicle and wallet defacement that makes me longing for more. Some will take calm refuge and say that 3F Oude Gueuze is better, denial is a hella of a panacea. This is an almost perfect AWA in every way, it is not a gueuze, but it goes beyond even traditional Goozies in sheer excess and panache like an acidic ZR1 that pushes you down in your seat with sheet acidic stiff arming. Fucking phenomenal, every bit as good as B1 that will continue to improve despite the 1.0001 FG. Mark my words. 1,879 charactersSubpoenaDeuces, Sep 03, 2013

3oz pour in a plastic shot cup
Served at Lost Abbey DDG release
A: Light straw color. Nice 1/4" head with some lacing. No alcohol legs on the crappy plastic cup.
S: A slight barnyard aroma present.
T: Not super sour. some tartness up front with citrus fruit and barnyard flavors mid palate.
M: Starts tart then goes to a nice soft creamy mouthfeel that finishes crisp from the effervescence.
O: This beer is an exercise in balance and a great example of the style. The mouthfeel plays well with the flavor that plays well with the crisp finish. It was a great beer to have when standing around with a few hundred other whale hunters in a 90 degree plus warehouse sweating. As far as other sour beers out there this one is mild. Is this beer worth the Whale status? No. But is a really good beer none the less. Recommended. 843 charactersPsyko, Sep 01, 2013

S - Tart lemons, light sweet tarts, lactic acid, light oak, some orange 4.25
T -Tart lemon, musty oak, orange, and lactic acid. There is really a strong tartness to it but despite that the oak adds enough funk to give the beer a complexity beyond being just a straight tart bomb.
M - Had a lot of carbonation yet was rather smooth. However, when it's as tart as this beer was, it definitely felt sharp on the tongue and had a dry finish
O - This is a solid American wild ale that goes up there with some of the Belgians I've had. It definitely was one of the most sour beers I've had as it was rather tart with just enough funk and complexity to keep it grounded and interesting 728 charactersjeonseh, Aug 16, 2013

For the people that have had it already, it was unanimous that this was the best bottle of DDG they have ever had. For me the amazing balance of sour/funk/lemon zest was amazing.

Score: 100
2009 vintage bottle served in an hard plastic wine chalice and enjoyed on 05/18/13 side-by-side with a bottle of 2012 Cable Car as part of our Chicago Craft Beer Week whales tasting. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Similar color to, but a little lighter and more "bright" than, the Cable Car (orangey-golden in color). Only a thin ring of head around glass off the pour. Surprisingly good lacing and retention (Cable Car absolutely lacked both). 5/5
Smell: Tart apples, pear, hint of mango. Super sour nose. 5
Taste: Incredibly tart peach, apple, mango, lemon and some vinegar. Lacto too, but not in a funky way. A light amount of pine as well. 5/5
Mouthfeel: A little more body than Cable Car (which was light-medium bodied) with a perfect level of carbonation as well. More tart than Cable Car too, with a tongue tingling zestiness that was like drinking liquid warhead candy. Just as dry as Cable Car on the finish. 5/5
Overall: Even better than Cable Car. This is one I wish I had a case (or ten) of. I love how "clean" and sour this was, without being heavy on the funk. This is one of the best beers I have had the opportunity to sample. Prost!
Cost: $40 for a 750 ml bottle. 1,376 charactersjegross2, Jul 06, 2013

4.14/5  rDev -8.8%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750 mL bottle poured into a wine glass.
Appearance - Hazy orange. Small white head with a thin collar.
Smell - Orangey citrus acid aroma. A hint of vinegar creeping up in the back.
Taste - Bright citrusy sour. Orange sourness. Vinegar is less intense, but still faint in the back. Very intense sour finish. 
Mouthfeel - Medium carbonation. Very sour.
Overall - Extremely sour and it probably covers up any complexity. Thankfully the flavors it has are quite good. 468 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 15, 2013

4.66/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5'09 750 poured into a Crooked Stave snifter. Tomme told me to crack this one soon, so I did. Here is what I think about it. 
Appearance: Golden, minimal lacing. Carbonation still holding up. Probably 1/4 carbonation that it had in '09. Looks great. 
Smell: Sour lemon, sour apple, lacto, minimal brett I would assume. Very encouraging for an American Sour&gt;Gueuze attempt. 
Taste: Follow smell with tart lemon with background sour apple. I have never had this fresh, this is the only time that I have had it; and I feel like it could last a few years more. Tomme said this was turning to acid, but mine tastes fine. Barnyard funk. 
Mouthfeel: Feels like the style. A little wax coats the mouth like Saint Louis Fond Tradition does. Probably 1/4 as much wax as St. Louis Fond Tradition. Really pleasant mouthfeel. I am enjoying this right now on July 4th. 
Overall: I have heard many people say that this beer is turning into acid, but perhaps their techniques in storing has been an issue with their bottle. This bottle tasted like it was about 2 years old. If you have stored your correctly I think you have another 2-3 years before it goes bad. I wish I would have had this news prior to me opening my only bottle; but I am very glad to have had this delicious brew. 1,275 charactersgueuzedreg, Apr 20, 2013

Pours a hazy orange without much head.
This is hard to review for me because it's actually pretty one dimensional. Very sour/acidic, bright dry apple/grape, delicious but not super complex. Very dry and acidic going down.
Excellent for what it is but not as good as a top Belgian gueuze and not as good as Izzy or some of the other best CA sours.

A - Poured into my Kate the Great tulip a hazy straw hue with a sudsy head that fades to a thin blanket. Nice light lacing here.
S - Super, super sour tart funk. Big, tart lemons with lots of oak barrel. Some nice green apple notes too. Oh wow!
T - TONS of green apples here, tart, tart sour green apple sinks as well. Lemons and green apples with good earthy notes as well along with light oak.
M - Mouthfeel is super tart and delicious. Never really puckering, but almost mind shattering dry.
O - Overall this was an exceptional bottle. So glad I got to try this little slice of heaven. 704 charactersrudzud, Feb 28, 2013

Pour: Hazy yellow orange, with a half finger of white head that recedes to a rim. No lacing. Body has a nice glow to it.
Smell: Big tart lemons and funk up front. Lots of oak as well. Some pear skins and green apples. A strong lactic character is even sour on the nose. 
Taste: Big sour lemons up front, followed by a deep clean funk. Lots of tart pears and more lemon. A hefty amount of oak dries everything out continually. Some light bready sweetness, but only just. Finishes with funk and oak.
Mouthfeel: Very sour, but never puckering or cloying. Very, very dry, which I enjoy immensely. 
Overall: This beer exceeded my high expectations. It is clear why it has the acclaim it carries. I hope to have it again. 785 characterscfrances33, Dec 31, 2012

I have been wanting to try this one for a while!
Poured a hazy apricot like color with minimal head. The nose on this one was amazingly tart, slight funk mixed with lemon juice.
Taste follows suit on the tartness. hint of lemon rhind mixed with sour berries. This was surprisingly dry on the palate. Smooth from sip to finish. Overall this is an amazing geuze 453 charactersjoel66, Dec 01, 2012

A: Pours a clear, extremely golden color with no head or lacing at all. 
S: Nice tartness, very fragrant peach, apricot, and a little bit of lemon. There is a very nice sourness mixed with some light funk and acid, but the fruit is quite nice. 
T: Fantastic, lots of lemon and peach with a great mixture of tart/funk/earthy flavors. There is some citrus fruit and a little stone fruit. Very sharp acidity on the back end. Faint oak comes through as well. 
M: Medium bodied, extremely smooth with a great level of carbonation. 
O: Lives up to its reputation. Great fruit flavor with the level of sourness/acidity that I love in this style. Thanks again Jay! 724 charactersmdaschaf, Oct 09, 2012

T: Very sour! Some funk and lots of citrusy sourness. Less funky than 3F and Cantillon gueuzes. A bit sweet with peaches/lemons and some oak flavors. Clean, minimal funk finish.

4.12/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4750ml bottle into a Cantillon tulip. Enjoyed during a truly ridiculous sour/Lambic tasting. Enormous thanks go out to Jon for sharing this huge long-time want of mine.
A: Hazy pale orange body under a finger of fine white froth. The head settles into a persistent ring, and leaves spotty lace. Nice.
S: Sour, piquant and fruity. Lemon and cantaloupe. Tons of acidity. Excellent.
T: Lemon-lime tartness up front, followed by melon, grapefruit, and harsh, pure sourness - mostly lactic, a faint hint of acetic. Really tasty, but a bit one-sided in favor of fruity sourness. Not as much funk as I'd like.
M: Fairly light-bodied with nice, lively, fine carbonation.
O: This is undoubtedly a terrific American take on the style, but it really suffered in comparison to some of the Belgians on display during the tasting (e.g. all four Armand'4s, A&T blend, Crianza Helena, 50ºN4ºE, '98 LP Gueuze, etc, etc, etc). I really enjoyed the melon character and intense sourness, but complexity was sorely lacking compared to the Old World funk bombs. If you like sours, don't hesitate to seek this out - but don't feel you have to empty out your cellar in order to land it, either.

Medium to light in body with a semi drying tart finish. The finish leaves you begging for more! Overall, this beer was everybit worth the hype. So pumped I got to have it! 512 charactersdcloeren, Sep 09, 2012

Peach-colored body brings with it some white head. The fizz emits a pleasantly lemony aroma, layered with sour yeast and oak. Love the nose's intensity; hopefully this tastes as good as it smells.
Liquid meets tongue, taste buds rejoice. Tart lemons, oak, sharply acetic, mildly barnyard-esque, plus a unique kiss of sweetness to shake things up. Lemon meringue pie in a glass.
Reminds me of Cable Car, though I prefer the blend of flavors here. An excellent American sour. 593 charactersbrystmar, Aug 20, 2012

Pours a very light fizzy head, and knowing the history of this one surprised it has any head at all. Hazy bright golden straw like color.
Nose brings a light tart funk right off, golden very light malts, fruity juice like aromas with lots of tart fruit, a hint of funk and hint of acidity, and a big tartness.
Taste starts quite sour actually, with a huge acidity! Acetic acid comes through with a big funk taste, lacto like funk, with juicy sour fruit, hint citrusy even, with a tart almost berry like fruit. Light bready malts in the background and towards the finish play up the sharp acid bite and nice blend of sour juice and tart fruit. there is a very slight hint of a vanilla oak barrel rounding effect, but that's mostly drowned out by the tart fruits, funk, and big acid kick. Finish is dry, bone dry, with a bit of bready malts, some funk, tart fruit, a little plemmy, and more acetic acid.
Mouth is lighter bodied, with very little carb.
Overall fan-freakin-tastic! Amazing gueuze, with great blend of sour fruit juice, tart almost fresh fruit flavors, some funk, and plenty of acidity and a light typical bready malt finish. Nice and dry, and all in all fairly drinkable surprisingly. Really wish I could have gotten more of this to at least have another one in the cellar. The only real issue is lack of carbonation, and a few year old beer, and being a Lost Abbey beer in the time of Tomme Arthur carbonation issues (if you want to call it that), still pretty good. 1,643 charactersjlindros, Jul 22, 2012
4.08/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This was opened at our Lost Abbey tasting in DC. Poured from the bottle into a tasting snifter.
Appearance: The beer pours a cloudy golden amber color with not much visible carbonation.
Smell: Tart lemony funk with a touch of malt sweetness. Not nearly as funky as a traditional gueuze.
Taste: I'm not sure I would call this a gueuze. Much sweeter than most gueuzes I've had. Less funky than I would have expected. Tart lemon and some vinegar. The finish is slightly herbal and sour. 
Mouthfeel: The body is medium with tingly carbonation and a dry finish.
Overall: I thought this was a very good American Wild, but I was expecting a gueuze (I know it's listed as a wild, but the name made me thin gueuze). I still liked it and would have more. 749 charactersoline73, Jul 13, 2012

A - Hazy hay color. That's the best I got. There is a good amount of carbonation and lingers for a few minutes, retreated to the edge of the glass.
S - Amazing. Big time earth and funkiness. Just super barnyard sour funkiness.
T - Big lemons up front with an oddly cherryish finish. Very tart and acidic without being overbearing. Big funk on the back end as well.
M - Tingles on the front of the tongue, first and foremost. Super light despite the funk factor. Super drinkable.
O - Just a fantastic beer. Glad we got to readd this one. Clean despite being funky. Boom. 704 charactersraveskdr, Jul 01, 2012

Golden honey blonde with swirls of haze from the yeast. Nice bubbly top. Beautiful blend of lemon zest, herbs, tannic wood, and must, with lots of citric and lactic sourness radiating all over the place. Very light sweetness throughout. Light in body with an effervescent carbonation that is neither too strong nor too weak. Quite a delicious beer indeed. 456 charactersDmanGTR, Jun 28, 2012

Pours a great golden color, a tad bit hazy, a thin white head appears and dissipates right away, pretty much all you can ask for in a wild ale, I do wish there was a bit more head to it though. The aroma is just sublime, lemons, a bit of hay, grapefruit, a touch of chewy sweet oak. Some tart green apple and white grape comes out the end, just a fantastic way to greet your nose. The flavors are just as wonderful, tart lemon, a bit of grapefruit, oak, green apple, a bit more hay, just a little bit of funk, but the fruit flavors really mix well with the earthiness, the balance is about as good as it gets and the profile is so spot on, everything plays with each other so well. The body is amazing, perfectly carbonated, not too big, not too thin, coats the mouth so well and has a fantastic dry finish.
Verdict: This is definitely one of the best beers on the planet and deservedly has a reputation as being one. I really can't think of anything to change about this beer and my wishing for more head might be out of line. My hats off to Tomme for this, a true gem. 1,131 characterskevanb, Jun 18, 2012

a - Pours a clear deep golden color with one inch of bright white head and moderate carbonationi evident. Looks amazing.
s - Smells of sour fruits, lemon, citrus, hay, earth, wine, oak, grapes, funk, brett, and apples. Ton of sourness, brett, and some light funk mix to an amazing smell. Near perfect for me.
t - Tastes of sour fruits, light wine, oak, brett, apples, lemon and citrus hops, some earthy notes, and sour grapes. Awesome taste, though the nose is slightly better.
m - Medium body and low to moderate carbonation. Crisp and very easy to drink.
o - Overall I thought this was an amazing wild ale; one of the best at the tasing for me, and one of the best I've ever had. The nose is perfect and just a ton of sourness and funk. Well worth the hype and really hoping the rumors are true that they are making this one again. I preferred it to both Synergy and Yellow Bus, though Izzy slightly edged this one out for me. 1,005 charactersmdfb79, Apr 19, 2012

A - Pours honey yellow with a nice one finger tall white head leaving spotty streaks of lace down the glass. Goes a little dead in the glass after the first few minutes.
S - Smells of bright lemon zest, green apples, a bit of candied sweetness and some light vinegar toward the end. It gets a little funkier as it sits in the glass.
T - Starts off with a nice lemon twang up front quickly giving way to hints of granny smith apples, some candied sugar and a bit of earthy funk. The balance of tartness and sweetness is spot on. Finish is pretty tart, leaving the pallet dried for quite awhile after the finish.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Crisp, tart feel that leaves the pallet dry long after consumption. It has a really good balance of flavors throughout.
O - I really enjoyed this one. It had a ton of flavor but it was much easier to drink than some of the other wild's I have had. I would have loved to have tried this one fresh when it came out. 1,094 charactersorangesol, Feb 15, 2012
3.61/5  rDev -20.5%look: 4 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Huge thanks to TurdFurgison for breaking this out at our recent tasting. This was my first experience with the beer, and while you said it hasn't improved with age, I still thought it was a tasty beer!
A - The first pours of this were a brilliant brassy color with great clarity. No real head though.
S - Buttery chardonnay is the best way I can describe the aroma. Bitter strawberry greens and a nice sourness make up the remainder of the aroma.
T - Much more lactic/sour than the aroma hinted at. The sourness was tasty indeed, though the beer was a bit one-dimensional, especially after some of the other beers we opened that night.
M - Low carbonation. Acidic.
O - As far as most American Wilds go this is far and away something well made. However, when pitted against the cream of the crop it (at least at this stage in its aging) falls very short of pure greatness. I really dug the clean sourness - unlike the harsh over-bacterialized sours so many breweries are rushing through production anymore. 1,010 charactersSpider889, Feb 08, 2012

Pours a deep golden orange with a small head that dissipates slowly to a thin ring around the glass, no lacing. 
Smells amazing, initially taken aback by the intense sourness and tart peaches. My tongue was bracing for the tartness that was coming. The more I sniff it, the more fresh fruit, sweetness, honey and funk come through.
Intense sourness hits the tongue first puckering on the way down. This sourness is nicely complimented with a sweet honey, balanced with a little oak and soft tannins. Super tart, but great balance in fruit and earthiness. 
Good carbonation, leave my mouth super dry from the tartness. A little creamy as it warms.
Overall, really great beer, probably the most sour beer I've had besides Hanssens . Not much funk, but it's great with the fresh peach flavor and honey. The taste is really delicious, the sour is balanced with sweetness, and complex with wood and depth of flavor. 943 charactersislandboi8204, Feb 06, 2012

My white wale has been conquered! Finally!!!
Thanks toZX6Chris for sharing
Shared at MrHirschybars tasting
App- In the glass this shines as a bit of a clear vibrant yellow. It has a tinge of orange to it and a small ¼” head that fell quickly to only a bit of a pond layer on top. The cling was very minimal and didn’t really shine through.
Smell- I sat and smelled this for a bit before taking a sip to let it all soak in. It's very lemony. It has a little bit of stringy sugar with a balance of a little sour note without coming of as too vinegary. .
Taste- The taste is the money shot for this beer. It was lemony again like the nose but has an inherent softness behind it. Not over cloying sweet but had a good amount of earthiness and then comes out with sour and some funk. It was just balanced and almost perfect. 
Mouth- Light-medium bodied and then paired with a medium-high carbonation levels make this one quite tart and bubbly and soft at points. A little dry and a little wet all at the same time.
Drink- Well the journey is complete. I have my white wale and I finally got to give my little girl the bottle. For those of you who know the story, you know how much this means to me. The moment, the beer, the people it was perfect. Thank you again Chris. I owe you big time. 1,359 charactersFosterJM, Jan 23, 2012

Pours a clear golden yellow with an off-white head that settles to a thin film on the top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is extremely sour and funky with lemon-like fruits and some earthy aromas. Taste is of extremely sour lemons and funky earthy flavors. A very acidic quality in the mouth with each sip. This beer has a crisp carbonation level with a prickly mouthfeel. Overall, this is an extremely awesome wild ale with some amazing smells and flavors. I feel very lucky to have tried this one. 590 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jan 22, 2012

From notes. Shared with friends - thanks jerz for the trade way back when.
A: Murky, bright golden. Barely 0.5 bubbly (off-white) fingernail head on medium pour.
S: Burnt hay, SweeTarts, white grape, aged sharp white cheddar, and hint of must and grapefruit.
T: Sweet Granny Smith apples with balance of tart and sour. Lots of oak and lemon zest with hints of funk and barnyard, but I wish there were more of this. This aspect of the beer is here and gone too quickly - I want a gueuze to be very distinct and memorable and this is not. Sad.
M: Light bodied with soft carbonation. Crisp and dry.
O: I'll be honest, I had really high hopes for this and it was a bit of a letdown. Definitely worth seeking out, but I'm not too crazy about it. I would like to give it another try, but there are plenty of other gueuzes out there that are readily more available and taste better. I think the big thing for me is that this is more mellow that a lot of other ones in this style. Maybe it needs a bit more age, but only time will tell. 1,080 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 22, 2012

A- Pours a Brown golden straw color, absolutely no carbonation at all, really hazy.
S- Really mellow aroma, cardboard, slight notes of fruit, peach, apricot, lemon, nothing really comes out in the aroma overall, slight acidic notes, sour, the nose was a little disappointing. 
T- The taste was the complete opposite, really acidic, love the strong sour notes that come out, really puckering, apricot, vinegar, sour grape skin, nice taste.
M- Really dry, medium mouth feel, no carbonation, nice puckering taste.
O- Very impressed with this beer, this has been on my top wants for some time, love the acidity, and the fruity notes that come out, would love to have another opportunity to drink this beer. 803 charactersChriscrundwell12, Jan 18, 2012

Smells amazing. Super ripe and tangy peaches and
Nectarines are dominant. Perhaps a hint of raspberries as well. Not particularly complex, but just so damn delicious. Fresh fruit all the way.
Intense sourness hits the tongue first, and burns all the way down. Mmm. Soft vanilla and oak linger long after the first sip. Definite acetic twang, bringing out the nectarine flavor. This is definitely a Lost Abbey sour.
Leaves your mouth feeling like you just ate a big ol peach, coated from the sweet tangy fruit character. Nice dense carbonation, ad soft oaky tannins barely there as you enjoy.
I have had this 5 or so times now, and have loved it every time. Not the most complex stuff, no real depth of funk, but, again, the fresh fruit character they manage to evoke in beers like this, Isabelle, and Cable Car is always impressive. 1,051 charactersMrFootstones, Dec 22, 2011

Beautiful golden pour with nice white head. Smells delicious! Tart, sour, a little funk and sweetness. Tastes amazing, a little sweet then a nice sour pucker and funk on the finish. A nice balance that keeps evolving with time. 
Great mouthfeel. I found this beer had a lot of body when I first tried it and I knew it would age well, as the years pass the body is thinning but it still has so many years to go. 
Overall an amazing beer, definitely the best American Wild ale I've ever had. Still has plenty of body and I honestly don't even think it's peeked yet. 705 charactersZX6Chris, Dec 16, 2011

Pours a hazy gold with a thin white head that settles to a slight ring and swirls of haze. Phenomenal aromas of funk, lemon juice, oak, green Granny Smith apples, and wet hay. Very acidic and sharp, but in the best possible way. Reminds me quite a bit of Cable Car. Taste follow the nose nicely, very acidic flavors of lemon juice, green apple, and tropical fruit with a bit of oak and a whole lot of funk. Mouthfeel is crisp and smooth, with a fairly light body and good, sharp carbonation. Just the right amount of dry sourness here, it doesn't strip the enamel off your teeth. Overall an amazing, unforgettable beer, so stoked to have gotten to try this. Cheers, Shane! 752 charactersjsanford, Dec 08, 2011

Thanks for this one, Jerz and ZX6Chris!
(Aged for 2 years)
Clear golden with lots of visible, active carbonation and a thin near-white head. Spots of lace are left down the glass.
A hugely aromatic sour consisting of bright, vibrant juicy lemons and a tart, biting, strong sour tartness. As the beer warms, more barnyard funk aromas present complementing the strong citrus (lemon) and sourness.
The flavor follows the aroma very similarly. The dominant flavor is of funky yeast and strong lemons, complemented by a high level of sourness throughout. Complete, and while aggressive, very drinkable.
Thin to medium bodied with high carbonation. Incredibly easy to drink. Light and airy.
An absolute joy. I wish I had this on unlimited supply at home (one can wish!). 785 charactersehammond1, Nov 20, 2011

Look: Pours a light yellow in color with little to no head on my pour
Smell: Very tart and funky lots of lemon zest
Taste: This beer to me taste like someone took lemon heads and pureed them and then added a bunch of water to it to make the beer a bit thinner. There is not much else going on here but ton of lemon and a bit of vinegar
Mouthfeel: Thin body and a ton of carbonation and extremely tart
Overall: I am extremely glad that I finally got to try this whale of a beer. Thank you again Jacob for the bottle share 561 charactersDarthKostrizer, Nov 07, 2011

4.79/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750 mL bottle into a tulip. Thanks to bauermj for bringing this out to the whale tasting.
Appearance: My pour is a very hazy light golden straw color with a light off-white head that fades away to nothing. 
Smell: The aroma is so sour it burns my nose a little bit. Pure sour, lemon zest, some grapefruit, and a bit of apricot.
Taste: The light malt is there but gets quickly overwhelmed by the lemon, lactic, and vinegar sourness. Very sour throughout, which I enjoy very much; that is really the focus of the beer. Lemon, a bit of white grape and green apple with some full grapefruit sourness to finish.
Mouthfeel: Smooth but bitingly sour and tart. Medium bodied, crisp carbonation.
Overall: I really enjoy sours that really burn my nose and rip my taste buds out. This satisfies that criteria. 817 charactersKickInTheChalice, Oct 31, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Ah, Duck Duck, we finally meet thanks to Vacax. Thanks again, Jacob. 750 ml bottle served in a snifter.
Pours a light orange with good 1-2 finger pearly white head. A bit cloudy and yeasty.
Smells of a real gueuze, Jean Van Roy would be proud. Very funky, "horse blanket" if you'd like. Some good sweetness is under all of that funk. Lemon and orange peel.
Tastes just exceptional. Really love this. I have heard people say this tastes like "smarties" and I can see what they mean. It does have a slight candy taste, but it's hidden under very balanced lemon sourness. This beer is exactly how I like a wild ale, very sour with a bit of sweetness coming through on the back end. So tasty.
Mouthfeel is a pretty solid body and moderate to high carbonation.
Overall, finally a beer I don't feel stupid for taking time to track down. This beer is amazing and I would drink it frequently if it wasn't so damn rare. 915 charactersdmsohyea, Oct 30, 2011

Thanks to Bulldogp04 for sharing this guy in line at the CBS release. Served in a Deschutes snifter.
A: Pours a hazy golden yellow with spritzy white head that dissipates to some swirls.
S: There is actually some considerable funk in there, nice tart lemon skins and some sour apples. A nice woody oak character as well. 
T: The taste follows the nose. It's nice to see some funkiness in there, nice oaky flavors with a sharp tartness. Some sour lemon as well. Really great.
M: Light bodied with a nice dry finish. Little pucker in there.
O: Delicious. I'm surprised at how funky this has become. I didn't really expect that. Great flavor profiles. I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to try this again, but I can cross my fingers and hope. 763 charactersTreebs, Oct 30, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Pastel yellow in color. Slightly cloudy. Forms a bubbly off-white head that slowly dissipates to a stable surface coating and a thick ring around the edge. 
S: Pungent and funky. Rather tart green apples. Notes of cider vinegar. 
T: Again, quite tart, but with a light sweetness to it, makes it quite drinkable. Lemon, lemon zest, green apple, cider vinegar. Finishes quick and clean. 
M: Rather acidic, bright, crisp, and sour, but not crazy sour. This one punches you real good at first, but then backs off quickly. 
O: A very good wild ale with a good degree of tartness, but not enough that it becomes undrinkable. Best way I can describe it is as a very "clean-tasting" sour. 687 charactersFlorida9, Oct 11, 2011

.
A- Pours a translucent light gold with a small head that dissipates quickly. 
S- Vinegar, lemon, peppery spice, barnyard funk with tons of hay
T- Wow, this is tart. Like biting into a Granny Smith apple, with lemon zest, peach, barnyard funk, vinegar and oak.
M- Medium carbonation and a lighter body. Has a very dry and tart finish.
O- Haven't had too many Wild Ales, but this was intense with the high level of tartness. I really enjoyed this, but am not sure if I could have more than 4-5oz's. This definitely got me interested in trying more Wilds.
Thanks again Bryan! 675 charactersiadler, Oct 09, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Swimsum brought this over to our place as part of an epic tasting on Saturday. Thanks Brent! Following review based on notes taken at that time.
4oz. sample poured into a snifter.
Appearance: Body is very hazy and goldenrod in color. A fine white film sits on top and retains well. No lacing.
Smell: Slightly under-ripe banana, sweet cream, lemon meringue, and vanilla. Smooth and mellow; doesn't exhibit any sour or vinegary aromas. Odd, but certainly pleasant.
Taste: Sourness is bold, but not palate-wrecking, allowing subtler flavors to shine through quite well. Lemon meringue, banana cream, and citric acid all play large roles. Very balanced and enjoyable. Would give it a 4.75 if I could.
Mouthfeel: Moderately carbonated, medium-to-light in body, and surprisingly easy for a sour.
Overall: Balanced across the board, complex, and just fucking good. I can understand why this is such a highly sought after sour. Thanks again Brent! 945 charactersThreeWiseMen, Sep 30, 2011

Clear, slightly chill-hazed, orange-tinted gold. Small white head. Looks like a classic gueuze, it really does. Minimal lace, but good looking nonetheless.
Fine carbonation that works very well. Little harsh acidic bite to the sourness, but overall this drinks very smoothly and I would happily sip this all day.
The beer is good. I understand why people go crazy for these beers... it really is fucking good.
The nose some citrusy notes-- mainly lemon. A slight oak character comes through. The flavor is tasty-- clean, sour, and overall a fantastic beer. 646 charactersAleWatcher, Aug 28, 2011

This beer is a very pale, hazy straw yellow with a very slight ring of egg shell foam. The beer smells wild and bretty with a little fresh lemon. The beer starts out pleasantly sour and tart with good lemon and green apple flavors, but the finish is pure viengar. The viscous, mouth-coating, saliva-stripping, mouth pucker acidity. It is a combination of astrigent (like biting into underripe apples) and vinegar was very unappealing. This beer is wildly drying for a liquid. This is an okay beer, not the worst sour I've ever had, but it does not live up to the hype at all. I'm glad to have gotten to try it, but it's nothing I would actively seek out again. 754 charactersSoonami, Aug 27, 2011

A -Pale golden color with a wisp of white foam atop.

T- Starts out sour and tart with a distinct lemon presence. Barnyard funk and wet horse blanket follow. The finish is sour with a lingering lemony aftertaste. Exquisite!
M-Thin with a medium level of carbonation.

Pours similar to carbonated apple juice, with not quite the clarity and a nice cap of white head. The nose is lightly sour with lemon rind and cider vinegar. The taste is sweeter than expected - a lemon apple acidity presents in a somewhat reserved way. This beer is shockingly drinkable and not particularly sour (more funky than sour). One of my preferred wilds. The mouthfeel is nice with good, strong carbonation and a heavier than expected body. Overall, this is one of my favorite wilds that I have had from the nebulous AWA style. 566 charactersseeswo, Aug 26, 2011

S. Oaky upfront. With lemon, green apple, some vinegar, notes similiar to 
T. Lots of granny smith, good high level of tartness, some funkiness, lemon peel, a lot more sweetness than expected. Barnyard characteristics are more apparent in the bottom of the bottle.
M. Thin body with high carbonation.
D. Very drinkable. The front is more tart while the tail is funkier. 481 charactersBeerAndBourbon, Aug 26, 2011

Pours a beautiful hazy yellowed orange with a nice touch of white head. Got the dregs sort of of the bottle. Smells tart and sour. Very nicely funky. It's very sour but also very funky. Not like any beer ive ever had. The mouthfeel is nice and well carbonated. The sourness is pretty harsh but enjoyable.

4.85/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5HUGE Thanks to Chad for sharing this beer with me! This has been on my WANTS for a long time. Pours a murky, golden-orange color with a small, white head that disappears quickly. Scent is oh so funky with some sweet fruit notes...peaches. Sour vinegar and lemon come at me as well. Taste is just as I was hoping. Tart fruit (peaches, green apple, lemon) with some vinous characteristics. Tons of sour and funky flavors with a nice oak backbone. Absolutely delicious! Mouthfeel is a puckering, well-carbonated, crisp masterpiece. Drinkability is very high, especially for this Fresno summer heat. Amazing beer... I would definitely need to do a side by side with Cable Car to see which one I enjoy more. 702 charactersDovaliHops, Aug 23, 2011

A- Beautiful straw yellow color with a very light whitish head. It is pretty golden amber and glowing in color, and a little murky. 
S- I get lots of notes of green apple, lemon, and barnyardy funk. It doesn't smell terribly sour, but is certainly funky. 
T- I get lots of grape skins, apple, lemon, and funk. There are notes of acidity and sourness. I get some oaky notes as well, but the whole thing is smooth and tasty. I think green apple sweet tarts was what we thought it taste with, combined with some funky tartness.
M- Perfect blend of carbonation and body. The aftertaste is great, and very pleasant. Crisp and refreshing.
O- Definitely a great beer. Not as sour or funky as I expected, but it is sooo smooth and tasty. This is one of the smoothest sour beers I've had, and is very easy to drink. Can't wait for the next release, as this is a very drinkable sour.

Also, a massive thanks to Patrick (kingkong) for trading one of these to me which will be opened in the near future with family. Cheers to two great BA’s!
Appearance – Pours a hazy, golden color into a Lost Abbey tulip. Slight off white head is achieved with a moderate pour that dissipates relatively fast leaving slight lacing.
Smell – Man oh man. Tons of tart, funk up front. Wet hay/grass, musty barnyard, slight leather. Hints of vinegar, acetone, and lemons. As the beer warms nice oak characteristics emerge as well as sour fruits and granny smith apples. Wonderful.
Taste – My mouth puckers before the beer even touches my lips. Honestly, the taste is pretty spot on with the nose. Wonderful lemon flavor mixed in with the barnyard funk. The oak characteristics shine as the beer warms, as does the slight vinegar and acetone. The fruit flavors are simply fantastic, with the lemon fading to green apple, and peaches. The beer is everything I wanted it to be.
Mouthfeel – Lighter/medium bodied, slight prickly carbonation, finishes damn dry.
Overall – A wonderful beer. Very glad I was able to try this now and have one to open later. Rip on LA or TA as much as you want, but he can make some damn good sours. Simply put, one of the best beers I’ve had. The first beer of the night and the best in my opinion. Fantastic. 1,429 charactersSpdKilz, Aug 03, 2011
3.8/5  rDev -16.3%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Foggy straw-colored pour with minimal white head. Nose is vinegary and acetic, but with a very noticeable maltiness, backed up by some wonderful cheesy funk. Flavor is quite nicely consistent with the nose. Like the nose, there is a light bready sweetness that I was not expecting. Adequate carbonation pulls everything off the palate for a great finish. Wonderful brew, but not quite ’top 5’ sour material. Certainly try it if you can. 440 charactersKrautAficionado, Jul 16, 2011

Big thanks goes out to beermeX2 for sharing this one with the group! A LONG time want of mine and was really glad to see it come out during this tasting! Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured golden yellow with a half finger pure white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, BIG sour, BIG funk, tart, and fruit. The flavor was of sweet malt, BIG sour, BIG tart, funk, and fruit. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall, HOLY DUCK-FACE BATMAN!!! This thing was drop-kick your momma sour! Just the way I like it.... The fruit character in this one tries despirately to subdue the sour/tart aspect going on here, but it never stood a chance. Funk too? Hell yeah... This brew really lived up to my expectations and might have actually exceeded them slightly. Definitely a well done brew that I would love to have more of. Well done Lost Abbey. 1,063 charactersthagr81us, Jun 28, 2011

A - pours a bright yellow. White head, light lacing.
S - Not that strong. I smell some funk with hints of lemon peel and lime. 
T - sweet and dry finish with some good funk and sour uppertone that takes it away and makes you want to have this again and again.
M - perfect. Level of carbonation with bubbly action throughout.
D - Sour, sour, and sour, but not off-putting at all. The lemon notes keep me interested.
O - This is a celebration beer for any good occasion.

3.48/5  rDev -23.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3750ml bottle thanks to one of you. I came into this expecting a gueuze and I will review it as such. Bright orange color with almost no head at all but it is carbonated. Smells sour and a bit cheesy but i would not say funky at all. In fact this does not smell like a true gueuze at all. The taste was way too sweet and then followed by a sourness. The sweetness was almost like a pixie stick or sweet tart and I didn't like that aspect at all.There was some citrus and fruit but to call this a gueuze is just not being honest. As a wild ale this was ok but the price was completely out of line for the beer that is in the bottle. Save your money and get a Cantillon for half the price. 686 charactersArrogantB, Jun 06, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Really amazing beer...without doubt, one of the best, most drinkable and complex sours I’ve tried (and I’ve had my share). Cloudy honey pour with an amazing amount of carbonation for the style producing a 1/4 inch ivory head that diminishes to a ring. Aroma of peaches, balsamic, citrus rind, and grapes. Flavor doesn’t show the typical "barnyard" qualities...instead combining tart, sweet, and fruitiness. Green apple Jolly Ranchers, lemongrass, apricot, and grapefruit...balanced and incredible. 503 charactersBOLTZ7555, May 29, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5750ml bottle / 2009 Vintage
A)- Pours a semi cloudy golden apricot yellow/orange color. Produced a decent white head that dissipated down to foam. Minimal lacing. It really does have a beautiful looking color.
(S)- Dry, yet a wonderful acidic sourness. Gets the back of your palette tingling with lemon tart, white grape, and oak. Im really not getting the funk on this beer but as is true with AWA its a rare thing., but just enough hay and vinegar-like earth to mesh really well together with the sour fruits.
(T)- Very similar to the smell in every way. A really nice dry, acidic lemon tart and white grape sourness. Minimal funk but a sweet oak characteristic that I cannot get over. 
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. It really has a beautifully balanced profile of tart acidic fruits and mellow dry earth. Its so smooth despite its sourness.
(D)- Just an absolute beer. I would have a hard time placing it in a category though. Not a true AWA. Just a wonderfully easy drinking; balanced and dynamic beer. Lost Abbey has been hit or miss for me, but I really think this is hands down their best offering. I'm going to have to get more - one of my favorite beers. Bravo Tomme..

4.57/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Alex and Bryna for opening this up; I mentioned I'd never had it, and next thing you know, I open the fridge and there it is, on deck...
A - It pours a cloudy yellow hue, about the same shade as the bottle's label, and it is capped with a short-lived fizzy white head.
S - The nose is woody-astringent, and replete with tart citric notes, especially white grapefruit rind and lemon/lime zest. The funk is fairly acetic, with white wine vinegar notes.
T - Lemons, lime zest and a strange grassy greeness that reminds me of elderflower lead the way in terms of the flavor profile. Some apple skin and white grape are definitely there, too, as is an astringent oakiness. This brew is definitely way sour and astringent, it has a lot of acidity. It is not like what I expected, though it is quite nice; I guess I was sort of expecting something like IP, Deviation, Bottleworks X, Beatification or FF; it doesn't remind me of any of those.
M - The feel is less than medium-bodied, and is pert and puckering, drying, and then finishes mouth-watering. Enhancing.
O - A very nice brew, I am glad I had it. I would not consider it as good as IP, Deviation, FF or Bottleworks X, to name-drop a few I've had recently, but it is quite nice. 1,247 charactersktrillionaire, May 18, 2011
4.79/5  rDev +5.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Yellow and light orange appearance, broke out at the 5th party. Great aroma, just like Cable Car in my opinion, was super tart, funky, dry with no discernable fruit aroma save lemon, which is probably only an association from the tart/sour aroma.
More of the same in the taste, super dry, super sour and tart. Maybe could see some green apple adding to this one giving it the slightest dallop of sweetness, but contributing far more sour and bitter feel. Tangy, saliva inducing on every sip. And you sip ever so fast, must control self next time and let it warm even further. Wouldn't call it complex, its straightforward and pretty simple in the mouthfeel for what it is. And at $50, it isn't exactly accessible that often (aside from its limited production numbers). Astringent.
A must try for anyone who likes their sours though. But Cantillon Classic Gueze is like $16? And this is $50? Can't say it comes anywhere near being worth it based on that comparison, but should have it at least once in a blue moon (i.e. when you see it). 1,038 charactersBeerandraiderfan, May 18, 2011

A - A nice gold, orange which is darker in the center. Pretty well carbonated with a nice ring of foam and nice clouds in the middle. Lacing is really nice.
S - Really nice citrus funk. Peaches and lemon zest, apples and grape skins. Really Delicious.
T - Just a great tasting sour. Sugar patches kids with more sour. Lemon, lime, grapefruit, sour grapes and lots of sour peaches. Really great flavor and funk and pretty damn sour.
M - Tartness and sour tingle throughout. The carbonation is really nice.
O - Really tart. Pretty much perfect in the taste and smell sector. We had a lot great sours at this tasting and this was my top pick for winner. I really, really need to get a bottle for myself. 835 charactersjoshuaseresse, May 16, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5750 mL bottle shared with beandip and starrdogg.
Pours a hazed golden apricot color with a delicate, wispy white head that quickly fades to a thin ring and little lacing. Almost has a pulpy, resiny texture to the appearance.
Aroma is a rich, sweet blend of lemon, grape skin, vanilla oak, grass, light funk. Sweeter than expected and not as funky, but very well balanced.
Incredibly easy drinking, initially has a mild funkiness that never turns into an oppresive barnyard funk bomb. Lemon and grass sourness appears mid palate before finishing fruity and sweeter with grapes and vanilla oak. 
Lighter side of medium body with soft, fine carbonation. Finish lingers with green apple and lemon.
Well that was nice. 718 charactersyourefragile, May 15, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Review #1400. Bottle purchased through Sinner's Club in 2009. Served in taster pint during the Half Acre/Pipeworks/de Struise brewday.
A - Hazed dark peach/apricot body with a quick-dissolving finger of white foam that settles to a thick ring, leaving a few splotches of lace.
S - Funky fruits, oak, acetic and lactic acidity, lemons. As it warms a touch more stone fruit, vanilla, and graham crackery malt. Too sweet to truly convince as a gueuze, but it's an excellent American Wild Ale nonetheless.
T - Taste is initially sweeter too, but it actually grows more sour as it warms up. Sharp oak mingles with lemony brett, stone fruits and lactic acidity. As the bottle drains and more yeast and sediment is introduced there is a mild yogurt character.
M - Medium bodied, with medium zesty carbonation, and a super dry and puckering finish. No alcohol is present.
D - A really enjoyable and well-crafted wild ale, but not quite as strong as Isabelle or Cable Car '09. Still - highly recommended and well worth seeking out. I understand that Isabelle would be logistically impossible to recreate, and that Cable Car is solely for Toronado, but there's no good reason why Tomme shouldn't be blending up more of this every year. 1,230 charactersMasterSki, May 05, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On our two year anniversary (well technically two days after, I was sick), my girlfriend and I cracked this open with dinner. Poured into two snifter glasses.
A: A very pretty hazy, golden-orange body with a very small and supple white head. The dissipation was rather rapid though a thin ring stuck around throughout the entirety of evening.
S: Loads of barnyard hay are up-front, giving it a very earthy and grassy funk to it. Lemons, apricot and sweet malt vinegar notes come through mid-way. The end scent is a distinct extremely tart/sour candy aroma - pretty overpowering, nice.
T: The tartness of the beer sends your palate into immediate shock, whoa, I wasn't expecting that much! Really, a very sour beer immediately calmed only by some citrusy zest: orange and lemon, again. The finish is a puckering white grapefruit tartness - this beer screams sour through and through. Wow. Kind of sickeningly sour after a while...
M: Light, effervescent to a "t" and extremely crisp.
Well, it was wonderful to finally be able to sample this iconic beer from The Lost Abbey. I tried going into this blinded but after reading some of the other reviews, my experience seemed to differ - smarties candy? No way. Not enough sweetness or fruitiness, which I expected a lot of. This beer is definitely one to try, worth a World Class rating? Ehhh... 1,346 charactersShanePB, May 03, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This beer has a certain sentimental value to me, as my wife would attest to when I proposed. Always loved to bottle, would like to have a poster-sized picture of it. Bottle shared with a few of the Chicago crew and some Jackie O's peeps that were in town.
A - Golden orangish colored beer. A finger and a half of white foam bubbled up, leaving a little bit of lacing on the sides as it dissipated rather quickly.
S - For an American Wild, this is pretty spot on. Great funk, barn, and horse blanket. Smell is slightly vinous, with a bit of green apple. It has a great tartness to it, that balances out the funk with a perfect blend of sweet. 
T - This is one of those beers that is easy to drink and wish I could drink often. Funk is present, but the tartness takes over, and combines with acetic notes to give it a drying and lighter taste which is great. Sour apple is hinted at, with some grapes, a touch of vinegar, and a little bit of oak. Great balance and flavors, about as right as you can get.
M - Healthy carbonation makes it feel lighter than its medium body. Dry finish that doesn't over do it.
O - One of my favorite American Wilds. Really can't get enough of this, and it is quite easy to drink. Alcohol is not detectable, even at a robust 7% for the style. Highly recommended, and I want more. 1,313 charactersAgentZero, Apr 21, 2011

A- Wow really nice! Sour apple all the way. A nice funky twist with some lemon twist. A light hint of Chardonnay barrels. This is just really, really, nice. 
T- I love it! Tart granny smith apples. A bit of oak, white grapes, and chardonnay. The bit of citrus in the nose is also present in the taste, but not as strong. Sour and funky.
M- lighter side of medium in body. Carbonation is high. Finishes dry and tart.
D- I will without a doubt, be seeking out another bottle. 617 charactersbiggied, Apr 12, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Slatetank for sharing this brew with a few of us on 2/13/11. Been wanting to try this one for awhile so thanks again Matt!
From a 750ml corked and caged bottle this brew pours a clear golden yellow color with a pillow of white fizzy head sitting atop. The bubbles are fairly large and the cap is supported by a constant stream of rising carbonation. This is quite an attractive looking offering that displays no haze and spotty lacework clings to the glass.
The smell of this brew is funky suggesting notes of Brett that are introduced in a pleasing way that breaks up a readily apparent indication of fruity lemon zest. The smell of this brew was an exciting surprise of lemon verse the funk I was expecting. There is seemingly no indication of alcohol to be found in this smell. It is well rounded and super enjoyable before I have even taken a sip.
The taste of this brew is quite acidic blended with notes of Brett that impart a lightly cheese-like flavor coupled with an overall funkiness. It is both tart and acidic that give an accent to the light lemon flavor that is included. The Brett is enjoyable, not too subtle that you have to search for it and not overpowering at all. The lemony aspect seemingly clings inside the mouth with nearly an oily lasting power of resines. At times this brew seems to pick up a contrasting sweetness that is revealed as I concentrate more on the lemony flavor. The blend here of flavors is enjoyable and seemingly different with every sip, awesome array of tartness, acidity and funk before the first indications of the bitey alcohol reveals itself once the brew is warm.
This is a medium to light bodied brew with a moderate to high level of carbonation. Very easy drinking and enjoyable with it's tangy acidity and drying quality on the tongue. The alcohol is well integrated into this brew, it just works. Each sip has a big salivation factor to it which urged me to drink more almost carelessly without thinking about the characteristics it was offering. The only thing I can fault this beer for is it's lack of availability. I wish I could drink this on a regular basis. 2,136 charactersstakem, Mar 02, 2011

S - Sour green apples, lemon citrus, orange fruity esters are big. Huge aroma that hangs around.
T - Sharp lemon, grass, vinegar with plenty of those fruity esters found in the aroma. Begins with lots of dry citrus, then is met in the m iddle with sweet apple and finishes dry with some more tart fruit and vinegar. Lovely balance of fruit and sour.
M - Medium bodied with a great carbonation pop which feels very effervescent on the tongue but not overwhelming whatsoever.
D - The hanging citrus & vinegar is going to fade my palate quickly as my throat is already filled with super tart lemony vinegar. 718 charactersdrewba, Mar 02, 2011

4.88/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was looking forward to trying this for a while -thanks to Maltzilla for the trade. Poured cooler than cellar temp from the 750ml into a cervoise.
 The color is clear golden with thick bone white cap with a very tight formation of beading to make up the head - the clarity is good enough to see carbonation rising steadily and the lace sticks to the glass - the head settles to a ring of about 1/4 inch high. The aroma of fruit emanates from the glass with a very vinous odor -white grape and mild honeydew with a slight hint of golden delicious apple brings out the sweet notes from the malt along with the tart qualities of the wild yeast - some mild wood and light sour fragrance comes forward with mild lemony aspect -but a tropical nose emerges and seems to add more floral and light herbal notes to the nose. The feel is great -exeptional and has a moderately strong sour element with assertive but not bitter quality-mildly dry with citrus juiciness and lots of puckering tinges but not over the top or harsh, a very gentle sweetness cushions the tanginess and sour elements well.
 The flavors are citrusy with orange and lemonade puckering taste yet there is a light dry taste w/ mild wood and gentle lactic accents. The taste of the wood gives a dry flavor with light lemony acidity following and subtle oak w/ hints of white grape combine to give a mild astringent edge to the smooth malt and fruit from the yeast- the green grape and hints of bitter citrus blend with the tannic flavor from the wood as it finishes. There is an almost peachy floral and tropical sweetness in the background which is very pleasant and adds to the complexity of the barrel to offset some of the dry elements in the taste. Duck Duck Gooze is as good as I remember from having it at Extreme Beer Fest 2 years ago -it may even be better - the beer has a lot of complexity and wonderful flavors for a 5% wild ale- this was very memorable and well worth the effort to acquire - I wood seek this out again. 1,995 charactersSlatetank, Feb 15, 2011
5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle poured into a tulip. Thanks to Kyle for sharing the wealth! 
(A)- Pours a clear orange/yellow color that produced a white head that dissipated after awhile. (4.0)
(S)- Some great tart fruits and sour; almost lactic background. Lightly earthy of hay, but mostly the sour wine-like fruits dominated the aroma. (4.5)
(T)- Rather sour, but a great sour profile at that. Some light earthy hay from the smell, but again, the lemon and white grape-like fruits take center stage.(5.0)
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. A potent sour/acidic level, but supplemented well by light earth and fruits. It finishes rather clean despite its potency.(4.5)
(D)- This is really a great Wild worth getting your hands on some. Has a great profile and balance with just the right amount of each aspect. Great stuff.(5.0)

**Updated review**
750mL corked and caged bottle poured into a stemmed glass. 2009 Vintage.
(A)- Pours a semi cloudy golden apricot yellow/orange color. Produced a decent white head that dissipated down to foam. Minimal lacing. It really does have a beautiful looking color.
(S)- Dry, yet a wonderful acidic sourness. Great tart lemon rind, white grape, and an almost lime or peach fruits. Not a ton of funk, but just enough hay and vinegar-like earth to mesh really well together with the sour fruits.
(T)- Very similar to the smell in every way. A really nice dry, acidic lemon tart and white grape sourness. Minimal dry earthy hay funk on the finish with even more almost juicy, yet tart lemon and maybe peach on the finish.
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. It really has a beautifully balanced profile of tart acidic fruits and mellow dry earth. Its so smooth despite its sourness.
(D)- Just an absolute wonderful wild ale. It really is even better than what I remember from my first time trying it! With a much larger amount to critique and a more quiet setting to enjoy it in, I felt that this deserves an even better rating than I originally gave it. Just a wonderfully easy drinking; balanced and dynamic beer. Lost Abbey has been hit or miss for me, but I really think this is hands down their best offering. I really do not see how it can get any better than this for the style 2,259 characterssweemzander, Feb 15, 2011

A: Cloudy orange gold hue. Small amount of bright white head. Tiny lace ring. 
S: Wonderful aroma. Citrus, grape skins, light funk, lactic sour, dusty wood, basement. Nothing in your face. Just a perfect balance of sweet and sour.
T: Just like the aroma the flavor is spectacular. Perfect balance of sweet juicy citrus fruits and sour lactic bite. Mild funk that plays off the other components so well. Lemons, white grapes, wet hay, dusty wood, damp basement. So delicious. 
M: Medium body. Very creamy yet carbonated perfect. 
D: Overall a true master piece of a wild ale. Thanks again sweem for the chance to sample a healthy serving of this epic brew. 866 charactersbeerwolf77, Feb 15, 2011

This beer pours a beautiful yellow color and is surprisingly clear, only a very slight haze to it. the head is white and laces the glass. the smell is sour, with hints of fruit like green apple, also detect some oak. the taste is pretty close to the smell, it has that lactic sour, with hints of fruit, a little funk to it. the mouthfeel is on the light to medium side with good carbonation. this beer is sour and very drinkable. 488 charactersrowingbrewer, Feb 13, 2011

Big thanks to "King of Beers" sweemzander for busting this, among quite a few others to come, out for a night of epic proportions!
A - Beautiful lightly hazy goldenrod color with a low but persistent off-white head. Good retention and some patchy lace left over.
S - Sharp, crisp funk all over the place, Brett and barnyard aroma adds some awesome damp hay, horse-blanket, and tartness to the nose. Lemon citrus and bugs make it mouth-puckering before I even taste it. Lots of lactic-ness here.
T - Notes of raw honey and pale malt drizzled with caramel lightly sweeten the huge lactic sour flavor. Massive Brett barnyard funk with a sharp finish. This is wild!
M - Light-bodied and heavily sour with a big funk, Duck Duck has a sharp finish that's nicely carbonated and mouth-puckering.
D - This is hard to not demolish before finishing the review, it's very very easy drinking for as sour as it is. It goes down so well, I'd be willing to wager Sweem regretted sharing it. 1,044 charactersBeerFMAndy, Feb 03, 2011

M - perfect. Level of carbonation is high, and I love that with my sours. The beer flavor lingers.
D - very high. The beer is very sour, but not off-putting at all. The lemon notes keep me interested.
O - another great beer I just had tonight. Well worth it. 574 charactersabecall98, Jan 27, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to Mike for sharing this. No matter how mad you are, you can always keep your beer at my place.
Appearance -- Pours a hazy peach hue with no head to speak of. Great color, though.
Smell -- Bright acetic tartness akin to red wine vingar, Granny Smith, lactic tartness, wet oak, and gentle malt sweetness.
Taste -- Begins with a lack of subtlety: sharp acetic tartness coupled with no small amount of sourness. After a few sips the palate becomes accustomed to the acetic/lacto character and the underlying malt sweetness becomes apparent. Interestingly the brett character is pretty mild: a bit of lemon and faint horsiness, but little else. Wood tannin and and wet lumber flavors have strong footing. A proper lambic-styled American ale
Mouthfeel -- medium-bodied with ample carbonation. Finish is nicely drying.
Drinkability -- Quite good, though more in line with a younger, unblended lambic with the malt sweetness and gentler brett character. This has to be the most labic-like of any American wild I've had to date. That said I wouldn't say that this is any better than Cantillon or Girardin gueuzes, both of which being far more accessible. 1,162 charactersyeahnatenelson, Jan 24, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Shared generously by Chico1985. Notes from Friday. First of three gueuzes on the night.
A- Murky golden-orange that reminds me of a dried apricot or something. A small white head forms for a bit and a ring leaves just a bit of lace.
S- A big bomb of funk and fruit. Funk lends a barnyard and horse pasture type feel. The fruit balances that out with notes of almost anything I can think of, mainly white wine grapes, apples and some vinous hints. Oak rounds it all out.
T- Probably the smoothest flavor in a sour I have experienced thus far. Just like the nose the fruit is huge. Apples, white grapes, slight peach and tons of lemon/citrus sour fruits. Oak works nicely with the funky barnyard wild yeast. A nice level of sour.
MF- Light body with lower end carbonation suiting the flavor. Gets very sour as it warms more but still at a level I enjoy.
DB- A very smooth and balanced flavor compared to most sours I have had before. The microbes in the beer lend so many nice flavors and the brewing skill put into this helps balance it into a great beer. 1,059 characterscbutova, Jan 23, 2011

First beer in a very gueuzy tasting, my guts are hating me right now. I've been very excited to try this, definitely one of my most sought after beers since I began "the hunt." Got this in a trade from nerd, thanks! 
Poured hazy peach color, excellent color. Thin white head eventually turns to a thick ring leaving some lacing.
Great sour scent. Big oak+brett, sour light fruits. Improves as it warms. Slight banana? It's enticing.
Taste has got lemons, peach, citrus, oak, brett, chardonnay, some green apple. Surprisingly not too sour and extremely tasty and drinkable.
Mouthfeel is perfect, I couldn't ask for a better feeling sour. Just feels perfect, flavorful, and balanced.
One of the best and most drinkable sours I've had so far. A great balance of fruit and funk tastes. Let's hope it gets released again! 919 charactersChico1985, Jan 22, 2011

A: Pours a slightly hazy yellow golden with a thin white head that faded to a collar that left a few wisps of lacing down the glass.
S: I mostly get tart lemon zest and citrus but there are some funky notes, brett and peach in the mix.
T: Very funky but the sour/tartness is very well integrated and under control. Notes of lemon and brett, a slight attic must, and a few hints of nail polish acetone. Aftertaste linges for a while.
M: Medium body, clean and refreshing mouthfeel, low but tingly carbonation, and a moderate fruit tartness.

A - This reminds me a lot of Isabelle Proximus..which I had a few minutes before enjoying this one. Clear, light orange, light head, and nice lacing.
S - It's got a lot of IP characteristics, but it's a little less funky. Lemons, zest, spice...there's some more horse blanket (slightly different from funky), and a little less fruit. Maybe pear and citrus on the finish?
T - Lemons and spices seem to come out most as far as discernible flavors aside from funky. More acidic than IP, with light funkiness.
M - Light body, sour taste...light carbonation. Definitely smacking my lips after each sip.
D - Oh yeah, definitely drinkable. I was at the release, and should have bought it instead of the flat Santa's Little Helper and Older Viscosity. But I wasn't into sours then...so what did I know!? 840 charactersKaiser81, Jan 16, 2011

S- Fruity, floral. Not much in the way of 'funk'. Maybe a little brett. 
T- Lemon tartness, a bit of saltiness and a wash of acidity. White wine in parts, green apples.. a bit peppery. Not terribly funky. Dregs blended with the final glass- Substantially more cheesy horse blanket notes.

Pours a hazy yellowish-golden color with a one-finger white head. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving decent lacing.
Smells of large amounts of funk - wet hay and leather - with good amounts of light malts and wheat twang. Also present are moderate amounts of tart light citrus aromas and very faint vanilla from the oak.
Tastes very similar to how it smells. Light malt and wheat twang flavors kick things off and are joined quickly by large amounts of funk. Midway through the sip moderately tart light citrus flavors with hints of lemon pith work their way into things. The funk come backs in full force to carry through to a crisp and mildly tart ending.
Mouthfeel is good. It's got a nice thickness with active carbonation.
Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall this is a phenomenal beer that could be confused with the real thing from Belgium. Well worth a shot if you can get your hands on it. 1,017 charactersglid02, Jan 05, 2011

A-Lightly hazed, brilliant golden yellow with a thin white that held on strong throughout and left fine flecks of lace behind.
S-Musty lemon zest, Granny Smith apple and a strong presence of apple cider vinegar. Becomes more musty as it warms.
T-Amazing similarity to a Sweet-tart candy on the palate. Sweetness up front with a moderating and inviting lemon zest and vinegar tartness in the finish. 
M-Light bodied, sharp and crisp with a very nice drying finish. Long lingering lemon zest flavour and astringency is quite pleasing.
D-Damn nice stuff. Not overly tart, as the initial sweetness balances this, but enough to make itself known. Overall this is very approachable, inviting and solid sour. One I am certainly glad to have had an opportunity to try, 857 charactersDeuane, Dec 26, 2010

From a bottle, thanks to radhoesbro. Pours a faintly hazy apricot with a meager head. Nose is a bit salty, with some very distinguishable round, fruit tones I find in most Lost Abbey sours. Nice, but nothing explosive. Kind of a peachy, apricot aroma. Flavor is initially quite salty, which is my overall complaint with Veritas 004, but it quickly melds into a nice progression into a full peachy note. Quite sour and tart with that integrated, round yeast I find in their light sours time and again. Carbonation is medium and is good for the style. Nice, one of the best from Lost Abbey I've had.
EDIT - This beer is a mess as of April, 2011. I think I was overrating it to begin with. Compared to some better peaches it's completely one-dimensional and has a really flat flavor profile. Acidity has taken over, as it does with most Lost Abbey light sours. 1,001 charactersJAXSON, Nov 05, 2010

Duck Duck Gooze pours a clear, light-orange with a thin white head on top. Good lacing left behind. Looks great for an American Wild.
Lots of sour mustiness on the nose. Hay and acidity with a faint hint of ethanol. Peaches and light fruits. Touch of vinegar and white grape. Strong and enjoyable. One the best wild ale aromas I've had the pleasure of nosing. 
Peach, pear and apple enveloped in a wave of nice sourness on the tongue. A decent vinegar burn lingers on the finish. Very juicy and acidic, mixed with sweet malts. The flavor profile is great. The balance between fruitiness and sourness is very good. I feel like this going to get pretty acidic in another year or so, but at the moment it's like sour liquid candy.
Mouthfeel has a really nice sour kick to it. Smooth long burn on the finish. Perfect carbonation. Very smooth, almost slippery. Well done.
This is a very drinkable wild. The sourness is starting to become more intense, which makes this more of a sipper, but a sipper that is full of complexity and great flavor. This is most definitely one of the best sour beers I have ever had, especially from an American brewery. Really a must for all sour heads. I can't wait for the next release. Great job Lost Abbey. 1,323 characterssisuspeed, Sep 19, 2010

After a long time of not appreciating "sour" beers is was Duck Duck Gooze that caused my epiphany. I fell in love immediately. Later I was able to secure a bottle from Avalon68.. A great trading partner. Thanks!
It's time to enjoy that bottle and post my review.
Pours into my snifter with a small white head that faded almost immediately to a ring of foam around the glass. The beer is a bright brass color with perfect clarity. Some slowly rising bubbles can be seen.
Aroma is certainly tart with green apple and green grape notes. 
Taste is as wonderful as I remember. White wine, tart green grapes, peaches, oak and behind the tartness a bready tone. Later I detected some light lemon as well. While there is certainly a vinegar like tartness the character and complexity make this a special beer.
Delicate mouth feel with the slightest carbonation. Sparkles brightly on the tongue.
Wonderful drinkability and a great bottle to savor for quite a while... 
Great beer. Sadly, I'll probably never taste it again... 1,073 charactersReagan1984, Aug 26, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Second time having it and was more amazed by it this time.... it deserves to be in the top 100 so here it goes, review #2
A: Golden color with a slight orangey tinge... Light layer of slightly tan head with bits of it clinging onto the edge of the glass. (I am color blind as hell so my colors might be off) it still looks great though. 
S: A light sweetness followed to a tart bite that you can feel in the back of your noses.
T: Overly tart apples, with a light sweet funk at the end... Slight traces of lemons/tart citrus through out. I feel the apple shows up more though
M: Lightly carbonated just enough so that you know that it it's there.
D: This is the most drinkable wild ale I have ever had. I split my bomber with a friend and I am kind of sad that I didn't just drink the whole bottle. 803 charactersTodes, Aug 23, 2010
4.6/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 55 oz. pour. HUGE thanks to BMan1113VR for bringing this to my tasting last night. Review from notes.
Murky straw golden color. Finger of fluffy white head that dies down to a layer of foam. No lace.
Smells quite sour. Horse blanket. Sour white grapes.
Tastes of white wine, horse blanket, peaches, apricots, and sour grapes. Refreshing and bright.
Mouthfeel is pretty puckering, light bodied, and light carbonation.
Pretty insanely drinkable. Great to try this one. Would be awesome on a hot summer day. 508 charactersbillshmeinke, Aug 21, 2010
4.03/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks a bunch for opening this Mike. 
Cell phone notes.
Clear golden, off white head, minimal lacing. Acetic, brett, lemon, apple, and oak. Up front acetic bite with a sharp lemon peel, very bright taste. Light body, medium carbonation, slightly tannic, and dry finish. I never had it fresh, but from other reviews it seems the acetic character is starting to take over. IP still wins in complexity, this lacks depth. 419 charactersxpimptastikx, Aug 15, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Infinite thanks to miguelmandingo for busting this out at a recent tasting. 750ml bottle split 4 ways--my serving in a Corsendonk tulip.
DDG pours with a brassy golden hue that shows a nice clarity and depth to its color. A light, eggshell-white head holds court up top, fueled by a steady stream of carbonation rising up from the laser-etched bottom. Aromas of soft hay and grassiness greet the nose, along with some pale malts and light horseblanket funk. Very nicely balanced, with a hint of fruitiness in the background.
The flavor reveals dry grass and white grape rinds. The Gooze is sour, but not crushingly so. Tart acidity on the finish does well to numb the sides of the tongue. Body is on the lighter side of medium, with a crisp carbonation level and drying finish. Drinkable, complex, and very tasty. All in all, a great American-made geuze. Thanks again for the share Mike! 889 characterswagenvolks, Aug 15, 2010

Lemon tart and puckering I wish this were more atainable and made regulary. I can also see why it might not. I was so impressed that I tradeded for a bottle that I have yet to open. I may have to review it in the latter style. 
This is one great brew !! 431 charactersCasey10, Aug 14, 2010
3.28/5  rDev -27.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Had this about a year ago and it has changed a lot. Hazy urine color with lively carbonation. Turbid for the style it's trying to mimic. Aroma is acetone, highly lactic, eggy, sweaty goat fur. I didn't get much brett funk this one just smells sour. Taste has degraded. Eggy, lactic acidity, acetobacter (has a bigger presence). I'm getting a noticeable amount of vinegar that is hurting it's flavor and drinkability. Lemon tartness and high level of sourness is still there. The vanilla sweetness has disappeared or being overpowered by acidity. I felt this used to be a really good beer but seems like it has peaked. I'd love it if an American Wild would have a brett character you didn't have to search through tons of acidity to find. 737 charactersBearsOnAcid, Aug 12, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Aged for at least a year. 
Into a tulip, pours a soapy white head with lots of tingly bubbles snapping and crackling as I agitate. The body takes on a yellow-ish/golden characteristic that is quite illuminating. 
Aromas of apricot, pineapple, and funk, albeit milder on the third trait. Intense, tropical, and very complex. That complexity also reveals a little bit of horseblanket, or perhaps wet duck funk, no? 
Flavors of the aforementioned apricot, with a combined dryness and tartness that gives off a crisp, smooth bite that's quite pleasant. 
Mouthfeel is thin, and lacks that sticky icky on the gums that most Bretty beers exhibit. 
Overall, Duck Duck Gooze has some wonderful balance, and is not as intense as I am sure it was coming out of the gates a year ago. I could drink this for days, pairing it occasionally with some triple cream and perhaps apples and/or apricots. 888 charactersjminsc76, Aug 11, 2010
3.94/5  rDev -13.2%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Enjoyed in a snifter poured from a bottled shared by the great tlay10. Tyler, you are the man. 
Looks: like molten gold. So hazy my fingers on the other side of the glass are mere fuzzy shadows. The pour results in no head; just the lightest mention of off-white fizz along the sides. 
Smells: wooden. Sweeter than most sours that cross my path. Aromas of pronounce oak, alcohol, grapefruit and honey play about my nose, along with floral lilac and a unique earthy, cave musk quality. 
Tastes: Flavors of lemon juice, tart grapefruit, apricot followed by a blast of green oak. As the nose suggested, this beer tends toward the sweeter side of sours. A hard-to-place earthy yeast flavor akin to truffles emerges as the beer warms. The sourness is crisp and doesn't linger about much after the swallow, though a candy sweetness reminding of burnt sugar definitely does. 
Feels: lightly fizzy, with a medium-light body. A slight alcohol warmth travels down the throat. 
Drinks: thanks to an epic beer tasting lineup, I was able to enjoy Duck Duck Gooze directly after Isabelle Proximus. In comparing the two, I'd call this the more "incomplete" beer. It had a more unique flavor bill, but seemed slightly less well-mingled. Another year or two in the cellar may have improved it a bit. 1,287 charactersPhelps, Aug 09, 2010
3.67/5  rDev -19.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3Re-review off a bottle that is about a year old at this point. 
A: A vigorous pour produces a clear coppery-orange body with substantial off-white head. 
S: More citrusy and tart than expected. Lemon up front, but a surprisingly tropical fruit bouquet of pineapple and lychee. Leather, tobacco, salt, and oak. An altogether unique smell, particularly in the salt, which is unmistakable and not something I smell in many other beers. 
T: Initially a balance of sweet and tart, reminding me of a lightly sour lemon candy with hints of pineapple, but it quickly gives in to the tart / sour side and becomes puckering (lactic variety). Small brett funk that produces a melange of leather and tobacco. The finish sees a development of tannins and some slight vinegar. This beer hasn't developed the funk I was hoping it would have after a year of aging; nor has it dried out like I hoped. Still quite good, but sweet for a sour beer. Reminds me of a Sweet Tart effect. 
M: Light-bodied, moderate-high carbonation. Could stand to finish drier. The flavor is robust throughout and it captivates the senses while consuming. 
D: It's solid, but not worth giving up the farm for it. 1,177 charactersArbitrator, Aug 04, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Been looking forward to this one for quite some time. The first beer sampled at our sour tasting. Poured into a large tasting glass approximately a 6oz pour.
A- Pours hazy golden yellow in color. A nice, slightly off white head that recedes ever so slightly. Some light lacing is left on my glass.
A- Wow really nice! Sour apple all the way. A nice funky twist with some lemon twist. A light hint of Chardonnay barrels. This is just really, really, nice. 
T- I love it! Tart granny smith apples. A bit of oak, white grapes, and chardonnay. The bit of citrus in the nose is also present in the taste, but not as strong. Sour and funky.
M- lighter side of medium in body. Carbonation is high. Finishes dry and tart.
D- I could have killed the bottle with great ease. I was sad to see the bottom of my glass. I will without a doubt, be seeking out another bottle. It was my 2nd favorite sour of the night, only Beatification out shined this and that is really splitting hairs. 978 charactersurwithdave, Aug 03, 2010

Super event!
Poured a golden straw in color w/ a 1 finger white head that left a medium amount of lacing on the glass. The nose was of acidic funk, vinegar, and lemon zest. The taste was of acidic funk, mild tartness, a touch of vinegar, and lemon zest. Mouthfeel was thin and clean. The drinkability was ridiculous. Please send me more bottles!

4.77/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I shared a bottle of this with drabmuh and our wives last Sunday.
The label art is fantastic and hilarious. The beer appears mostly clear, with just a slight haze. The color is golden yellow, with a small head and just a touch of lacing. 
The aroma is sour and funky, but not overly so. Straw and hay scents with a slight barn or farmyard presence. Very enticing.
The beer is so easy to drink. I am very impressed. It tastes incredibly smooth and clean, and all of the complexities are balanced very well. Masterfully done. As we delved deeper into the bottle, the beer gets slightly more sour and funky. Hooray dregs. The finish is tart and funky with a hint of vinegar, but no burning acidity.
An awesome beer and well worth tracking down. 745 charactersHuhzubendah, Jul 28, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle shared by the other Matt last night at his place. This was one of my short list beers for a long time. Never successfully traded for it but somehow was still lucky enough to split it with Matt. Thanks, I'll get you back soon.
Beer served in a tulip, of sorts. Beer is yellow and slightly hazy. Forms a thin broken white head of tiny bubbles that slowly pulls to the edge of the glass but does not leave lacing on the sides. Carbonation is moderate to low and made up of small and medium bubbles that slowly expand as they approach the top of the beer. Looks good. The dregs of the bottle darken the beer significantly and make the beer much cloudier. Not shocking there. The dregs do not noticably affect the aroma, mouthfeel, or flavor of the beer. 
Yep, its a sour alright. Aroma is a straight 5 in my opinion. Its really strong. The first whiff I took was a little solventy. Reminded me of isopropanol and toluene. I was crest fallen but kept smelling. The solvency gave way to a strong oakiness, bitterness and lactic / acetic mixture of acids. Mild citric bite to the end. Very pungent, very strong. Very complex.
The lead off flavor is a strong lactic and acidic sourness. No sweetness at all. I was expecting some funk to come along but instead there is almost a collapse of the palate close to the back. No tartness in the corners of the mouth you might expect with other, usually fruit, flavored lambics. The body of the beer is pretty thin, minimal carbonation in the mouth but its there. If you hold the beer there for a moment it begins to burn around the gums and behind the lips. The beer is very sour and minimally bitter. Finishes cleanly, probably due to the lack of back palate tart and funk. A great beer overall and a great sour. Thanks again Matt. 1,778 charactersdrabmuh, Jul 26, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I have been waiting for quite some time to crack this bottle, and last night at our tasting it finally came out. 750 ml bottle, poured into a tasting glass.
A: Hazy straw yellow color. The pour dropped an impressive, fizzy head that left some nice lace.
A: Notes of sour and tart green apples, chardonay, lemon, grass, and light bread. Not overly funky in the nose, but you can tell this one will be acidic. Light notes of brett.
T: More green apples, lemon rind, grass, white wine, and of course the sour funk. It finishes rather dry and, as expected, very tart.
M: Light to medium body, heavy carbonation. Tingely and somewhat sharp.
D and overall impression: Drinkability with many sours is a little lower for me, but with this one, I would not have a problem finishing the bottle. Overall, this was my favorite of a night in which 8 of the top 10 sours were consumed. I only wish I had another bottle. Fantastic! Skal. 927 charactersGtreid, Jul 25, 2010

4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy golden straw color with active white prickly and sprity head, minimal lacing. Scent is musty and sour, finally mellowing into a slight citrus and biscut note, mild vanilla and oak. First sip is tart, funky and acidic but soon rushed into a very fruity blend... mango, apprico, lemon, pineapple... lots of stuff going on there. Slight biscuty sweetness and hints of the vanilla and oak also present. Medium bodied, active carbonation, dry. A pleasure to sip and could see this improving over a long length of time. 526 charactersrfgetz, Jun 10, 2010

Coming at me with a hazy yellowish blond look with hints of orange poking around in there. Looks a bit lighter than medium in build and there is no head at all from the tap, no lacing. Smells include big musk of barn with horse and hay. A big basket of lemons and assorted fruits. Oak, wood and some musty aroma with a dousing of brett, maybe lacto? Smells like it's going to be sour. And it is, a nice sour gueuze. I had this out of the bottle young and can tell it's only growing in funk. Taste is tart lemon drops with apricot and small pineapple blast. Warming brings a bit of apple to the stage. In the middle a earthy taste with oak tannins but not any vanilla which is ok by me. The sourness is pleasant and a bit acidic, but not quite there yet. There is actually a nice faint sweetness going along with the sour in that order. Puckering, yes, overly puckering, no. Quite balanced. Medium bodied and nicely carbed. Crisp and semi dry I 'll take another please. Id like to see where this goes in a year or two but the chances of getting another bottle are slim. Another winner. 1,176 charactersBARFLYB, Jun 10, 2010

S: barnyard funk with sour earthiness. sharp and scrumptious. 
T: sour, funky, and complex. Its dry but very sour but that sourness if balanced out by the funky barnyard bretty taste. 
M: very smooth and rich. sharp and biting at the same time. as with every other aspect of the beer a great balance. 
D: way to easy to drink for being a sharp long aged sour. the complexity and balance allows it to be very easy to drink.
This is probably one of my favorite sours ever. Incredibly easy to drink and yet still incredibly sour and complex. An absolute pleasure to drink and makes me want to find a way to get a case of DDG. 731 characterspsiweaver, May 27, 2010

S: huge citric lemon aroma with hints of oaky barrel funk, viinegar, and apples as well.
T: beautiful puckering sour lemon flavor that is pretty intense with oaky apple notes that make the beer quite acidic.

4.32/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bought this for myself as a present for finishing 2L. Been eyeing this one at the Goat for awhile. 
Appearance- First pour is a beautiful clear golden color. Half inch of sparkling white head disappears in a moment. Second pour is much cloudier. I guess there was a lot of sediment left in there. 
Smell- Some funkiness. A real dank sweat sock quality. Grapes and white wine. Apple, like barrel of fermenting, rotting apples. Vinous. Downright pungent towards the bottom of the second pour.
Taste- Wow. Delicious. Sour and more sour. Vinous. Just a ton of vinegar. As it warms it literally crawls up the tongue. Seriously, it's like light apple cider vinegar. Wow. Just a hint of grain in the finish. It's delicious, in case I wasn't clear. It's got a really nice young white wine quality. Dries out the mouth, just saliva-inducing.
Mouth- I want this to have a little more bubbly. It's fine for the style, but I'd like a touch more carbonation, especially since it's so dry. The acid tingles nicely.
Drinkability- Want more. More. As it warms, and as the dryness catches up, I also want a giant glass of water. Somewhat glad I split the bottle, somewhat wanted it all for myself.
A really delicious beer. I'm as harsh as anyone on LA, but this beer is fantastic. Wish I had more of it. 1,292 characterscallmescraps, May 12, 2010

S - Brett funk, some sour apples / lemon. Musty aroma comes out more as it warms up.
T - Lemon/lime sugary sweetness/sourness dominate the palate. This is complemented by a complex woody/oak backbone.
M - Moderate carbonation, huge mouth watering astringency. Leaves the mouthwatering well after the beer is gone.
D - Like most sours, this one is a very difficult beer to consider "sessionable." I love sours, but my palate always feels destroyed after finishing a bottle. Still, I cannot put this one down. 635 charactersmuttyd, May 07, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A= been waitin for a good time to open this one. This one pours a nice slightly hazy amberish yellow color with a very thin head on it that falls to a thin ring around the side of the glass leacing little to no lacing.
S= The smell is sour apples, lemons, vinegar, funky cheesy brett, a little oak. Really a lot of smell going on here. You could easily pick out a few more odors coming out. The smells meld together in a way I can only describe as interesting.
T= The taste of this one is simply divine! Wow not expecting so much greatness from the odor. There is a dominate sour lemon taste to it that really only creeps across your tongue. There is a lot of oak coming through for a sour. Usually a sour beer is only grazed by the oak taste this has a lot of oak deep inside of it. All the flavors seem like they just touch your tongue for a moment so you really have to concentrate to pick them out. There is a lot of green apple taste to it as well as some really really sour lemons or limes. The taste isn't longest lasting taste I've ever had which I find interesting due to the intensity of the flavor.
M= Low carbonation and super dry finish.
D= This beer is amazing. I'm glad I had the chance to try it and I hope I will be able to get my hands on it again in the future. A superb drink that I was able to share with my girlfriend after we have both worked looong hour for many days making the setting perfect for a nice sipper to be savored. This beer is something that keeps you coming back for more and more sips. Great job Lost Abbey I look forward to more releases. 1,583 charactersjjanega08, May 03, 2010

Pours a clear golden color with a bubbly white head. As soon as the yeast gets kicked up, the pours become hazy.
Sour without being vinegary, acidic and fruity. Light funk...just amazing...
The taste is mindblowing. Again, it's sour without being vinegary, fruity and citric, very acidic and mouthpuckering. Light funk. Lemons and tart green apples.
Mouthfeel is light with a sharp acidity. Fine carbonation. Excellent all the way around. Drinkability is perfect.
This might be better than Isabelle, but I'd have to do a side by side to be sure. I really can't think of anything to make this better, but I can't rate it perfect so I suppose it could look a little better (better head, more lacing, etc). This might be the closest to perfect that I ever have in a beer.
Mouthfeel is nice and dry and good carb.
Overall an amazing beer. Can't wait till it comes out again. 996 charactersMistofminn, Apr 27, 2010

4.47/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5750mL bottle poured into a tulip.
Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a surprisingly small bubbly white head that dissipates quickly to a small collar fed by stray bubbles floating up from the bottom.
The aroma starts with a light lemony tartness but that is overshadowed by the funk from the brett, which manifests itself in the nose as wet hay and old leather. There is also some tart green apples and apricots coming out as it warms which tones down the funk.
The taste just completely puckers my mouth on the first sip, massive fruity tartness coupled with barnyard funk. There are some candied pears and bread and dough in the background but the finish brings back the tartness and some dry oaky tannins.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied and moderately carbonated with an overall sour tartness from start to finish.
This is another excellent sour from LA and one that surely stacks up against some of the best out there, American or Belgian. Super drinkable, plenty of fruit but with a tag-team combo of funk and lactic/acetic sourness that really comes together well. 1,081 charactersgford217, Apr 18, 2010
4.63/5  rDev +2%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5From a 750 mL at the brewery. Plenty of "ooohs" and "aaaahs" as we took it back to our table.
A: Beautiful, faintly hazy, luminescent gold color. Thin film of sudsy white head, which is stirred up nicely by a swirl. 
S: Lightly funky, but tart citrus, grain, and lactic notes dominate. Appetizing.
T: Balanced citrus, tart apple, and honeyed peach flavors. Just a touch of barnyardy notes... certainly much less than in some European examples I've had. This will appeal to more palates than Oude Geueze, for example; it is very, very easy to like. One person said it was like champagne (?).
M: Cuts well, but very balanced and smooth-textured.
D: Tops. I could drink this ALL FREAKIN' DAY.
So glad I got to try this. Absolutely wonderful. 744 charactersnectar14, Apr 11, 2010

A-Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with a quickly dissipating head.
S-Huge sour aroma with a fair dose of funk. Some lemons, peaches, maybe apricots. The acidic sourness really just dominates (in a good way.) Leaves solid lacing.
T-Really nice flavor on this one. Not as sour as it smells, but definitely still a big sour kick. Really complex and interesting sour. Slightly sweet peach flavor (remarkably similar to Flaming Fury even though there are no peaches in this one.) There is a lot going on underneath the sour.
MF-Slightly under-carbonated for my liking and a little syrupy in the back of the throat, but nothing detrimental. 
D-Definitely my favorite style of gueuze, what I think of as a "clean sour" (other beers on this level that fit in this made up character of mine: Isabelle Proximus, Flaming Fury, etc.) 908 charactersmbudner, Apr 11, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Received this brew from 0110x011 when it was released. I've been saving this for some reason and review #700 seems like a good enough reason. Drank from my The Lost Abbey goblet.
Review #700
Appearance- Pours a crystal clear yellow with tinges of orange with a nice half finger fizzy white head. No cap remains but a thin collar hangs the entire beer along with a crystal clear glass that contains zero lacing.
Smell- Perhaps one of the fruitiest Wild Ales I've smelled that doesn't actually contain fruit. Whiffs of pineapple and kiwi come to mind upon my initial inhale. It's nicely tart smelling with plenty of green apple and apple cider vinegar. My mouth is salivating already at the sour goodness that's about to hit it. A bit of oak is easily noticeable as is a touch of vanilla amongst everything. Not necessarily the dankest sour I've smelled but there is a bit of horsey aspect.
Taste- Starts with a nice sour bite that is definitely bracing and nice. Again, really fruity at times with a peach and green apple thing that's really nice. Once my mouth acclimates is when I really start to love this stuff. The vinegar aspect is strong and something about it reminds me of some sort of cherry thing. Obviously very acidic and even a light malty toast comes into play. The oak is strong in this one as is the vanillin. Nothing funky in the brew to me at all. It's even ever so slightly sweet toward the finish but the sour lingers on and on.
Mouthfeel- Nice hefty body, especially for the style. The carbonation is fairly aggressive and spot on and a nice quenching finish is bomb.com.
Drinkability- I knew this was going to be good. It's been a fairly obvious consensus on BA for quite some time and I wasn't let down in the least. Supremely drinkable and mega enjoyable, wish I had another bottle to lay down for awhile. Thanks much Matt! 1,849 charactersyounger35, Apr 10, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Dyan for sharing this one. This one is number 25 in the tasting. Number 16 of day 2. Tried as part of a side-by-side with Isabelle Proximus.
Lightly colored, like a golden hazy straw color. This is missing some of the bubbles and champagne-like nucleation that I really enjoy in my wilds.
The nose is packed with yeasty sourness and funk. Lots of Belgian cheese and a lemony citric acid aroma. A white pepper spice is in there as well, backed nicely by a touch of cloves that serve to augment rather than steal the spotlight from the pepper. The palate brings long a yeasty sourness and funk as opposed to the bacterial sourness of a true geuze. Lemongrass, hay, citric acid, and that cheesy funk pack the flavor. There is a fleeting sweetness that seems to threaten at reigning in the sourness, but then thinks better of it.
Very acidic and mouth puckering, the sourness makes my tongue recoil initially. Very light and enjoyable with that nice spritzy feel that wilds provide so readily. I will need to cleanse my palate with some Pecorino Toscano before moving on. 1,080 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Apr 08, 2010
3.56/5  rDev -21.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I shared a bottle at the epic tasting this past weekend.
The pour is hazy yellow with a thin white head with great retention and lacing. The nose is outstanding with a big, cheesy funk, citrus sourness and grassy hay. Floral with a touch of honey (minus the sweetness), I get a little lemongrass too. With white pepper and a little clove, this is a great smelling beer.
The palate is intense. Massively sour with plenty of lemongrass, orange juice, grass, hay and quite a bit of cheese, this beer is moderately musty. Mild pepper and clove mid-palate, the mild sweetness in the mid-palate (that I recall even the draft version having) is present. Finishing long and fantastic with an intense citrus sourness and a moderately grassy character, this is an enjoyable, drinkable take on one of my favorite styles.
Original scores: 4.5/4.5/4/4.5/4.5
**Edit 16 Sept 2011**
I shared a bottle the other night. This is just not very good,. Overly acetic with the signature Lost Abbey fruity vinegar, with champagne vinegar, this is one note, has no funk and has a moderate acetone character, despite being cellared correctly. Disappointing (for the hype), I'm updating my scores to reflect this.
**Edit 01 July 2012**
I shared this at the mega Lost Abbey tasting. It appears that there's a ton of bottle variation here. The nose is fatty, rancid,moderately funky and again, not acetic. Sweeter, more lactic sourness with a touch of acetic. Sourness is intense, but there's also some fruity flavors with kiwi and unripe peaches. Solid, enjoyable.

Duck Duck Gooze by Lost Abbey is an American Wild Ale, 7% and hard to get a hold of since they brew it in very small quantities. It's a blend of their young and old barrel aged beers. It poured a hazy straw yellow with a hint of white head and lacing. It smelled of tart citrus, sour green apples, oak, and some leather notes. It tasted sharp and tart at first with some lemon peel and wood. Then it finished a bit sour and dry but very well balanced. 500 charactersfemALEist, Mar 25, 2010

4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to jammalamma for sharing this bottle, poured into a mini goblet. The beer pours a golden dark yellow color with a thin white cap that quickly fades to a tight ring around the top of the glass, leaving almost no lacing.
The smell is funky. Hay, cheese, musty old oak barrel and zesty lemon sour are the headliners on this one. There is a brief cameo by some sweet fruits (maybe melon or that one sweet bite of green apple) before it returns to lemon juice and sourness.
The taste is just like the smell. Lemon zest, funky oak and hay, green apples, just SOUR. This beer finishes even more sour than it starts, and just brings funk and sour from the first smell to the last taste, really impressively consistent in that regard.
The beer is light bodied, well carbonated, very tart and crisp and has a great dry finish. The alcohol is never present, the sour notes take it to the limit on this one and come to a point where they are almost too harsh, but they never get there. This is a very good wild ale, something I can't wait to revisit. 1,049 charactersrpstevens, Mar 15, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks jmu500...I owe you one! Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle into a small brandy snifter. Pours a slightly hazy(when yeast and setiment is swirled and poured in) pale shade of gold/yellow. Very small white head that dissapates almost imediately. In this glass, there isn't much lacing, just random thin and fizzy bubbles that slid quickly.
What a great aroma! Lots of brett characteristics, funky sourness...oak, and a lemon crispness. No booze to speak of in the nose.
Tastes just like it smells! Tart up front, oak and lemon...like lemon juice. The second wave is slightly sweet, but finishes quickly with a nice dry sourness that leaves a great tart long lasting aftertaste. Wow what a great beer! Light body, mid to high carbonation...but perfect! 767 charactersShadesOfGray, Mar 08, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Reviewed from notes taken at Greg's epic tasting. 3oz pour. 
A - Hazy, milky gold with a bit of a white (not off white) head that recedes quickly. 
S - Sharply but cleanly sour, lots of citrus, melons (grapefruit), and green apple skins. 
T - this is the best, most robust wild I've ever had, period. Most fall into the trap of being very one-dimensional, but not this beauty. MOUNTAINS of green apple skins, tons of sour and barnyard funk, with a slight acidic bite. Not too vinegary. 
M - a tad thin, but spot on nonetheless. 
D - I could, and would, drink this all day everyday. 586 charactersNYCWheatFanSC, Mar 05, 2010

4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A snow day treat!
A: Golden with a slight orange tint to it and with only a minimal amount of cloudiness present. It pours a decent amount of carbonation that is champagne like but still leaves a nice ring which hangs around the edge of the glass
S: Nice lemon, grape and pear tartness to start with maybe a hint of sour green apple. Light funkiness and a nice oaky and earthy essence.
T: The tart fruitiness is certainly the starting point but lends very nicely with a subtle sweet oak wood note and vanilla. There is a nice earthy feel that provides a pleasant mustinss. The tart fruitiness reminds me of sweet lemonade mix with pears and sour green apple. This one was really well done
M: A slightly prickly feel and a mild booziness the body is very light and there is no vinegar taste to it
D: This is a great sour that i would love to drink on a regular basis. It is loaded with complexities and quenches my thirst at the same time 942 charactersmikey711, Feb 25, 2010
4.65/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5In my study of the American Wild Ale I had read about the elusive Duck Duck Gooze. So wasn't I happy when on a trip down to The Lost Abbey on Sunday that they had, what I now affectionately call Duck Duck, available. From notes on 2/21/2010.
A: Pours a golden orange with a white head that quickly dissipates.
S: A crisp sourness that imparts a citrus smell of lemon and orange.
T: The taste follows the smell. Was anticipating a more intense sour but found it to be a rather smooth tartness. Very citrusy.
M: Drinking enough of this makes the teeth feel stripped and the tongue rough but it's so good I just don't care.
D: Definitely a sipping beer due to the sour. While it does leave the palate feeling "stripped" I could literally drink this all day. This one gets an overall "major noms" from me. 806 charactersirishgurl4, Feb 24, 2010

A: Golden yellow in color. Small head with minimal lacing. Millions of bubbles in glass. 
S: Sweet, funky, and fruity. I'm getting some green grapes possibly vinous and earthy must. I want to keep smelling this beer as much as I want to drink it and every drink gets a quick whiff from me. 
T: Light and tart. Sour with some funk but not overly done on either. They seem to balance each other out and play nicely. Once again I get the green grape taste coupled with a light fruitiness. My friend comments that it tastes somewhat like green apples, somewhat like wine. 
M: Nicely carbed and actually fun to drink. I think this beer is right on the money. 
D: I &lt;3 this beer. It is that good. I was not sure if I would get to try it and I'm certainly glad I did. This will hopefully not be my last time with this beer. Will seek out a trade for more. 996 charactersBTPete, Feb 23, 2010

Pours a light golden orange with a finger of head. I can smell funkiness as I pour, but when I put my nose up to the glass it isn't as over the top as I was expecting. A nice tart orange aroma, cobwebs, lemon, grass, grains, 
The taste is refreshingly tart, just enough pucker to satisfy my sour craving but tame enough to prevent myself from swallowing my cheeks. A nice orange peel flavor dominates, with some lemon juice accentuating the citrus aspect. The funk is mostly cobwebs/dust/dirt, and it is balanced extremely well providing an brew that is hugely flavorful yet not overwhelming. This is just fantastic really.
The body is medium and there is a bit of carbonation sting, but overall it is pretty much what I expect out of the style. Overall, this is a great representative of the style and one that is easy to enjoy and also provides enough complexity for deeper examination. 1,046 charactersalcstradamus, Feb 16, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Bottle generously shared by ThirstyBird earlier in January.
Pour is bright straw yellow with a thin, fluffy head. Nose is puckeringly sour, lots of citric and lactic notes, good earthiness, a touch of cereal/grain. Taste is a fruit explosion -- pineapple dominates, peach/apricot and citrus follow, much less funk in the taste than the smell would indicate. Mouthfeel is classic gueuze, good body and spot-on carbonation. Will probably age very well.
Incredibly impressive for any American brewery to construct a gueuze like this. Never bet against Lost Abbey sours. 568 charactersjedwards, Feb 16, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Floydster for this corked and caged 750 mL bottle. Shared with ksak and frederickTbunky.
A: The wild ale is a golden peach color, hazy even before that last pour. Said last pour added a turbid layer of yeast into the equation. The head never amounted to much more than a thin band.
S: The nose is very acidic, sharp and sour. Lemon and citrus aromas are strong, as are the horseblanket scents. The ale has a lactic dryness that is evident even here.
T: I was rather surprised that the first sip wasn't nearly as sour as the nose led me to believe. Rather, sweeter fruits lead off. Peach and apricot, in particular, set the stage for a mild citric sourness that takes over the last half of each sip. The ale's carbonation, paired with the sourness, is very prickly and hot on the tongue. The lactic aromas in the nose are out in full force, leaving my mouth very dry.
M: The mouthfeel runs from fruity sweet to sour to very dry in just a few seconds. The complexity kept me coming back for more and the prickly carbonation was intriguing.
D: More, please. A serious wild ale that really nails it. 1,110 charactersakorsak, Feb 14, 2010

Opens with a nice pop to it. Poured into stone old guardian snifter.
Pours hardly and head. Color is a nice hazed sunset hued orange straw color. Some sediment in the glass.
Aroma: Lots of horse blanket and funk. A nice amount of fruit: peaches, muskmelon, grapes, and cherries. Very nice aroma. Some oak and citric acid as well.
Taste: A lot like the aroma. Nice and funky. Horse blanket with lots of fruit: peaches, apricots, grapes, and cherries. It starts out sour and tart, but then ends a lot sweeter and clean. The oak and citric acid shows in a good way again.
Mouthfeel: Sour and tart. Lighter to medium bodied with a lower amount of carbonation, but nice for the style. Ends sweet and clean.
Overall, this is one fine beer. Very drinkable. I slowly savored this one to try and make it last longer. Very good. I really enjoyed how it started sour and ended sweet. Glad I got to try this one. Thanks Daniel!

4.59/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Many thanks to Greg for opening a bottle of this at his tasting! From notes on 1/16. 
Pours a kind of hazy yellowish peach color with a good amount of wispy white foam. Leaves some abstract lacing. 
Very complex nose. Lots going on here varying from musty bales of hay and leathery notes down low to brighter fruity flavors of tart citrus and granny smith apples on the surface. Some more rich funkiness is evident as it warms and presents itself in a dirty gym sock kind of way. A bit of damp wood, moderate acidity prefacing what's to come. 
Initial sharp tartness leads to a good bretty funk mid palate. Some sweet fruitiness is evident which helps ease the acidity, though not by much at all. Lemon zest and a little buttery wood. Like if you toasted a piece of oak as if it were bread, then spread a light layer of butter on it. Anyway, it ends pretty dry. 
A very nice level of carbonation makes this brew even more pleasing to the palate and begs for another sip. I would drink a bottle of this every week or so if I had a couple people around to share a bottle. DDG is by no means an introductory sour, but the flavor really isn't too intense. I was digging the aroma much more. Having said that, this beer is pretty...pretty....pretty good. I look forward to seeing how it develops with a little time. 1,314 charactersIneedabeerhere, Jan 21, 2010

A: Pours no head, no lacing... I think there might be something wrong with my glassware? Beer is a cloudy lemon color. 
S: Woody, skunky, barnyard, band-aid, sour fresh apples, lemon, vinegar. Very appropriate.
T: Opens intensely tart and it shocks my palate the first time around. Promising. A second sip tempers the sourness and reveals a slightly sweet middle. Lemon and granny smith apples. Finish is a bit sour but very balanced. 
M: Light bodied, coarse, carbonated though you wouldn't think so from the appearance. Very dry with a slightly sour finish. 
D: I think this has gotta be the poster child of sours... It doesn't do anything outrageous but it doesn't fail at doing anything either. Very balanced, appropriate smell, taste, and feel. I'd no doubt have this one again but it didn't blow me away like some other sours I've come across. 990 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jan 17, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle courtesy of Bankhead at the Charlottesville tasting--thanks so much! Delicious!
A: Very bubbly with about half a finger of head that disappears almost instantly into very large bubbles. Light peach and tangerine in the color. Looks like a very dark, yellowish white wine. Almost no lacing, even with agitation, but sill very pretty, especially the hazy white residue across the top of the beer.
S: As could probably be predicted with ease, very very sour. Slight hint of syrupy candy--perhaps bubblegum? A bit of white grapes, light orange, and white vinegar. There's also a nice barnyard funk with pretty dominant notes of hay and horse hair, saddle leather, as well as sweet grass.
T: Very sour and acidic taste approximating sour powder, yet tempered by other elements of the taste. A ton of white vinegar and white grapes here--which I absolutely love--as well as a heavy grapefruit taste. There's a slight funk to the taste, also, which is expressed as slight hay and grass as well as a sort of earthy or maybe a bitter herb or oak, as well as a little bit of a leathery taste.
M: a little sparkly and very fine, tiny bubbles form a crisp, refreshing, sour brew. Very fine bubbles--I almost want them to be a little bigger, though not by much. It's still very good, but I'm not sure I could put it up to a 4.5 or 5. Almost no aftertaste whatsoever. 
D: highly drinkable. Mmmm. I have a feeling that if I weren't trying to get a review out of the tasting amount, this one would be gone pretty quickly (though the sour does naturally slow you down slightly). 1,573 charactersafausser, Jan 14, 2010
4.45/5  rDev -2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Duck Duck Gooze, courtesy of Bankhead at the January C'ville tasting. A huge thanks for this huge want! Served in a cervoise.
Appearance: A bright, sunrise on a crystal clear day-hued brew, pregnant with well-dispersed, relatively large-bubbled carbonation that - surprisingly enough - rises to the surface fairly slowly, suggesting a thick body. The head is pure, snowy, and white, and has excellent retention, taking a good 5 minutes and a few swirls to fade any appreciable amount, ultimately leaving a good amount of dusting and a thick but flat, uniformly dense collar. The lacing is similarly impressive, leaving huge eruptions and fingers that themselves have admirable retention.
Aroma: Relatively clean, with all the constituent parts you'd hope and expect. A sweet golden malt note provides a solid underpinning for a large amount of white acetic sourness - bold, smooth, unforgiving, but not too overpowering - and some pleasant fruit notes, peach, lemons, faint lime. The funk is well-integrated, sort of playing second-fiddle, providing a few spicy notes, as well as faint bandaid and horseblanket. So, sure it's mostly tart notes, but the tart isn't so selfish as to not let anything else shine through.
Taste: Amazing. A dry, quenchingly smooth acidic quality that's far stronger than its aromatic remnant and that permeates most parts of the mouth is the cornerstone of the mouth on this one. It's puckering, perhaps not overwhelmingly so, but it comes close. Also, surprisingly, it doesn't overwhelm the base beer, which perhaps suggests how flavorful this one is - pale malts, moderately well-attenuated and that become sweeter as this one warms, as well as peaches, lemons, slight bananas. And it just gets better as it warms, really, with all the elements marrying and intermingling and playing off of the strengths of one another beautifully. If the sourness was toned down one notch and one notch only - and I know many will disagree with me, but this is simply my palette's opinion at this point in my exposure to sours - it would be a 5.0.
Mouthfeel: A body of average thickness, perhaps a little thicker than I would expect, with a ton of spicy, crisp, bright carbonation, complimenting the spicy, crisp, bright flavor profile.
Drinkability: Fantastic. I kept cleaning my palette and going back for it fresh 'cause that first kick is just amazing. But the followup - that is, once your palette acclimates - reveals whole new flourishes and subtleties and is worth the price of admission alone. And though that price is steep - $30, contributed by the ever-generous Bankhead - this one is a true treat, and I'd be happy to pay that amount for this one again if that were an option. Envy for the west coast BAs abounds!! 2,748 charactersCrellMoset, Jan 11, 2010

Poured a hazy orange-gold with a loose, quarter inch white head that quickly dissipated. Lots of effervescing activity on this one as evidenced by clusters of tiny bubbles adhering to the sides of the glass below the cap; no lacing. Nose is slightly tart and sour with tropical fruits coming out (pineapple, star fruit, etc.)? Taste follows nose - slightly acidic and dry, tart light fruit and a hint of cork. Mouthfeel was very lively and consistent throughout. Finishes dry with some astringency around the salivary glands. This was extremely delicious and even quite refreshing and palette cleansing, even with the incredible fruit profile. This is sour, but not puckeringly so - one of the most memorable beers I've yet to experience. I know it's classified as an American Wild, but definitely some gueze like qualities (I guess hence the name). 932 charactersJwale73, Jan 10, 2010
4.25/5  rDev -6.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Presented by Bankhead.. a nice surprise from California! Thanks, Henry!
A: Blonde + nicely retained white head. Fizzly and bubbly, with a great sheet over the entire brew.
S: A nice acidity, both full of that whole 'sour apple' aroma and a nice note of hay and that whole 'funkiness' scent to be expected from such styles. 
T: Sours can be a very challenging style, and this one does a very nice job of bridging the gap between that separate the palates for such a style. There are some pineapple flavours in there as well, though it adds a beautiful note to it rather than a 'tinny' type of pineapple-ring type flavour. 
M + D: This was one of two sours had in the evening, and it brought out the dryness that the other did not. It almost lifts off the tongue... love it! This one steps it up a notch as far as geuze goes, with a little higher alcohol than many. Nonetheless, it's a fabulous sipping sour. 910 charactersProteus93, Jan 10, 2010

Appearance: Pours a cloudy golden orange with a 1 finger bright white crown, some retention, and lace. 
Smell: Nice amount of lemons along with some honey, bubblegum, lightly toasted barrel, and a hint of alcohol. Different and delicious but not exceptional. 
Taste: Oh wow this one is nice and puckering. Good amount of tartness / sourness, lemon juice, green grapes, apples, and a small bit of funk in the finish.
Mouthfeel: Fairly light body with decent amount of carbonation. Nothing offensive about the mouthfeel, but nothing extraordinary either. I think it needs a bit more carbonation.
Drinkability: Very sour but a nice flavor profile and good mouthfeel. I got through the 750ml myself and wanted more. 767 characterskoopa, Jan 07, 2010

A- Pours a hazy deep golden straw color. Nice one finger white head that stays for a short while. Light lacing the entire time with this beer. 
S- This is a interesting beer to say the least. It's funky but not overly so. Nice winelike vinegar notes come and gone in the nose with this that battle with a citrusy (lemon) overtone the entire nose. There is a light oak smell in this that mingles well with a musty presence. Not overly funky but still good nevertheless.
T- This is where the beer really shines I think. The acidic quality to this is what I think when I try sours. Very nice citrus upfront to this with lemons coming to mind right off the bat. There is a very wine vinegar like undertone in the back end that makes me pucker. Nice oak flavor in the middle of this as well. Everything compliments each other well in this. 
M- Lighter mouthfeel. Carbonation is good with the style. Lost Abbey always has good carbonation with everything I have had from them. Citrus tones and vinegar notes stay on the palate and in the aftertaste. Drying finish with this beer. 
D- Very nice drinkability to this one. I was very impressed with this beer. Strike another one up for Lost Abbey. If you get a chance to try this I would not pass it up! 1,332 charactersalleykatking, Jan 04, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Big nice off-white head. Beer itself is a sun-golden-yellow with a bit of haze.
Smell: Lots of lemon and vinegar, reminds me of New Belgium's Bottleworks X. Also tropical fruit like pineapple and star fruit, along with some musty funk and leather, more brett than typical for lost abbey.
Taste: More sour than usual for Lost Abbey. Lemon, vinegar, tropical fruits (pineapple, etc), bret, funk, wee bit of leather, and french oak. Perhaps some honey. A bit lacking in complexity as compared to Isabelle Proximus, and the score for taste reflects this.
Mouthfeel: Was glad to find that this one is carbonated. Very dry.
Drinkability: Incredibly high, very sour and flavorful, but still drinkable. 
NB: I enjoyed this one, highly drinkable and tasty. But it simply is not as good as cable car, isabelle proximus, or any of the Veritas line. 854 characterscraytonic, Jan 04, 2010

A - Dark straw colored pour with a thin head. No lacing on glass.
S - Funky! Tart and cut grass. Was impressed by the complexity of the nose on this.
T - Amazing. Sharp fruit and tartness, with a good funk profile.
M - Carbonated and crisp. The tartness did make for a "shocked palate" feeling but I found that dissipated pretty quickly.
D - I could have sat there and drank it all night. Honestly. Fantastic sessionable beer.
What can be said really. A really complex gueze-style beer. I don't know how they pulled it off but I'd have been shocked if you told me this wasn't a Cantillon or similar beverage, if I didn't know better. 688 charactersmutterfudder, Jan 04, 2010

Pours a cloudy yellow-orange with a small white head. Aroma is quite sour-- some barnyard, some sour candies. Flavor of much of the same -- lots of tart candies and mild barnyard. Sour but not acidic. Very pleasant and easy to drink for a sour ale. Excellent! 339 charactersLilBeerDoctor, Dec 19, 2009
4.68/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I drank this from a 22oz bottle into a Rochefort glass.
The beer is honey gold with a touch of orange. The head is white rising a finger and lasting only briefing with ligh lacing.
The aroma is pretty light for a wild ale with mostly a light sour funk to it. Its on its way to being a crazy strong horse blanket but jusn't get you there. Some might like the lighter aroma as it won't turn them off, but I was looking for a tad bit more pugency. At the end there is some light wood. 
For the reasons I didn't like the aroma a ton, I love the taste. It is sour enough to give me the pucker and sensations that I love about wild ale but its just light enough to make it very drinkable. The biggest complaint is that the flavor isn't complex just sour through and through.
Mouthfeel is heavy and great drinkability.
Overall this is an excellent ale and great beer overall. If you love sours this is one you have to search out. 927 charactersjrallen34, Dec 11, 2009
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I love this beer. Poured from the bottle into a Delirium Tremens tulip glass.
Poured a clear pale golden yellow. Odd - I've had this beer before, and it's always been very cloudy. This pour is very clear. Weird. No matter. A small white head emerges and quickly dissipates to a thin collar. Quite nice. (Note: Subsequent pours were cloudy in appearance, which I like a bit more for some reason).
The beer smells of lemons, vinegar, a dollop of honey, oak, and big blast of barnyard funk. Absolutely fantastic.
The taste largely follows the nose. A big sour blast of juicy lemon citrus, with a hint of orange and perhaps ruby red grapefruit zest mixed in. The oak is there, but very subtle. There's a touch of sweetness in the mid-palate, but that is enveloped quickly by a strong (though not overbearing) sour finish. Wonderful.
Mouthfeel is great. Active carbonation, light-bodied, with a sharp, dry finish. Just what I wanted tonight.
This beer, once opened, never lasts long. I can gulp this down with reckless abandon - but I don't. I enjoy the bottle over the course of an hour or more, taking my time, and trying my best to ignore the chug demon that sits on my left shoulder. 
This is a fantastic beer, and IMHO the best sour that Lost Abbey has done. Caveat: I have not yet had Yellow Bus. In due time...
Highly recommended. 1,339 charactersdavod23, Dec 11, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Quite murky, rich golden yellow body with 2 fingers of white head that slowly dissipates to a thin but everlasting white lace. Appealing and appropriate appreance.
Aroma: Impressive. This contains just enough of the funky sourness that I am looking for to take it seriously but plenty else is going on too. A tart lemon rind acid hits the front of the nose and then gives way for musty basement aromas, mold, damp leather, and quintessential barnyard character. Tropical and citric fruit notes round everything out and the finish contains hints of gasoline. 
Taste/Mouthfeel: Light to medium bodied and relatively dry. An initial blast of sourness makes way for steady, tart acidity. Not quite as sour as I would like but close. Lactic qualities meld with oak tannins and lemon. A touch of green apple enters into play as does a hint of citrus. By and large this isn't an explosion of flavor but that isn't what I was looking for. This is a well crafted, sour beer that makes for pleasant, easy drinking. Very comparable to several of the more mellow and subdued Belgian originals. Well done. Drinkability is through the roof. 1,140 charactersDaPeculierDane, Dec 07, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4From a bottle into a snifter @ the Stone Brewing World Bistro & Gardens on 11/9/09 during the "Tomme Arthur Experience" event. 
Pours a hazy golden tangarine color, with a thin filmy covering of brite-white head. This stays rich looking on the edges, coating the sides of the glass with white froth. The aroma is tart citrus right off the bat, probably being most akin to the smell of grapefruit juice, along with some mustiness and woody oak character. Going deeper reveals some cider-like vinegar notes and more pronounced vanilla and char. I like the fact that the more pleasant fruity tartness sits on top, while the more meat & potatoes character of the souring and tannic presence sit underneath with a much slicker feel. Good stuff here. 
The taste is a bit more acidic and vinegar feeling at first, but those same brash citric flavors of lemon, peach, and grapefruit just about keep even pace. Esters and funk permeate the whole profile, along with notes of tannic oak and vanilla. These blend in with some sweeter accents of sugar and honey, which thankfully are constant throughout the taste but not constantly overridden by the tartness, sourness, and funk. Wow, oak and vinegar really just sticks to the roof of the mouth in the finish and it is a bit hard to shake. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, with a mild softness that sits on top of the tongue but then gives way to a lower carbonated and slick feel that falls right in line with the barrel character and ABV of this. Once I got past the initial shock of the flavors, my palate adapted pretty readily to this, making for a most favorable experience. 
This was, all in all, pretty intense at times for me but in the end, I couldn't ignore the beautiful balance between the tartness, sourness, funk, sweetness, and barrel flavors. Just a fantastic Wild Ale blend here. A beer to be proud of for sure. 1,870 charactersKegatron, Dec 02, 2009
4.55/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I owe a big thanks to Jordan from Holiday Wine in San Diego. I walked in not knowing what I was in store for, the man hooked me up. 
The appearance is light straw blonde. Really thick one finger head with dense white foam. The pour was beautiful, really tiny fine bubbles with a crisp carbonation. This was a hazy brew when it came out of the fridge and was still hazy till the last drop. There was a good deal of sediment in the bottle and the last glass had some friendly floaters. Leaves a medium lacing with beautiful alcoholic legs. When I popped the cork it flew across my kitchen, I was scared that it was going to be a gusher, but it just sat patiently in the bottle waiting to be consumed. 
The smell on this brew is very pungent. There are also more than a dozen few smells that present themselves throughout the entire bottle. The first smell is Brett, this is starting to become one of my favorite smells. Smells like a bit of soured lemons and a bit of juicy sweet apple. The Brett smell I was referring to was a funky sweaty sock smell. I have never understood what 'horse blanket' was until this one. Has a Granny Smith apple sweetness in the beginning. When I popped this brew I stuck my nose right in the bottle and inhaled with all my strength, what I got was super acidic and burnt the nostrils. There is a bite to the nose that is acidic and abrasive. This beer for me was about salivating, I did not stop for a while, even after I finished the beer. 
The taste is inspiring. The first taste was one of the best beer experiences I have ever had. Sours and Wild Ales are so amazing on the first taste because it catches your senses so off guard that you are taken back with the strength. When I was smelling it, my mouth was salivating to no end. The first sip was so tart that my tongues receptors exploded with different flavors and textures. This is a beautifully complex brew, so many sour and funky characteristics paired with fruit flavors, I am in awe. Let me try and explain. The tart bite at the beginning start the saliva, then there is a citrus and fruit explosion. Apples and lemon are the two big players in this. The Brett is tasted in funky acidity and sour lemon grass. The fumes this brew put off go throughout your entire nasal cavity when it is drank. There is a Chardonnay characteristic that is present, like an oak wine dryness that backs up all the flavors. Hits the back of the throat with acidity, the stomach acids are being abused by something with a higher acid content. The sweet lemon flavor is the strongest and my favorite characteristic in this one. It has lemon flavor, lemon acidity, and lemon tart. The apples bring a sweetness that is paired with the funky Brett in an amazing way. I now know what horse blanket is. 
The mouthfeel is perfectly carbonated for this style. Not overly soda-like carbonated like Consecration, because this is a Geuze. There is a chalkiness that I believe comes from the oak and a tart punch that makes the tongue beg you for mercy. The sediment and Brett bugs also contribute to the chalk feel. The fine carbonation drills the tastes into your tongue. What I love the most about this mouthfeel is the acidity and funky tart. You really can feel the fumes coming off of this thing, my sinuses were filled with a lemon sting. Also, the sweetness takes your palate for a ride because it is being attacked on so many fronts. I would of given it a perfect mouthfeel but the chalky dryness put it back just a bit, because it mellowed the fruity juice explosion which was a favorite. 
The drinkability is awesome. So mouthwatering and complex that you cannot stop lifting the glass to your mouth. I was so excited for this, and also a little skeptical. I tried the Black Label unfiltered Girardan and was impressed but not blown away. The Girardan was at the top of the Geuze list, so I was weary about the style all together. I have had only a few Geuzes all together, so the style is still a mystery to me. This one was enjoyable on all fronts and was a pleasure to drink. I want to thank Jordan at Holiday again for giving me the opportunity to try this delicious brew.

This beer has a nice sour fruit aroma. I detect some lemon, and a little orange. It smells sour, to say the least. I can also detect some oaky aroma. A slight earthy funk aroma is also present. Also, just a slight vineger scent.
This beer tastes just as it smells. Some sour, tart fruit. A little oak and some funk mix in as well. As with the aroma, I can taste a slight vineger flavor.
This beer leaves a tart lemon aftertaste. It is highly carbonated, as I would expect form the style.
This beer would make a great session beer. It isnt too high in alcohol, and the flavor is great. It may become cloying at some point since it is so tart.
Overall: I have been waiting to open up this beer for a few months now, and I couldnt think of any better time than Thanksgiving. I now have one more thing to be thankful for. 932 charactersOStrungT, Nov 26, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Matt for supplying. Sweet pick-up from So Cal.
A - Pours a hazy golden color with 1 finger of head. It dissipates moderately fast and leaves little lacing. The carbonation is low.
S - Brett and lacto at first followed by subtler characters of honey and maybe a bit of caramel. There is a hint of oak as well.
T - Brett and lacto are the most prevalent flavors. As the beer warms up there are more fruity esters, but also perhaps this beer was aged in a white wine barrel as well. Definitely oak and caramel and honey compose the background. Hops are minimal, but just enough to leave some residual bittering flavor.
M - Moderate bodied and malt dominated, with funk and sourness. Also, a residual amount of sweetness present from the esters and oak aging.
D - Exceptional. I could really sit and session with this sour. The sourness is not too much (cuvee rene) as the white wine barrel aging adds residual sweetness. Definitely a top 100 beer. 959 charactersMisterClean, Nov 23, 2009

Hazy lemony yellow pour. Just a swirl of foam, with some bubbles around the edges.
Sour, oaky, funky aroma. Really nice. I'm smelling some tart lemon, and maybe even some green apple. 
Flavor follows. Big sour character, but it's not too much. It's delicious, but I will say that it's no Ithaca Brute. The sweetness, acidity, and barrel qualities meld excellently.
Light body, carbonation level is right on the money. Make your own Lost Abbey jokes here. Ridiculously easy drinker for a sour. 509 charactersGyle41386, Nov 21, 2009
4.22/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to mikedashg for sending me a bottle. Poured into a tulip glass. 
A- Pours a hazy, apricot color. Almost has a glowing aura surrounding it. There was half fingers width of white head, but it dissipated instantaneously. 
S- Pretty spectacular. Has a vinegar like characteristic. Wet horse blanket and hay are noticeable. Some leather, oranges and lemon in there as well. Smelled like a barnyard on a citrus farm.
T- The initial sip reminds me of RR's Temptation. A very tart, white grape flavor explodes on the palate. Immediately, an oak flavor starts to kick in. Then it gets a little interesting...the back end takes on a citrus, lemon tartness that has a slightly sweet, honey like quality to it. Can't exactly put my finger on it, just not what I expected. Almost had a flanderesque type finish.
M- Light to medium bodied. Could have used a little more carbonation.
D- Given the lack of sourness in this beer, it's pretty smooth and easy to drink. 
Overall, not what I was expecting. The initial sip was pretty tart and I was expecting for that to continue, maybe even intensify. However, that didn't happen and the finish to the beer was a little too weird for me with the subtle sweetness I was picking up. It's a well made beer, but as a person that craves sours every now and then, this definitely doesn't satisfy my fix. For a $30 price tag, I'd much rather stick to Cantillons, which are cheaper and better IMO. 1,438 charactersrhinos00, Nov 14, 2009

Vinegar whiffs on the aroma, leather saddle, peed on horse hay.
Fruity tartness up front, grapefruit and white grapes. Vinegar sourness to go along with the tart. Not overwhelming in the least. Nice oak funk riding through the middle. Fragrant sour in the back, yet right in line with the flavor spectrum. Amoeba lacing up high on the glass, half way down. Somewhat dry mouthfeel, tart, nice.

Consumed on a nice day in Carlsbad on 11/03/2009 and poured into a snifter. The beer appears cloudy tangerine orange with a two finger white head and great retention.
The nose is musty barnyard, cheese, and wet leather accompanied by orange and lemon. There's moderate acidity in the aroma, as well as notes of oak. Wow. The combination of citrus and funk is outstanding. There's moderate lactic character. 
The taste is acidic tart lemon and orange with a moderate lactic sourness. Brett provides mustiness, moderate funk, and a decided cheese quality to the beer. The tart citrus is delicious. Oak is evident. I enjoyed this bottle immensely more than I enjoyed my tap sample. The finish is acidic citrus with a lingering tartness and lactic sourness. This stuff is killer, and so damn drinkable. I'd venture to say this is one of my favorite American Wild Ales and a marvel of blending. Highly recommended. This beer deserves the Gold Medal it won at GABF 2009. 1,083 charactersHopHead84, Nov 04, 2009

I've been waiting for a special occasion to pop it open, but today just felt right. Just returned from NYC, watching the second Packers/Vikings game of the 2009 season at home and waiting for some beer stew to be ready (cooked with 2yr old Bell's Third Coast Old Ale).
DDG is hazy golden colored, very translucent but no floaties (at least in the first pour), with about 1 finger of bright white foam. Some rivulets of lace on the glass.
The aroma is perfect, tart citrus that smells like it came from Brussels. This has all of the best flavors of a wild ale, horseblanket, old leather, and dank basement. It doesn't sound good but it's exactly what I wanted in this beer. The smell of lemons and pineapples brightens it up a bit, this has definite promise. 
On the first taste I'm instantly in Brugges, drinking lambics and gueuze in the main square. This is tart and fruity, absolutely perfect. Abrasive and tasty, strong influence from brettanomyces, this is the SHIT. The label states that this is ale aged in oak barrels, but as so often happens with Cantillon and other sour beers from Belgium I have a hard time discerning wood flavors through the bracing sour presence of the beer.
This is about as drinkable as any wild ale can be, the complexity of the flavor keeps me returning to the glass. At only 7% ABV I'd pop another bottle if I had it. Absolutely recommended, I'm completely thankful for the chance to try it. 1,507 charactersTurdFurgison, Nov 01, 2009

4.6/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've had this a couple of times now, last time a bottle I split with my wife. Just a fantastic brew, and everything I was looking for in the style. Sure, its still on the young side and exhibits more of the acetic and lactic notes than it does the barnyard at this juncture, but I like that too. Really its a matter of taste. The analogy that comes to mind is that of a soft, washed rind cheese- do you like it ripe, runny, and rank, or do you like it a little firmer, slightly sour, and just a bit piquant? Same with wild ales for me. I like them both ways, and I think one can have a classic in either maturity level. This particular beer is a classic for me in the younger, tarter vein. This pours a hazy yellow with a thin wispy head that sticks around. Smells beautifully balanced with sour acetic, lactic, and bright fruit- the fruit components showcase orange, tangerine, and muscat. Just beautiful. The taste has a long lactic finish, bright citrus, and some light funk coupled with nice firm tannins from the oak. The mouthfeel is lactic and punchy with enough tannins to give some structure to the sour fruit. Great beer, and a testament to what Lost Abbey can do when eveerything goes well. 1,201 charactersGeorgiabeer, Oct 01, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Another one from ummagum - many thanks! Poured from a 750ml corked and caged bottle into a Duvel tulip. My last several Lost Abbey's have been flat or close to it so nervous opening this one. Nice loud pop when opening - off to a good start. Was a hazy honey color with lots of center carb plus streams on the outside. Quick sliding lace that doesn't stick. It had a good sized fizzy white head that settled into a collar.
The aroma was excellent. Funky, sour, horseblanket, lemon, and grape. Semi-dry as well. Very nice and near the top of wild ale aromas for me. A little more funk and it would be perfect. The taste followed the aroma and again was exceptional. Sour bite from the start with good fruity balance. Ends with a eye closing pucker and then fades so you are ready for the next drink. Mouthfeel was excellent. Dry but not overly dry. Great carbonation and tart finish.
Overall, an exceptional wild ale that is worthy of the hype and praise. A world class beer. Very reminiscent of Isabelle Proximus which is one of my all-time favorites. Most highly recommend. Rotation: not available here and extremely hard to get so while I'd like some more this probably it for now. If here, I would get several bottles a year. 1,230 charactersTexIndy, Sep 27, 2009

A - Pours a hazy orangey yellow color, almost grapefruit juice like. A larger than expected, dense, 1 finger of white foam forms, lasts about a minute and falls to a thin layer of bubbles on the surface. A steady stream of bubbles rises up the sides of the glass.
S - Smells very sour. Good amount of citrus - oranges and lemons mainly...some vinegar, some banana. Some brett aromas too. Very complex...
T - Very intense and complex. First sip is - wow! Sour! After the first sip, the range of flavors can be better appreciated. Vinegary sourness, oranges, lemons, a touch of brett funk, and banana flavor (actually artifical banana - more like circus peanuts)...
M - Fuller than I expected...hard to describe entirely...not at all syrupy, but the beer wants to hold it's shape - doesn't spread over the tongue just stays in a constant stream down the center of the tongue...sounds weird, but can't think of another way to describe it. Carbonation level is pretty high, but very fine and smooth. Excellent.
D - Pretty drinkable sour. Very intense flavoring but it all blends together very well. Wish this was more readily available. Glad I got a chance to try it. 1,210 charactersportia99, Sep 26, 2009

D: Easy drinking considering the amount of sourness and funk here. Definitely a winner from Lost Abbey. Glad I hunted this down. 544 characterscallmemickey, Sep 26, 2009

4.65/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Strong pop from the cork, emitting a little wisp of gunsmoke, then laid into a lambic basket to serve it. 
Dusty crystalline orange with an ethereal haze of skim across the surface. It was like a web of spindly clouds that ebb and fade on the wind. A thin ring at the edge with some random spotty lace around, the broken skim remained for the whole glass. 
Lemon custard, wet hay, citrus aromas, very authentic and Belgian lambic inspired. Woody farmhouse funk that further supports the lambic impression. With a swirl it intensifies with a sharp acid/petrol note. 
Dry and tart with lots of unique fruit for a Wild Ale. Lemon and sweet tarts, with an ever so slight edge of sweetness that surfaces at the back. The sour/sweet balance is near perfect, lending to the puckering feel with the salivary glands working overtime. A nice mellow softness enhances the overall feel of it, in contrast to the sharpness of a traditional Gueuze. 7/10 on the sour scale. The finish is dry with some oaky barrel traces in the aftertaste. This is an exercise in self-control not to just gulp the whole bottle down. One of the most drinkable Wild Ale examples out there. Though incredible, i'd still give the slight edge to Isabelle. Would love to taste some Phunky Duck, as this blend is very tasty.
Huge thanks to Weibull for his overflowing generosity, never thought i'd get to try this! Thanks also to Masterski for the preview sample! 1,428 charactersemerge077, Sep 19, 2009

Pours a hazy, dark deep golden yellow color with lighter golden ripe banana hues when held to a light source and a 1.5 finger frothy white head tat slowly fades into a lasting cap.
Earthy funk aroma with lots of awesome horseblanket barnyard notes. Slightly lactic with a nice light fruit presence. I'm picking up some light strawberry notes along with some vinegar and earthy oak.
Tart and very puckering with some strong acidity. Lots of barnyard horseblanket funk with some nice golden fruit notes. Apple, pear, white grape and some strawberry and cream. Extremely dry and sour and very refreshing. Nice earthy oak presence with subtle vanilla characteristic. Pretty well balanced with pleasant light fruit nuances that counter the extremely sour funky notes. Bone dry sour puckering finish. Actually pretty drinkable after the initial palate shock. Probably not worth the $30 price tag but still very good. Recommended. 973 characterscorby112, Sep 19, 2009

Hazy blond color with a white head. Funky, horsey and sour aroma with a tart orange juice element. A nice level of sour in the flavor. Not as sour as the better Belgian Gueuzes, but with a similar character of funk and lemon. Pretty good stab at a gueuze, but I couldn't help thinking that I would rather go out and buy the real thing for less money. 473 charactersbulletrain76, Sep 16, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Purchased at the Pizza Port Carlsbad back in early August. Sampled on September 15, 2009.
A: Beautiful golden, tawny apricot color with a fairly long-lasting bone-white head. The initial head on a semi-hard pour into my tulip glass was a little over an inch, and it has settled down to a little over a quarter of an inch. Rich effervescent bubbles immediately after the pour settle into a mild vertical flight of carbonation as the brew settles. The lacing clings mildly as I quaff the beer down.
S: A prickly sourness is the most apparent scent upon first sniff. As I bring the glass back for another whiff, I smell sweet Meyer lemons alongside sour green grapes and a few tropical notes. There's also a slight oakiness, which I gather will assert itself further as the beer warms from fridge temperature. As it warms, there is a little more of a slightly funky earthy aroma. 
T: As with the nose, there is a mouth-puckering tartness as I take my first sip; it takes my mouth a moment to adjust, and my eyes have gotten a little watery. While I'm certainly no sour expert, I wouldn't recommend this as a beginner's wild ale. As I get further into the glass I can detect a lot more--the lemon is much less pronounced in the taste, and coming further is more of a Granny Smith-type sourness.
M: The tartness is obvious and the first sip made my lips pucker and left my cheeks quite dry; the dryness subsides as my palate becomes more accustomed to the beverage, but the refreshing acidic tartness remains throughout. The carbonation is fairly light, which is very nice and refreshing on what is hopefully one of the last hot days here in Northern Virginia. My biggest complaint is that this is something my taste buds were able to adjust to a little too much, as the last sip wasn't nearly as puckering as the first couple. Also, while not a style that needs plenty of carbonation, this one could use a tad bit more.
D: Drinkability is quite high; as I took my second sip, I was saddened by the fact that I had only another 700 mL or so of this tart, puckering nectar. While this may not have been the kindest year to Lost Abbey, Duck Duck Gooze is certainly making the brightest impression upon me. 2,203 charactersThorpe429, Sep 15, 2009
4.92/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've been hearing insane things about this beer before it was ever even bottled. As much as I hate to follow the crowd, I've gotta say: This beer was absolutely worth the hype!
A- Pours a deep, rich gold with a quickly dissipating head. Although hazy, the color of this beer surprised me in that it is very deep for a (neo)geuze.
S- Acetic and lactic sourness. Complex notes of cider and balsamic vinegar compliment a lemony, fruity aroma. A mild breadiness is cut by notes of sour apple and tart peach.
T- Sour with a honey-like sweetness. Dry and complex. Honey and lemon are the first two things that are noted, but not simultaneously. A rich, honey-like sweetness coats the palate and is quite abruptly cut off by sour notes of lemon and green apple. Herbal, peppery tones lead into a lingering sour finish.
M- Big with a nice dry finish.
D- I don't even know what to write for drinkablility. Although, I do wish I had more of it to drink. 948 charactersJoeMayo, Sep 13, 2009

Best beer of the night out of 20+, just edging out the likes of Valley Brew Uberhoppy and Rasputin XII. This is Tomme's way of reminding you that he's a really damn good brewer just when you're about to throw yourself off a building because you paid $30 for an uncarbonated bottle of Angels Share.
A - Brilliant hazy golden-straw color with a white head.
S - Lemony funk, barnyard, wood, and a little sweet malt.
T - Nice lemony tartness balanced by a malty sweetness and some light fruits. Not too sour, great balance. Very tasty.
M - Incredibly sharp, biting, and lively with high carbonation (from Lost Abbey!).
D - High. This is actually pretty refreshing for a wild ale and goes down easy despite the tartness. 784 charactersnickd717, Sep 08, 2009
3.94/5  rDev -13.2%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Large corked bottle poured into a Duvel glass. 
Even in the Duvel glass, designed to produce head, the white head that tops the hazy straw colored beer is minimal, has no retention, and virtually no lacing. I cannot avoid imagining this is going to be another flat journey. 
Aroma is an improvement over appearance, with a citric tartness, major damp funkiness, a variety of fruits, a significant acidity, a hint of oak. Very nice. 
The body and flavor are quite nice and reassuring, as I was again really concerned about quality control here. It is not flat; there is a soft carbonation that actually matches the flavor nicely. Tart, fruity, musty. Citric notes abound, with minimal sweetness. Acidity rounds out the flavor, with a slight woodiness. 
Significantly better than I expected, but short of great. Worthwhile, but if you consider the price, not that much. 
On the spectrum of Lost Abbey adventures, where most have been either great, or more frequently, a disaster, this manages to be somewhere in the middle. 1,022 charactersbrdc, Sep 05, 2009
4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Golden with a slight haze. Two fingers of head rises from vigorous pouring and retains fairly well, ultimately settling to a thick disc around the rim of the glass. The nose is complex but balanced, barnyard funk backed by lemon and orange-like acidity, lactic sourness, acetic acid, and a unique tropical fruit sweetness that really makes the beer. Opens on the palate with sharp lactic acidity and well-expressed tannins. Fruit flavors of pineapple, orange and lemon add interesting complexity. Moderate acetic presence mid-palate, woody and lightly astringent, with the malt coming out a bit more, lending a light sweetness that leads into a dry, sharp and tannic finish. The noticeable acetic quality is a slight detraction, but I love the strong tropical fruit character. Another winner for Lost Abbey; they should really concentrate on these barrel-aged sour beers, they're often excellent. 896 characterslargadeer, Sep 04, 2009
4.6/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Received two bottles of this in the mail courtesy of Papollo as a gift. Awesome and huge thanks again!
Appearance- Pours without exaggeration one of the best looking American wild ales that I've seen. A beautiful golden with a good deal of carbonation and about one finger of tight white head that sticks around for a bit and then dies back to a thin layer. The bottom of the bottle is a bit hazy as it pours out, and I add a little of the residual yeast to my glass, making it a nice cloudy golden.
Smell- Very lactic and tart up from. Very vinous and smells of white grapes, citrus, and apples. A fair amount of barnyard and actually the first time that I think I've smelled leather/horseblanket in a beer before as well. Always wondered about those, but here they are, and I've smelled horseblankets before, and it is surprisingly similar. Excellent and complex nose.
Taste- Very tart. Again, very vinous, almost like a white wine with grape being the predominant citrus flavor and also some apple. Funk is pretty strong, especially in my glass given that I added some yeast (tried a sip from a cup poured from the top of the bottle, which was definitely less funky). Barnyard shows up again a bit, but less strong than the nose. Very tart, delicious, and easy to drink.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability- Spot on carbonation and more body than I'm used to for the style. Excellent in my opinion, and the drinkability is great and makes it worth the price tag.
Overall, lives up to the hype machine. A great beer and though labeled an American wild ale, the closest American approximation to a Belgian gueuze that I've ever tasted I'd say. I have a second bottle that I'm going to age and give another try. We'll see how this one grows. Get a bottle if you can. 1,758 charactersboatshoes, Sep 03, 2009
4.28/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Finally found an appropriate evening to pop this devilish duck received from my favorite suspicious aloysius t0rin0 and shared with the bestest, BeerTruth, even if he is a Syracuse fan.
This beer pours a color I can happily describe as bright and sunny, not a cloud in the sky. A pale orange yellow that doesn't produce much head besides a thin white layer that disappears pretty fast. The haze increased as the bottle was emptied, clearly having settled (much leftover chunkies clinging to the bottom).
The aroma was real refreshing, sour apple, little funk, mostly citrus and tart, but none really overpowering the other either.
Oh, this is a good one. Just like the aroma, the taste delivers on all counts a very delicious balanced sour, and the hints of oak that came out after a few sips really add a magnificently subtle kick to the taste buds. Not too dry, not too tart, Goldilocks would pick this one out of a lineup for sure as it is just right. The drinkability is unquestionable for me, I could have had this entire bottle.
DDG might just be my new favorite sour so good thing it is readily available all the time...oh wait.

Pours a slightly hazy peach with yellow highlights. An average white, fizzy head was there for a minute, but disappeared, leaving a small white halo. Settling must have occurred as it sat in my cellar, because the more we drank, the cloudier the pours got.
The nose is big and complex on this one! I get a mix of band aid astringency, sour granny smith apples, sour peaches, fresh, sweet honey and tangerine. There's also a tobacco quality and some wood in it. Wow! To me, the peach is the most assertive flavor in the nose and it does smell puckering!
Wow, where to start! Puckering mix of band aids, peach, tangerine and honey again! My college graduate level vocabulary can't give this beer justice. Leathery/woody finish on this one... Just amazingly unique!
The body is light and the flavor is full. I get a film of bitterness on my tongue after sipping! Big complex and fantastic! One of my top 3 favorite beers of 2009!

4.5/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A solid Pour into my 25cl tulip glass produces a frothy, two-finger thick, pale, almost white head. The beer is a murky, pale amber color that shows quite a bit of haze (much is a chill haze as it was clearer at room temps) and a rich gold color when held up to the light. I only let this sit for just under two weeks (I couldn't wait any longer), so this was still a touch hazy even before I chilled it down.
The aroma has a tart lemon like bite to it up front but finishes with a distinct tropical fruit and even more pineapple notes at the backend of the aroma. Musty, damp cellar notes mix with a musky, phenolic soaked moldy cotton, sweat stained well worn leather character are a sure Brettanomyces signature. There is a touch of toastiness here that seems to be contributed by both oak and grain; the latter also produces some saltine cracker notes I can't get away from the fruitiness here, while it is not overwhelming (the lactic contribution is probably the most dominant in this complex nose, but not by much) and even a touch subtle, it is quite distinct from say a Belgian Lambic; tropical fruit, with a touch of green apple at times can be quite distinct at times, though at others it can be quite fleeting too. As the beer warms a sort of unripe, green fruit character seems to get accentuated, some how it reminds me of nopalitos (prickly pear cactus paddles ready for cooking).
My first sip is puckeringly tart, but there seems to be a hint of sweetness to this brew too (though perhaps this is just perceived from a soft acetic character). Subsequent sips lose the shocking sourness but retain a robust, amply tart lactic acid component that dominates the flavor profile. The body is quite full for something that is so dry and I am sure much of it is contributed by tannic oak and the lactic slickness that is found in significantly sour beers. There is a buttery note here that I at first thought might be some residual diacetyl, but I am not convinced it is more likely oak derived; in fact I am pretty sure of this. Despite being quite sour, there is still a lot more going on here; spicy oak notes, a solid virgin oak stave woodiness, a touch of urea, maybe a hint of an acetic bite (actually as this warms I think this becomes more apparent, though it is nothing more than a background note), maybe a touch of green apple, . There is a touch of astringency and sharpness to the finish that seems to leach into the oral-nasal cavity and the roof of my mouth after a sip as passed down my throat.
My second pour of this beer is, unsurprisingly, a touch more hazy. Underneath the ever present acidity there is a soft Brettanomyces influenced funk; layers of mustiness, definite phenolic notes that don't quite reach curing plastic levels as well as a hint of musky, sweat dried, abused blankets that become a touch more apparent towards the finish. 
I could drink a lot of this beer. The aroma is nicely complex and though the flavor could be a little bit more so, it is still a fine tipple overall. This substitutes very nicely for a traditional Belgian-sourced Lambic and I so wish I had a bunch of bottles of this. For those who like a more integrated faux Lambic, this beer will be enjoyed a bit more than the fresh Isabelle Proximus. Comparing these fresh though, I liked the additional complexity of the Isabelle Proximus (funkiness and oak were more prominent in the first beer released). This is still quite a fine beer though and it serves as proof that the funky beers at Lost Abbey are still strong and full of life. 3,553 charactersGueuzedude, Aug 25, 2009

Mix that with all the hype that has built up behind this beer and you've got one curious, but cool, kat.
Poured from a 750Ml bottle. This pours a very hazy straw golden yellow, which glows when held up to the light. There is a nice soft white hazy head. Looks near ideal for the style.
WHOA!!! Super sour, lemon, vanilla, lemongrass, sour cherry and light orange all combine to form an unbelievable scent. I can't keep my nose out of the glass. Easily one of the best smelling beers around. The flavors dance nicely on the palate, and combine to form an incredibly acetic taste. Very pleasing to the sour lover. The body is highly carbonated, which is unusual for an LA beer. Regardless, there is plenty of substance to this beer.

A nice pop when I removed the cork and I see the foam oozing from the bottle. A nice cloudy orange coloured brew with over a 1 finger head of foam. Yes!
Taking a few whiffs, this certainly smacks of an American Wild Ale that is of the sour variety. Huge sourness greets my nosebuds...I'm geting mostly grapes(I'm guessing they are bringing some sweet tones as well cuz there is definitely some sweetness here) but also green apples tartness and some notes of citrus fruits.... with a healthy yeasty note and if your whiffs are deep, you can smell the oak aging for yourself. In other words, the smell is outrageously good and implies an equallly good taste. We shall see.
First sip and the sour starts things off very nicely. Green apples, grapes, citrus bitterness, some fruity sweet tones, yeasty, and slightly funky?? wow. Love the flavours here and the sourness intensifies greatly when you swish the beer in your mouth. And..in between all that, a bit harder to detect but it is there, is an oaky goodness. The second pour sems to bring out more of that oak aging but it certainly isn't a dominant feature. No problem. What I'm tasting the most pleases me to no end.
The mouthfeel just creeps over into medium territory and the carbonation is light but perfect for this brew. This sucker is silky smooth. And you know what? Head retention and lacing are superb!
Drinkability? No sign of the abv and quite frankly, I didn't "expect" any as most of the style are in the reasonable alcohol content department. That being said, this is so easy to drink for me, it makes me shudder. I'm so glad I opted to buy this, being a Sinners Club member. So many positives and so few negatives. Are there any?

4.97/5  rDev +9.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5So damn happy to be able to get a hold of this one. Big thanks to Stonepurist for sending this one out to me. Chilled down to 50 degrees and the 750ml bottle was popped and decanted into my darkness snifter. Consumed on 08/06/2009.
Appearance 4.5 - Poured out a very hazy golden yellow color. A little white head on top, maybe a quarter of an inch but it stayed on top for damn near the entire session, really looked quite nice I have to admit. Light rings of lace on the side of the glass and a really nice and very bright color to it.
Smell 5 - Beautiful. Like a funky masterpiece. Loads of tart apple notes, hints of sour grapes, lots of fruit all over the place. Bright, with a touch of light citrus notes bouncing around as well. Very well put together I have to admit. Really am like where this one is going. As I let it warm it opens up even more. So bright and complex, yet simple. Sour at its perfection.
Taste 5 - Ok. So I am anticipating something huge here. To be honest I have followed this beers progress for a while, drooling at the early reviews and statements of it. I am comparing it to Isabelle, again another sublime beer. I take the first sip, the only thoughts that cross my mind bring me back to being a long lad growing up in Jersey. Running through the orchards and picking fresh granny smith apples. You take that first bite into the green fruit on that crisp fall day and all bets are off. Huge tart and sour notes just pucker your lips and leave you in amazement of the flavor you are experiencing. It was like that times ten. I was floored. Clean, crisp, super funky and tart, I was beyond impressed here. One of the best tasting beers, let alone sour beers that I have ever come across. It was really that damn good. Say what you will, but wow. Nice long drawn out close to it really lets that flavors absorb on the palate and that taste, which wonderful sour taste just will not fade and hangs in your mouth forever. Not much else I can say, but wow.
Feel 5 - Perfect. Carbonation is spot on. Light and airy. Flavors are accented wonderful by the feel. This is what dreams are made of people.
Drinkability - Incredible, I could have drank this one all day. Unbelievably crisp. That taste was mind-blowing, carbonation perfect. Light balanced and sublime. I was so utterly sad to see the last drop leave my glass that it depressed me the rest of the night.(not really I had another bottle)
Overall - Wow, just wow. I had been worried with all the heat that Lost Abbey has taken recently as to whether or not this one would stand up. And boy did it ever. One of the best sours I have ever had, hands down. Up there with Isabelle and Beatification, this thing is a beast. This must be sought out, it lives up to the hype and actually surpassed it for me. 2,788 charactersmikesgroove, Aug 08, 2009

T - Wow, this one is damn good! Sweet/sour citrus melded together perfectly. Green apples stick out for me up front on this one along with the sweetness of oranges on the back. This one is sour, but not so much. Rather, it's a perfect blend of both together combining into a wonderful AWA.
M - Fizzy, champagne-like carbonation. Light-medium in body. Really refreshing and such a clean/dry finish...awesome.
D - Such an easy wild ale to drink...I probably could have drink the entire bottle myself if not for the tasting I brought this bottle to. Can't wait to crack another open and review again. 837 charactersSean9689, Aug 02, 2009

A: Like most lambics and gueuzes, the lacing and head potential exhibited by this beer appeared to be on the weaker side. When held into the sunlight, a beautiful orange-yellow haze hue peered through the cup. Very reminiscent of a good summer hefeweizen and/or Belgian style golden ale. 
S: A delicate and complex aroma. Lots of citrus and sour up front, neither one overshadowing the other, followed by green apple. 
T: Not as subtle as the smell indicated, Duck Duck Gooze had a very intense flavor profile and tart character. A mixture of various citrus fruits along with green grapes and green apple seem to come through on the palate, which went well with the very refreshing tart/sour finish.
M: A much bigger body than what I had expected...somewhat thick and hazy I guess; ample carbonation as well.
D: Very impressed! The amount of alcohol and abundant flavors brought forth from this beer are amazing.
Overall: The quality and complexity of this sour was extremely similar to those brewed by Russian River...who probably do the best job with this style. A must have. Cheers! 1,186 charactersOlieIPA, Jul 26, 2009

4.65/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Whew. The wait is over! Had this on tap today along with a boatload of other folks at the Lost Abbey Christmas in July. Had a fantastic time, big ups to the whole staff and for having such an awesome and worthy event for beer lovers. 
Appearance: Yellow with a straw-white head and nice carbonation. Solid, but it really belied what was inside. 
Smell: Tartness comes through, even in the nose. Green apple, grape, and hints of cherry with very little yeast. Highly sour and sweet smells alike, and on a hot day like today, just sounded awesome.
Taste: Now, I just want to say before I fully review: I haven't had too many sour beers, but this beer was incredible. Full bodied tartness that really makes you pucker, with the grape, green apple, and hints of peach really layering it on thick in the taste department. Wow, just so interesting, refreshing, and just absolutely tasty through and through.
Mouthfeel: Crisp and well carbonated, with a lasting pucker post-swallow that eventually fades to a dry and sweet finish. Really nice.
Drinkability: As drinkable as they come. I could've gone through pint after pint of this, and would've had it not started to run out / me go broke. But as great as I'd hoped, and here's to hoping it's all that and more out of the bottle! 1,279 charactersnomomentwasted, Jul 25, 2009
4.38/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5We'll, finally I'm at 500 reviews! I had thought about what I would rate for my 500th review and I love the Lost Abbey sours so it was nice that this highly anticipated beer came out just around the time I was close to 500 reviews.
I got to try this beer on tap at the Stone Sour Fest 09. This was the only beer I actually went back for a 2nd time.
The duck is a pale, hazy, yellow color with a good inch of foam. Good head retention and soapy lacing on the sides of the glass.
Light cheese and funk on the nose, a bit oak buttery and popcorn aroma, lemon and tart citrus fruits. Not as funky or sour as I was hoping for but still nice.
Now, the taste is a bit better than the aroma, more of what I expected. Cheese upfront, brett, lemon, leather, and hay. Medium acidity with some vinegar on the finish. Semi-dry with still a touch of malt sweetness. More leathery flavors with each sip, oak and vanilla, more fruity as well. To me this tastes more like a 2 year old lambic, it's not a traditional gueuze in that it's a 1, 2, and 3 year old blend of the same beer. I heard this beer has some 1, 2, not sure on 3 year old beer but supposedly there is a beer blended in here that is older than three years. Good carbonation and creamy on the palate with some body from the sweetness. Nice dry finish.
I think this one will age very well and get drier and funkier as the years go by. Looking forward to having a pint and buying some bottles of this at the upcoming release. 1,476 charactersseaoflament, Jul 21, 2009
4.42/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Sampled at the RBSG09 Grand Tasting thanks to alohaC.
It's an excellent sour. Light yellow and murky liquid with good lacing. The smell is mostly sweet and sour lemons with a refined funk. The flavor is pleasantly sour, and the beer is quite drinkable. The malt gives the beer a refined sweetness. It's a refreshing gueuze with an easily likable flavor. While I like strong funk and sour flavors, this is still an excellent gueuze. 432 characterspopery, Jul 20, 2009
4.8/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Got to first try this during the Stone Sour Fest. This was one of the first three or four beers I sampled, before the UNGODLY KILN-LIKE HEAT began to destroy my will to live. 
Surprisingly long lived white foam head. Pours a cloudy, hazy yellow. Smells like tight, tart funkiness, with a predominantly lemon aroma. Wow. Lot of lemon in the flavor, too. There's some nice barnyard funk that isn't overpowering, and a ton of zesty vinegar lemon ... maybe some unripe oranges ... and a dash of vinegar. Its funk and sour elements are very well balanced.
Surprisingly, neither a sour, a funk, nor a flavor bomb. It's just a very well harmonized, very good sour.
Had this back to back with Isabelle Proximus, and it was interesting to compare the two. Isabelle is certainly more sour, and heavier on the unripe apples/pears versus lemon and citrus.
**UPDATE: somewhat uniquely amongst Lost Abbey beers (recently), this was BETTER in the bottle than it was on tap. Shocking, I know. The citrus and vinous vinegary-ness was more lipsmackingly addictive, and with a big amount to linger over the nuances became much more noticeable. The oak finish and unripe apple sensation, for example, was more prominent as one worked their way through a larger serving size. One of the most drinkable sours I've come across. 1,308 charactersOverlord, Jul 20, 2009
4/5  rDev -11.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4RBSG09 bottle at the grand tasting courtesy alohaC. Pale milky straw color with a thin white head. Aromas of lemon meringue, chlorine, honey. Tart and acidic flavor but not that sour. Lemons and oranges, almost pine-sol-esque at times, sweeter grains and honey/caramel. Pretty dang good but not top tier. 304 charactersillidurit, Jul 13, 2009
