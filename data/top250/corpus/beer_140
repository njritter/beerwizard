The Heist Brewery's Citraquench'l IPA nestles into the glass with a murk and mud appearance that's of semigloss goldenrod. Its creamy white froth holds all those aromatic, succulent perfumes that create an irresisstible ire of creamsickle and herbal sherbet. Juicy and sweet on the tongue, the radiant fructose sweetness of citrus and tropical fruit take on honey dipped proportions, even lightly caramelized at first.
The middle palate bursts with fruit flavor. As the sweetness wavers slightly, the tangy fruits of pink grapefruit, blood orange, pineapple, mango and passionfruit take on the freshest, branch ripe savory succulence possible from hops. Smoothly bitter, the beer's even keel bite carries an herbal, grassy, sassafras-like taste to close.
Medium bodied and trending dry, tart and tantalizing; The beer's juiciness is laced with a bready sweet linger like poundcake. Limited in its bitter value as well as its dryness, its doughy, vegemite center keeps the beer richly of sherbet and finishing only semidry. 1,173 charactersBEERchitect, Feb 03, 2017

L : hazy dark mango-juice appearance. Very light tan head.
S: This surprised me! Citra for days! Citra hops are dominant here. Great hoppy sweet tropical aromas of orange, mango, peach, pineapple, slight vanilla/graham sweetness. I spent a considerable amount of time just smelling this  great beer.
T: Taste was a citra hoppy orange creamsicle. I was apprehensive and assuming that people were exaggerating a bit in other reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised/pleased that they were pretty on-the-nose with the taste.  There is some citrus and light bitterness at the end to make sure that this is not some sweet-bomb. Very impressive!
F: Thick and creamy.
O: I was blown away by this. I was already a citra freak, but this really showcases and shines that hop. This is easily one of my Top 5 IPAs (and I've had lots of HF/TH/Trillium) and in running for favorite. Highly recommended! 924 charactersraspy22, Jan 24, 2017

Clean and not quite soft but less abrasive than expected. Clean bitter hops with a quick dry-wine finish, I enjoy that, it reminds you of and old school hop bomb but ends so nicely you want to immediately dive back in for more. An awesome IPA that I would only be so lucky to try again in the future. 533 charactersM_chav, Jan 08, 2017

Murky pale orange juice appearance with a thick, frothy head that pools around the edges.  Heavy Citra aromas full of ripe tropical fruit and citrus juice.  Creamy orange juice, peaches, mango, and pineapple.  Medium bodied with a creamy thickness to it.  Juice bomb!  I only wish for a little more dankness to counter the fruity sweetness. 345 characterswedge, Jan 08, 2017
4.6/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours an almost completely opaque super murky burnt orange in color with moderate amounts of active visible carbonation along the edges of the glass and moderate deep golden yellow highlights. The beer has a three finger tall dense foamy beige head that slowly reduces to a medium sized half finger thick cap in the center of the glass surrounded by a large patch of thin film covering the remainder of the surface of the beer and a medium thick ring at the edges of the glass. Significant amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Moderate to strong aromas of citrus/grapefruit (juicy), citrus/orange, tropical/papaya, and tropical/passionfruit hops over the top of light to moderate aromas of biscuit malts.
T: Upfront there are light flavors of biscuit malts with moderate amounts of caramel + grainy sweetness. That is followed by strong flavors of citrus/grapefruit (juicy), citrus/orange, tropical/papaya, and tropical/passionfruit hops which contribute lots of flavor but only a light amount of bitterness which fades away pretty quickly.
M: Slightly heavier than medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Creamy with a hint of slickness in the finish.
O: Delicious juicy NE style IPA, probably the best one I have had brewed here in NC. Really enjoyable, easy to drink, and a beer that I would be happy to enjoy regularly if I could get my hands on it. It took quite a while to get my hands on this beer and it was well worth the wait and stood up to the hype/demand.

S - bright ripe pineapple and orange creamsicle. Orange Julius. Faint vanilla. Pithy clementine, slightly yeasty/wheaty... I'm guessing galaxy? 
T - now that's what I call JUICE Volume NC. Mango cream and orange juice. Slight orange tang and some pithy spicy bitterness toward the finish. Peel. Fresh-cut pineapple. So bright. Floral citrus and mild grapefruit acidity that really showcases the hops. Leaves creamsicle lingering in the mouth; one of the most sensually beautiful finishes. 
F - delightfully creamy. Full and bright. Just oozes across the mouth, leaving a river of flowing flavor in its wake. It's basically sexual.
O - wow, never expected this out of anywhere except New England. Bright and juicy, fresh ice creamy vanilla and orange sherbet. 950 charactersagreenman19, Dec 25, 2016

Appearance is hazy, almost murky, and yellow orange in color. Head is a good three finger thick with pretty good retention.
Smell is like a juice bomb with orange and mango leading the way with citrus hop flavor. There is also some wheat in the background.
Taste follows the nose with a ton of orange flavors. Almost comes across as orange creamsickle. Bitterness is fairly low with moderate sweetness.
Mouthfeel is very creamy with fairly low carbonation throughout and a bite on the back end.
Overall this a hazy juice bomb, NE style ipa that is really well done. There is initially a surge of fresh orange that is accompanied by a creamy mouthfeel. I wouldn't mind a little more bite on the back end. Having said that, this is one of the best juicy ipas I have tasted. 820 charactersthatche2, Oct 08, 2016

L-hazy as heck....really thick and pulp looking orange juicy.  I want to sink right in!
S-burst of heavy citrus.  about as bold as they get of grapefruit, orange, and tangerine.  pretty dank with a little melon as well and some earthy grassiness to it slightly as well
T-the citrus burst continues.  Heavy flavors and lots of them. All stated above continue on.  Really great.  I assume this is heavily dry hopped, but I am loving how these flavors are coming through.  I am still in awe that all these flavors can be present in a beer under 7%.  Crazy
F-crushable.  Goes down super smooth.  Just fantastic
O-everyone should seek this one out.  I got lucky to get this in a trade right after the canning and I hope I can get this in the future.  This competes with just about every top IPA I have had. 861 charactersrabbott2, Oct 03, 2016

A: Fits the stylistic bill. This one comes in a super hazy, medium orange-gold color with about a finger of pillowy white head, which slowly dissipates and leaves thick rings of lacing on the glass. It's very turbid and pretty much entirely opaque, with an OJ-like appearance that I rarely get outside of Tree House, Trillium, and a few others. Really really enticing.
S: Lots of citrus and some underlying dank qualities. Up front, I get orange, grapefruit, and loads of sweet melon. Underneath that is a grassy green hop note that kinda reminds me of some west coast IPAs. Overall, it's not an explosively aromatic beer, but as it warms, the aroma does begin to pop more. For a 7.1% beer, it's smells damn good. 
T: Straight citrus juice up front. TONS of orange and a ruby red grapefruit. Hints of more tropical fruits--pineapple and a bit of mango--but mostly a sweet citrus bomb on the initial taste. On the finish, I get a really nice pithy, bitter grapefruit and orange flesh note that combines with the sweet OJ up front to balance it out. Maybe a hint of green hops underneath it all, but definitely not to the extent that I get it on the nose. This is a phenomenal showcase of Citra's flavor profile.
M: Smooth as can be. It's soft while still providing a bit of effervescence on the tongue. In terms of weight, it's medium; not at that creamy level of Tree House IPAs in this range, but it definitely has some heft. There's a wonderful smack of pithy, citrus peel bitterness that hints on the back of the taste and perfectly balances out the sweet citrus flavors.
O: Wow, what an awesome first impression of Heist. After drinking a ton of Tree House, Grimm, and other NE-style beers over the past few weeks, I feel confident in stating that this one stands up to the best. At 7.1%, it's right in my personal ABV sweet spot. It packs a ton of hop flavor while retaining a drinkability that would--for better or for worse--enable me to drink a few of these consecutively. I love the bitter/sweet balance on the finish and the soft, delicate carbonation. If they could amp up the aroma a bit (to bring out some of those sweet citrus notes even more) and add a bit more creaminess to the mouthfeel, this would be up there with Julius, Congress St, etc. for sure. As it stands now, though, it's not far behind!
P.S. As I sip this more, I'm noticing a ton of similarities on both the flavor/aroma profile and the mouthfeel to Trillium's Headroom... Of course, it's thinner and not nearly as intense on the nose, but definitely a Headroom-lite! 2,588 charactersavas, Sep 30, 2016

Taste is of pineapple and grapefruit with a nice mildly dry finish with a nice mile bitterness. Best IPA I have had from NC. 226 characterslupercmda, Aug 14, 2016

S: Peaches, grapefruits, tangerines, and a slight dankness
T: All of the juicy tropical fruits we've come to expect with the hazy NE IPAs - pineapple, calamansi, mangoes, and oranges - capped by a crisp and dry crackery malt finish
F: Full body with moderate carbonation
O: Finally. Finally North Carolina has the hazy, juicy IPA it deserves. Man, I've longed for this day and Citraquench'l flat out delivered. From the tropical and citrusy nose to the juicy and flavorful taste profile, which was all underpinned by the thick mouthfeel, I'm delighted to report this beer is the real deal and capable of going toe to toe with some of the best that Tree House, Trillium, Tired Hands, Grimm etc. have to offer. Overall I thoroughly enjoyed this one and applaud Heist for producing a world class hazy juice bomb! Delicious. 1,004 charactersFireman_RK, Jul 14, 2016
4.96/5  rDev +6.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Look: Pours a thick, deep orange/yellow, the color of orange juice. Great head which settled down about halfway through the glass but retained the lacing throughout. 
Smell: CITRUS! Tropical fruit aromas assault your sense of smell, in a good way. 
Taste: Juicy tropical fruit imparted from the citra hops. Hoppier than expected, but everything tied together excellently. 
Feel: Heavy(er) mouthfeel, a bit dryer than expected, but was still easy drinking. 
Overall: An amazing NE style IPA that is simply superb. Don't sleep on this one, it can certainly challenge the best of its northern counterparts. 607 charactersWesHowl, Jul 14, 2016

Smell:  Juicy citrus and tropical fruit tones, bringing papaya and citrus
Taste:  Juicy as all get out, with the tropical fruit flavors of papaya and pineapple dominating with the citrusy tones building through the middle; refreshingly juicy through the finish
Mouthfeel:  Medium to full body with moderate carbonation
Overall:  Heist has thrown down the gauntlet with this one and I don't see anyone challenging them in the New England IPA style in this neck of the woods 596 charactersbrentk56, Jul 13, 2016

Pours very hazy, prominent citrus and hops on the nose, flavor....100% citra with a creamy to slick mouthfeel and a clean finish.  Just not sure what else you'd look for in an IPA. 302 charactersjbriggs7, Jun 15, 2016

Now they cant make enough of these blurry IPAs .
Murky orangeish  yellow, literally looks like OJ. 
Mouth feel is heavy but finishes so light and crisp.
Unfortunately, this batch kicked today but I'm sure there is more unfiltered loveliness in the works .

This was fantastic.  Great nose, tons of citra and super smooth.  Big mouthfeel but can crush it easy.  1 crowler isn't enough.  Love what these guys are doing.

4.87/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75What an amazing beer!!!  Ive been fortunate to have had plenty of beers in the last couple of years from Treehouse,  Trullium and the other heavy hitters coming out of the Northeast.  I have fallen in love with the style and have had quite the itch that has needed to be scratched with  the availability of these beers in NC.  Holy shit!!  Heist has given me the fix that i have so needed.  All of their NE style beers have been incredible but Citraquenchal has been the best of them all!!  The smell is all late, tropical hop additions that create this "hop dust meets orange juice" aroma that makes me want to quit drinking any other liquids in my life.  The color is somewhere between orange juice and grapefruit juice.  Just looking at the beer makes my mouth salivate.  The taste is exactly what i want in an ipa.  Pure, clean, light orange juice that was dry hopped with finely ground hop fairy dust with hardly a hint of bitterness.  Is this even beer or is this what liquid viagra tastes like?  Its hard to believe the ibu's in this beer still fall into an ipa classification.  We did a tasting along side of Treehouse Julius and Bright and Citraquenchal was the best.  They were all similar but the finish on yhe Citraquenchal was superior.  I am so thankful to be able to enjoy these beers without having to give up beers that I had to wait in line for and pay twice as much per oz for.  Thank you Heist for making my dreams come true!!  The only reason why there arent 5's across the board is because I know Heist has yet to make their best IPA yet and I am saving those 2 fives for the "perfect beer". 1,613 charactersabb610, Mar 24, 2016
