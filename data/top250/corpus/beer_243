4.24/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16oz can into an All Green Everything Other Half tulip glass. 
Appearance is slightly hazy, darker orange body with a two finger off-white head that reduces fairly quickly to leave a light layer of foam and spotty lacing. 
Aromas are malty, resinous, piney, citrusy, rindy, grapefruit, caramel, light booze. Smells like it's going to be a malt-forward IPA. 
On the tongue, it's less malty than the nose would suggest but still sitting on a heavy malt backbone. Pine and resinous hops, floral, orange cream,  lightly citrusy, follow through is lightly sweet with a slightly bitter peppery finish. Mouthfeel is fantastic for a 10.5% TIPA - almost no booze detected. Drinks like a 7% IPA. Medium body and carbonation.
Overall I liked this for what it is. A 10.5% triple IPA that drinks super smooth and has no off flavors. This isn't the tropical fruit bomb that are increasingly popular these days, this is a solid IPA brewed with the classic hop styles and a good malt backbone. 995 charactersgcamparone, Apr 06, 2017

The head slid down and left really good foamy lacing in a camouflage pattern.
Smells of grapefruit, mango, apricot, pineapple, green apple, tropical fruit, honey, caramel, wheat bread, syrup, piney hops and a lot of fruity sweetness. The malts peek through the sugary sweet fruity nose, but this is basically a hop bomb that's a bit unbalanced. The smell is nice, but I've inhaled a lot better DIPA's from Other Half.
Tastes sweet and fruity up front with the sharp citrus hops and some floral hops leading the charge. As it washes down I got a coating of the tropical fruits which includes grapefruit, orange juice, apricot, pineapple, browning pear, tart green apple, peach and then earthy notes. The next wave was fresh cut grass, tea leaf, dry floral hops, zesty piney hops, honey, caramel and wheat bread toast with a ton of margarine on top. Booze and some minor heat shows up at the end, which is to be expected for a triple IPA clocking in at 10.5% ABV. The hops keep charging like WWI armies out of the trenches.
Mouthfeel is thick and juice-like, in a way where I'd expect pulp or hop leaf particles floating around. The bitterness is high, the carbonation is average to low and it ends semi-dry with a lot of hoppy sweetness and only minor booze for such a big beer. It's wasn't smooth per se, but it was easier to drink than I expected.
Overall it's a very tasty triple IPA that is pungent and aggressive in the hoppiest ways possible. It was good, especially for a beer this strong, but I preferred some of their other high ABV beers over this like the masterful 3rd Anniversary DIPA or Green Diamonds. 1,907 charactersCHickman, Mar 30, 2017

4/4/4.5/4.5/4.5
Muddy yellow-brown. Darkly unfiltered. 
Light scents with garlic, pineapple, and lemon.
Big, sweet, and hugely hoppy without being particularly bitter. Massive fruit, sweet lemon, and a dry, oppressive, IBU-breaking finish. My kinda beer. 
Never sticky. Scarily drinkable. 
Not my favorite Other Half, but a delightful beer! 398 charactersAgentMunky, Mar 06, 2017

Deep gold color and mostly clear with a slight haze to it. A fluffy white head that sticks around for a while. The aroma jumps out at you with big tropical fruit notes, mostly pineapple and mango, and pine. The flavor is all hops, as expected, but there is the slightest bit of malt sweetness trying its hardest to balance things out. The alcohol is actually pretty well hidden given its strength, but definitely creeps up on you as you continue to sip. Medium-full bodied. Dry, bitter finish. This is a big beer that manages to show restraint. Impressive, yet a little too one note to enter the upper echelon of IPAs.
On a side note, the "Triple IPA" description is a little silly. There are standard strength IPAs and then there are Imperial IPAs. At 10.5% ABV, this would be an Imperial. Thanks for my friend's cousin, Joel, for leaving me the can to take home after a Red Bulls tailgate. 913 charactersJacobob10, Nov 11, 2016

2.93/5  rDev -33.6%look: 3 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.75 |  overall: 2.7512oz/$7 USD on-draught @ the brewery taproom. Due to the crowded cramped space, my notes have to be brief.
Rindy hop bitterness and sticky resins guide the hop character of this heavy brew. No delicate floral notes, subtle Mosaic blueberry, or juicy citrus here - just loud bold hops (though the Amarillo resinous flavour is nice). 
Mouthfeel is sappy, sticky, and suffers from alcohol warmth. Overcarbonated and coating, with a heavy hefty full-bodied presence on the palate.
Drinkability is what you'd expect in a 10.50% ABV imperial IPA (which is to say not high). I'd prefer a more balanced expression of the style; this is more in the Stone/Green Flash camp of IPAs, targeting big bold hop flavours, extreme bitterness, and high alcohol for high alcohol's sake, eschewing balance, subtlety, and depth of flavour. This is currently Other Half's only beer in the Top 250; I honestly wouldn't buy another.

I could session this. 323 charactersGreywulfken, Sep 30, 2016

It looks and smells great, tons of hops obviously.  My biggest critique of this one is it's ABV.  It smells and tastes boozy as hell and to me is distracting from the hops.  I very much preferred the Small Green Everything we had the previous week, and to me it was a much better expression of the hops and just more palatable in general. 438 charactersWayne17, Sep 28, 2016

3.83/5  rDev -13.2%look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Fairly clear amber with an off white finger of dense foam dying to a thin film and ring.
I'm smelling pink starburst, faint pine, orange jelly slices, cologne, a little cannabis, and oddly, the ghost of an oaked sour.
Tangy pine hits up front in taste, with tangerine and grapefruirt rind. A little graham and booze comes forward only as it gets close to room temp.
Chewy, dry feel. A very intriguing and tasty mix of old and new. Reminds me, if only a little bit, of Permanent Funeral. 489 charactersSabtos, Sep 25, 2016

4.04/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4A- The all green tallboy pours into a snifter with a medium golden yellow hue with quite a haze to it. The crown on the brew is white with a thick and frothy consistency rising up to over a half inch. Good retention and the wide belt at the edges drops a few large webs of lace.
S- Not boozy but you can instantly tell that this is a heavy, massive IPA as the malt base is right there alongside the hops with that classic caramel found in most 9%+ hoppy brews; it adds a candied element to the fruity hops. Hops compete impressively with those grains giving off a wave of fresh notes of mango, stone fruits, tangerine, grapefruit,  dried pineapple, melon and herbs.
T- The booze that was not present in the aroma makes a bit of an apperance here combining with the pithy bitterness to give the beer a true bite on the palate. The fresh, dank and fruity hops give off bitter ruby red grapefruit, melon, mango, papaya, orange, tangerine, floral and herbal notes that can't quite push the booze aside. A bit of a sweetness in the base as well as cereal grains and bread.
MF- Thick and oily moderately heavy body with a slight foamy, frothy texture. Slick with a medium carbonation. Ends warm with a very sharp bitterness.
Ascending past 10% in IPA is a dangerous game. This is one of the better ones I can remember but still not a truly great beer by any means as booze and caramel interferes with the hops especially in the flavor. Fresh hops beat out many other top tier ABV IPAs but still not one of the best. 1,513 characterscbutova, Sep 20, 2016

A: Bright orange color, almost clear with a very thin white uniform head with solid retention. Very light lacing in the glass.
T: Big hoppy flavors of citrus, grapefruit and berries. The beer has a clean light malt presence with a low hop bitterness through the finish. M: Medium-full bodied with moderate carbonation. The beer is smooth, but there is still some alcoholic warmth though not hot. O: Solid; strong (no pun intended) take on a triple IPA. The beer has a great hoppy aroma and flavor. However, the beer isn’t overly danky, nor quite as juicy and smooth as other IPA offerings. 729 charactersPhil-Fresh, Aug 18, 2016

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a slightly hazy orange yellow color with some clarity and vision of tiny bubbles coming up through the glass.  Spotty lacing down the glass as the beer was drank the beer was drank.
Smell:  Tropical, stone fruit, earthy, spicy, lemon, grassy, resiny pine, herbal, toasted, biscuity, caramel, and warm warm alcohol.
Taste:  Really don't know where to start.  Total hope bomb and nice malt bill to back things up.  A little chewy, medium bitterness, some sweetness from the malt that was expected being the beer is 10.5%,  and warming alcohol.
Mouthfeel:  Medium to full bodied, warm warm alcohol, a little chewy, and light tingly bitterness.  
Overall:  Thought I reviewed this beer.  The last beer of the two 4 packs and happy to have reviewed this beer now.  Just wish I had a few more.  Road trip to Brooklyn anyone? 942 charactersFlounder57, Jun 18, 2016

A: I get a bit of a vegetal note upfront oniony-garlicky type.. Tons of mango pineapple slight grapefruit a bunch of pungent "dank" pine notes at the end. Also malty sweet booze.
T: Similar to smell a bunch of mango and pineapple. Then resinous pine with a deep malt all the way through.
F: Nice and thick coats your whole mouth in bitter pine..tho a bit more dry than juicy IMO..Very drinkable for the abv. Maybe too drinkable!(shakes can to get every last drop...)

Piney, tropical fruits, of course some malt to hold it together.
For a beer that's 10.5% it's very drinkable and this hides the alcohol very well.
This is a damn good beer, definitely one for a relaxing drinking session, one (or two) and done.
Other Half is killing the IPA game.

L. Copper in color with pretty much full haze. Thick 2 finger head with sticky lacing. 
S. Mix of line and hops, with citrus and a hint of malty sweetness. 
T. Lots going on but in a good way. Very complex with the same flavors that were on the nose. Very surprised because it's not hot at all and at 10.5% I was expecting some heat. Loving the tropical notes, lots of citrus and orange too. Really nice finish with minor bitterness but a lot of fruit flavors that linger. 
F. Medium mouthfeel with nice average carbonation. 577 charactersDopen993, Mar 22, 2016

4.04/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Pours a hazy dark amber color with a small off-white head. Decent retention and lacing on this one. 
The aroma is boozy as all hell, with the sweet caramel malts hiding underneath. The piney, dank hops make their appearance known at the very end. 
The flavor is very malt forward. There's caramel, and bread, as well as a bit of dry grain. The extreme bitterness of the hops is there at the back end once again, fighting their way through the boozy, malty sweetness. Very piney and resinous. 
The feel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Alcohol is definitely present and burns just a bit at the end of each sip. A bit sticky but relatively smooth and extremely dry. 
Overall, a good beer that I wouldn't say disappointed me necessarily, it just wasn't at all what I was expecting. The malt is just as prevalent as the hops, and the hoppy flavors and aromas that do come through are extremely resinous and bitter. 925 charactersScaryEd, Mar 03, 2016

Smell is dank, pine, hops, citrus, mango, and malt.
Taste is malt and mild sweetness up front, citrus, and a hop bomb at the end.
Mouthful is medium to light with medium carbonation and a super hoppy finish mixes with some alcohol warming.
Overall an interesting IPA that isnt balanced, strength in the front and back but enenjoyable nonetheless. 403 charactersSlack, Feb 13, 2016

3.25 A:  Mildly hazed medium orange with a hint of brown color.  About one finger of frothy/creamy off-white head.  Retention is perhaps a touch below average for the style and a half finger ring of lacing is left.
4.5 S:  Good mix of tropical fruits, pine, floral, and grassy hops.  The citra offers mango, mandarin orange, and papaya.  Mild caramel maltiness, noticeable but manageable booziness, but clean overall.  The nose grows in potency as you sip it and It warms.  Pretty great.
4.0 T:  The taste is good, but it doesn't match the vibrancy of the nose.  Mild-moderate bitterness.  Tropical fruits mentioned above but not as in your face.  Secondarily mix of pine, floral, grassiness.  Decently boozy, but not excessive.  Caramel maltiness but otherwise smooth.
3.75 M:  Medium body.  Good moderate carbonation.  Moderately creamy with a light bitter aftertaste.
4.0 D:  Great beer, but maybe not all it's hyped up to be. 969 charactersDavoleBomb, Jan 13, 2016

It has the Big IPA look: hazy golden-orange color with a 1F white head. Big bubbles, no sediment.
Fresh citrus hop aroma right as I opened the can. In the glass were more citrus and tropical fruit aromas. Some sweet boozy malt. Strong, not necessarily pleasantly so.
Bitter tropical fruit hop taste. Juicy fruit, some alcohol.
It's syrupy with hop bitterness and alcohol. It starts malty sweet and finishes dry. The alcohol lingers harshly.
The sweets and alcohol win out, sadly. 523 charactersNiceTaps, Dec 30, 2015

4.44/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked this up recently at Other Half's offering on a Saturday, never having this before. I heard this this was this best beer that was readily available and without a doubt, that turned out to be the case. Most of their beers are IPA's stylistically and this was the one that stood out head and shoulders above the rest, offering a ton of hops and taste from start to finish!
Great pour here, as this beer had a wonderful dark bronze hue with a frothy had and lots of soapy lacing left to it once I gave it a sip. Good pine and grassy notes to the nose with even more to the taste, as the brightness of this really shone through. Sticky resin, tropical resin, dank weed, and tangerine were all here followed by a sticky sweetness and a very subtle earthiness. Oily, somewhat slick, and recessed in alcoholic content, this was a beer that straddled the line perfectly while offering a full range of fresh, vibrant flavor; while never packing a full and overly bitter punch!
Yes, this was strong but having a Stout that was over 10% would not feel like this did. I almost expected there to be a bit of pulp at the bottom of my point glass given how well the citrus juiciness was here, but alas, that was not to be the case. Other Half nailed it with this one, as the best aspects of the guava, papaya, and orange fruits were present here without the puckering aspects of this. Just enough caramel malt and crystalline sweetness here to balance those notes out and give the right amount of body to this, elevating this beer to near-exalted status. Easily Other Half's best periodic offering and worth standing in line for - this is on part with SingleCut's top beers as the reason why New York City is making noise nationally when it comes to must-have brews. Get this if you want to treat you taste buds! 1,805 charactersJerzDevl2000, Dec 11, 2015

4.62/5  rDev +4.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a can into a tulip glass. Can was purchased fresh from the brewery 1 day earlier. 
Smell was fruity but dry...poured an amber color darker than I would have expected. Taste and mouthfeel reminded me more of a 7-8% mid-IPA than a 10.5% Triple..it was super drinkable until it warmed up a bit, at which point the hops detensified and gained a bit of bite. 
I preferred Baby Diamonds to this one, but for a Triple IPA this is as drinkable as they come! 462 charactersKBrady, Dec 07, 2015

Possible that it was made more difficult by also having some spicy food at the same time -- probably intensified it. Regardless, the nose was quite good, was the part of the overload of hops that I really enjoyed. The mouthfeel was great as well - not overly carbonated and had a nice hit for a triple. Enjoyed this one, but will not seek it out again in the future unless in NY. 511 charactersthorkelson, Nov 30, 2015

Bright golden color with a nice white head
The aroma of this was was simply awesome - Citrus, Hops, Tropical Fruit. This is a perfectly balanced beer. HOPS HOPS and more HOPS 
IMO for being a triple IPA the bitterness wasn't overbearing, It was very easy to drink.
I throughly enjoyed drinking this beer and would love to get a 4 pack of it next time. 421 charactersGregA135, Nov 18, 2015

L - Great look for an IPA. Somewhere between a vibrant gold and warm amber. Thick and opaque when brought to light. You know this baby's been hopped. 
S - A strong punch of pine -- like rubbing freshly fallen needles in your hands and taking a whiff. A touch of ripe fruit and citrus follows suit ending with just a hint of malt. There's a sweetness that plays the harmony to the piney chorus.
T -  The pine hits immediately with a whisper of booze. With 10.5% under the hood, I'm impressed with how smoothly the alcohol is expressed. A kiss of iciness lingers on the tongue, those likening the sensation to menthol are not wrong. There's a dryness from the middle to end that shows shades of citrus and hops. This is something special.
F - Starts sharply with an immediate shift to smooth and warm. Nothing abrasive, really a profound body.
O - A winner, unreasonably sessionable for a TIPA. If you can get your hands on this one, do it. Bravo to Other Half for catering to the hop enthusiast. 1,137 charactersBoogieBoozer, Nov 14, 2015

4.65/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5L - Nice looking beer! Dark for an IPA but I guess that's why they call it a TIPA! Slow, evervescing bubbles give way to a dangerous looking brew. 
A - Pine! A whole forest! Dare I say it... green? Fresh, minty, pungent grassy hops give way to a dank malty backbone. Looking forward to that first sip. 
T -  Whoa. Huge pine blast up front. Tropical and wet. Dries out quickly and leaves a cooling minty-type feeling in your mouth. Almost menthol-like. Very unique and something I haven't seen before in a beer. The alcohol peeks through at the end as the cloying boozy bitterness creeps in. Up until that point it's like taking a deep breath in the middle of a quiet, frozen forest, sunshine gleaming sadly over the icy snow.
F - Soft and subtle. Reminds me of Trillium. Smooth and attempts to balance this wild beer. 
O - Quite the ride. Lots of imagery and lots of flavor. A little too easy drinking for 10%. 914 charactersagreenman19, Nov 10, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Pour: On draft at The Jeffery in NYC. Poured into a tulip glass. Appearance: Light gold in color with a wee bit of haze. Medium white head with a nice bit a lacing on the sides of the glass. Aroma: Big bold hoppy notes. Heavy and juicy citrus...grapefruit aroma. Earthy and grassy notes are detected as well. Taste: Fat and juicy. Lots of big hop tastes. A considerable amount of funky notes as well...onion? Aftertaste: Bits of alcohol warmth on the back end (which is consistent with the ABV (10.5%)), cuts through the heavy hops and bold citrus. Overall: Big bold stunner. Liked it and would return. Very good. 4.3 out of 5. 627 charactersEmersonio, Nov 08, 2015

4.18/5  rDev -5.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Description: Bright, golden color with a white head and not much lacing.  Smell is pine, orange and mango with a slight bitterness.  The taste is overwhelmingly hoppy and bitter with very little of the citrus fruit that it smelled like.  A bit of dank, onion "funk" in the taste.  Lightly carbonated and smooth for an IPA.
Suggested food pairing: A sharp, white cheddar cheese

Ideal time to drink this beer: Happy hour?  Tapas?  Charcuterie? This beer has so much flavor that you need to balance it out with some food.  Little plates of spicy food, sharp cheese and other flavorful bites seems appropriate.  Plus, since this is a beer from Brooklyn combining it with tapas or charcuterie will earn you major hipster points.
Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I may or may not drink it again)  NOBODY MOVE!  There's a BOMB in the room...a HOP-BOMB!  Get it?  Hahahahahahaha!  Not surprising as the can advertises this as a triple IPA, but it is extremely hop forward.  That being so, if you like to load up on hops this is for you.  If not, run away screaming.  I couldn't drink a lot of this given the intensity of the flavor, but it wasn't bad, especially if you're in the mood for something hoppy. 1,266 charactersSHDoyle, Nov 08, 2015

4.48/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a can into a tulip glass, this was canned on 9/25/15, reviewing on 11/1/15. I've had a few that were more fresh, but I wanted it to mellow out a bit for the review. Pours a bright orange, hazy but plenty of light comes through.  White ring of bubbles but no lacing really. Aroma is tropical fruits and citrus, a little pine. Taste is fantastic, I'm glad I let it mellow a little, it was almost too dank of a hop bomb when I drank the others, but it was still delicious then. It's still a hop bomb,  mostly reminded of grapefruit, some fresh squeezed orange juice, orange rind, a slight hint of melon. This triple IPA is a bit boozy, warms me up a little. Even after a month,  it still tastes a bit like you're chewing ok hop pelets, but not as much as when it was canned. This is a total hop bomb. 809 charactersJordonHoltzman, Nov 02, 2015

Awesome smell that's sweet like candied grapefruit with loads of juicy tropical hops and dank herbal onion. Also a good bit of booze.  Taste follows with more dank earthy onion, resin and touch of pine.  Feel is spot on, kind of thick and oily like the other great east coast doubles.  This is a HUGE double.  It is pretty boozy and don't think it hides it at all but it does work with the malt sweetness. 482 charactersRoland7792, Oct 30, 2015
4.68/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Appearance - There isn't too much to say in terms of how this beer looks. It is mostly hazy but has a great sunburst orange color. An off-white head quickly builds and falls before haphazardly sticking to the glass.
Aroma - Right from the start, the aroma kicks you in the face. The hops are pungent and bold to the point where you can almost taste the tropical fruits. Pineapple, guava, grapefruit, and pine bombard the senses and everything just screams 'fresh'. There's a bit of trailing sweetness but only a touch. 
Taste - The flavor is all hop, all the time. There's a good amount of bitterness to this beer, but the hops do a great job of balancing that with a strong fruit note. As in the nose, the tropical notes are the best with a slight honey-like sweetness in the finish. The hops have a wet sort of edge to them that lends a sticky quality that meshes well with the hop resins. 
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is fairly heavy without a ton of carbonation. As mentioned in the taste, the hops weigh on the palate to really give this beer some heft.
Closing Arguments - Another awesome IPA from Other Half. In terms of similarities, this draws comparisons to the heavy-hitters coming out of the greater Vermont area. This is an exercise in hop expertise and I am looking forward to my other can even more now. 1,320 charactersnhindian, Oct 30, 2015

The taste is even better. Tons of mango, papaya, and guava. In your face amounts of pine come in and bring you to a nice high level bitter finish. The sweet malts really support the hops here and balance this just about right for me. The feel has a nice coating mouthfeel, with a medium to light carbonation. Just a tinge of alcohol can be noticed. 453 charactersDustin_Sallitt, Oct 28, 2015

Pours a burnt orange color with a very dense white head about 1" thick. Fairly still and laces nicely. First sniff is pretty simcoe forward. You can smell a pretty hefty biscuit malt base. A little sweet smelling at the end. First sip is pretty potent. Hard to pinpont any specific hop notes over the booze. Kinda resinous. A little piney. Boozy, bordering on hot at the end. Body is thick and hot. A total sipper. Low carb. Alcohol, thick, booze, heat, more booze. Did I mention this beer is boozy? Finishes quite dry...the mouthfeel's only saving grace.
I can't say I'm enjoying this as I'm drinking it. It's a fairly well made beer for what it is but I can't get past the heat. The hop profile isn't terribly exciting either as it's overshadowed by the heat and malt base. 884 charactersPSU_Mike, Oct 08, 2015

Look is dark gold and hazy. Head is frothy and full. 
Tropical citrus aromas of citra and mosaic come through slight rich earthy vanilla of motueka. 
Taste is incredibly full with spicy hop notes of pine with distinct citrus notes. 
Wow. Thats all I can say. Is this really 10.5%!!!? 333 charactersEamonn-Cummings3, Sep 11, 2015

Smell: Dank and tropical. Peach, tangerine, and weed. Solid blast of grapefruit juice and skin. Super juicy flesh. Solidly floral as well. Malt body offers up some slightly caramelized and bready malts with a solid caramelized sweetness. A touch of peppery hop spice as well. Hints of alcohol through the back. A little bit of papaya. Candied tropical fruit. Ever so slightly woody. Lingering green tree branch with some pine sap as well.
Taste: Weed and pine right up front. Malts are nicely bready with some solid carmelized malt sweetness. A touch of caramel. Some fresh white bread crust, slightly toasted. Hops run a wide range, throwing a ton of tropical fruit. Mango, nectarine, and peach in abundance. Solid bitterness of pine sap, green tree, branch, and citrus pith. Grapefruit juice and rind. Solidly floral with some soft spice from both the hops and alcohol. Slight push of booze through the back of everything. Attempts at balance, but the hop profile ends up dominating a touch.
Mouthfeel: Slightly slick and oily on the initial sip. Medium body with a moderate carbonation. Slightly dry on the finish. Ever so slightly crisp.
Overall: Feeling the urge to make it rain.
This is a true gem. The hop profile is on point and is nicely balanced by the malt. Solid all around and well worth tracking down. 1,513 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Sep 06, 2015

No head, murky carrot orange color.  
Nose lots of fruit, candied apricot little tangerine, orange pith, mango, papaya, guava, citrus pith, melon rind, Dragon fruit even, but also a grassy pine sap earthy forest floor note as the mosaic somehow still comes through, candied papaya, light sweet malt. 
Taste brings hops again, big pith and rind, musty dank resin with more pine sap forest floor, into big tropical fruit, musty passion fruit and guava, tangerine, candy stone fruit, papaya, big papaya and melon rind, sweet caramel and candy malt, hint of booze warmth, especially on the finish, candied tropical fruit, papaya and melon lingering with little spicy hop bitterness earthy too. 
Mouth is med bod, creamy flesh like I'm biting into a papaya, little booze, decent carb. 
Overall mixed, tons of great tropical fruit, so much papaya, but the mosaic grassy pine sap ruins it a bit. 922 charactersjlindros, Sep 05, 2015

Aroma is fresh cut grass, tangerines, passion fruit, and pineapple all drenched in resinous pine sap. Taste is more pine sap and grass. Resinous. Dank. The fruit is almost overwhelmed, but sweet citrus and passion fruit are present leaving behind a bitter aftertaste of grapefruit pith. Overall, the flavor is more dank than bitter. As it warms, a caramel sweetness develops. The mouth feel is full bodied. It does have a dry finish, but this is still tough to drink. The dank, grassy aroma and flavor make this a unique experience. Its worth trading for. 622 charactersdanh53, Aug 29, 2015

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a clearish amber gold hue with a thin head that fades quickly. 
S - Aromas of mango, passionfruit, tangerine, melon, citrus, pine, pine sap. Super fruity and juicy. Nice dankness too. 
T - Taste is similar to the nose. Lots of pine sap. Nice tropical notes, absolutely loads of passionfruit. The citrus is pleasant, however, there is a hot finish from the alcohol. 
M - Mouthfeel is a bit hot on the finish, however, it's really juicy and not sticky. 
O - Overall this beer, while good really didn't live up to the expectations. Lots of great things going on, however, the dank pine sap is really not my scene.  Good, just too much dankness.

4.49/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Look:  Dark orange body  with a white foamy head that easily slips from the sides of the tulip glass it has been poured into.  The body is lighter than Hop Showers, solid, and even colored orange compared to some of their other IPAs.
Smell:  Candied fruit and citrus aroma up front.  Some watered down orange juice smell.  Sharp hop smells linger.  I could almost smell some rubbing alcohol.  That would actually be interesting.  I have not drank rubbing alcohol since I was in alcohol rehab in the military.     
Taste:  BOOM!  BAM!  SMACK!  This has a good balanced taste, with gentle sweetness, that does not overwhelm your taste buds.  Where's the alcohol?    
Feel:  Thick and heavy in the chomper.  
Overall - Over the past few days, from Other Half, I have had Galaxy IPA, Nelson, Green Diamonds, and Hop Showers.  I am glad I saved the best for last.  This one is a hit with me.  This is high octane...well, it should be if it is supposed to be a triple.  This is a beer to seek out.  A contender in the IPA bracket. 1,025 charactersmabermud, Aug 15, 2015

This one pours a nice hazy and bright dark orange, with a small head, and a lot of lacing.
Smells just so pungent, bright and awesome, a veritable slew of citrusy hop goodness- mango and peach, grapefruit and tangerine, just so much. I get some pine as well.
They really just nailed this one- it's possibly the best IPA made in  New York State. There is some malt character, it adds a small amount of sweetness and enough heft behind the hops. But all in all- it's still a story of massive juicy hops here. This manages to pack a ton of the aforementioned fruity hops flavors, without getting too sweet. There's also not a single taste of alcohol in this one- how is that even possible? This is one dangerous beer.
This has a very juicy and full mouthfeel, with a pretty thick and slightly creamy body, and a moderate level of carbonation.
This is an absolutely wonderful beer, a tremendous joy to drink. 969 charactersGreesyFizeek, Aug 10, 2015

4.42/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Appearance - The beer poured a golden copper color with a bright white head.
Smell - The nose might be best described as candied grass.
Taste - My first impressions is spicy grass. Other notes include orange, tea, and biscuity malts. All of the notes going on here work well together. There is a slightly warmish aftertaste with notes of orange and spice.
Mouthfeel - There is a smooth clinginess to the mouthfeel. The spice really sticks around.
Overall - Triple IPA is not an official style. That said, this is not the most heavy imperial IPA. It is delicious. 566 charactersJohnnyHopps, Aug 07, 2015

I've had a lot of good ones(never had PtY), but one has never blown me away until AGE.    This is an amazing beer in every way.    It's high ABV, but you don't taste it.   It pours less cloudy than any other OH beer I've had.   The nose is very strong- pine, grass, dank.    The taste is incredible, a feast for the palate.   All of the intense flavors from the nose combine to provide one of the best IPA experiences I've ever had.   Could not recommend higher.   
A side note- the first can I had I poured into a glass and it was fantastic.   Second can I drank directly from the can and it was a revelation. 671 characterstmbgnicu, Aug 05, 2015

No cloying here; just surprisingly smooth and drinkable triple IPA.  You can't hide the alcohol completely, but I found myself downing this much quicker that I'd normally approach a beer like this.  Definitely prefer this hands down side-by-side with their Green Diamonds DIPA.  AGE definitely lives up to the hype, and I will be seeking it out far more often moving forward. 470 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Jul 06, 2015

Long alcohol finish. It’s tasty, but absurdly boozy and heavy. 382 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 22, 2015

A: Pours a medium pale color with a razor thin bright white head.  Persistent collar.  
S: Pungent, expansive hop aroma of banana, mango, along with a deep boozy malt (bordering on what you’d get from a barleywine), some floral and piney notes.
T: Malt-forward with mild sweetness, crystal malt, pine, finishing with a high bitterness that is balanced by the body and sweetness.  
M: Full bodied with medium carbonation.  Slight alcohol burn.
O: Big, tasty triple IPA.  This is nearing the point of an American Barleywine with high bitterness and malt-forwardness. 611 characterspmarlowe, Jun 16, 2015

A: Pours an unfiltered, hazy golden honey with a finger and a half of dusty light beige head. Fades to a high collar and barely-there cap.
S: Piney and tropical. Heavy mango, pineapple, and peach. Maybe some passion fruit as well? A very exotic aroma... big, heavy, stank bomb without smelling artificial.
T: Chewy, dank, a heavy bite of resin that slowly eases up as you progress. A touch boozy, but it is masked by waves of hoppy citrus zest and pallets of malt to keep things balanced. Mango/Tangerine/Pine/Malt
M: Silky. Consistent whether cold or warm. Alcohol makes its presence known during a very drying finish. Smooth, filling, warming.
O: Yahtzee! AGE exceeded my expectations, and entrenched OH as my top local brewery. A big, bold, unique DIPA (triple... whatever) that is an absolute treat. Seriously, this is a very well made beer... one of the few 10%+ DIPA that is worth seeking out. 970 charactersuntitledeuphoria, Jun 14, 2015

3.93/5  rDev -10.9%look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Thanks to mrbubbler for sharing this one at his tasting.
Pours a hazy golden-orange with a foamy beige head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace drip into the remaining beer on the drink down. Smell is of citrus fruit, citrus zest, honey, and tropical fruit aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest, grapefruit juice, and tropical fruit flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and sticky mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with solid citrus forward hop aspects all around.
Serving type: can. 656 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jun 02, 2015

A: Red orange with a haze, white creamy head. .
S: Has a ton of aroma, citrus and pine with tropical notes, each whiff brings new scents.  Tropical comes on more strongly as it warms.
T: Deep and resinous, dank hop blasts come through balanced and bright.  Citrus, tropical, pine, peach.
M: Smooth and satisfying, impressive.
O: Was one of my top tastings at the 2015 ACBF.  Can't wait to get more.  Have some on the way from sis-in-law in Brooklyn.  Met the hype IMO 595 charactersjhavs, Jun 01, 2015

4.7/5  rDev +6.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75This beer pours a hazy golden orange with a one finger, loose off white head that dissipates very quickly and leaves some spotted lacing. Smell is complex. Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, orange, dank green earthiness, sweet and bready malts and a touch of booze are all there. Taste is the same. A solid malt presence (expected for 10.5% abv) but the hops are most definitely the star of the show. A little bite on the back end from the alcohol. Feel is full side of medium, slick and resinous on the finish. Strong but in no way harsh. Overall an excellent beer. Really think this beer hits it's prime around the 3 week mark. The hop flavors are always incredible, but it seems like the boozy bite has pretty much dissipated. 725 charactersCNoj012, May 31, 2015

S: When cold, piney and resinous, as expected, comes out.  As it warms the tropical fruits really burst out of the glass.  Papaya, Mango, touches of peach?
T: Thick, resiny taste just bites down on your tongue.  The Mosaic is strong here, but it is driven by something fierce and dank.  The bitterness wasn't so much a factor as just sheer mouth weight of the hops.  I felt it lighten up and get more tropical and fruity as the beer warmed.  ABV is disguised, shocked to see 10.5%.
M: I found it to be silky smooth from cold to warm.  Reminiscent of other epic DIPAs, IIPAs, I've had.  A characteristic missing in the wannabe-P-A-s.
O: I really have to stop drinking these beers, it ruins the field for me!  Dunno what the lower end reviews have beef with.  This is a danky, resinous, uppercut to your face beer that I believe, in all seriousness, I would be happy to drink for life.  Fresh Dinner still tops it for me, but this is one of the bees knees!! 1,031 charactersBeern1ck, May 31, 2015

L - slightly hazy copper body, thick creamy head fades only slowly
S - lime, tropical fruits, caramel malt, spicy, dank
T - despite the smell it's more pith and pine focused, with a noticeable malt presence, pretty dry throughout, long bitter finish
F - super creamy and resinous, some alcohol burn
O -  an enjoyable beer, but for me it's too boozy for what I get out of it in terms of hop aroma 465 characterscfalls, May 24, 2015

Aroma is off the charts and out of bounds, it's a tropical onslaught.  Taste brings waves of flavor, citrus pulp and pith, tangerine, orange, mango, papaya, and grapefruit toward the finish.  Big waves of hop flavor and a clean bitterness.  Medium body, touch boozy and dry on the finish.  This is a top tier DIPA for sure and one that I need to seek out again. 428 charactersHopBomb515, May 22, 2015

A- nice foggy gold w small white head.
S-  tropical fruits.  Papaya, guava, pineapple.  Not much pine or resin going on.
T-  follows nose.  Lots of tropical and citrus fruits with very little malt presence.  An unbelievably smooth brew for the ABV.  I defiantly thought it'd have a bite but not at all.
M-  perfect smoothness and drinkability.
O-  hard to find anything wrong here.  A home run once again by OH.  Keep them coming please. 516 charactersEveningCordial, May 15, 2015

The aroma hits of oranges, grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, mango, pineapple, lots of Mosaic and dank Mosaic on the back. Hops dominate as the malt is sweet, but takes a backseat.
The flavor hits up front of juicy orange, tangerine, some mango and sweet tropical. Breadiness hits in the middle, but then the middle hits of a big dank note, some herbaceous, a lingering stiff aftertaste of that and bittering, along with a touch of alcohol.
The beer drinks towards 9%, but there is a warming as the beer goes down.
One of the best TIPAs out there, but definitely not the best that Other Half has to offer. 662 charactersdar482, May 12, 2015

An absolutely incredible beer. It is not often that I am floored by a brew, but AGE was absolutely fantastic. It seems that most IPAs these days are heavily tilted in either the bitter or the juicy direction, and what AGE is more than anything else is a picture of perfect balance between these two directions. So much pine and resin in the pungent nose, along with melon and tropical fruit, followed up by one of he creamiest, crispest and most flavorful ales I've had. I would put nearly equal with Heady Topper, if not equal. I loved it and will be coming back for more as often as I can. 640 charactersTheElectricOne, May 06, 2015

a - brew pours a semi transparent orange.  deep and rich color with a classic frothy ipa head.  lines of lace coated the glass where the beer one was as i sipped it down.
s - yum. fresh resinous dripping dank citric hop.  smells fantastic...like an Iipa aught to.  super appetizing and inviting.  dripping with gooey hoppy goodness.
t/m/o - in a word...homerun.  other half is really making NY proud in the IPA category cranking out several varieties of world class ipas.  super quenching and the abv is invisible in the taste, but its warming power will take you over before the glass is done.  all that tropical fruit in the nose is just as gooey and ripe in the taste.  like biting into a resinous peak riped hop.  super juicy.  thank you other half for giving NY some IPAs that can hang with the big boys of the west coast.  this is worth putting some effort into getting if you are a fan of great ipas/iipas 1,084 characterscosmicevan, Apr 26, 2015

Aroma is rich with loads of tropical fruit, peach, pine, vinous hops, and some sweet caramel malt backbone.
The flavor matches the aroma, with tropical fruit, peach, and pine dominating the palate. The caramel malt backbone makes you aware that this is pretty high gravity, and if that didn't convince you there is definitely a pretty strong alcohol presence.
The mouth feel is relatively thick for an IPA, even if it is imperial, but that's to be expected at 10.5%. Moderate carbonation, an alcohol bite, and a strong dry bitterness on the finish.
This is one of the best "triple" IPAs out there! Definitely not for the faint of heart as it's very in your face and abrasive, but delicious none the less! 787 charactersSadMachine, Mar 24, 2015

4.77/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours hazy gold.  Smells like a goddamn rainbow, an A+ hop profile combining, as the name suggests, just about verdant variety of hops you can think of: there's the mango and citrus nodes of typical contemporary IIPAs, but these are balanced against more classic green flavors like grass, pine, and pot.  It sounds like a mess, and by all rights it should be, but they fucking nailed it.
Tastes nearly as good as it smells.  First sip is a bit overwhelming, but it smooths out beautifully.  Citra and Amarillo dominate, with lush tropical fruit nodes bounces against marijuana and pine .  The finish is light and yeasty, and the malt never really asserts itself because it doesn't need to, the hops profile balances itself just fine. 
All Green Everything is so good that I have to break my long-standing policy of not rating beers based on festival pours.  It was easily the star of the show at the 2015 Extreme Beer fest, and I hope to god that Other Half starts distributing out here. 989 charactersmynie, Mar 22, 2015

Aroma is a viscious hop bomb but seemingly brewed with new age hops. Dank and tropical. Really pungent hoppiness and boy is it enticing. Tropical hop perfume. I dive into my sample and am absolutely bombarded by tropical hoppiness. Mango, papaya, pineapple, citrus medley and plenty of pine. These hops are definitely new varietals. Pale malt lends to the juiciness of the hops. Finishes dry and very bitter. Fuller bodied. One of the best beers I had at EBF. Good lord what a hop bomb. Very legit. 555 charactersVelvetExtract, Mar 22, 2015

You only need to know one thing to understand why: motueka. The New Zealand hop that packs the most luscious and juicy grapefruit flavor you have ever experienced. Other Side signed their hop contracts two years before they even started brewing which is the reason they have access to this rare, expensive,  and mind blowing hop. If you are attending EBF2015 and you don't try this beer you are missing out on something magical. Gold star for Other Side for bringing this amazing beer. 571 charactersNinjaJesus, Mar 21, 2015

7/27 can consumed on 8/7. 
Just like Heady, drink this from the can. If OH dialed the booze back a little bit this would be dangerously close to Heady. I still prefer Heady by far but this is an excellent IPA that's much easier to obtain. 292 charactersBltByKrmn, Dec 13, 2014

Pours a 1 finger foamy white head with good retention. Beer is a slightly-cloudy bronze. Lacing is spotty, stringy and sparse with solid cling. Oily legs. Nice looking brew.
Nose is slightly soapy. Notes of pine, papaya, starfruit, mango, citrus and other tropical fruit. A nice cane sugar dank hop bitterness is pervasive. Really aromatic and fantastically enticing. 
Opens sweet mango, papaya, cane sugar, and citrus. Sweet with a big tropical fruit malt backbone. A light hop bitterness provides an excellent balance. Ends slightly resiny, sappy and sweet. Same aftertaste. Very impressive. 
Medium bodied with ample carbonation. Smooth and lively in the mouth and goes down crisp, refreshing and super drinkable for the ABV. Finishes messy with a dry aftertaste. Excellent. 
This is hands down, one of the top 10 beers I've had in the style. That it's made by a brewery in New York is even more impressive. By far the best thing I've had that's made in New York. Check these guys out! If only for AGE! 1,095 charactersSpeedwayJim, Oct 11, 2014

4.81/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75On tap at the tap room. Beer only a couple of days old. This is one of the best smelling beers I have ever had, amazing smell. Great taste and at 10.5 ABV there is no taste of alcohol at all. Unlike some of the other really big TIPAs, this is not syrupy.
As good as it gets, Other Half is killing it. 301 charactersjrnyc, Jun 19, 2014

4.29/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.2516 ounce can poured into an oversized Belgian tulip. 
Quite an impressive foamy, frothy pale white head forms from the pour. Persists for quite some time, in fact allowing me to write these notes as it slowly recedes. Lace scatters about in little islets shapes. The body is a hazy, cloudy copper color with a blonde hue to it. 4.5
Big old bursts of fruit pop out on the nose. Mango, pineapple, orange and the likes, but a smooth and sweet malt aroma shows up with a second pass of the nose. There are piney notes and some of that cat piss smell too. 4.25
First thing of note is that I'd never have guessed this was a ten fiddy ABV. There's 7 percent IPAs with more heat and solvent flavor than this. That's well done. Second, it's not as fruity as the nose but it still plenty of flavor going on. Orange and lemon, floral notes, zesty spice, and sweet, creamy vanilla malt. There's a touch of resinous hop flavor on the finish. 4.25
I mentioned the booze level and I gotta emphasize again, this doesn't drink like it's 10.5. There's a touch of heat but it's easy to roll with. The body is full, but smooth enough to permit me to throw this back like a British Mild. The finish lingers for an eternity with dryness and bitterness. 4.25
This is a  damn good brew. Damn good. 1,278 charactersONovoMexicano, Jun 10, 2014

4/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4From 05/06/14 notes. Had on tap at The Jeffrey in NYC, my first Other Half beer. 14 oz. pour in a tulip for $8.
a - Pours a deep, hazy orangish color with one inch of bright white head and moderate carbonation evident.
s - Smells of fruity malts, tropical fruits, pine hops, citrus hops, resin, grapefruit, bready malts, pale malts. Nice nose, some good hops to it and a lot of fruit.
t - Tastes of of fruity malts, citrus hops, bready malts, pine hops, tropical fruits, grapefruit, earthy malts. Taste is good and fruity, but much more malty than nose.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. No bitterness and no real bite from all the alcohol.
o - Overall a good beer, though I didn't find it a hop bomb and found the taste much maltier than I was expecting. The alcohol is hidden very well, and there is a good amount of fruit to it. Worth checking out. 864 charactersmdfb79, May 07, 2014
4.33/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Jimmy's No. 43. Served in a wine glass.
Appearance: Beautiful glowing opaque orange yellow. Great head retention for a "triple IPA" as well. When I see beers that look like this, I want to drink them immediately.
Smell: Sweet red grapefruit. Aromatic and floral but not pungent. Smells like it's single hopped with Centennial or something. Smells hopped as hell but no earthy / dank, all flower, light red berries, and citrus. The magnitude of the citrus really opens up with time and warmth. 
Extra points for being 10%+ ABV and no booziness in the nose at all. 
Taste: The hops from the aroma, full flavored and again, all fruit and flower. Big malt sweetness underneath is somehow not cloying, and just hot enough (you can tell it's high alcohol, but it's not assertively hot at all). Tastes like a more refined and citrusy 90minute IPA with a way better mouthfeel. Hops and malt are in perfect balance. Low perceived bitterness.
Surprised to read on the menu the hops used in this beer. I have to admit that I think some of them are a bit wasted here; I'm not tasting the telltale signs of most of these hops. Who cares though; the finished product is an uncommonly beautiful balance of hop and malt, really fantastic. 
Mouthfeel: This, like most really well done hoppy beers, is where this beer shines. Juicy and mildly carbonated, medium bodied. Neither sugary nor dry, but somehow gives an impression of lightness that matches perfectly with the refined balance of the flavor. 
Overall: This beer is like taking an unassuming but profoundly "pleasant" flowery and citrusy pale ale, doubling it while retaining all of its balance, subtlety, and "pleasantness," then tripling it and still keeping everything right. Almost show-off-y in this regard; it tastes like a beer that is not easy to make. 
Hat tip as well for avoiding the dank weed punch in the face that's carrying most hop bombs to popularity nowadays. Honestly, I *love* those dank hop bombs, but I like this too, and I respect the talent that must have gone into making it. Noteworthy beer. 2,076 charactersPahn, May 07, 2014
