This is really an incredible beer.  I've had another version of this and it's amazing how they change up the coffee to keep a fresh variety of this brew coming off the line.  Definitely one of the best coffee stouts I've had.  Showcases the stout and the coffee bean to perfection.  The brew adds a little roastiness, hint of vanilla, and earthy tones which combines for a grand slam. 436 charactersrabbott2, Jan 09, 2017

Pours opaque near black with a half-inch beige head that remains as a thick ring and leaves thick spots of lace. The smell is of coffee, earthy hops and cocoa. The taste follows with coffee, cocoa and a subtle cream presence. Full texture with medium carbonation.

Black with a tan head, great coffee and chocolate smells, smooth as hell with batch consistency with DS, and overall just a great beer.

4.56/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a growler into stemware. Thanks Dan! Not my first time having this, but it's always good to reacquaint myself with some fantastic dark beer.
Tight mocha head atop an intensely black beer. No light penetration at all. Swirling the glass recreates a sinister foaming mass building up to a finger and a half before sinking again. Lacing is very spotty. Surface is wispy and greyed-out with smoky plumes swirling about.
Lots of espresso coffee, brown sugar and crackery, slightly-roasty malt all building up a veritable smörgåsbord of deeply-layered scents. Almost has a "s'mores" like scent with some marshmallow/vanilla and graham cracker notes in there, too. Very decadent and well-built.
Absolutely full of coffee, vanilla, cocoa, graham cracker, brown sugar, molasses and slightly-nutty notes on the tongue. Amazing delineation of different flavors. Not too roasty at all; the coffee comes across as creamy and well-balanced and medium-roasted.. A tiny tinge of smoke dances across the palate close to the finish, rounding out each sip with mystery and interest.
Full-bodied with a chewy and dense palate. Low-leaning carbonation brings out some of the darker, supple flavors that a lighter profile would likely leave behind. Fluffy and gentle overall feel. Amazingly drinkable, complex and well-built. I'm a huge fan and will never turn this wonderful concoction down. Believe the hype! 1,406 charactersichorNet, Jun 29, 2016

A lot of coffee on the nose. Not much else. Maybe a little chocolate. 
The taste was like a smooth iced coffee. Super coffee forward. No bitterness. Really nice. 
Extremely smooth feel. Almost like a nitro. Mild carbonation. 
Overall, one of the best coffee stouts I've ever had. On par with Founders Breakfast Stout and Angry Chair's The Awakening. I could drink this every morning. 451 charactersukwildcat1995, Jun 19, 2016

The beer had a brown-black appearance with a bright dark brown head. Aromas were incredible and intense; there was a thick chocolate-mocha aroma mixed with roasted coffee. The taste followed the amazing flavors sensed in the nose and expanded greatly. This was one of the most delicious stouts I have tried, with a chocolate-coffee frappe-like quality. It was tasty without any of the flavors being overwhelming. The mouthfeel supplemented the taste quite well by making a very creamy texture to this beer. Overall, one of the best beers I had at the festival and one of the best stouts I have had in a long time. 693 charactersfitzy84, Jun 19, 2016

Nose expresses roast, cocoa and artificial vanilla notes.  Taste follows nose; however, there's also a slight smokey quality, albeit somewhat artificial.

Mouthful is medium and smooth.  Carbonation is medium as well.  Finish is a bit dry and lingers.

It seemed boozy even though it's only 7.6% abv and the flavors were not blending.  As it warmed up to 55-60 degrees it was a whole different beer.  It became smooth, the boozy taste dissipated, aromas and tastes of coffee and chocolate came out. It's a very good stout. I still think it's a bit overrated although I am one of the few who prefer porters to stouts so I may not be the best judge for the style. 480 charactersELS, May 06, 2016

4.41/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Perfect appearance. That mocha head lingers and lingers over the obsidian body. Beautiful to look at. The aroma isn't as nuanced as I expected. Big chocolate, big coffee ... but the coffee is a bit "generic", at least in the bottled version. I would love to try some of the variants focused on different coffee varietals. The abundance of chocolate was a surprise to me from something I really expected to be coffee driven. Flavor is chocolate covered espresso. Pretty direct but wonderfully dense. The feel is, surprisingly, too thin and light as it warms. 557 charactersKurmaraja, Apr 25, 2016

5/5  rDev +8.7%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5At first, I did not want to like this beer because it hadn't tasted like most stouts (which were much thicker and higher abv), but it definitely grew on me. Double Shot is like desert in a bottle. It is a deep black with thin mocha head. Lots of dark chocolate and some coffee in the nose. The description perfectly describes this as a chocolate covered espresso bean. It's silky smooth mouthfeel is followed by a sweet, salted caramel end notes that keeps you coming back for more. Stouts are usually so strong that they have to be sipping beers. However, Double Shot is so good that you wish you had sipped it. I was lucky enough to score a bottle in a trade in March of 2016. 678 charactersTrevor11, Apr 04, 2016

Classic imperial stout look with great head retention and even better lace. The nose on this beer is outrageous and I can smell it as I'm pouring it. Huge notes of molasses, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, roasted malt and fudge. My palate salivates at the thought! Flavor is that of cold press coffee, lactose, chocolate, fudge, a light smokiness and some roasted malt and liquorice. Outstanding! The feel pulls everything together as its full in the mouth without being heavy and silky smooth on the palate with just the slightest bit of bubbles going down. Aftertaste is luscious coffee, chocolate and lactose. 
The biggest crime this beer committed is that its not Good Morning. That's to say, even though its amazing, its not the best of the bunch. Definitely worth trying and certainly top notch in the style. 878 charactersSpeedwayJim, Feb 22, 2016

Surprisingly good, webby lacing on the glass. Smell is sweet coffee, chocolate, some vanilla. Taste is predominantly coffee with a really smooth landing on the palate. Chocolate and vanilla flavors blend in the background. Smooth as it gets. Awesome. 346 characterscostanzo_mike, Feb 14, 2016
4.65/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From growler. Pours near black with a nice finger head. Motor oil thick appearance. Lighter brown, moderate retention. Solid lacing. Nose is a nice coffee. You can tell this was brewed with a high quality coffee. Soft. Chocolatey. Vanilla. Fresh. Reminds me of Kona  though I don't think that's the bean used. Decadent and creamy. Perfect for what I'd look for from a coffee stout. Nice beer here. 397 charactersHootie159, Feb 14, 2016

If you like coffee, this is totally worth seeking out! Pours jet black with minimal head and lacing. The flavors are just perfect in my opinion. From the roasted flavors to the subtle sweetness, this is an awesome offering from Treehouse. Cheers! 363 characterstregan_20, Feb 09, 2016

4.95/5  rDev +7.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Like many folks, I'm usually not a big fan of coffee stouts, but Double Shot is definitely the best coffee stout I've ever had. As of this review the BA score is 97 and it deserves it. While Tree House's Alter Ego (BA 99 as of today, but deserves 100) is definitely better, I'm quite glad I got a growler of Double Shot when visiting.
I found my 16 day old grower filled to the very very top when opening it (thank you, Tree House) and it poured black-black-black with a nice brown head that grew a little more than expected a few seconds after pouring.
The taste is incredibly smooth with no sharp notes of coffee, chocolate, or the like, but the flavors are indeed there, just not hit-you-in-the-face like other coffee stouts can be, which is a very good thing. Double shot has a great mouthfeel, almost as good as alter ego. 
If you like coffee stouts, this is the beer for you. If you don't like coffee stouts, try this as it may get you int them! It is well worth trying.
Even after drinking 16 ounces I still want more, which is not something you often say about coffee stouts! 1,087 charactersMarcGetty, Oct 25, 2015

Purchased a growler, and have been savoring it for two days.  This is an amazing brew, layer after layer of flavor.  Sweet and bitter are perfectly balanced, incredible mouthfeel, coffee (like really good coffee), chocolate, nuts and toffee flavors are evident.  This is a unique and  addictive brew, another amazing brew from an amazing brewery. 473 charactersRABouffard, Oct 11, 2015

Smells like...coffee.  Dark espresso coffee.
Flavor follows.  It's not a light, bitter coffee; it's a smooth, dark, espresso flavor, blended with chocolate malt notes and just a touch of alcohol edge. Delicious.
Smooth, oily, medium-full mouthfeel. 286 charactersRoguer, Sep 19, 2015

4.44/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 750mL growler into a Tree House tulip glass. Purchased at the brewery a few days ago. 
Pours a deep black, inky body with a 2 finger mocha colored head that reduces within a few minutes, leaving a thin layer of foam. Little lacing. 
Aromas in the first 30 minutes are subtle and muted, but once it warms up they start to come out with rich deep roasted coffee, anise, black liquorice, dark fruit, dark chocolate. 
Taste is bold and rich - heavy roasted coffee upfront, espresso, followed by dark cocoa, roasty, toasty malt, char, coffee beans, finish is slightly bitter and you guessed it - roasty. Mouthfeel thickens as it warms, becoming rich and full. Low carbonation. 
Overall a solid stout - a massive coffee bomb. Seek it out if you're into coffee stouts. 779 charactersgcamparone, Jun 21, 2015

This one pours a black, thick liquid into my tulip glass and leaves a one-finger graham cracker head.
The aroma is mind-blowing. Coffee, cocoa, caramel, and vanilla are all fighting in the glass trying to gain the upper hand. On this pour, the coffee reigns supreme but it was a bloodbath. 
The taste is like a beer cappuccino. Coffee dominates the first sip, with the strong chocolate flavor breaking through like the Kool-Aid man through a brick wall. Not detecting too much caramel or vanilla on the taste but the coffee and chocolate have all but decimated my palate. 
The mouthfeel is extremely smooth. It drinks like an Imperial stout, but surprises with only a 7.6 ABV. The alcohol is very well hidden.
Overall this is unquestionably one of my favorite stouts. There's not a whole lot going on but what IS going on is absolutely amazing. This is how a coffee stout should be done. 911 charactersScaryEd, Jun 05, 2015

F- Sweet, milk chocolate on the front and the coffee/bitterness just follows on the back end with some more milky sweetness. The coffee isn't overpowering at all, just perfectly balanced. 
M- Medium to full-bodied. A little syrupy from the sweetness, yet it's still drinkable. 
O- I really dig this beer. It's dessert-sweet without being too sweet. Coffee isn't overpowering at all, and I really appreciate that. Really awesome beer that I'd happily drink again. Next time, I'll be sure to drink it fresh. 739 charactersrockernino, May 05, 2015

4.5/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5When consumed fresh, this beer is heavy on the coffee -both on the nose and palate- with deeper layers of flavors opening up as it warms. While there are a few things going on, the predominant flavor is coffee. 
I cellared another growler of Double Shot for four months and found that while the coffee had largely dissipated, the overall flavor of the stout had improved over time. 
The choice, really, is yours. If you are into bold coffee flavor in your stout, drink this guy fresh. If you are more into layered flavors in your stouts, with just a hint of coffee, then age this beer for a few months. 604 charactersrodmanfor3, Apr 27, 2015

A: The beer is a deep dark brown color, with a short brown white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains black coffee, chocolate, roasted malts and a faint touch of hops.
T: The taste starts out with a strong coffee flavor that is quickly followed by a hearty roasted malt character. Then some chocolate flavor comes in. The hops presence is very mild but complementary and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and extremely smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is very clean for the style.
O: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good coffee beer to drink for a long time. 834 charactersTheManiacalOne, Apr 21, 2015

A- Dark brown body with a thick two finger mocha head with excellent retention time and longevity. Impressively carbonated, looks so thick and creamy. Spots of lacing persist over time.
S- Mocha chocolate and rich coffee beans, nice espresso and roasted malt. Very solid aromatic profile.
F- Tastes like a mocha milkshake. Seriously, creamy milk chocolate and espresso. Nice mild roast that isn't too burnt or smoky, but overall the flavours meld together very well to make it taste like a mocha milkshake. I dig.
M- Medium-thick bodied, soft and creamy, lending more attribution to the idea of a mocha milkshake. Drinkable, although I don't think I would want to dome a whole growler of it despite it being 7.6% ABV.
O- Delicious stuff, like I said, who can turn down a mocha milkshake? I definitely never would. 869 charactersStevedore, Mar 05, 2015

The smell is out of this world, only can really compare it to a fresh 2013 BCBCS (without the bourbon). This is what a big coffee stout should smell like. incredible smooth taste with balanced sweetness and bitterness. Coffee flavor is still there.

WOW, what coffee. This is THE coffee stout. Forget Founder's Breakfast, drink this if you can get your hands on it. It looks like a cup of fresh brew, it smells of cold-pressed deliciousness. 
The flavors are perfect. It features a sweet backbone, and plenty of roastiness to make it bitter. But the real attraction is that coffee.

Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to a partial film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roasted malt, cocoa, coffee bean, brewed coffee, and vanilla bean aromas. Taste is much the same with cocoa, vanilla, and coffee bean flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of roast bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good beer with a fantastic mix of cocoa, vanilla, and coffee qualities all around.
Serving type: on tap. 714 charactersUCLABrewN84, Nov 10, 2014

a: Opaque black with a finger thick tan head which receded to even surface foam and dense lacing.
s: Surprisingly little aroma.  Slight dark malt.
t: Sweet black coffee and dark chocolate up front over a moderate hop bite.  Bitterness lingers a short time.
m; Smooth medium with lots of carbonation tingle and good body.
o; A very tasty and easy drinking brew, which does not suffer from a thin body as some do.  A solid top level stout. 538 charactersscotorum, Oct 16, 2014

A: Pours near black with a large, thick, and dense, dark brown head that slowly faded into a lasting collar. Wispy of soapy lace were left down the glass.
S: Huge and dominating notes of coffee on the nose. The coffee is clean, fresh, and potent smelling. It is a nutty and mild smelling coffee, with a hint of vanilla and chocolate, but without any bitter, acid, smoky or overly roasted notes. This just smells like clean, delicious, coffee. 
T: Follows the nose with smooth yet rich notes of coffee, dark chocolate, and a hint of vanilla. The chocolate and vanilla taste more like aspects of the coffee than they do the malt, the coffee flavor is that believable. This tastes like a cold, carbonated cup of coffee. The finish is sweet and roasted, and I get a hint of caramel in coffee aftertaste. 
M: Medium-full body, very smooth and not overly heavy or chewy, with velvety thick and fluffy carbonation that added some nice volume to the experience.
O: One of the better, and definitely the best in recent memory, regular coffee stouts I’ve had. I wish this was available locally because I would definitely drink this regularly. Thanks again for the growler Kevin! 1,266 charactersscottfrie, Jun 27, 2014

Appeared solid black in the light of the bar, with a dark brown head that retained as a small ringlet, leaving dots of lacing on the glass. Earthy, roasty coffee in the aroma, dark malts and more roast. Good melding of dark malts and coffee in the taste, which I like, as opposed to some coffee beers, which end up tasting like a full-blown glass of cold coffee. Notes of caramel, ash, and maybe some subtle dark fruit. Rich, tasty, smooth, medium to medium-full body. I can be picky with coffee beers, but this is probably one of the better ones I've had. 596 charactersRifugium, Apr 06, 2014

The brew appears black in color with a dark brown head. The cap holds with a film across the top that fades leaving spotty lace.
The aroma is chock full of delicious fresh smelling coffee. It is roasty and earthen with char and chocolate. The more the glass is swirled, the more it smells like coffee and seemingly nothing else, not saying thats a bad thing, just wow coffee overload in a great way.
The taste is bitter and roasted/charred. Somewhat earthen with plenty of coffee flavors but not so much that it dominates the flavor profile like it does in the nose. Some chocolate grain, licorice, raison and some citrus/fruity alcohol appeal.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest amount of carbonation. The nose is 100% coffee dominated. The flavor is also strong with coffee but there is plenty of beer aspect remaining. Get this, its great. Thank you Heath for sharing. 974 charactersstakem, Mar 25, 2014

4.71/5  rDev +2.4%The beer comes in an opaque obsidian with a fluffy light brown head.
The aroma has medium roasted malt, milk chocolate, a bit of sugary sweetness. Almost a nutty note along with coffee grounds and fresh espresso beans.
The flavor follows with that caramel sugar sweetness in the front. Almost like a sugar covered espresso bean. The mid offers lots of milk chocolate, cocoa, almost like a chocolate drink. Then onto a smooth longing melted chocolate note that is balanced by the beer's sweetness, roasted malt, and coffee bitterness.
The mouthfeel is medium to medium plus and drinks above its ABV.
One of the best coffee stouts I've had, even up against some double digit ABV stouts. 688 charactersdar482, Mar 24, 2014

big creamy fluffy head darker mocha color, hits a finger and fades fairly slowly with nice lacing everywhere, pretty much pitch black beer that I don't really see any light getting through.
Nose is loaded With coffee, and more coffee, fresh roasted mild earthy coffee, fresh roasted beans a sack of coffee beans and grinds, very toasty, toasted beans, etc. Late in there it eventually brings very dark choc, little fudgey. 
Taste is loaded With coffee, fresh roasted coffee beans, a sack them again, toasted beans, fresh coffee, etc. Mild dark choc, little fudgey, chewy sludge creamy choc, light roasted malt. A little earthy hop, bit nothing really else. It def delivers the coffee, but not a lot else in there. Finish is sticky and fairly sweet, long lingering coffee, mild fudge choc, light bitterness. 
Mouth is med to fuller bod, decent carb, little creamy. 
Overall not bad but mostly just all coffee. Doesn't have a ton going for it other than the coffee, which is great, but more complexity, or at least the nice malts I know are there that can't get through due to the coffee just overpowering them, would be nice. 1,198 charactersjlindros, Mar 24, 2014

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice dark brown nearly black hue with a one finger mocha head that leaves light lacing, very nice.
S - Aromas of enormous coffee. Huge, huge coffee. Light malt sweetness.
T - Taste is loads of coffee, not as much add the nose but really big. Roast malts, little chocolate, faint sweetness. Kind of a one trick pony.
M - Mouthfeel is nicely carbonated, easy drinking, alcohol hidden very well.
O - Overall this beer was pretty good, loads of coffee but that's about it. Really would benefit from some barrel aging. Some day. 639 charactersrudzud, Mar 23, 2014

S-Well it both looks and smells like espresso. All about the coffee. One of the most genuine coffee aromas I have come across. This could easily pass for a strong, black coffee in terms of aroma.
T-So much espresso, so much genuine coffee, so much roastiness. Double Shot is a very accurate name. Sweet and bitter dark chocolate and even a bit of nuttiness.
M-Medium bodied and very drinkable. Tiny bubbles. Bitter finish. No booze whatsoever.
O/D-I really loved this beer. A coffee clone. A coffee-beer-lover's wet dream. This one one of the gems at EBF.

The beer has a very strong cocoa note to it. However, the beer has two different bitter cocoa notes to it. One of them is a bitter and dark roasted Sumatra. The other coffee note also comes out well but it's not as strong as the Sumatra. There is also a slight sweet dark chocolate note.
The taste is very similar to the smell when it comes to the cocoa notes. Additionally, the taste has a strong sweet dark chocolate note to it to balance out the coffee beans.
The feel is really nice. It's a heavy bodied beer with slightly biting carbonation. The overall feel is that it goes down smoothly despite being a bit thick.
Overall, pretty good. Go for it. 780 charactersHattedClassic, Mar 23, 2014

4.66/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This pours out as a black color with a brown head on top. The smell of the beer is flooded with coffee notes, roasted malts and chocolate. The taste is basically the same as the aroma. The mouthfeel is very smooth, overall this beer is awesome! 244 charactersKnapp85, Mar 22, 2014
