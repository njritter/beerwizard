4.31/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.2516 ounce can into a tulip glass.  Canned 12/20/16, had 2/2/17.
Pours a medium golden yellow, a bit hazy, with a one and a half inch foamy head and a good amount of foamy lacing.  The smell is citrus hops- grapefruit, mango, orange, tangerine, pineapple, and an almost equal amount of pine and resin.  Light malt and yeast, light, dank, green onion when warm.  The aroma does not fade much throughout the can.  Really nice aroma.  The taste is grapefruit, pine, some spruce, orange, mango, lemon, less pineapple and tangerine than the nose, light but sufficient malt, some yeast.  A light hop bitterness up front, that mellows at the finish.  Smooth, a light but substantial body, refreshing, well carbonated.  
This is the real deal, with Citra hops bursting with aroma and flavor.  It impressively all stays intact the whole time.  An effective malt base.   I may be late to the game, but it's well worth a purchase, and is a real everyday beer. 948 charactersstortore, Jun 22, 2017

Bitter but smooth with some residual malty sweetness. 274 charactersSludgeman, Jun 12, 2017
4.49/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a becher pint glass, the appearance was a golden burnt amber color with a foamy to bubbly white head that quickens the pace of letting the lace of being messy all over. The aroma starts off with some sharp bitter pineu hops purely agitating a sly earthy sweet malt. Citrus hops slyly move in for a subtle balance. The flavor balances quite nicely between the piney bittersweet hops and citrus hops. Malt level seems to lay back a tad bit more. Pineyness grips the aftertaste and leads on into the finish. On the palate, this one leans to the lighter side between light and medium bodied. Low carbonation yields to the hops embracing a keen bitterness as the harshness punctuating my tongue. Overall, what a damn American Pale ale, that I would love to have again. Awesome in it’s entirety 802 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 12, 2017

4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.516 oz. can, canned 24 days ago. I've read the cans are contract brewed in Florida and fall short of the "real deal" (bombers from the main brewery).
Pours copper-orange with a half finger of white head.
Nose is orange rind, pineapple, peach, and pungent hops, and the taste follows. Suggestions of berry. A good display of Citra, balanced by biscuity malt.
Mouthfeel is on the light side of medium.
Overall, this is really good but short of incredible. The juicier, hazier version from the brewery is probably a knockout. 525 charactersmkh012, Jun 08, 2017

No bitterness, even as it warms up. One of the best tasting beers I've ever had. Creamy, medium body that finishes dry. Very easy drinking. I haven't liked APAs in the past, but this one might change that. Glad this has popped up in Minnesota! 498 charactersipeters1017, Jun 01, 2017

That's about all the criticism there is to be had concerning this beer. The nose is Citra heaven. With Citra being my favorite hop, I may be a bit biased, but it is such a well made beer that I think it's safe to put that aside. 
I looked down and all of a sudden it was halfway gone. This four-pack is not long for this world. Insanely drinkable. 453 charactersebin6, May 27, 2017

Mango and citrus dominate the senses of smell and taste followed by a clean, sweet lightly toasted bread and a simple and small amount of pine.  Feel is so clean, if that makes sense.

I was finally able to get my hands on some of this last week, and my first impression was that it tasted a bit like Kern's 'Hazy Citra' (which was a one-off NE spin on their classic, Citra, offered at the pub during their last Citra release), albeit a bit lighter.  After just reading the description I now know why.  Citra hops have to be one of the most delicious things to happen to beer.
Anyway, the beer is a cloudy (obviously) golden-tan, with a wispy head quickly dissipating.  Nose is citrusy and floral, with tropical nuances at the bouquet's border.  More layered and delicious on the palate, with notes of mango and  papaya distinct.  Closes with a clean, refreshing finish, as hints of bittersweet residuals linger.
Really delicious beer, kind of a West Coast-East Coast hybrid, with some of the best aspects of both styles. 867 charactersrand, May 21, 2017

A: Pours a golden orange color with a white head, slight haze, decent amount of lacing.
A: Not as aromatic as I was expecting, grapefruit peel, mango, guava, slight pine notes, subtle aromas.
T: Much like the nose, the taste is subtle with notes of citrus peel, mango, and guava, low bitterness with a slight pine note in the finish along with more guava and mango.
M: Light bodied with a good amount of carbonation and a semi-dry finish.
O: Definitely does not live up to the hype, however this is a review of a beer brewed and canned in Florida, it's still a great tasting beer but definitely not what I was expecting. 658 charactersBrolo75, May 12, 2017

This is just so incredibly balanced, with a punchy flavor and a forgiving bite of bitter considering its namesake T. rex. But no mistaking that this is a royal beast of a pale ale that slams its style with those Citra hops. So fresh and crisp!
L - Glowing golden, with a thin yet lingering head, slight effervescence, slight lacing.
S - Oh, that single-hop Citra scent. So inviting with mango and maybe lemony tangerine for me. Almost no dank that I could tell.
T - It lives up to that inviting smell and transcends it, in my opinion. This just seems like it set a new bar for me for a pale ale. Decidedly not so biting as an IPA, and makes you wonder why you would want that. Mango is there, some orange or lime, more touch of pine than I found in the smell, but all so subtle and balanced.
F - effervescent and smooth without of course being creamy, also not heavy like an IPA, though not watered down either. Again seems like it could define the style for me.
O - The T. rex don't need to brag. She don't need to bite too hard. She's confident and efficient. Right on style. Power without needing to overpower. Such a royal beast. 1,197 charactersbraker649er, May 01, 2017

It wasn't too hoppy and it didn't stick around in my mouth a lot.  The feel in my mouth was amazing.  It was a light body with a smooth head and very easy to drink.  I took an average of all my scores and then rounded up since I love it to give it a 4.5.  I would definitely drink it again. 539 charactersLuphildern, Apr 09, 2017

4.73/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Poured a golden-orange color in a Teku glass. A nice chill haze is created with some phenomenal lacing and an inch of a white fluffy head. 
Aroma is an assault of citrus and tropical fruit. Perhaps a bit of dankness near the finish. Lots of orange pith and peel, mango, and papaya; sweeter tropical fruits, not so much acidic. 
The beer is clean in flavor with a mild-moderate level of bitterness, and a medium-light carbonation level. The beer feels almost creamy on the palate. The beer is citra-forward. Great amount of citrus pith: grapefruit and orange. The tropical fruits are not as present as on the nose, but still mildly present (mango mostly). A bit of a herbal hop character comes forth near mid sip. The finish is dry, prompting another sip. Bitterness does not linger on the palate, but it does provide an appealing bite. 
This is one delicious pale ale. I would say that, in regards to hype, it does fall a bit short. I was hoping for a bit more topical fruit concentration. I prefer this to a Pliny/blind pig, and I see it being a toned back version of a Heady (but in the same vein). I am overjoyed I have a four pack, and I would without a doubt buy again if given the opportunity. However, I would not trade an arm/leg to try; it’s great, but not life-altering. I see this pairing well with many foods, but a crispy chicken paillard with frisee, lardons, and a soft poached egg would work nicely. It gets a  94.5/100. 1,441 charactersDaverCS, Apr 04, 2017

Excellent mouthfeel, perfect carbonation, and smooth.  Overall excellent.  I tend not to like pale ales due to the hoppy bitterness, but thought I'd try some Sue since it is so highly rated.

4.53/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours fiery orange with a little frost and fog keeping it from being completely clear. Pouring out the last few ounces of the can gives the beer a more opaque look. Head foams up to three fingers in height after a modest pour. Good retention and lacing. Aroma is blood orange, citrus, floral, and resin hops. Biscuit malts with a hint of earth give the aroma more balance. Flavor profile is blood orange, tangerine, orange with floral and resin hops and biscuit malts. Very flavorful, balanced, and tasty. Mouth feel is medium in thickness, and maintains a great consistency that falls just on the grainy side giving the beer a little more presence. Overall, a flavorful hoppy pale ale. The balance is struck just right, keeping the distinct attitude of this beer tame.

A: Pours hazy (with a few small floaties) golden orange amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a firm layer and leaves some very nice lacing.
S: Ripe fruit leads, passion fruit and peach, maybe a hint of mango, some citrus, orange, grapefruit, lemon lime, biscuity malt, and caramel sweetness.

16oz can into a pint glass
Canned on: 11/30/16  (reviewed with approx 2.5 months on it)
A: Pours a slightly hazy golden color with 2 plus fingers width of white  head. Head has good retention before dissipating down and leaves lots of lacing.  4.25
S: Aroma is tropical fruit with mango and pineapple.  Citrus with orange and subtle lemon zest.  Faint piney bitterness and a firm malt backbone to round it out.  4.25
T: Taste follows the nose with citrus, tropical fruits and piney bitterness.  There are definitely more bitter and piney notes on the taste than the nose, and less of the tropical fruit goodness, although admittedly this may be due to the age. It is well balanced though, great combo of citrus, fruits and piney bitterness.  4.25
M/D: Mouthfeel is medium body with carbonation on the higher side and average drinkability.  4.25
O: Very nice pale ale.  Better than most of the other citra only pales out there, IMO.  I will try to get some of this again, but fresher, and will re-review if I do.  Try to only rate Pales/IPA/DIPAs that are under 2 months but couldn’t pass this one up when I saw it on the shelf in FL and had to rate it.  Even with 2.5 months on it, its damn good.  4.25 1,237 characterszac16125, Mar 12, 2017

Poured from a can dated 5/11/17
Pours slightly hazy with a juicy look to it that invites you to taste.
Smells like hop heaven. Juicy citrus fruits and sweet goodness.
The taste is superior to nearly any APA you can name. Tropical and citrus hop flavor never cede to bitter notes, rather leave a citrus pith after taste that begs another sip.
Drink this. Seriously. 451 charactersBones10, Mar 01, 2017

4.7/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75IMO, this is TG's flagship beer that first put them on the map. This is an APA that has few, if any flaws. This is my go-to weeknight/everyday beer & couldn't be more excited that it's more readily available. 
The best thing about this beer, along with nearly every beer that TG puts out, is the nose, which is a heavy citra/grapefruit, and tropical bouquet. A fair amount of hop in the nose is apparent as well, but is more complimentary than showcase. The beer is well carbonated and pours smoothly with a mostly white head that clings well, though dissipates shortly after the pour. It's a golden body that leans more towards the amber side and IMO is best served in a snifter or tulip glass. The taste follows the nose well, with plenty of juicy grapefruit and orange notes, and a toasty, but well balanced, malt backbone. The hop notes are delicate and once again, compliment the flavors of the pale ale well. Again, a decently carbonated beer, with a slightly dry finish but incredibly smooth. Overall, this is an incredible APA that I think rivals most available. 1,071 charactersumichfan, Feb 27, 2017
3.97/5  rDev -11.4%look: 5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 416 oz can poured into a tulip. Comes in a four pack. Pretty sought after in the pale ale department. Toppling Goliath is also a very sought after brewery based in Iowa but contracts their beers to other breweries. Almost certain this is named after T-Rex Sue that is on display in Chicago. Who doesn't love T-Rex? Answer: lawyers sitting on toilets and Newman.....
L - hazy orange color, super hazy hue, standard foam dome with medium lacing, super frothy foam. Like orange juice in a glass
S - orange peel, all around citrus scent thanks to the Citra hops. Fills your nose with citrus zest
T - definitely orange juice, followed by orange peel, dryness of grapefruit, super juicy flavor
F - full bodied feel, dryness akin to acidic orange juice, resinous hops is medium light, big taste for a pale ale
O - very hefty pale ale, explosion of flavor and nothing subtle about it. Awesome session beer if you have the palate. Not your father's pale ale at all. Cheers! 968 charactersctylinebeer, Feb 27, 2017

Golden straw colored with substantial head that completely recedes to impressive lacing.  Smells like fresh citrus.  Taste follows the smell with more orange juice than rind.  Bitterness is just right, just enough not to overpower the subtle citrus.  Mouthfeel is impressive for a pale.  It is full and soft without being sweet or sticky.  Overall, this is a great pale ale.  If I could routinely buy it off the shelf fresh at $10/4pk, I would have it frequently.  Recommended 570 charactersjkblr, Feb 24, 2017

Tastes of lime, citrus blasts with more refreshing smacks of hops.  If this is a pale ale, sign me up every time!  A good dose of sweet malt is also present which makes the experience even nicer.  This belongs on the West Coast with all the hop explosion.
Really good. 305 characterskaseydad, Feb 24, 2017

4.15/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Clear glowing orange body with some visible sediment suspended around, off-white coarse head that leaves plenty of sticky lace around the glass. Nose offers mango compote and toasted sugary pastry, like a toaster strudel. Intensely sweet but full of character. Taste retains this fruity element and adds pineapple, as well as a touch of bitterness and pine. There's also a bit of light wheaty malt. Body is medium with a fairly syrupy quality and fine but sharp carbonation.
This was sweeter than I expected, and almost artificial in its deliverance of juicy mango and pineapple flavor. But it pulled through as authentic, and combined with balancing bitterness and all-around refreshingness, has earned a spot as one of America's best pale ales. 746 characters1000lbgrizzly, Feb 07, 2017

Appearance - Pours clear and pure gold in color with an off-white, frothy finger width head. Fair retention, resulting in a thin, broken layer of suds and a fair ring around the edge of the glass. Lots of tiny dots of sediment floating about. Decent lacing, with a few broken lines and small spotting.
Smell - Blossoming, fruity aroma envelop the olfactory senses; fresh orange peel, grapefruit flesh and lesser mango all paint a vivid picture in the mind. A hint of grain sits beneath. 
Taste - Doesn't quite live up to the aroma, but still very solid. Juicy orange and lesser, mildly bitter grapefruit notes upfront with mild mango coming through mid-taste. A hint of toasted bread also creeps in mid-taste, but finds itself overshadowed by the fair amount of citrus pith bitterness in the finish.
Mouthfeel - Medium in body with moderate carbonation. Easy drinker with a slightly silky texture.
Overall - As it's a single hop Citra-centric APA from the Midwest, the comparisons to Zombie Dust are inevitable. It's been some time since I've had ZD, but I gotta believe I dig this one more, though a side-by-side one day would be awesome. As good as this is, there's just something missing. It's just too simple for me to be completely enamored with. 1,280 charactersTheSixthRing, Feb 01, 2017

A: Pours a golden-yellow color with some sediment-haze through it. Pretty clear until you look really close. Nice 1-finger foamy white head with a good pour.
S: Mango, citrus, pineapple, papaya. Definitely citra on the aroma.
T: Papaya, coconut, mango, lemon zest. Just a hint of breadcrumb in the finish.
M: Medium body, great carbonation. No booze at all. Finish is just a tad bitter, but quite subtle. There's enough of a malt balance to keep things even, but not make this "malty". 
O: This is my first dive into Toppling Goliath and can't be more excited. The closest beer I can compare this to, in terms of popular, beloved pale ales, would be Zombie Dust. Now, Dust has changed over time in my eyes, but OG Dust is very similar to this beer, and that's a good thing. I get fresh hops, good balance, high taste-to-bitterness ratio, and most importantly, drinkability. This one goes down nice and isn't overly bitter or bready (a fault of many lame pale ales or IPAs). Not sure how this would do in a blind tasting, but for right here, right now, this lives up to the hype as a super tasty, drinkable pale ale from TG.
Recommendation: Maybe not worth aggressively tracking down like some of the other well-known TG brews, but this is certainly one all hopheads should try at some point in their beer careers. 1,507 charactersSparty1224, Jan 28, 2017

There's definitely pithy oily grapefruit on the finish, but there's definitely some underripe mango upfront. Besides my friend Jon, there are few good things that have come out of Iowa. This is certainly one of them. The marriage of the tropical and citrus flavors in this beer seem everlasting like the love of Barack and Michelle, topical as I sip this wondrous nectar in DC. This cloudy and pillowy nectar could compete with this coast's best pale ales. The T-Rex is ultimately the king of the ecosystem. 594 charactersSheppard, Jan 27, 2017
4.27/5  rDev -4.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Thanks to Nick for scoring this for me, was mucho bueno.  Anyways, showcase for the Citra hop I believe, yellow and orange pour, 1/2" white head, not super in the clarity department but not NE flour power hazing it up either.  Plenty of that honeysuckle citrus floral vibe in the nose.
Taste, well hopped, toasted pale malt affair.  Not overly bitter at all, this does what you want in an upper echelon ipa, drops substantial flavor without obscuring it with grating bitterness.  Light and dry body.    Carbonation on point.  If you like the Kern River Citra dipa you should like this, substantially less body and alcohol comparitively.  Would crush this over and over if I could pull it off a shelf.  But there's plenty of viable substitutes in whatever region you're in, so I wouldn't chase it down. 802 charactersrodbeermunch, Jan 27, 2017

A: deep orange. Almost neon.  Mostly clear with a big amount of specs to cloud it a bit. Thick white head. 
S:  citra for sure.  Floral.  Citrus pith. Grass. Some resin. Faint tropical fruits. 
T: pine. Peach skin. Guava peel. Bitter resin. Grassy notes. Fresh floral bouquets. Citrus. Orange peel.  Some biscuit undertones. 
F: extremely soft and smooth. Almost creamy.  Good medium body. Great palate coating. Finished smooth soft and creamy. Wonderful. 
O: I really like this a lot. It's not old but i can't wait to try one a bit fresher just for comparison.   I will say I think the hype train might have this one a bit high rated. Or it could be a freshness or where it was brewed thing. Again fantastic but I'd love to have a fresh one from Iowa to truly know. Even still great 976 charactersHop_God, Jan 26, 2017

Appear: nice pillowy head abt a pinky's worth. its an amber golden color. pretty clear can see my fingers through the glass.  
Smell: CItra for sure.  CItrusy dankness.  its subtle tho.  you gotta really inhale.  not a powerful nose at all.  orange and grapefruit pith a little pine a little lemongrass maybe?  
Taste:  Damn.  I've been drinking alot of NE IPAs lately and this is refreshing and delicious change of pace.  Taste follows the nose.  citrus notes for sure hops are really well balanced with the caramel bready malt notes.  The bitterness is there but it's subtle in such a nice way.  
Mouth: light medium.  its smooth and creamy but in a different way from like a Tired Hands or Veil or Treehouse. solid.  
OVerall:  Quality APA.  My first offering from TGB and I have to say I'm really impressed.  I have a DDH Pseudo sitting in fridge and I"m super tempted to open that too.  THis is really good.  Seek out or trade for.  No doubt. 1,033 charactersGumbo_gravy, Jan 21, 2017

PseudoSue did not let me down, it's truly an amazing beer.
Look:  Light amber, deep gold.  White head with many large bubbles
Smell:  So floral; fresh-picked cascade hops, notes of citrus, mango, pine
Taste:  Juicy, citrus, and a perfect amount of piny, resiny hop bitterness.
Feel:  Nice in body for an APA; high carbonation with a refreshing finish

Canned 11/16/16
A- pours a clear golden color with a two-finger foamy and creamy white head that has great retention and leaves some lacing behind all the way down the glass
S- dank citrus up front with some tropical notes of mango, pineapple, passionfruit & melon.  Honey-like sweet malty undertones to round it out
T- blast of tropical and citrusy hops hit the palate up front, with highlights of blood orange, grapefruit zest, mango, pineapple & ripe melon.  Honeyed malt sweetness adds just enough backbone to support the hop showcase.  The finish gives more tropical fruit with a hint of grass
M- medium body and carbonation leads to a creamy mouthfeel that continues into a silky smooth finish, superior drinkability
O- can't as for much more out of a pale ale, dank yet great drinkability 835 charactersTreyliff, Jan 18, 2017

S: Pulpy orange, tangerine flesh, zesty orange peel, mango, papaya, pineapple, yellow grapefruit, grass, earth, and faint, slightly sugary biscuit malt.
T: Tons of bittersweet orange and grapefruit, lots of mango, white peach, and pineapple accentuating.  Bittersweet, zesty, and floral throughout.  The malt is faintly biscuit with hints of honey, but very subtle, and accentuates the pineapple notes.  Finishes earthy and grassy, but with more orange peel, leaving a dry, citrusy, and grassy aftertaste.
F: Very big and filling, with ample carbonation.  Feels creamy and thick on the tongue.

The body is medium,with a medium dry finish.

It is good, for sure- a very enjoyable APA. But I don't find it to be anything particularly special. Citrus and tropical fruit, rather sticky, quite light-bodied. Moderate bitterness. The flavour is good with very low malt flavour. Either the beer falls off a lot after two months (certainly possible) or my tastes just don't align with most. It's a very good APA,  it not something to kill yourself trying to acquire. 531 charactersjrenihan, Dec 30, 2016
4.57/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75beer was canned 10/28 so its 2 months old at the time of drinking. Drank out of a TEKU.
Look: Deep gold to light amber in color with a solid medium minus haze and a pinky of egg-foamy white head. 
Aroma: Smells like a nelson dry-hopped beer with big white grape on the nose. Plenty of fleshy overripe mango as well. 
Taste: Way less flavorful than the nose would indicate(I suspect this is due to the age). Flavor leans more toward green, underripe melon and tropical fruit. Nice light pithy bitterness on the finish but I'm actually wishing for a little more sweetness. Bump it up to 6 or 7% and I think this beer would be waaaayyyyy better.
Mouthfeel: On the thin side but at 5.8% that's not surprising. Definitely sessionable. 
Overall(style points): My first TG beer and I'm pretty impressed given the age and low ABV. The aroma is clearly the best part of this beer but the flavor just couldn't quite keep up.  90 points. 931 charactersMikeyMcD86, Dec 30, 2016

Taste - much like the way it smelled. The flavors marry well together. But they are not very bright at all. Has a bit of a bitter finish. Pretty thin on the taste. Not a hole lot to report on the mouthfeel. Lightly carbonated. Overall, this didn't jump out at me. The taste is pretty thin. Does have a dry finish. It doesn't linger on in sweetness though it does have some. The bitterness sticks around quite a bit. 
Can't help but to do it. But drank next to fresh ZD, which was superior. Pseudo definitely had a more robust aroma though. 644 charactersNoYouDidnt, Dec 28, 2016

Aroma is big, layered and complex with pine up front followed by tropical fruit and floral notes.  Everything is nicely balanced.  Taste is somewhat consistent with the smell although the tropical fruit (mango, grapefruit) is more pronounced.  A little hoppier than a normal Pale Ale but that's fine with me.  The finish is slightly bitter but clean is not truly dry or crisp.  Feel is fantastic for a Pale Ale: thick and smooth with medium carbonation.
Suggested food pairing: Ahi Tuna

Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again)  There's nothing not to like here and this beer is super duper crushable.  There's nothing over the top or necessarily eye-popping, just expert execution.  I can't really see any beer fan not liking this so it's certainly one to try if you have the chance. 974 charactersSHDoyle, Dec 26, 2016

Finishes very clean, and easy to drink a few in an afternoon of football watching.  To those who are asking "what's the deal with all the hype?" the hype with regard to Toppling Goliath isn't with regard to this beer - as good as it is.  TG's hype is based almost exclusively on their out-of-this-world limited release stouts.  Pseudo Sue is a fantastic pale ale - and indeed one of the best, and deserves the accolades it gets here - but it's not hyped like the front-line stouts that TG puts out. 580 charactersDrQuantum, Dec 26, 2016

A buddy brought me this one back from a trip to Iowa to see his family...thank you sir.
Good looking golden yellow with a slight haze...big head that settles in leaving a thin lace.
Strong juicy hop aroma. Smells of citrus, pine, and spices. Almost like orange juice and mango in a can.
Wow. Juicy hop flavor without the same bite of an IPA. Hops dominate, but not overpowering. Great juicy tang and a bit dry on the aftertaste. A really easy drinking beer here and the alcohol is not too big. What a combo!
This Citra bomb is absolutely delicious! An IPA fan should love it, but it reigns supreme as a pale ale. 655 charactersobrike, Dec 16, 2016
4.27/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Citrus, Tropical, Bready, Clean
From the tallboy, this is a golden beer with a touch of haze and a fluffy white head with legs. Single hopped with Citra, the aroma is packed with citrus zest and fleshy tropical fruits. It’s very aromatic, herbal and floral, too. Bready malts with fruity mango flavors greet the palate, followed by some juicy apple and background earthiness. The finish is dry, very clean, crisp, and highly refreshing. I'm glad I got to sit down and finally analyze this beer, but pseudoSue is a killer American Pale Ale that should just be pounded from the can.

Bright tropical and citrus fruit aromas of orange, mango, pineapple, and grapefruit make this very tempting before the first sip.
Delicious smooth tropical fruit and citrus notes play out in flavor as much as they do in aroma. A bit of sweetness is lended by a light but sturdy malt backbone.
Light-bodied, medium-high carbonation, fruity, crisp, smooth.
Overall, this beer is truly one to seek out. Marvelous balance, fantastic tropical and citrusy aroma and flavor, and goes down almost too easily. 592 characterslarryarms847, Dec 03, 2016

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Received a 4-pack as a gift. Glad I did.
16-oz can in a tulip glass.
L: typical newer citrus ales: cloudy. Not as cloudy as some NE IPA/DIPA, but pretty cloudy. Some head. Can't remember how long it stuck around.
S: citrusy, malty. There was a slight dankness underneath it all, but ever so slight. Just enough complexity to keep things interesting, which is tough with a single hop beer.
T: This is a pale ale, and I'm used to the super-uber citrusy/fruity IPAs/DIPAs you get around here in NE. This was a refreshing change of pace. If I didn't watch it, this could be gone in a few minutes. It's light in flavor, but still has a ton of flavor. There's some depth and complexity from using this hops at various points during the boil. The malts gave a bread/biscuit taste. The yeast was fairly neutral. The remaining 3 beers won't stick around very long. I liked this beer.
Remember the style: this is a pale ale, single hop. People who are criticizing this beer are likely comparing to other styles. Reviews should be within the style.
F: a little dinner than I'm used to, but this is also 3+% lower ABV than I've been drinking. It's going to be a little thinner. But there was still body. Carbonation was good, restrained but not under done.
O: I'm glad I have 3 more. I wish I had them 4 months ago, in the heat of summer. These would be perfect. 1,353 charactersGeeL, Dec 03, 2016

A: Pours a hazy, golden-orange color with a very slight reddish tint. One inch, frothy, paper white head with short retention. Thick, white, billowy lacing throughout.
S: Huge notes of tropical fruits including pineapple, mango, papaya, passionfruit, and melons. Citrus notes of orange, tangerine, and grapefruit. Milder notes of piney and earthy hops as well.
T: Leads with citrus and tropical fruit notes of grapefruit, orange rind, pineapple, and melons. Piney and resinous hop notes follow with milder sweet and caramel malts as well. Nice, mild lingering bitterness.
F: Light-medium bodied, smooth, and crisp with good carbonation. Slightly dry.
O: Overall, this is top-notch pale ale. Definitely deserves its hype and ranking. The balance between hop bitterness and fruitiness is exquisite and skillfully done. Showcases the Citra hops perfectly. Super drinkable. Can't beat the price point on this one either. One of my favorite beers in general and definitely a consistent go-to brew. 1,054 charactersBeerGuy8315, Nov 27, 2016

Pours a golden yellow with a moderate  bright white head. Dissapates quickly leaving moderate lacing on the glass and edge.
Aroma is all hop, dank, citrus, grapefruit rind possibly mango..underlying slight sweetness... Taste follows aroma with citrus, grapefruit peal/rind, mango balanced with a nice bitter bite.
Mouth feel is light, well carbonated 
Another excellent pale ale...This would see regular rotation if we had distribution here in Michigan... 586 charactersazurel, Nov 19, 2016

Taste follows along quite closely to the nose as grassy is the predominant characteristic in this beer. Get past that and we find a fairly sturdy malt backbone, best explained as slightly nutty with a green tea quality. Great complexity, no problems with depth either. Nice beer.  Kind of reminds me of an extra strength Jai Alai. 423 charactersgopens44, Nov 14, 2016

Leaves a spotty foamy lacing down the glass and the beer has a fair amount of very tiny bubbles rising up. The aroma is big citrus, big tropical fruits, slight caramel sweet malt, and maybe a bit of pine. The flavor is really well balanced between bitter and sweet. Lots of citrus and big tropical fruit, malt, and a nice building bitterness on the finish as i continue to drink. The feel average carbonation, a little sticky and dry on the finish, and med light to medium body. Needs a little more carbonation, imo. Very good pale ale. 628 charactersmatcris, Oct 15, 2016

A: Clear golden with hint of amber with 1-2 fingers of foamy off-white head with good retention but skimpy lacing.
S: Grapefruit and mango are the strongest with some orange and light melon aromas. There is just a hair of malt sweetness. No alcohol or yeast notes.
T: Explosive flavor with huge citrus grapefruit and lemon-lime and mango and guava to shape it out. A bit of malt sweetness and crackery character to try to balance things a little. No yeast or alcohol nots. Definitely on the continuum of all-Citra beers along with Super Session #2 and Double Sunshine from LFL. A little bit of dank, catty with some warming.
M: Very light and dry in the finish with low-medium carbonation. Super drinkable.
O: An impressive beer with a huge amount of flavor and aroma in a highly consumable package. Glad I got the chance to try it. 922 charactersargock, Oct 09, 2016

To the nose it was similar to walking through a citrus grove with the fruit near ripeness. Upon tasting I expected a big burst of citrus rind but it was light and somewhat sweet.  Taste of lemon and melon. Light and mild dryness. Good beer for a warm summer day.  Well balanced and refreshing. Definitely worth trying again. 408 characterswaterski, Sep 23, 2016

4.11/5  rDev -8.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Reviewed from notes. Poured from 16 oz. can into a Cigar City snifter glass.
A: Medium gold, mild haze, with a two finger white fluffy head. The head fades quickly, despite lots of carbonation bubbles running up the side.
S: Tropical fruit, melon, grassy and dank. Light cracker malt body, but the dry hopped aromas dominate.
T: Melon, dank and less citrus rind. Tropical fruits are here as well, but less than I got on the nose. Light cracker malts. Remnant grapefruit pith and dankness with a present but restrained bitterness in the hang.
M: The body is light overall, but average for style – it has more of a creamy mouthfeel than a lot of APAs. Low alcohol presence and a good amount of carbonation sensation.
O: This is the second can I’ve opened from BrewHub in Lakeland, FL…let’s make sure to get the provenance discussion out of the way. Whether it differs significantly from the Iowa-brewed stuff, I have yet to have an opportunity to evaluate for myself. On its own merits, this is good, but not crazy outstanding or style-defining or anything. It's certainly good enough to be a competitor for my purchases of canned APA/IPAs from the shelves around here. But it doesn’t blow Reef Donkey out of the water. 1,232 charactersmacrosmatic, Sep 12, 2016

A - Mildly-hazy golden-orange with a 2-finger white head and very nice lace.
S - Ripe pineapple, orange flesh, moderately dank/onion, touch of herbal spice, floral.  A very fragrant/pleasant but not overly-bold aroma.
T - Bursting with flavor!  Orange flesh and zest, mango, biscuit, pineapple, pine, honey, pepper, herbal spice and gooey hop bud goodness.  Nowhere near as dank/onion/garlic as expected from the aroma; it's just hinted at in the background, which I appreciate since I'm not a fan of a strong onion/garlic flavor.  The finish retains fruit and spice elements and the reasonable bitterness lasts quite awhile too.
M - Medium body and carbonation.  Starts silky-smooth, then gets resinous and lightly prickly before finishing dry.  Excellent.
O - Great flavors that are very well balanced.  Seek this one out! 916 charactersTucquan, Sep 07, 2016

4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours an opaque deep gold producing 3 fingers of frothy, beige, somewhat lasting head that leaves a wash, streaks & webs of lace. Aroma is a hop bomb of tropical fruit, citrus, earthy floral, cedar & resinous pine backed by caramel malt. Amazingly balanced for such a hop forward brew. Taste is fronted by mango, pineapple, grapefruit, orange with a floral dank earthiness & pine coming in at mid-sip all balancing with the malty caramel in the dry finish. Aftertaste is a dry leafy hoppiness & faint caramel. Mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation, lively on the tongue, juciy, becoming dry in the finish which is joined bt astringency in the aftertaste. What a showcase of Citra hops. Classed as a pale ale by the brewer I would have surely called it an IPA. Very nicely done regardless. Thanks to outdoor 7or24 for the opportunity! 848 charactersmothmanscott, Sep 04, 2016

Aroma is probably the first "5" I've encountered.  It was an immediate "wow!":  Tons of grapefruit with some pine. Smells like hop resin at it's finest
Taste is bitterness but it's balanced. There is fruit and some cracker and it all blends very well together.  A sip sort of ebbs and flows between malt and hops. 
Mouth-feel isn't something I usually give a lot of weight to but this one was top notch.  medium, but very crisp and very clean finish. Nothing off-putting about the taste in the least
There was no way this, or any beer, could have lived up to the aroma.  It was too good to be true.  Nonetheless this is a very solid beer that is worthy of it's reputation.  I would destroy these if they were available in NY. 811 charactersmackeyse, Sep 02, 2016

4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25"This single hop pale ale showcases the Citra hop for a well balanced beer that is delicate in body with a mild bitterness in the finish. Ferocious aromas of citrus and mango give way to pseudoSue's unique and refreshing taste that is clean and bright with just enough bite!" Brewed in the style of an American Pale Ale, available in 16 oz. canned 4 packs and on draft.
Poured from a 16 oz. can to a tulip glass.
(Appearance) Pours a creamy foam head of a buttery white color over a mildly hazy bright amber body with fine sediment and abundant, lively carbonation. Retention is very good and lacing is light and spotty. 4.5
(Smell) Bright hop aromas of citrus juice and tropical fruit pulp and a moderate bitterness is paired with a clean pale and lightly toasted bread malt body for a simple yet inviting aroma. Potency is moderate. 4.5
(Taste) Malt flavors of pale bread malts with a reserved sweetness is accented by a modestly bitter hop profile of floral, herbal and grassy hop character with undertones of citrus and tropical fruit. The hop profile overall isn't quite as potent as the aroma suggested, but generates enough bitterness to balance out the beer nicely, and stands out boldly above the lightly sweetened and very clean malt body, for a nicely hopped American Pale Ale. 4.25
(Mouthfeel) Texture is slick, smooth, lightly oily, mildly dry. Carbonation is modest, generating a mild frothiness and a medium crisp finish. Body is medium for the style, light/medium overall. Balance is nearly even hoppy bitter to sweet. Alcohol presence is very light and there are no off characters. 4
(Overall) A highly drinkable and flavorful hop-centered American Pale Ale that could go by the gallon. My biggest gripe is that the hop flavor falls a bit flat in comparison to what I anticipated from the aroma with more subtle herbal hop flavors and less brightness from citrus and tropical fruit. However, it is nicely preserved otherwise and doesn't have much that it needs to go against with the simple malt profile. It keeps respectably bitter, enough to maintain a solid balance and ensure the highest drinkability. Very tasty stuff, and highly recommended. 4.25

Aromas of bright citrus and subtle caramel malts, with solid grassy and piney hops characters. Amazingly balanced aromas, heavy on grapefruit and lemon zest. Flavors are tart and sweet citrus forward, loaded with grapefruit, lemon zest, and tangerine, followed by a solid roasted character, and then into  wet grass and resinous pine pitch notes, both bitter and dank. Perfectly balanced and bold, on an effervesced, crisp body. Frothy, dry, and slightly astringent finish, with a solid dank, wet hops linger. Awesome beer. 698 charactersGarthDanielson, Aug 30, 2016

L-  deep straw with a nice frothy white head. Beautiful. Not a whole lot of head retention. Just a thin circle around the circumference of the glass. Nice lacing though
S- fantastic. Lots of hops in the nose.  Pine, citrus, and lots of tropical fruits like mango and pineapple. Smells like straight up citra hops resin. I love citra hops!!
T- I'm wondering why Toppling Goliath doesn't call this an IPA. It's a very hop forward beer. Slight caramel sweetness, but the hops are the star here.  Bitter
F- bone dry. Which again makes me question pale ale vs IPA. Lots of carbonation, just on the right side of being too much. 
O-  I don't know how I've never heard of this until recently. A coworker told me about it a while back, and the local beer store just started carrying it. He tends to increase the price pretty quickly when he knows he has something special in his hands. I need to buy all of these he has before he does that. It's fantastic for hop heads. 1,025 charactersAllenjoseph5, Aug 16, 2016

Look- Pours a slightly hazy deep brilliant gold leaving behind a generous two fingers of creamy white foam despite a conservative pour. Nucleation bubbles stream from the bottom of the glass. 
Smell- Passionfruit, mango, pineapple, butyl and a hint of malt hiding in back. 
Taste- Juicy passionfruit, mango, and pineapple dominate to start. It opens up to some subtle floral notes and a hint of fresh rubber in the finish. 
Feel- On the thin side, but very lively on the palate from the tiny carbonation bubbles. There is a slight bitterness and slick finish. 
Overall- A very memorable and quite possibly the best Pale I've had. How they pack all that tropical juiciness in a beer under 6 percent is a mystery to me? The only very minor subtractions from making this a perfect 5 was the bit of over carbonation in the careful pour resulting in excess head, and a slightly thin feel. That aside, world class all the way! 1,077 charactersPrager62, Jul 31, 2016

4.42/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5I think this style (APA) and IPA have so many variables that will cause a review to be more subjective than objective. I live on the West Coast, but recently tried PseudoSue on a trip to the Midwest (Milwaukee) and was impressed. Not because it was just like my typical West Coast options in the category, but because it was different. I think it's important as we accept different entries from around the globe into a category, that we judge them like the BJCP would & not based on our preferences or favorite examples. This wasn't my favorite but over time, I could see it entering my top 10 for Pale Ales. 608 charactersHartCondition, Jul 20, 2016

After reading many reviews and finally getting a hold of some, I'm shocked at how highly rated this beer is. Fully aware this is not an IPA, but there is no punch or character to this beer - it has as much body as a bud light lime. Other reviewers raved about how juicy it is, how flavorful it is, etc. but I'm not sure we're reviewing the same beer... Huge letdown for a big fan of Citra hops. Undeserving of the 4.5 rating, as it's not even close to being in the same class as Lights On or Fort Point. Moon Man still takes the cake for pale ales from the Midwest (*haven't tried zombiedust*). 731 charactersMisterdubs, Jul 17, 2016

4.35/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Updated:
I originally did this review for Florida Sue and noted that I recall Decorah Sue being better. I recently had Decorah Sue again, I don't know how to score this. It's not quite to the point that it's a different beer, but  I definitely prefer the original. I'll try to note the differences.
L- Look is basically the same. Golden color with a thin white head. Good lacing. 4.5 for both. 
S- Again, nose is similar. Strong citra hops. Fruity notes of grapefruit and melon. Decorah is slightly more pronounced, but still a 4.5 for both. 
T- This is where they separate. Decorah Sue has just enough bitterness and some tropical fruit notes. It's well-balanced, smooth and refreshing. Florida Sue has a similar profile, but it's not as bright. It has kind of a muddled taste, the flavors don't seem to blend quite right. Florida is a slightly above average pale ale, while Decorah is excellent and up there with basically any I've had. 4 for Florida and 4.75 for Decorah. 
F- Not a big difference in feel. Good body, smooth. Not particularly heavy or light. 
O- Florida Sue is fine. It's not amazing, but it's solidly above average. I would give it about a 4.25 overall, which brings it to about a 4.22 composite (my original rating). Decorah Sue is an excellent pale ale that I would grab every time I see it, I would give it a 4.75 overall, which puts it at a 4.6 composite. Can't wait until TGB's new place is done and I can get the real stuff in Illinois! 1,468 charactersZoomslowik, Jun 28, 2016

Lovely pale golden pour, with a large buildup of head.  Large bubbles initially eventually fall to a foamy full cap.  Lacing is present, medium thick rows of stuck bubbles.
Nose is onion and dank notes.  Light hints of grapefruit, but a general vegetal impression.
Taste follows the nose, but the onion is more prevalent up front.  Grapefruit pith is a little more noticeable than expected in back, plus there's a little pine as well.  Overall, fairly classic hop profile.
Feel is light but not too light.  Warmth does bring a little wateriness as the carbonation fades, but until then, it's a nice, soft feeling with just enough carbonation to keep my palate awake.
Reminds me of a more drinkable version of Enjoy By or Ruination.  That perceived onion flavor, though, is not my favorite.  Can appreciate this brew, and will grab another if it comes my way, but won't go seeking it. 903 characterscjgiant, Jun 19, 2016

Like I expected; tons of citrus in the aroma, with a clearly defined bready malt presence. The citra hops are definitely the star here and lots of orange and grapefruit are present in the aroma and taste, along with a pleasant piney bite at the end. Not much lingering bitterness, dry finish. Medium to medium-full body. 414 charactersPhigg1102, Jun 14, 2016

No bitterness at all in the aftertaste, just crisp citrus goodness that makes you crave another swallow.  My only complaint...goes down too easy.  Nothing will make you pump the brakes on this one.

It's well balanced,  clean as ever, and has a bright crisp Citra hopped taste but it doesn't blow me away as I was expecting with its reviews. It's a very good pale ale, one of the best I've had, but this isn't one I'd go out of my way for again. I was told this was better than King Sue. I don't agree. 410 charactersTyler_m, Jun 12, 2016

The malt blends perfectly with the various hop characteristics producing a crushable yet full flavor APA. Bitterness is contained, while mild fruity hop notes lead. Medium-light body and average carbonation. 449 characterszonker17, Jun 05, 2016

Smell is pine and tropical fruit (really nice). Taste follows the nose with a nice orange flavor coming through and incredible balance. Mouthfeel is somewhat viscous with good body and relatively low bitterness. It kind of blends the pale ale and ipa styles, and the execution is almost perfect. Excellent beer. 426 charactersthatche2, May 27, 2016

This may knock Zombie Dust out of the top 5 beers I've had, the 16oz cans brewed in Lakeland, FL are good but this bomber from Decorah blows the cans out of the water. HUGE citrus notes on the nose, complimented by the most delicious fruity flavor. Beautiful orange color with strong lacing that sticks to every part of the glass. I'd even take this over King Sue, just wow. The perfect beer for me. Only complaint is how hard it is to get compared to the 16oz cans here. 556 charactersJaykiie, May 26, 2016

Thin but fluffy white head leaves a few streaky rings on the glass. Smell: mango, note of melon, lime, grassy, saltine back. Just a tiny pop of fruit loops goodness a citra single hop promises. Taste: limeade, grassy, sugared grapefruit rind, sugared dried mango. Medium bodied with creamy carbonation, thinning out and finishing a bit oily revealing it's sub 6% APA/seshIPA-ness. This is extremely flavorful. 529 charactersbabaracas, May 16, 2016

Really great nose full of citrus, tropical fruit. Notes of resin and spice. The taste follows closely, citrusy, piney, and resinous while in your mouth, big tropical fruit flavors on the aftertaste. Medium-light body, moderate-high carbonation, and a lingering bitter finish. Unquestionably an elite single hopped APA. 430 charactersBSiegs, May 05, 2016

Big citrus (grapefruit, tangerine).  Taste is very close to smell.  Citrus, slight pine.  Not heavy and easy drinking.  Finish is very good.  Mouth feel is pretty smooth considering the carbonation.  Some resin at the end.  
For me, it lives up to most of the talk/hype.  Excellent APA that is worth seeking out and definitely worth coming back to again and again. 479 charactersdexterk1, Apr 27, 2016

There's a massive 2 inch frothy off white head on top. It dissipates later to about a quarter inch covering the majority of the top.  Light lacing.  Heavenly aroma of citrus hops and light malt is present.  Upon my first sip there's a massive citrus and mosaic hop presence that builds in intensity at the back of the palate.  There's a nice, deep, lengthy hop burn on the tongue.  It is otherwise very sticky, resinous, and bone dry. 524 charactersFranziskaner, Apr 22, 2016

Lightly hazy orange copper color with a big white head that fades to a cap and laces great.  Notes of light grain, honey, herbal green stuff, citrus piths, grapefruit pulp, light pine and mango.  Mouthfeel is great, creamy then bursts with a nice carbonation push that fills the pallet with hops and finishes somewhat dry on a light medium body.  Very drinkable, almost crushable.  I think this is a great pale ale, I just don't put it as high as others and I'm missing what the rage is on this. 703 charactersHopBomb515, Apr 22, 2016

4.14/5  rDev -7.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a nice, slightly hazy, bright, orange color with a well-sized off-white head. Good retention, too.
Smell is immediately hoppy (piney & herbal) with some citrus and bread notes.
Taste is piney hops first and foremost with light notes of citrus, bread, alcohol and faint honey. Pretty good balance but seems more IPA than pale ale due to the hop load.
Desert dry from the sip through the swallow. Medium bodied, light-ish effervescence for the style. Herbal and pine grab the taste buds from the start and never let go. A good beer that would be better if it weren't an aspirational IPA. 591 charactersPorterLambic, Apr 21, 2016

Aromas are probably the best showcase of citra I have had yet. Loads of juicy citrus, hints of herbal and piney aromas and you can almost taste the resiny hop oils through your nose. Taste lives up to the aroma with plenty of citrus, herbal hints and loads of oils and resign. Malt balances nicely showcasing hop flavors with little to no alcoholic burn. 444 charactersFcolle2, Apr 19, 2016

Color is golden honey with a 1 finger white head and good lacing. Smells strongly of citrus fruits. Orangy and tangerine dominates the nose. The beer is incredibly smooth; tastes of grapefruit, orange, Lemon, slight pine, and ends with a mild bready malt. Carbonation is strong and fits very well with this beer. This is one of the best pale ales around and it showcases the citra hops incredibly. 498 charactersEchris21, Apr 15, 2016

I never thought I'd ever get a chance to try this high ranking APA. Reading the can it says "under special agreement with Lakeland FL".  Killer! We can now get this here in Florida, I think? On to the review: pours a slightly cloudy honey color. The head is very impressive 3 fingers leaving stringy lacing on lager glass.  Smells like resinous hops and sour oranges. Taste pretty solid! Not too hoppy nor malty yet still flavorful enough to Stand out from the rest. This is a great tasting APA and I see why it ranks so high.   I sure hope i can get this locally here in Tampa in the future, I'll definitely seek this out. 4.50 741 charactersKensWorld, Apr 15, 2016

Appearance:  A one finger head was poured that reduced to a thin layer.  It is a slightly hazy pale yellow orange color with great clarity and vision of bubbles coming up through the glass.  Spotty lacing down the glass as the beer was drank.
Smell:  Citrus, stone fruit, lemon, tangerine, grapefruit, some pine, and a little tropical hops followed by biscuity, toasted, caramel, and pale malts. 
Taste:  This beer gets tastier and better with every sip.  Very enjoyable, delicious, and tasty.  Grapefruit, tangerine, orange peel, pine, lemon, stone fruit, and a little tropical hops followed by caramel, pale, bready, biscuity, and toasted malts.  Light tingly bitterness and a little chewy.
Mouthfeel:  Smooth, light bodied, light lingering bitterness, slightly chewy, sessionable, and medium carbonation. 
Overall:  Second night in s tow having this beer.  Definitely growing on me and looking forward to the rest of the Pseudo Sues in my fridge now. 998 charactersFlounder57, Apr 10, 2016

I was expecting a NE haze bomb for some reason and this is not that. Great transparency through the coppery-colored body. Good frothy head with good signs of persistence and lacing. Radiant carbonation. 5
Hugely fruity aroma. Tropical notes like so many different pales and IPAs I've had recently. Perhaps I'll get tired of this, but at the moment, I"m loving it. Resin and pine stand out as well. A light and biscuity malt presence shows and seems perfect to complement the fruit. 4.25
Flavor is light, gentle, tame but also satisfying. Still very fruity and showing mango and papaya notes. Biscuity light malt to fill things out. Finishes with light earthy notes and black tea very faintly. 4.25
Feel-wise this does a great job of providing some fullness in body and still drinking lightly and easily. Bitterness is there but tame. Dry finish but not too dry. Bubbly carbonation up front that mellows out by the finish. Very nice. 4.5
This is good. Veddy good. 1,010 charactersONovoMexicano, Apr 07, 2016

     Sue is new to Florida distribution and I'm happy that she found her way down here thanks to Brew Hub/TG.  I've never had one from the original brewery, so nothing to compare it to as far as that goes.  Light copper color with a very bright aroma on the nose...super clean citrus, ripe mango and bitter hop notes.  The taste is quite good; grapefruit and orange with nice pine resin but not too sticky.  As many others have stated...Juicy.  Nice mouthfeel with good body and perfectly carbonated.  Pretty sure that I will be drinking more than a few of these this summer.  A very enjoyable beer. 668 charactersStephen_Hawkings_Drool, Apr 04, 2016

4.26/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Nice to have a solid all Citra pale ale in MN!  A nice approachable pale ale that is more session-able than most of my go-to's.  This review is based on pouring both into a snifter and trying directly out of the can. Both were pleasant experiences. For the look (obviously out of the snifter) - straw-like pale in color as one would expect however had a hazy appearance to it... not your normal haze, but something else - actual small visible particles? Not sure if this was cold haze or if it was from hop extract? Have seen similar stuff from older Abrasive cans, but this was not that old of a can. Didn't deter me from drinking. For the smell, out of the snifter, much better Citra grapefruit nose (as expected vs. out of the can) dominates everything. I love a good Citra nose and this doesn't disappoint. Taste is a bit thin on the body and as a result, I perceived it to be slightly astringent (the main knock on the beer for me). It was very dry which can be nice, but I was hoping for it to be just a bit more "citra juicy" when the body balances in a bigger way... Mouth-feel was fine and overall this beer is very enjoyable. Glad to have it in MN liquor stores now! 1,176 charactersSebastRain, Apr 03, 2016

Love the tropical smell, and it carries into the taste - almost like a grapefuit with a nice malt balance.  Was expecting a hop blast but didn't get it.....which is a nice change.  Shouldn't forget this is an APA.

Served: 28 Mar 2016
Appearance: Pours a great golden yellow color with a soft one finger head that sticks around for a bit, but not forever. Good carbonation coming up from the bottom of the glass. Slight haze, but nothing extreme.
Smell: Very pungent citrus and pine hop smells. Quite resinous. Not much malt on the nose. Very clean smelling, which is refreshing.
Taste: Wow, what a great beer. Very assertive citra hops and everything that comes with them- grapefruit, mango, pine, lemon peel, and a pinch of fresh mown grass. The hop flavors cut across the palate nicely and leave you thirsting for more. Slight malt sweetness but nothing too noticable. Very clean tasting.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with medium-high carbonation. Drinks great.
Overall: Definitely deserving the rating it gets and very comparable to Zombie Dust. I have to say that this one edges out Zombie Dust slightly due to its awesome format- who doesn't love 16oz cans?! 1,005 charactersBeric, Mar 31, 2016

Smell is citrus, mango and some funk, very nice. Taste is fantastic for a Pale Ale as it drinks more like an IPA to me, which is my favorite style. Appearance is typical PA, golden and clear. Opinion: I am going to load up every time I see this. It's a great tropical forward hoppy pale ale that I always search for. This is a good one. Get you some. 547 charactersJdiggity, Mar 29, 2016

According to the stamp on the bottom of the can (love the label, by the way), this was canned on February 11, 2016. This is my first Iowa beer, let alone first Toppling Goliath beer, and I’m stoked to get a shot at it.
Poured into a Boundary Bay pint glass (possibly the oldest surviving beer glass I own, I just realized), this was a semi-clear, golden amber color, with a big, sudsy off-white head that hung about for some time. Lots of sticky lace globs, briefly appear, then slide back down the sides of the glass to rejoin the beer.
Juicy aroma! I don’t know what hop(s) are used in my favorite semi-local APA (Field 41, for those fans listening at home), but this reminds me a lot of that beer. Very bright and citrusy, with a nice backbone of bitter hop aroma to keep it from being mistaken for some sort of sweet fruit juice, plus a little spiciness. It smells absolutely delicious. 
The taste is much like the aroma. Citrusy sweet and citrusy bitter, with some bitter pine and spice notes to keep things from drifting off to Orange Julius land (love me some Orange Julius as a desserty kind of thing; in beer, not so much). Nice, restrained dryness at the swallow. This went way too fast.
Light-to-medium bodied, with a resiny, oily mouthfeel that would be unremarkable in some IPAs I’ve had, let alone an APA.
This is a great beer. It’s like a slightly fuller flavored, slightly stronger version of what Bale Breaker brings to the style, and that’s perhaps the best compliment I could give it. Plus, it’s in a tallboy can! I need more of this. Thank you, @Ri0! 1,630 characterswoemad, Mar 27, 2016

S: Very strong hop aroma. Smells of citrus, pine, and spices. Citrus aromas are more subtle than expected from other massively citra hopped beers.
T: Big, juicy hop flavor without the same bitterness of an IPA. Hops dominate the taste with the malt flavors taking a distant second. A bit an the drier side for an APA.
F: Between light and medium bodied. Seems like this one would be quite sessionable. 
O: Great display of the citra hops without allowing any unpleasant flavors or aromas to show through. Malt flavor is present in a support role, but the big juicy hop taste is what makes this beer stand out. 654 charactersCheesebach, Mar 26, 2016

This beer pours beautifully. Solid finger of a soapy white head. Pretty damn hazy orange color to "The Sue" with a fair amount of lacing. Can't ask for much more out of an APA. Sexy indeed.
Love that citra. Predominantly citrus and mango with a little bit of hop resin that gives a bit of a piney vibe. Nice caramel malt sweetness. Smells great, but it's not "bursting" -- again, probably because of its age. Regardless, I'm really loving what I'm getting here, and in terms of APA's , it's near the top: despite how "old" this can is.
This hits the tongue with a ton -- in a good way -- of carbonation. Very prickly carbonation opens the taste buds to the hops like a tongue scraping from a good ol' T-Rex. The flavor follows the nose with a super clean citrus, mango, and pineapple flavor, with a nice dose of pine on the back end as well. The malty sweetness in the nose isn't quite as prevalent in the flavor, which has this beer coming off very nearly like an IPA to me. The finish is super refreshing with the perfect amount of hop bitterness for the style.
A delight, even at a little over 3 months old.  I hope I manage some more of this in the future, as it's one of the best APA's I've had... easily. Maybe not quite the level of Zombie Dust, but it's up there. 1,433 charactersSerialTicker, Mar 26, 2016

The bottling code shows that this one is about three months old. Poured right from the fridge into my nonic pint glass.
L: Pours a golden honey amber with about a half-inch of eggshell head that falls after a good bit and leaves substantial lacing on the glass. Quite cloudy, with moderate visible carbonation.
S: Dank, spicy, fruity, and fresh--this one has a really nice, complex bouquet. There are some pineapple, mango, and guava tropical hop notes, as well as citrus, pine, and more "herbal" notes. A bit of cracked pepper and dry cracker malts in the mix, as well.
T: Ripe fruit and more herbal and piney hop notes dominate the flavor profile, which is big from start to finish. The front end showcases some great tropical fruit flavors atop cracker and bread-like malts. There are more herbal and earthy notes that begin to poke through at the front; these take on a more decidedly pot-like quality as the flavor moves into the middle and back. There's some nice spiciness and herbal complexity that emerges in the middle, and this carries into the back end. There are pine notes in the middle that become more pronounced at the close, with the closing hop bitter taking on a more resinous quality. The malts are just present enough without distracting from the wonderful hop profile.
F: Great mouthfeel on this one: it's on the lighter side of medium-bodied, with a great level of carbonation to keep things creamy and effervescent where they should be. This one never feels watered-down, though it certainly has nice drinkability. With just a bit of lingering hop bitter at the close, it's far from syrupy or sticky.
O: I really wish that I had a fresher can to review because I'm sure my review would have been higher. I'm a huge fan of the APA style and an even bigger fan of one of my state's best APAs, Moon Man from New Glarus. PseudoSue has made a pseudo-defector out of me: this is, hands down, the most flavorful and complex APA I've ever tried. There are hop notes in this beer that I don't think I've experienced in nearly the same intensity in any other APA or IPA. This one is well-worth seeking out. 2,287 charactersDabblinWiscCraft, Mar 24, 2016

Piney and resiny flavor, maybe some molasses for balance, pretty standard well-made hoppy ale.

Been wanting to try this for a while now.  Classic Citra hop nose, you know it right away.   Not incredibly juicy, but nice.  Soft mouthfeel, good for the style.  Not much bitterness.  
I have to be honest here, I have no idea how this beer got so hyped.  I know this is contract brewed in Florida, and the can could be fresher.  For now though, I'd take Zombie Dust over this any day of the week.  Still a very good APA though. 486 charactershoppytobehere, Mar 18, 2016

4.67/5  rDev +4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a hazy golden color, with a relatively small off-white head. Quite significant lacing as well. Looks the part. 
Smells of citrus-laden hops, and exotic fruity sweetness. 
Taste is phenomenal in as much as it is both substantive, and constrained at the same time. Subtle sweetness as a result of the tropical fruits. With just the right amount of bitterness from the hops. Feel is juicy, with a relatively light body and low carbonation. 
I've been looking forward to see this on the shelves of my local liquor store for ages, and it most certainly did not disappoint. One of my all-time favorites!
Consumed on March 15th. Canned on February 11th. Purchased a four-pack of 16oz cans for $13. 700 charactersWer34truh, Mar 15, 2016
4.1/5  rDev -8.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4It's American and it's got a T-Rex on the can. I was expecting a very powerful pale ale and it's not. This is a very fruity and balanced PA, just like Sierra Nevada PA. The citra smells good, but honestly I've had better smells in IPAs using citra, like in Scandinavian IPAs. On a blind taste, I would probably say it's a British beer, because it's well done and balanced. The smell doesn't wear off at all though, and the taste grows on you. It doesn't challenge me in any way though, it's just very nice to drink. I prefer to be challenged, like from what I've tasted recently from Modern Times. Is it worth the 4.5/5 average it's getting on BA ? No I don't think so. It's worth 4.1-4.2. In the forums there's often talk of how some beers are over-rated, and this is clearly one. It's a very good beer, but it's not much better than say Sierra Nevada. I remember a youtube blind taste on Zombie Dust, which is the best APA on BA of the last decade, and they rated it something like 8/10, very good but not mind blowing. PseudoSue is very well done, just not complex enough. I would have liked a bit more carbonation too. 1,122 charactersHallu, Mar 15, 2016

Aromas of a bouquet of tropical fruit. Taste is fruit-y up front with a nice hoppy finish that is not too bitter. Really very mellow interaction between the fruits and hop flavors.
Tastes as refreshing as a beer can get. First pale ale I genuinely loved. If only I had to travel to Iowa more often ...

14 : 02 CHEERS"
A — Pours an orangey amber hue into the glass, there is a puffy and tall off-white colored head that forms and leaves behind some epic rings of lacing with each sip, sure looks nice.
S — Smell is tropical and rich, increasing with intensity as it warms, there are notes of bitter citrus peel and pith, notes of grapefruit, lime, melon rind, some light piney and herbaceous notes as well, like pine needles and eucalyptus.
T — Taste is much like the nose, though amplified, extra notes of pine, lemon, melon, honeydew, cantaloupe, earth, pine cone, forest floor, pine sap, birch, chewy and rich hop notes abound. All on top of an easy going, but solid supporting foundation of semi-sweet caramel malt and oats, a sturdy foundation and an excellent showcase of balance.
M — Medium bodied, easy going, super refreshing and clean, a lingering light bitterness leaves you wanting to come back for sip after sip.
O — Incredible overall, tough to agree with a perfect score of 100 though, this is very well done, but it is what it is, an extremely solid and juicy American Pale Ale, this is very reminiscent of Grunion, though not as sharp, and similar to Dale's, just not as malt dominated. Very good and worth seeking out. 1,315 charactersMoose90, Mar 01, 2016

Falls decadently clinging. In the light of my living room the beer appears to have a slight orange blush to it like a haze, only a hue. In direct light there is no orange, the beer is yellow with a perfect stream of bubbles that steadily rise from the center.
Nose is mango. Outrageous and ripe! A soft and very broad hop floral that is sweet. Crakery malt, light pepper from the hops. A light floral nectar. This beer smells like what attracts bees to flowers. Earthy grapefruit rind and hints of lemon.
Dazzling flavor. Bright malt with just a hint of sweetness that combines with the hop pepper. It's like a peppery cracker. Mango is juicy and ripe and fills up the middle. The citrus on the palate is fresh and crisp and like a light tang. No real tartness to the flavor. The grapefruit peel is earthy and heady with fragrance. Sweet lemon as it warms. The beers is light to the perception but actually has a good solid mouthfeel. The alcohol makes up most of the weight on the tongue but then that sensual dry crackery malt is creamy and round. Flavor is complex from the citra hop. Bitterness is moderate but not too strong. It's as though this beer wants to show you the hops as a flower. This beer opens like a flower on the nose and on the palate. The finish is what clinches it though. It's like a bit of bitter sap from the stem.
I love it. This is one of the best pale ales I have ever had. Crushable, dangerously drinkable and shows one hop in all it's delicate and robust complexity. 1,598 charactersutopiajane, Feb 29, 2016

4.2/5  rDev -6.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This was a touch underwhelming, but I had the Florida version if that means anything.  The beer pours a nice clear yellowish color.  Nice head and nice lacing.  The aroma is really nice.  No question that citra hops are the star of the show and little restraint was used in finishing hops and dry hopping.  Lots of mango, melon, and grapefruit in the nose.  The taste is where I find this one lacking a bit.  The malt base is a little under pronounced and a tad grainy.  The flavor is prevalent, but its just missing something to me. I was also hoping for a bit of a drier finish.  Don't get me wrong, really good beer, and I would drink and buy again, but I would prefer others in a perfect world. 698 charactershardysf, Feb 12, 2016

Taste - Tons of citrus...tons of herbaceous notes. Some grapefruit as well.

4.18/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Possibly known as the best American Pale Ale known to man, I had to try this. 
Canned on : 1/15/16 (very fresh!)
Appearance is golden with tinges of bronze and orange, with a touch of haze. The head is large and towering, although the lace it leaves could be a bit more exotic. 
Aroma is of onions and raisins, some old fruit peels too. Can't say I'm a fan of the onion craze. 
Flavor is both underwhelming and absolutely amazing at the same time. I've had nothing like it. It starts off with water basked in pine needles, a bite of white onion; strikes a great balance of pale malts and grapefruity hop. Tropical and bright. My biggest gripe is that the profile loses steam quickly and grows boring. Could use more piney bite. The finish is of onion and rotted fruit rinds.
Feel is creamy and smooth, yet delivers a tight crisp feel overall. 
Overall, my favorite American Pale Ale is still Mirror Pond. This one is really great though, and I would have it again. Nice work, TGB. 986 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Feb 04, 2016

4.19/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25A bright and medium colored orange pour hits the glass in a swirl of haze that quickly clears up. Body of the beer is mostly translucent with a huge head that hangs around forever. Lacing is awesome. The scent of this beer hits the nostrils as expected for a citra pale ale, with a big dose of piney and herbal hops bitterness. When you take a drink of the beer the hops bitterness is the first flavor hitting the tongue. The hops start off lightly floral and citrus in nature and move toward a pine and cedar flavor. Light malt backbone is noticeable slightly at the back end of the drink and provides just enough base to balance the hop bitterness. On the palate, this one is balanced and easy drinking. Nothing weighs particularly heavy and the hops are just strong enough to appease the hop-head.
Overall, this is a very solid pale ale for the casual hop lover and the seasoned pale ale drinker alike. 906 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jan 30, 2016

For whatever reason, this batch tastes a bit better than the other ones (not that the others were bad). Just a great, easy drinking hoppy brew. I do not know how to do the super fancy reviews, but compared to other 100 rated beers I think Sue has the best initial hops/flavor kick.  So glad this is becoming more readily available, good job Toppling Goliath you have made a loyal customer. 441 charactersWebzombie, Jan 29, 2016

L: A very nice-looking deep amber. Three finger head with decent retention, leaving some lacing and an enduring cap.
S: CITRA HOP HEAVEN. So great. Grapefruit, orange, tangerine, plus tropical fruits. Not much floral or pine in this hop, but that's OK.
T: Muted, compared to nose. A bit of citrus, followed by malt profile and mildly bitter finish. Could be due to age of can. Still quite good, but you sense there may have been more.
F: Light-medium bodied, mild carbonation, very drinkable. Good balance and well constructed.
O: My first Toppling Goliath experience is a good one. Looking forward to more. 748 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Jan 26, 2016

4.63/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5COD 12/29/15.  Clear amber pour that is slightly darker than golden.  World class head volume, lacing and retention.
World class nose that really brings it for an APA.  Citrus (orange, tangerine) over a surprising level of dankness with mild pine elements.  As it warms, the citric elements come more forward, adding mango and pear.
Light medium body with an almost slick texture fueled by hop oils.  Normal carbonation level with a bit of effervescence in the middle and a slightly prickly finish.
The flavor profile is world class - perfectly balanced, quite complex and just the right intensity of flavor and bitterness.  The citric flavors of the nose cascade over a dank base.  Orange, pear and mango lead as the first wave of biscuit arrives.  These shift to tangerine with a bit of rind and a rising dank influence.  The middle has a subtle bitterness with both pine and rind aspects which, as they fade, yield the sweetest period for the palate.  The finish is a bit dry and slowly fades away leaving a slightly sweet tropical mango and pine aftertaste over a dank background.  Alcohol is completely covered and only reveals it's presence with a subtle burn at the back of the throat in this brewing masterpiece. 1,223 characterstillmac62, Jan 25, 2016

It has a soft, slightly malty body, a gently sweet citrusy/mango flavor, and a mild bitter finish. A lot of flavor, none of it too aggressive and a very drinkable texture. Even with a high abv and a a tall can, it's easy to finish and a joy to drink.  My first entrance into the now-legendary Toppling Goliath lineup, and while I won't call it mind-blowing, it's surely wonderful and worth every sip. 545 charactersjmasher85, Jan 25, 2016

Consumed: Jan. 14, 2016
Misc.: Canned on Dec. 13, 2015 at 1:53 p.m.
Of course Sam sent me this with six Surly Abrasive’s. It feels like I am about two shipments behind, but will after to wait after the thaw. Was really excited for this one and kind of hesitant that a pale ale could really be that good. Here’s to heaven. 
Poured an orangeish, pale, hazy color with two fingers of frothy white head. A few bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Above average spiderweb lacing on the sides of the glass. Average-to-soft retention. (Sight - 4.00)
First thing I thought on the smell was - this is really a pale ale and not an IPA? Got Citra hops, sharp grapefruit, tangerine, tropical hops, bitter mango rind, lime and dank resin. (Smell - 4.50)
Taste followed the nose nicely, getting grapefruit pulp, grapefruit juice, Citra hops, tangerine, juicy orange, tropical hops, mango, pineapple, juicy dank resin and hints of floral hops. Every single taste is pulp. Awesome. (Taste - 4.75)
Medium-to-light body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, juicy, citrus finish. (Feel - 4.75)
This was just an awesome beer. The best APA I’ve ever had by a long shot (sorry original Alpine Hoppy Birthday). (Overall - 4.75)

Anyway, onto the review. 
L- light golden with minimal haze, tons of lacing in my NB globe glass. 
S- WOW - Orange zest, orange marmalade, grapefruit and a little pineapple. Just a blast of semi sweet citrus fruit! Fantastic!! 
T- While not as much of an impact as the nose (which isn't much of a knock) - taste follows nose. citrus dominates, with sweet orange, grapefruit, pineapple, with a lingering bitterness. Hardly any discernible malt profile beside a minimal crackery base for the hops to do their magic.
F- Light and crisp, while keeping an intense juiciness to it. It manages to be juicy without being to sweet. 
O- Met my high expectations, ecstatic I got to try something from TG! This will have to be part of the routine as I drive back from Chicago! 995 charactersCO-Bloom, Jan 19, 2016

L: Golden color with a half finger of head. Looks like a west coast style APA/IPA.
S: Ton of tropical fruit (pineapple, mango, grapefruit) with some light dank elements (onion, pepper) in the background. 
T: Taste is defiantly more mild than the aroma. Mostly grapefruit, grapefruit rind, and a little onion and pepper. Strong bitterness for an APA (on par with an IPA or DIPA really).
F: Medium body with a dry finish. Nothing really special about the mouthfeel.
Overall this is a good hop forward APA. The citra may have fallen off some since canning so I'll be interested to try a very fresh can. 632 charactersMyThoughtsExactly, Jan 18, 2016
4.24/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Pours a clouded amber-golden color with a fluffy big head. After a few minutes, the head collapses to a thick lacing, which is still half a finger broad.
Smells of ripe citrus, together with biscuit malts and a flowery vanilla note. A lemony crispness prevails, producing juicy freshness. A layer of orange rind adds to the citraic richness, pushing its juiciness of the beer, together with a note of resin.
Drinks very soft, while the beer actually has a higher carbonation to it, which gets entirely coated by cream. 
Tastes of white bread malts, juicy lemon and its great softness straight from the beginning. The malts turn sweeter afterwards, while the beers hop profile develops a nice crispness, featuring a flower coated dryness. Finishes with a noteable malt backbone, while the beers sweetness seemingly results from the juicy fruits, orange and citrus. This creating a fantastic, exotic fruit forward finish with a pleasant, malt accompanied dryness, finding its greatness in its balance.
Another hop forward beer, which convinces by its world class mouthfeel and a perfect balance between hops and malts. The hops provide enough punch to stand out from the malts easily, while I find it astonishing that it is possible to create a beer which is that flavorful, while it drinks easy as lemonade. While not being particularly bitter, neither punching my tastebuds, this combines a fantastic fruitiness with well nuanced crisp and bitter characteristics. 1,467 charactersaleigator, Jan 18, 2016

Aromas of citrus, pine, mango, and a bit of sweetness.
Taste is sweetness up front followed by grapefruit, mango, with a piney/resinous finish.
Mouthful is smooth and somewhat creamy, medium body, and moderate carbonation.  A bit of alcohol warming on the finish.
Balanced and clean.  The flavors work together nicely.  Enjoyable and easily drinkable, more so as it warms. 441 charactersSlack, Jan 17, 2016

That, and I divested myself of a number of recent duplicates, making me look like a generous trader. It was a win-win for all involved!
From the CAN: "This single hop pale ale showcases the Citra hop for a well balanced beer that is delicate in body with a mild bitterness in the finish. Ferocious aromas of citrus and mango give way to pseudoSue's unique and refreshing taste that is clean and bright with just enough bite!"; "Live beer, please refrigerate."
I was able to visit Sue in June 2015 during my most recent visit to ChiRaq/Viet Rahm while at The Field Museum for the Viking exhibit so it seems apropos to be drinking this beer!
The Crack! revealed another brimful craft CAN and I could barely CANtain my glee! The only thing that kept me from CANducting an inverted Glug was that it was a 16-fl. oz. tallboy CAN & they CAN be hard to CANtrol once started. Still, a heavy-handed Glug brought forth just over two fingers of dense, rocky, French Vanilla-colored head with great retention. Color was Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7) with NE-quality clarity and as such, I welcomed the Gelt Gang of Croesus, Midas & Mammon into my kitchen for the second time this day. Nose was redolent with hops, very assertive with notes of grapefruit and pine, which was a far cry from my last APA, which was more restrained. Mouthfeel was medium. The taste was an onslaught of hops, but not bitterness, which kept it appropriate for an APA. I got soft fruit flavors of peach and mango up front, underlain by grapefruit and pine, which was a real change of pace. Finish was semi-dry, very fruity, so that it CANnot be thought of as outright dry. Man, no wonder that this is so popular! It was a bargain at a six-pack in return. 1,928 characterswoodychandler, Jan 12, 2016

Taste is slightly malty and sweet at first, hoppy with some tropical notes but also floral and resiny. It's fascinating how they pulled out all the major hop profiles from just Citra hops. Gets slightly bitter on the finish and aftertaste but not too much. Medium body with crisp carbonation. Really good overall but I think it's a bit over-hyped. 443 charactersCiocanelu, Jan 05, 2016

4.28/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25A nice, mellow citra hop affair with a little bitterness in the finish. Nothing overpowering, and while I'd like the beer to be a LITTLE more citra hop-forward, it's well balanced and extremely easy to drink. I was extremely excited to finally find a place near me that stocks TG beer, and so far (2 beers in), I'm not disappointed. Not similar to Zombie Dust in terms of overall taste, but occupies the same space that ZD (and Lizard King) do: Great single hop beers that are balanced and easy to drink. Nice job by the guys (and gals) from Iowa!
Edit: Came back to this with a fresher batch, and one more thing that stands out (and had me tweak the score very slightly) is that there is a creaminess to the beer that I missed the first time. The creaminess balances out the bitterness of the hops so that this is really easy-drinking. 837 charactersSeanBond, Jan 04, 2016

Dank smell, with citrus notes - grapefruit and lime - plus a bit of pine resin and some honey. The taste is dank, dominated by citrus hops. One can also taste what feels like unripe tropical fruits.

5.0 A:  Moderately hazed golden orange color.  One and a half fingers of dense creamy off-white head.  Retention is great and glass covering lacing is left.
5.0 S:  Blast of resiny and citrusy hops - mango predominant with orange and pineapple following.  The hops annihilate any chance of smelling the malts, but it's not a big deal since it's such a potent and wonderful nose.
4.5 T:  Mild-moderate bitterness.  Again huge resiny and citrus hop flavor.  Mango predominant but not as potent as the nose.  Pineapple and orange again.  Malts are generally neutral with maybe a hint of caramel.
4.25 M:  Lighter medium body.  Good moderate carbonation.  Moderately creamy and super smooth.
5.0 D:  Very good beer with intense aroma.  Manageable bitterness makes this super quaffable. 832 charactersDavoleBomb, Dec 04, 2015

It has a one finger chalk white head that laces the glass lightly on the way down. The smell is very citrusy, orange peel with a hint of pine. The taste is citrus fruits with a great malt partnership. This is a world class beer without a doubt. I've had it on tap at the brewery and out of bottles both from Iowa and Florida, all being very consistent and impressive. 414 charactersMeyers1023, Nov 21, 2015

Some foam lacing.  Yeasty, mild aroma. Tastes of citrus hops.  Very strong hops flavor.  I don't think adding hops to an ale automatically makes it better.  The hops in this pale ale are definitely extreme for a pale ale with very little malt to balance it.  The citrus flavors are also highly accentuated.  Nice experiment, but I think I would take a little more balance in this case. 488 characterscmf, Nov 20, 2015

I've noticed variation among batches, in both appearance and flavor/aroma. First batch I tried this summer was hazy, juicy and damn near perfect. Recent batches were clear in appearance and I picked up more piney notes. Regardless, I consider this beer world-class and will purchase whenever it is available. 434 charactersjstigen, Nov 19, 2015
4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75From a 12 oz. bottle dated 10/26/15, which makes it 3 weeks old. Color is a lovely orange-gold, with green highlights. Slightly hazy. A 1-finger head is dense and settles to a fine film that sticks around. A bit of lacing. 
The smell is grapefruit and pine, tangerine and ripe melon. After it warms a bit, some dank kicks in. Probably the best-smelling APA I've experienced. Taste is pretty much the same--fresh grapefruit and pine, which moves into an earthy fruitiness, then a brief doughy breadiness, and finishing with more pine resin, though it's more subtle than many heavily hopped ales. Truly fantastic. 
The feel is right on carbonation, but a tad watery in the middle before a modestly dry finish. The wateriness has just a hint of slickness that makes this very drinkable, but I prefer just a bit more body myself. 
Overall this is one of the finest APA's I've ever had the pleasure to drink. Well done. 917 charactersBeers-es, Nov 19, 2015

S - Fresh pine. Almost wintery. Complex hops. Lots going on here. Slight sweetness toward the end. Deep, rich, earthy aromas. Penetrating. 
T - Juice! But not the fleeting variety. This hits you hard and slowly transforms as it sinks deeper into my mouth. The way this beer flows through the stages of deliciousness is incredible! Masterful. This is the first time I've been able to sit and enjoy Toppling Goliath and holy shit do I now see what the fuss is all about. So rich and "full". Most pale ales are thin and leave you wanting more, but this is entirely satisfying. Crisp, clean finish. Artfully crafted. 
F - One of the best parts about this beer! It's like a meal! Punches you in the face from the get-go, holds your mouth open and fills it with whipped cream and packing peanuts. So chewy, so hearty. Never falls flat. An absolute delight to drink. 
O - Beautiful pale ale! More flavor and body than most IPAs! A great introduction to Toppling Goliath. I imagine it can only go up from here... and that's hard to imagine. 1,113 charactersagreenman19, Nov 17, 2015

I wish the taste was a strong as the the nose but in terms of an APA this is very solid. Feel is ver crisp and high carbonation.

Appearance: It poured a slightly hazy golden orange colour with a one finger white head that fades fairly quickly to a thin foamy layer but leaves lots of nice spotty lacing.
Aroma: A nice mix of citrus and tropical fruits with orange, lemon, grapefruit, passionfruit and mango. There are hints of pine here and there.
Taste: Starts off tropical with mango and passionfruit leading the way in addition to hints of peach and apricot along the way. The finish is a nice lightly bitter grapefruit and orange pith. The balance between sweet and bitter here is perfect.
Mouthfeel: Dry, crisp, light to medium bodied with mid to high carbonation.
Overall: I loved it. Lived up to its hype and is in my opinion better than Zombie Dust. I really need to find more of this must buy beer. 864 characterskitch, Oct 20, 2015

The head is off-white, fluffy and leaves great lacing. The nose is very obviously Citra. Loads of mango and grapefruit with touches of pine and a slightly sweet hint as well. The taste starts out with a nice bready backbone that has a good sweetness to it. The Citra then comes through bringing the mango, grapefruit and a small hint of pine.

LOOK: Pours with a half finger's worth of white foam that dissipates into a line after a minute and a half. Rising bubbles are small in size and subtle in quantity. Yellow-orange in color with a high amount of cloudiness. Lacing is thin and moderate.
SMELL: Strong aromas of mangos, grapefruit, and oranges meet with subtle bready malts and piney hop aromas.
TASTE: Strong orange and grapefruit along with mild mango flavors enter initially and are immidieately followed by mild bready malt and piney hop flavors. Subtle bitter hop flavors finish off this taste symphony as all previous flavors continue to push on, but mango flavors grow slightly stronger.
FEEL: Medium-bodied and highly carbonated. Goes down rough and finishes with a strong dryness.
NOTE: This was an amazing tasting brew. The crappy mouthfeel prevented this from receiving a higher rating. 929 charactersMyotus, Oct 05, 2015

Smells of wet hops, hint of pepper, sweet malt, strong citrus hops, earthy malt, and a hint of alcohol.  Fits the style of an American Pale Ale.

A: Moderate pour yields 1/4 finger with decent retention.  Chill hazy brass color.  Good looking.  More head please.  
S: Resiny hops, bright mango and pineapple.  Slight harsh esters.
T: Fruity in a tropical way.  Very nice.  Finishes bitter which persists the longer and deeper I get into the pint.  Delightful.  Finish has a tad bit of green banana flavor.
M: Drinkably thin but heartily substantive.
O: Maybe superior to Zombie Dust!  But similar (ZD has no haze and has a more malty finish)  Complements Thai coconut chicken soup well. 602 charactersdfillius, Sep 27, 2015

Taste goes with the nose. So good! Perfect amount of hoppiness, as well.

T- A great combination of everything above. I just put this head-to-head w Zombie Dust and Pseudo remains my favorite APA. 
O- Simply the best of its style I've had—The hops are so well rounded, not astringent or bitter (i.e., not cheating by over-hopping it as is common w this style), balanced in every way. Very glad they started doing 4-packs in Madison. Steal at $9 per—only complaint is that TG just needs to make its distribution more regular. Completely lives up to the hype. 563 charactersMadtownbeerguy, Sep 13, 2015

3.91/5  rDev -12.7%look: 3.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Date on the bottle of 8/10/15.
Appearance: Super hazy orange with about a finger of white foam.
Aroma: Dank/fruity/tropical citra hops. Touch of bready malt.
Taste: Quite clean with no depth in the malt department but it's not needed. I find citra to be quite palate-consuming when used for bittering and that comes there here with forceful bitterness. It's a pungent bitterness nearly masks the more subtle mango flavor that comes from late addition and dry-hopping with citra. At 5.8% ABV the depth of flavor is definitely lacking. Finish is smooth with a bit more of the fruity hop tones. Aftertaste of fading bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Thin to medium in body and over-carbonated. Good drinkability but a bit harsh.
Final Thoughts: Maybe my expectations were too high going in, but this one just didn't do it for me. Citra is my favorite hop and it just didn't shine in the expected way here. Still awesome to have gotten my hands on a four-pack and it beats out 9/10 of the other IPAs on the shelf. Would I drink it again? Yep, probably going to make the trip down to the taproom soon to check out the rest of the lineup. 1,126 charactersJamesMN, Sep 12, 2015

I had a Mo'Citra an hour ago and am sure thats having some affect on my tastebuds. Definetely worth a fair trade from a west coast beer lovers point of view.

I had this beer side by side with a Ten Ninety Citra Pale Ale and they are nearly identical.  One gets a perfect score and the other is slammed.  This is a solid APA that everyone at the party enjoyed.  And all agreed with the side by side comparison! 321 charactersNiners49, Sep 05, 2015

Overall: A solid beer. Can see me tossing some back at a kickback or party while peeps drink their AALs...hahaha. Wish I had access to this bad boy. With that said, I kind of don't get the 100. Definitely a good beer but its body was too light. I get its an APA but not big enough of a brew. I probably just need to get my hands on some King Sue. lol 562 characterssittinggc, Sep 05, 2015

Still, probably the second best APA i've had. I also thought King Sue was one, if not the best beer I've ever had, so im probably unfairly comparing it to KS. 620 charactersgovlady, Sep 04, 2015

Orange gold hazy color with nice inch of white head that settles quickly, bit of lacing holds
Smells of Mango sherbet blended with Zombie Dust , hint of some other fruits maybe cantaloupe, if they make candles that smell like this I want one 
taste citrus, mango, bit of hops but not at all harsh
sort of drys the back of the mouth, but not unpleasant not really a bite
Very glad I got to try this , and will drink one or two more fairly soon 510 charactersThirstygoat, Sep 04, 2015
4.52/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Look - Golden and light, translucent with a light white head
Smell - GRAPEFRUIT! almost nothing else present
Taste - Better than I could dream for.  Tremendous pale ale with a strong fruity taste (mostly grapefruit and citrus) with a hop backbone. Super juicy but fairly thin for the amount of flavor packed in, hope and pine round out the taste.  For a beer under 6%, the tastes are almost overwhelming...
Feel - Drinks very nicely, light body with moderate carbonation. Absurdly refreshing
Overall - One of the top 3 pale ale's I've ever had (if we are going by what the brewery categorizes it as) 603 charactersPourharddrinkslow, Sep 04, 2015

Aroma is cheesy at first with some sulfur and citrus notes. It smells good but kinda disappointing that cheesiness leads the way then a nice citrus hop zip.
Taste is citrus hop forward, than herbal grassy and cheesy. Moderate bitterness with nice fruity hop flavors and little to no malt/alcohol backing.
This is medium bodied, modestly carbonated and overall very enjoyable. Would not mind trying this again if it was super fresh but as is its pretty solid. 632 charactersstakem, Sep 03, 2015

The nose is typical juicy citra, juicy peach, orange, light mango, a little cantaloupe, just bursting with citrus fruits here. The taste is very refreshing, with mostly citrus upfront, with a nice refreshing grapefruit finish that is very clean. Almost no residual bitterness. I would say this is a little bit lighter of a flavor than ZD, but a comparable beer. One of the best pale ales out there. 430 charactersDustin_Sallitt, Aug 30, 2015
4.3/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 12oz bottle into a clear mug.  I'm damn excited about this one!  Bottle is dated 7/9/15.
Appearance:  medium orange hue with a moderate haze and a strong effervescence.  Head pours a finger of frothy off-white foam.  Quite attractive!
Smell:  a piney hop aroma with a nice citrus backdrop.  Not quite massively fruity but very enticing nonetheless.
Taste:  very nice piney and lightly citrusy hop flavor with a smooth finish exhibiting a balanced bitterness.  One of the smoothest and most satisfying pale ales I've ever had, with a brilliantly satisfying finish.
Mouthfeel:  medium body with a good level of carbonation and creamines.  Quite good.
Overall: highly drinkable and very, very satisfying indeed.  I was expecting a flavor bomb, but what I got instead is one of the most easy-drinking pale ales I've had.  Great. 841 charactersflagmantho, Aug 29, 2015

But this bottle is from a great trade with doughanson78.. Pours mostly clear light golden with a decent white head with no real retention... Tropical fruit/melon/tangerine hops and pale maltiness in the nose... Flavor is sorta muddy and the hops are lost in the pale malt.. VERY drinkable, but this is just a good fruity pale ale. 
If this was brewed anywhere in Oregon or Southern California, no geeks would have ever given it the time of day.. Pretty nice APA, but Oh sooo standard in THIS neck of the woods.

After reading about how the new Brew Hub brewed Sue has nothing on the old Iowa brewed ones I cant even imagine how good those had to have been.  This is my favorite hoppy beer I have had even over Heady Topper.  It looked hazy and bright orange, smelled awesome, and tasted extremely juicy and tropical.  It was like alcoholic orange juice in the best way imaginable.

Pours out a typical pale orange kind of color.
The aroma is lead by soft tropical fruit notes of peach, mango, orange peel and tangerine.
Taste is also very citrus forward with orange, grapefruit, pineapple and mango heavy on the tongue.
The body is light and the mouthfeel is crisp. Drinks like a Pale Ale which is nice since a lot of Pale Ales verge on IPA territory anymore.
Good beer? Yes! Overhyped? Yes! For single hop Citra Pale Ales there's a certain Zombie king for me. 552 charactersJohnnyMc, Aug 22, 2015

4.02/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Smell is of citrus, tropical fruit, and malt sweetness.  Taste is heavily tropical, with mango being most prominent for me.  Finish is slightly bitter but blends well with the citrus and tropical flavors.  A really smooth drinking and flavorful beer that doesn't quite live up to the hype for me, although I've heard that the newer Florida batches are getting closer to the original. 383 charactersOmahaKF, Aug 19, 2015

3.53/5  rDev -21.2%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I almost feel bad reviewing this beer in its current form, as I've never had it in the 22oz format that was actually produced by Toppling Goliath.  I have had it 4 or 5 times though from a couple of different batches since production was moved to a contract brewery in Florida, and it now only shows up in the 12oz bottles used by them.  It's a real shame because King Sue is one of the best tasting beers I've ever had when it's fresh and brewed by Mike Saboe.  I wish he would take control again of production of Pseudo, b/c I can taste enough there that I know it's likely a phenomenal beer when done right, but the batches from Florida have ranged from a solid basic pale to a drain pour.  It really is a shame to create such a universally acclaimed product and then shift production elsewhere and have it slowly eroded...Please fix this beer!! 848 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Aug 18, 2015

4.19/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Two 12oz bottles, purchased and tasted several days apart. Bottled dates of 10 Jul 15 and 10 Aug 15. Poured into an Irish Imperial pint glass. Golden color, hazy. Moderate amount of visible carbonation. 1/2 inch of slightly off-white head that recedes slowly, leaving some lacing on the glass. Aroma is wonderful citrus and pine. Pleasant, inviting me to take a taste. Good initial body and mouth feel. Malt backbone is present, but so are the hops. Definite citrus "juiciness", but the dominant hops taste is pine that carries through the middle, with the bitterness asserting in the finish. Very well balanced, though, with the malty body continuing through to nicely balance the hops bitterness and to finish clean. This ale is really good. There's been a lot of discussion that the Brew Hub / FL versions are substandard compared with the legendary Decorah brew, but these versions are really good. 902 charactersMNAle, Aug 18, 2015

One can also taste what feels like unripe tropical fruits per mango.  As some may mistake this for a DIPA per all the characteristic's, but it's only single hopped with citra hops.  When drinking.... Orange citra, mango fruit, grapefruit, evergreen pine and a smooth finish.   This is a world class beer without a doubt.  Fantastic pale ale, Absolutely fantastic...  Up there with my other favorite hoppy pale ale Zombie Dust. 502 charactersta_hagen, Aug 16, 2015

4.68/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75From a newly distributed to MN single, bottled on July 10th, into an imperial pint.  Very cool label!
A: fairly clear, bright glowering mango orange with a finger of white head that subsides fairly quickly and leaves decent but not great lacing.
S: Angels are singing...  Sweet flowery orange blossoms, juicy mango and grapefruit (again, fairly sweet and light, but also substantial), mild pineapple, faint and sweet fresh-cut grass, some caramel...just a little dankness as you get past the initial flowery and juicy sweetness.
T:  Everything in the nose shows up here, though the integration isn't quite as brilliant; enough malt to provide a solid body; there is a bit more bitterness, which is good.  A slight minty and earthy tinge (that I don't really get in the nose) lingers at the end.  Truly outstanding.
M: Fairly light, medium carb, good body...neither real thick nor thin, nice bit of aggressive bite to go with the sweet flowery tropical flavors, goes down way too easy and quickly.
So good.  Ecstatic that these guys are in MN now...looking forward to drinking this often. 1,089 charactersTaybeh, Aug 15, 2015

L- Dark gold and medium-clear with a bubbly white head that sticks around for quite some time. 
S- phenomenal citra notes. Orange, grapefruit, juice, a bit of pine.
T- much like the taste. Citrus, but in a sweet, juicy way. Bitterness present, but overall intensity, between white-bread malt and bitterness, is pretty low.

A: Pours a clear light golden amber with lots of visible lively bubbly carbonation. Head is and inch and a half of frothy foamy white color. Retention is absolutely excellent and lacing is phenomenally plentiful. 
S: Wow what inviting aromas of tropical fruits, and citrus that present themselves immediately. Mango, grapefruit, pineapple, lemon, and tangerine are the prevalent smells. Then in the middle you find aromas of sweet malts, and fresh cut grass. On the end you get some floral hop notes. Absolutely fantastic this is one of the best smelling brews I've ever had.
T: This brew continues to blow my f***ing mind. Opens with huge bold citrus and tropical fruit flavors. Mango, grapefruit, peach, orange, lemon, pineapple, tangerine, and cantaloupe flavors are all present to me. In the middle of the taste you find sweet malts, and grassy/pine like hop bitterness. Finishes with floral hop flavors and a nice lingering bitter/fruity aftertaste.
M:Light to medium bodied with a moderate amount of carbonation. Incredibly smooth and easy drinking. It's qualities make it almost too easy to drink. This is a perfect all/every day kind of brew but it has such depth of aromas and flavors that I feel like I am committing a beer crime for how fast I am drinking these. I love this beer but I wish it had a slightly heavier mouthfeel.
O: This is one of the most impressive brews I have ever had. I have heard such great things about Toppling Goliath and finally we get distribution to our store. I picked this up immediately after work and proceeded to have my brains blown out of my f***ing head like a .50 cal round hit me. This is easily the best Pale Ale I have ever had the pleasure to consume. This will forever have a place in my heart and has immediately become one of my favorite beers. I plan to drink the f*** out of this. I would stand by my recommendation of this brew to my death. Seek this brew out beer lovers far and wide, this is truly a white whale that deserves any amount of praise heaped upon it. 2,055 charactersCannibalgasm, Aug 14, 2015

Huge citrus on the nose with almost as big aromas of mango. Smells hoppier vs bitter.
The citrus just kicks it here. Mixed in with that mango and a light malt that comes across as bready, this is one magnificent APA. Btw, the citrus is most definitely grapefruit with a touch of lemon zest.
Medium bodied, perfect carbonation.

L- pours a hazy pale golden/ straw color with a red bottom, about a finger of white head leaving a white cap that sits atop the beer on the way down along with a bit of lacing. 
A- it reeks of citra hops, I took out of an open bag of citra hops and smelled them side by side, the girl friend even said they smell the same, I love it. Very strong tropical notes. Hints of malt sweetness. 
T- tropical notes with some malty sweetness followed by mild hop bitterness. Some floral notes become evident about halfway through the beer. I let the gf have a sip and she was hesitant to give it back, she's not a craft beer drinker. 
M- it has a good mouthfeel for the type, strong carbonation 
O-  it's a good beer, I'm not sure if I'd rate it a 100, but good none the less. I was excited to try this beer, but feel slightly let down, I guess since it had such a high score I expected amazing. Don't get me wrong though, I do like it and would definitely buy it. Maybe I just need a newer bottle. 1,127 charactersKelz87, Aug 08, 2015

Aroma is bursting with citrus and fruit, evident as soon as the beer is poured. You can taste the peaches, pineapple and grapefruit. Remarkably vivid. 
Taste is absolutely sensational. Enormous fruit flavors that end with a finish of pine. Grapefruit, peach, pineapple, orange, tangerine. Accented by light floral and citrus hops. As it warms, pine starts to take a little more of the spotlight. Finishes a bit bitter.
Light bodied. Smooth. Even at just 5.8%, this beer is as dangerously drinkable as you'll find. I feel like I could drink an entire case of this. Very versatile, suitable for an time of year. 
Overall, this is quite possibly the best beer I've ever had. So ridiculously drinkable and versatile. As tasty as any beer you'll find. In a beer world oversatured by IPAs and PAs, this one manages to stand out. 967 charactersmajorbase2, Aug 03, 2015

T) Wow what a super flavorful single IPA ! Huge tropical fruit that gives way to a perfect piney mouthfeel as you wash it down. As it warmed up the fruity notes began to leave the resin and pine in the dust. This beer is too drinkable.

Head reaches about an inch and a half consisting of creamy off white foam.  Leaves a consistent rim of lace as it slowly fades.  Nose is of citrus pulp, mandarin oranges and floral hops.  With first sip this beer bursts with citrus juiciness.  Tons of orange and pink grapefruit come at you with relentless tongue attacking presence.  This would be the perfect beer on a hot summer day.  There is just nothing abrasive about this beer at all.  I would buy this beer on the regular if I had better access to it. 600 charactersSPLITGRIN, Jul 27, 2015

Smell - Citra hop and citrus notes in general beat up nose nicely.  
Taste - Lot of fruity hops up front, mellowing out towards back end.
Feel - Smooth.  I expected a much more of a bite at the back end, based on smell and initial taste, but it just mellows out nicely.
Overall - Really exceptional pale ale.  Very much belongs near or at the top. 443 characterseifster82, Jul 26, 2015

A blast of bright hops attacked as soon as the 12oz bottle was cracked open. The flavor and scent shared a hop forward/low malt profile. The beer was smooth and crisp, with a nicely dry finish. Drinkability was great, I woud drain these regularly if available to me. 429 charactersbeertunes, Jul 21, 2015

Hands down better than ZD and way better availability. Citrusy and hoppy flavore combine to make a perfect balance. A murky, hazy look and full mouth feel make this a near perfect pale ale. Just a hint of lingering bitterness on the finish is the only slight drawback. 437 charactersMuFugga, Jul 21, 2015

Or whenever you got that Power Wheels, Tamagotchi, or Game Boy Color? After receiving the spoils of my first beer trade today, I do— it felt like popping a mega roll of bubble wrap while placing the perfect Tetris piece and flipping to the cool side of the pillow all at once. PseudoSue [soo-do-soo]. Say it with me! Toppling Goliath basically brewed the Miss Universe of craft beer with this one: she’s elegant in a gown, she’s stunning in a swimsuit, and she actually has the IQ and diction to talk about how desperately she wants world peace. The beer pours a hazy golden/orange color which is accented nicely by the T-Rex on the label (bonus points in my book). And though I didn’t think it was possible, the brew’s smell is probably more impressive than its appearance. A pungent bouquet of mango, grapefruit, and orange eventually gives way to evergreen and pine notes (sticking with that Christmas theme!). And… down the hatch. Blissful? Pretty much. Divine? Maybe. Perfect? Almost. While I can’t quite find the right words to describe the taste as I’d like, it is as spectacular an APA (American Pale Ale) as you will find. The bitterness is almost enough to make you think of PseudoSue as an IPA, but the beer ultimately stays true to the balance of the APA style. I now understand and appreciate the hype surrounding this beastly brew and it has earned a place in my own personal pantheon of heavenly beers. 1,525 charactersljjpowers, Jul 15, 2015

Look is hazy amber gold, with a thick slowly diminishing head and a web of lingering lacing.  Smell is a very aromatic blend of bitter grapefruit, sweet citrus, mango and fresh evergreen.  Taste reflects the nose and is a near perfect blend of hop bitterness and malt sweetness.  Feel is delicate and finishes with a mild bite.  A go to pale ale. 462 charactersHopheadjeffery, Jul 05, 2015

4.49/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle dated 28 May 15. Pours a slightly hazy yellow golden color with a thin white head. Leaves some lacing on the glass. Smell is orange, grapefruit, mango, pineapple... You know it's gotta be Citra. These bottles are a little over a month old so some drop off is to be expected. Taste is juicy and tropical. Follows the nose for the most part. Nice biscuity malt at the end. Bitterness is subdued. Mouthfeel is light and crisp. Actually not as creamy as some other TG beers I've had. Overall an excellent pale ale, but I'm not seeing how this could be a perfect 100. A solid 4.25-4.50 beer. 593 charactersMisSigsFan, Jul 04, 2015

Pretty underwhelming. Hopefully I'll get the chance to try a better batch in the future and update my rating.
*Update: tried another bottle last night. Much better. Some dank hops, fruity notes. Very tasty. 395 charactersjtladner, Jun 27, 2015

4.15/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance - The beer was a golden orange color with a bubbly white head. 
Smell - There is a modest dry orange nose. It is partly floral, with a hint of grass. 
Taste - At the front, I notice orange and lavender. The profile is dry overall with hints of grass and other citrus. The finish comes across as both orange and dry oak. 
Mouthfeel - The carbonation is appropriate for the style, contributing to a dry finish. 
Overall - I hate to say, but I think this is a little overrated. There are other APAs out there that are in the same ballpark as this, but lack the noteriety. 583 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jun 20, 2015

Pours a beautiful bright orange with a half finger of head.  Leaves lots of lacing.
Nose is extremely tropical.  Mango, orange, dankness, a bit of spice.  Smells heavenly.
Wow the taste is awesome.  It immediately kicks you in the tongue with a burst of citrusy hops.  The flavor on this is stronger than any beverage I've ever had.  Amazing. The bitterness hits up front but is immediately followed by the fruity goodness.  Mostly orange and mango.  Back of the tongue has a punch with some more bitterness.
It feels awesome.  You know you're drinking a hoppy beer as the hops permeate throughout the palate.  Coats the mouth unlike a pale ale usually would. 
I understand the hype.  This is probably the best pale ale I've ever had.  It's just so powerful and makes me realize why I love Citra hops so much. 879 charactersPeterParker, Jun 18, 2015

Thanks goes out to jwc215 (Joe) for sending me this one, much appreciated.
Poured into a pint glass, a very nice cloudy dark yellow color, with some nice carbonation, which leaves a small creamy/white head, with some nice sticky lacing. The nose is hoppy, with a nice citrus note, with a very slight pine note. The taste is very nice, hoppy, with some nice citrus thrown in, picking up a slight pine note as well. Medium body with a nice dry/bitter finish. Overall a very tasty Pale Ale.  Very glad to have my third Toppling Goliath brew. Thanks Joe! 587 charactersWasatch, Jun 14, 2015

Smell:  Moderate citrus rind.
Taste:  Bready sweetness, then a lasting citrus aftertaste.  Very easy drinking.
Overall:  Picked up a 4-pack of 12oz bottles in Iowa of the contract-brewed PseudoSue. It's a very nice pale ale, a little more balanced than I was expecting but still packs a nice hop flavor.  Hopefully I can try a side-by-side of Surly Todd and PseudoSue someday. 444 charactersMdog, Jun 14, 2015

4.34/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25This one's a bit of a creeper.
Pours a light golden colour, and has a fantastic nose that has plenty of mango and orange, backed by some very spruce like scents. The flavour seemed underwhelming at first, and while it never quite matched the power of the nose, as it got slightly warmer it opened right up. The hops provide just the right amount of zing.
By the time I was finished i was ready for another. It's not easy to find a beer this well balanced and tasty, yet so subtle and drinkable. This is one. 509 charactersdiablo14, Jun 14, 2015

3.97/5  rDev -11.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from the twelve ounce bottle into a nonic pint glass.  Bottled May 29th 2015, (320) listed, agreement with Lakeland Florida.
Chill hazed lemon yellow body, with a lemon pineapple like glow and orb appearance.  Fluffy to creamy bleach white head form simply and nicely at about slightly taller than two fingers.  Cream bubbled makeup, but with a bit of a soapy appearance.
Nice straightforward hop nose.  Zesty, slightly oily.  Not heavily pronounced, but classic tangerine like orange and a bit of candy like sweetness to it as well like a classic Christmas orange.  Slightly earthy as well with a bit of pine, not much discernible malt character.  Pretty solid though.
Palate brings some real nice qualities.  Slightly juiced front of orange and mango with a very good dryness and airy powdery malt quality almost cancelling out the mouthfeel's very great but slightly wet qualities.  Leafy and mint to tea like finish, with a bigger drying quality that's emphasized on the swallow.  Has some classic drying Pliny Elder character which is kind of memorable.  Some of the oily fruit character comes through real nicely as it warms.  It does become more enjoyable as I drink more of it.
It's a very well made beer, but not something I am going to be crazy over with the plethora of good solid American Pale Ales out there. 1,332 characterssmakawhat, Jun 11, 2015
4.51/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75Look:  Deep orange hazy body.  Off white head that shrivels from a pancake sized nipple to a shriveled up quarter.  The head is very sticky, and the curtains are slick.
Smell:  Rich.  Candied tropical fruit or Hawaiian punch with grapefruit.
Taste:  Tropical fruit punch, watered down, just a tad.  The finish tastes like I am drinking tropical fruit juice when there are more ice cubes left than juice.  Not bad, just saying.     
Feel:  The feel does not disappoint.
Overall -  With this beer, the smell stands out.  I think there are better APAs out there, but this is actually a hit.  A watered down Enjoy By...
I had to come back after it warmed to bump up the "overall."  Outstanding finish and a complete package for an APA. 733 charactersmabermud, Jun 11, 2015

Piney resin with citrus hop taste that is nearly perfect.  The resin sneaks up the nose slightly, and it feels like a slight nutty taste.  The hop and malt combination creates the best finish of any IPA I have had.  I have long heard of this company and it's offerings and it lives up to the hype. 412 charactersGobearswalter34, Jun 07, 2015

22oz bottle served in a large mug. Traveled here in mr-jj's friend's suitcase. If there is a date on the bottle, I can't find it.
Pours murky golden with a smallish white head, medium carbonation. I can see thick chunky sediment left in the bottom of the bottle, but I think a fair amount of sediment made it into my glass (not that I mind). Smell is gorgeous. Floral and tropical. Just dreamy.
Taste is surprisingly malty, with the expectations set by the nose. Based on the aroma, I thought this was going to be a total hop bomb, but it's actually a fairly well balanced pale ale, with all the stuff I like in an IPA (floral, resinous, honeysuckle and tropical juice...) but toned down a bit, with a stronger malt (straw, maybe) presence.
Mouthfeel is moderately thick and surprisingly dry. Overall, very tasty beer. 832 characterssnaotheus, May 30, 2015

It's delicious, certainly. It has some magical quality that's pretty instantly recognizable. But it's kind of anonymous. The flavor profile seems oddly without substance, transparent -- invisible, even. To serve this in a Shaker pint is definitely part of the problem. But I'm just shaking my head. I can't see what all the hype is about.
It's nowhere near the enlightenment that is Zombie Dust. I even like New Glarus Moon Man better than this. If I were to place it on my Top Ten APA hierarchy, it'd look like this:
Zombie Dust
Daisy Cutter
Alpha King
-(Big falloff, here.)-

T: Similar to nose. It actually reminded me of a duplicate of the Galaxy Dry Hopped FPPA by Trillium. The Pseudo Sue is a combination of an upfront hoppy punch to your tastebuds followed by a citrus bomb of mango/peach juiciness. Some dry, pine like aftertaste, but well balanced overall.
M: Medium carbonation, hops prickly to the tongue. Medium bodied beer.
O: I loved it! The freshness component was an added plus as it is fairly difficult to track one of these down especially living in the Northeast. It's right up there with Trillium! Great job! 731 charactersCoffeePorter, May 11, 2015

L - Cloudy vibrant orange with a thick foamy head that leaves behind fine lacing
S - mmmm Citra.  Soft citrus aromas with a hint of spice
T - Bursts of oranges and a backbone of smooth malt with just a tiny hint of sweetness - perfect balance between hops and malt, with just a slight bite of bitterness at the finish
F - creamy and spot on carbonation - no prickle, dangerously smooth
O - Having this side by side with Zombie Dust, overall, I would give the nod to PseudoSue as being a more balanced beer, that finishes with less bitterness than a ZD.  As a Pale Ale to style, ZD is over the top, this is more balanced and just fantastic! 681 characterspagriley, May 02, 2015

A - Hazy, tangerine.  Opaque.  Not much of a head on the pour and it dissipated quickly.
S - The nose on this beer is great.  Huge orange, tangerine, mango, slight pineapple.  Underneath all the Citra, is a bit of a resinous, dankness.  Very pungent.  This smells more like an IPA or DIPA
T - Really nice, but I think the nose is much bigger than the taste.  Big citrus - oranges, orange peel, bitter grapefruit.  That bitterness hangs on a bit middle of the mouth, and falls off the palette.  Very clean, drying, easy drinking.  A very tasty APA, especially for the ABV
O - I think this beer was a bit over hyped for me, and I'm bummed I didn't get an older version of this as I've heard the older batches were better. 774 charactersjow_42, Apr 30, 2015

A - Bright honey orange color. Completely opaque capturing all of the light in it's brilliantly dry hopped body with a small fine white head and light lacing.
S - Extremely strong hop fragrance with tons of tropical fruit. Basically DIPA aromatics with mostly a papaya, pineapple, and mango mixture that is just awesome. If you like tropical fruits in your IPAs then this one hits it out of the park.
T - Unbelievable hop flavor with a full fruit hop character with tons of tropical fruit mango, pineapple, orange, and citrus hops make you feel the awesomeness that is the PseudoSue. If you like tropical flavored hops by the bucket full this is a great beer. This is completely hop forward and more like juice than a beer. There is almost no malt flavor. The bitterness is very light to nonexistent with all of the amazing hop flavors. This is definitely a Citra lovers wet dream.
M - Lighter mouth-feel with low carbonation. Really it is a low ABV pale ale and it is very drinkable and flavorful to boot.
Overall, this is the best pale ale that I've ever had. Amazing aroma and taste really set this beer high and beside all other pale ales out there. Though it doesn't look like you average pale ale and doesn't have the balance of malt to hop that most APAs have this beer is tremendous. This beer went down fast and I wish I can't wait to try it again in the future.

Pours a murky, opaque light golden orange that doesn't want to let much light through. 1/2 finger white chunky, yet creamy head. The nose just friggin' brings it with huge amounts of tropical hops. Oh my. Oranges and tangerines dance a beautiful dance with juicy mango, pineapple, a hint of salty papaya and just a touch of caramel. Taste comes through beautifully,  following the nose with a nice amount of hop bitterness slathered in sweet, sweet mango, citrus, a touch of floral bouquet, and finishes sweetly with pineapple jam and the most appropriate faint touch of bready biscuity maltiness. A creamy and bright mouthfeel along with a lighter (but not too light) body, bring this beer to the pinnacle (for me, so far) of APAs. Holy Shyte. This bomber is about to disappear. What a treat. Can't wait to try it alongside zombie dust. 874 charactersajchocholousek, Apr 28, 2015

S - Huge tropical fruit notes of pineapple & mango as well as grapefruit & orange peel and all brought together with a light sweet malts. 
T - Pretty spectacular for a pale ale. The taste follows the nose. Gobs of tropical fruits as well as sweet malts. I'd say the best quality is there is not a huge hop bite or bitterness that overtakes all the subtle qualities in this beer. Just a light bitterness. 
F - Light bodied and medium carbonation. Juicy and wet. 
O - The best pale ale I've ever had. Depending on my mood that day, zombie dust could definitely rival it. 643 characterscvm4, Apr 19, 2015

T:  Fresh squeezed citrus juices - pineapple and grapefruit. Lots of wonderful hop flavors but suprisingly not bitter at all. Very well balanced. 
M:  Medium body and average carbonation. Finish is light and refreshing. 
O:  Excellent pale ale. Citra is definitely one of my favorite hop profiles. 607 charactersrichj1970, Apr 17, 2015

Appearance - Within the glass, PseudoSue takes on the hazy, unfiltered appearance that is so popular now with the fresh, overtly hoppy beers. It is cloudy and has a very active stream of carbonation bubbling away inside of it. The color and clarity draw comparisons to pineapple juice or a mimosa. A snow-white head caps the beer with a rocky, cavernous texture which blankets the rim of the glass in a dense foam of lace.
Aroma - While the beer looks like pineapple juice, the aroma also flourishes with tropical notes. Huge wafts of citrus, berry, and grapefruit rush out of the glass and paint the scene of a lush, fragrant landscape. Little, if any, malt sweetness makes it through the deluge of hops, but there could be a touch of grain peeking through.
Taste - From the potency of the nose, I was expecting a similarly aggressive and somewhat bitter note from the taste. However, Toppling Goliath does a great job of 'balancing' the hops; it is still very hop-forward, but doesn't possess a bracing bitterness. Instead, the hops meld nicely with the rest of the ingredients to produce a smooth flavor. There is more sweetness present here than the nose previewed, especially in the finish.
Mouthfeel - This is where the beer loses a bit of its luster for me. The body is a touch thin and isn't that successful in supporting the bold flavors within the beer, but the style and ABV mitigate that complaint to a degree. Otherwise, it lends itself to being very drinkable and not heavy on the palate.
Closing Arguments - For a 5.8% 'pale ale', PseudoSue could stand toe-to-toe with much bigger beers and come out victorious in regards to hop utilization. The dry-hopping technique allows the hops to jump the glass, while late hop additions lend additional flavor without the bitterness that would be disastrous in a beer of this size. While I'd like a little more meat to chew on, I have to admit that the lighter body lends to a beer that goes down like water. Unfortunately, I don't have a sustainable stream of bottles to replenish the one I'm drinking now! 2,104 charactersnhindian, Apr 17, 2015

Look = 4.0 Pours a cloudy golden orange with 2 fingers of crisp white head; retention isn’t as good as I’d expect and lace is good not great.
Aroma = 4.75 A citrusy hop bomb: orange citrus dominates with lighter tropical fruit notes and some rind.
Taste = 4.25 Hop forward, full of citrus and tropical fruit, moderate bitterness of orange rind. Light bready backbone forms the base.
Feel = 4.25 Medium bodied with medium to high carbonation, a bit fizzy. Good for style.
Drinkability = 4.75 Really drinkable pale ale.
Overall = 4.3875 A stronger score here than my previous review even though everybody claims the FL brews aren’t as good as those from Iowa; should get better as the batches roll out. 803 characterskbwalters, Apr 04, 2015

Appearance is extremely hazy orange with a fluffy white head, inviting for sure...big citrus aromas on the nose, hops at the forefront...a bit more biscuity malt undertone on the palate. Dry, with moderate bitterness.

Powerhouse of complex citrus and hints of dried pine and apricot. The hops and malt balance beautifully. Drinks way too easy.

I've only poured two beers down the drain because I couldn't finish them and this was one of them. The other beer I poured down the drain was a strong German Eisbock. The first drink of this beer wasn't horrible, grapefruit, grapefruit, grapefruit and some more grapefruit. There was some hop bitterness on the aftertaste on the first drink but nothing crazy. As I continued drinking this beer the grapefruit was becoming so intense and obnoxious it wasn't enjoyable at all. The aftertaste was very funky and long lasting. I have no idea how this beer is ranked 100!! I bought two bottles to share with two of my friends and neither of them could finish it as well. I was so excited to try this beer and it was a total failure in my book. It's hard to say because this is a loved beer by many but this is one of the worst beers I've drank. I'm going to give it another shot, maybe in the brewery. 995 charactersthetravelguy01, Mar 06, 2015

4.23/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.2522 oz bottle poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint originally reviewed below, with a month old 16 oz can on the re-review. 
A lot of the same flavors, but with more aroma. Very earthy/musty with vibrant, rips fruits. Cantelope/melon, mango, pink grapefruit, orange, and some peach/apricot. Also very pithy. The body is a bit too drying. The night and day difference though is the appearance. It is a deep gold, and very, very clear. Not sure what was up with the bottle, but this looks much better, with a big sticky, lacing foam. 
A very pale orange, 100% -can't see through cloudy, with a big frothy white head that settles into a film like layer on top. Mine also had a bunch of sediment floating around, and settled in the bottom of the glass. Not sure if that is normal for this beer. 
Smells very citrusy. Orange, melon, lemon, and mango in nature. Faint sweet bready malt. 
Taste is all citrus with very little malt considering the appearance. Strong mango and melon flavor. Maybe a little peach too. The hops have a little bite, but not too much bitterness. I get a little bit of a grassy "green" taste too even though it is supposed to be single citra hopped. 
The body is fairly creamy. Average carbonation. 
My general impression is that this beer is either older, or may have some sort of issue because my experience isn't jiving with any of the other reviews I have read after typing most of this. It reminds me of a Zombie Dust that is 3 or 4 months old. Just kind of flat. Someone else even noted that it pours clear. Mine looks like a hefe. Very good, but my gut feeling is something isn't right. 1,618 charactersWesMantooth, Mar 01, 2015

T-The taste is delicious, up front a bit hoppy/earthy and then comes the fruit. and it comes hard and good. My lord.

A:  Beautiful golden/range hue.  Effervescent foamy heady that leaves enough lacing to get me from NJ to Iowa.  
S: Plenty of Orange, grapefruit pear with some hints of pine.  
T:  This is so juicy that it should come in a box with a little straw.  Loads of grapefruit, pineapple, pear, apple,  Slight sweeetness and a little but of resiny pine in the background.  Very little bitterness.  
M:  Easy drinking, light body, moderate carbonation. Refreshing, smooth and creamy everything I want in a beer.  
O:  Great Beer.  Maybe even reason enough to go to Iowa. 643 charactersSammyJaxxxx, Feb 09, 2015

A - A surprisingly small off-white head tops a beautiful, glowing orange body.  It's lighting up the room.
N - I can smell it from here.  Massive citrus: orange, grapefruit.  No bitterness at all.
T - Yeah, it's so light, and yet flavorful.  Heavy citrus, but the sweeter kind, like clementines, ruby red grapefruit.  Impressive how they pack so much flavor in here.  Some bitterness on the back end.
M - Not quite insta-froth as I prefer, but still lots of coating.  Finishes extremely clean.
O - A real winner. 673 charactersCraftFan5, Feb 06, 2015

4.41/5  rDev -1.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This brew was served on tap at Toppling Goliath Brewing Company in Decorah, Iowa.  It arrived in a generic pint, showing a shimmering yellowed straw coloring.  It held a one finger head of fizzy, crisp white bubbles that retained well, leaving etched patterns of crystalline lacing around our glasses.  A lingering chill haze was noted, especially after the fact in our growler, but no sediment was noted.  Carbonation appeared to be moderately active.  The aroma gave huge, huge, huge nectary and grapefruity hoppiness, with a roaring background symphony of freshly picked strawberries, wet apricot and mango pulp, orange and lemon rind zest, buttered popcorn, juicy bubblegum and sweet cotton candy esters, clean pale malt toast, mallow sugars, resinous green grassiness, and a distant powdering of simplistic ale yeastiness.  Flavoring followed in step as perfectly as you would hope and expect, offering up intensely juicy citric and grapefruity hoppiness, to hit hard at the forefront of your palate.  As the beer warmed and evolved on its journey past the buds and beyond, these hops took on a more bittered, vinous grassy and piney quality that went well with the base blend of pale and curiously Weizen maltiness, cotton candy cloy, cucumber and celery coolness, dried mango and raw plantain, light vanilla smoothness, brass, garlic grass, walnut oils, mild phenolic plastic, sweet booze, grapefruit skin and seed, wet lawn grassiness, wicker, bittering green acorn pulp, metallic twangs of yeast, and singed caramel sugars.  The body was lightly medium, and the carbonation was medium as well, but offered robust prickle to the hard palate.  Each sip’s slurp and smack were soft and inviting, with nice cream and froth on the swirl around the mouth.  Finishing pop was clean and definite.  The mouth was left cooled and creamed, with an eventual light pucker, independent of any frank dryness.  The abv was appropriate, and you can hardly keep yourself from drinking this beer rapidly.
Overall, we are ecstatic to finally be able to report the findings from our expedition to observe this whale…errr…dinosaur in its natural habitat.  What an experience!!  In all seriousness, this is a phenomenal beer that deserves all the hype it gets.  For us it doesn’t quite dethrone the likes of Zombie Dust in the area of the American Pale Ale, but it comes damn close.  From the first whiff through that first sip you are wrapped up in a world of insanely juicy, dripping wet citric hoppiness that offers just the right amount of sweetness and bitterness to the last drop.  If anything, the mild lightness of feel held the beer back from being the best, most invigoratingly flavorful experience it could have been, but here we’re just talking about why it isn’t “perfect fives” across the board.  Nit picking, if you will.   We obviously had to pick up a growler of this gal, and savored it, as incredibly hard as that was, over the next couple of days on our journey across the frozen Midwest.  PseudoSue is the best we’ve tasted from Toppling Goliath, and an absolute must-try. 3,098 charactersTheBrewo, Feb 01, 2015

The aroma is a showcase for the Citra hop. Big, bright mango, blood orange, and grapefruit along with some orange zest. Pine cones and resin.  
Flavor is very juicy. Grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. Slight danky resinous flavor in the background. A touch of indistinguishable grainy sweetness. Lightly bitter. 
Light-medium body and moderate carbonation. Very smooth and creamy yet refreshing mouthfeel. Maybe just a touch thin.
Overall, Sue is a great beer. Worth the hype? I'm not sure. Delicious but very simple. Minimal malt backbone for an APA. TG's  Light Speed is better in my opinion. 768 charactersPhocion, Jan 28, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Absolutely worth its title as the new contender for best APA. 22oz to the dome, newer Tyrannosaurus label.
A - 22oz into 22oz wilibecher glass, golden amber, thin white head that clings to glass with each sip.
S - Nose is jam packed with Citra goodness. Reminded me of the first time I had Zombie Dust years ago. 
T - Stellar. Easily the best APA in a bottle in the State (Havent had the chance to try the new Fort Point offering from Trillium). Hop forward, only slightly bitter, malt takes a distant back seat that is so damn impressive.
M - Reminiscent of standing in line at Hill Farmstead with a few tasters, you could throw this right in the middle of the taster and be none the wiser. Perfect, resinous without being sticky and bitter. Lingers with sweet floral hops. 774 characterslateralundertow, Jan 24, 2015

Lemon zest, pineapple, wet hops, and a good dose of dank in the nose. The flavors bring in very similar qualities of Three Floyds Zombe Dust , perhaps a hybrid of, once again, Three Floyds Alpha King and Alpine Nelson based on their underlying effects. Burst of dank hops, orange, melon and some honey sweetness from the malts to balances this beer out. There is a slight bitterness in the back finish which brings this a bit more closer to an IPA rather than a pale ale. In addition to the creaminess, there is a medium body to this. Overall, a very fine pale ale - if not the best I've had in a while. 666 charactersCuriousMonk, Jan 18, 2015

S: Hop bomb.  Grapefruit, pine, honey, but just sort of the exploding hop aroma I was hoping for.
T: Immediate citrus and pine.  Clean honey-like malt character.  Hop bitterness is there but not harsh in any regard.
F:  Lip-smackingly crisp.   Some residual thickness towards the end. Perfectly carbed.
O: Oh, how I've waited to drink this APA.  I'll stop short of saying it's the best (blindfold me and I'm pretty sure Born Yesterday will triumph), but this beer warrants the accolades it gets.  This is easy drinking tastiness that shows a deft hand in the fermentor.  Not bitter by any regard, but booming with hop character. 723 characterswaitwhatamidrinking, Jan 09, 2015

The beer is a chill hazed gold with a nice off-white head and lacing. 
The aroma is of fresh citrus, a hint of tropical fruits and grains.
Nice!  It is slightly bitter with note of juicy fruit gum, citrus and a slight touch of something like mango.  The malts add a nice caramel counter point.  Seems well balanced to me. 
The mouth is decent and slightly coating.  
This is a winner, just like the Blackhawks 4 -0 over the Maple Leafs.  Well done on both counts! 527 charactersRedrover, Dec 22, 2014

4.79/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I had a very thorough review of this beer. Comparing and contrasting it with Zombie Dust as I just drank them together and once again my review was lost, that has been happening a lot lately, not sure what the deal is, could be me. Anyway, I will attempt to review this beer from mental notes. 
Color: Hazy golden color, very much like ZD in that respect. Nicely done for the style.
Smell: It very faint, I got some grassy notes, there was definitely tropical fruits in there, mango, guava, papaya. Very subtle on the nose not as potent as others. Not a bad thing. I have gotten beers with an amazing nose that taste awful. 
Taste: This one does not taste awful. It is truly spectacular. Mango, tropical fruits, earthy grains, some grassy notes in there. Its really a perfectly balanced beer. Its not too hop driven and its not overly malty, its just right in my opinion. I would prefer it to have a bit more bite. Its very smooth, in the mouthfeel category. 
Overall: This is a world class beer and is worth the ratings it has received. I think i liked the ZD just a bit more, but barely. Had I not drank them one after another they would probably have blown my mind, and truly my mind is blow, to have the opportunity to try these beers one after another and both be fresh. I have to give a big thank you to my trader friend from Iowa who got these to me. Cheers man! Top notch beer, no doubt, if you can find it get it! 1,426 charactershumuloner22, Dec 02, 2014

PseudoSue breaks out with strong golden shades and a deep yeast fog. Its unfiltered character thwarts bold citrus aromas to mesmerize the senses with the very first whiff. Dank citrus, pineapple, passionfruit, mango and blood orange frame the tropical and citrus medley. With a candied backdrop, seemingly of fructose and honeysuckle, the taste casts a hoppy spell that few can deny.
The middle palate simply blossoms with white grapefruit juicy, leafy, grassy, berry and orange flavor. Once the malt sweetness drops out and the hops tilt toward the tang, the taste evokes tropical memories of Hawaiian Punch and orange sherbet. Smoothly bitter in finish, the ale retains just enough malt sweetness to offer slim balance to the hops.
Creamy, smooth and impeccably balanced, the beer trends more hoppy than malty, perhaps crossing the threshold to IPA, but its marshmallowy structure laced with soft pine resins and herbal chive brightness allows the ale to seduce the palate regardless of intent. Malty dry to finish, hops command the final impressions of taste and linger with the teeth churning acidic nature of hops. 
If this is the future for the American Pale Ale, then there's hope for its survival after all. 1,429 charactersBEERchitect, Nov 27, 2014

(A)- Pours a hazy golden orange color. Some good white froth and lacing.
(S)- Big juicy citrus meets bitter pine. Great lemon, lime, grapefruit, and orange.
(T)- Again, big resin-like citrus meets some dry bitter pine. Love the citrus on this.
(M)- A crisp carbonation level meets some awesome citrus. Bitter, but restrained with some good woody pine.
(O)- It is definitely one of the greatest pale ales I have had. Smooth, yet bitter and mountains of citrus. It is just one of the many beers that are too hard to get to desire more often. If it was on the shelf, I would not hesitate to purchase 628 characterssweemzander, Nov 19, 2014

A-  Beautiful cloudy, peach colored hue that slowly cleared up.   Decent two finger white frothy head.  Plenty of carbonation and lacing present.
S-  Super fruity nose.  The Citra hops are very apparent and leave nice notes of tangerine, peach, grapefruit, and mango.  Small amount of resin and pine detected.  Small malt presence and biscuits.
T-  Very tropical and citrus tasting.  Same fruits from the nose follow suit in the flavor, making it a very juicy and hop forward IPA.  A small amount of pine and grass in the aftertaste, but perfectly smooth and refreshing overall.
M-  Medium bodied IPA with a somewhat creamy yet quenching mouthfeel.  Carbonation present and a small amount of bite on the aftertaste as must IPAs have.
O- This was definitely a treat.  I had high expectations and the beer certainly delivered what I wanted.  This was the most enjoyable single hopped beer I've had to date.  Highly recommended and you won't be diasappointed.  Citra is one hell of a hop and TG blended it smoothly with their malt choice. 1,068 charactersEveningCordial, Nov 12, 2014

Color was honey-gold with a thick white head that lingered.  Excellent sticky lacing showed every sip.
Smell is amazing!  Crazy grapefruit,, peach and tropical hops - super intense.
Flavor follows the nose nicely - it's tropical fruit - mango, pineapple with melon, grapefruit and oranges.  Super juicy.  Nice malt base that gives the hops substance and depth.  A delicious bitter-sweet clean finish.
Body is light to medium with a very juicy feel.

A: 3/3 - golden-orange coloration; hazy (cannot read or see through); off-white carbonation with lakes that clings to the side of the glass; small carbonation bubbles; small alcohol legs
S: 9/12 - moderate Citra aroma - tangerine, orange peel, tropical fruit and slight dankness; some background bready/biscuity malts and alcohol; no diacetyl, no DMS
T: 16/20 - moderate hop bitterness up front that, in the middle of the palate, the Citra flavors really take over - juicy tangerine, orange, mango, papaya and pine with a touch of dankness; these flavors continue to develop with little malts and alcohol; finishes dry and inviting
M: 4/5 - moderate body, juicy, mouth-coating hop oils, moderate carbonation
O: 9/10 - excellent Citra-forward pale ale that I'd put a slight step below Zombie Dust because the aroma and flavors just pop a little more in that beer and this didn't wow me; for me, this is not a 100 beer - would put it somewhere in the low-to-mid 90s - and wonder about local grade inflation to increase trade value; however, for $4.50/pint, this is super-crushable and affordable

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%I was able to get my hands on 3 bombers of fresh Psue in a trade.  
I thought the best attributes of this beer were its smell, good use of the citra hops and it's drinkability.  I can't help comparing Psue to Zombie Dust having been at 3 Floyd's a couple months ago.  They are definitely similar.  I would give Psue an edge in hop aroma but in my opinion ZD is still the most balanced, drinkable and enjoyable beer to consume in multiples.  
TG definitely deserves high praise for the second best APA out there. 513 charactersELS, Nov 02, 2014

Look-Color is a cloudy tangerine, Pours a finger of white, creamy foam that settles into a respectable layer that retains throughout, and leaves chunks of lacing on the glass.
Smell-As advertised on the bottle, Aroma is full of Ripe mango with hints of citrus.
Taste- Mango and orange peel, slight kick of bitterness to compliment the fruity hops.
Feel-Quite creamy yet very carbonated, with a medium body, which makes for an overall texture that is easy to drink yet satisfying.
Overall- Fruity, sweet, refreshing, and balanced. Truly one of the greatest IPA's i've ever had. 664 charactersSteveB24, Oct 30, 2014

A - Light haze on a creamy orange body.  Fine white head pours a finger and a half high.  Nice retention and lace.
S - Wet grass, cilantro, dill, and old wood. 
T - Delicious.  Barnyard hay (almost saison like), bold resiny bitters, bright cilantro.  Honey sweetness and biscuity malt.  Orange and apricot fruitiness.  It's incredible how much better this gets the more you drink it.  The hop character is exceptional.
M - Full for an APA.  Medium staying power.  Soft creaminess.  Relatively low carbonation.
O - Bright, bold green hop character.  A shade short of the mega-hype, but still an outstanding APA that's probably in my top 10 for the style.

Bright, golden color. Very little head. Bright tropical fruit aroma. If they made a car air- freshener based on the aroma, I'd buy it. Taste is fantastic.

4.27/5  rDev -4.7%Thanks to Themind for the trade.
I will preface with the statement I held on to this beer for too long - should have consumed it as soon as it arrived on my porch.
The appearance was light straw color with excellent clarity and big frothy egg shell head.  The carbonation seemed very coarse.  The head left spotty laces. The aroma was big on the citrus, mangos, pineapple, and a little pine. The taste fell short with a slight soapy presence and hops mostly in form of resin and pine. Not much of a malt backbone - which I prefer in a APA/IPA/IIPA. Some bitter bite, but very smooth, high carbonation, and moderate body.
As previously stated, I would like to try this fresh and I assume the hop esters would be much more pronounced and contribute to a much better beer and sequentially a better rating.  With that said, I'm fortunate to have tried this. 856 charactersmacher0, Oct 24, 2014

S - Up front I smell the Citra hop. Deep inside covered by the aroma of Citra, I can smell sweetness of orange citrus and grapefruits. 
T - Some hop bitterness with A LOT of citrus. Citra hops shine through up front, but the shining stars truly are the grapefruit and sweet, fresh oranges that follow up. The hop bitterness lingers for a bit afterwards. This is delicious!
F - Soft. Delicate. Mmmmmmm.
O - This definitely caught me by 'surprise.' I would guzzle it if I could pick up a case locally. Overall I would 100% recommend this to anyone. Anyone. One of the best IPA's I've ever had. I will seek it out again. 793 characterszoober911, Oct 20, 2014

3.75/5  rDev -16.3%This is my first TG beer as they just became available at my bottle shop. Appearance is straightforward - dark straw to light amber appearance with a fairly fast breaking head. The nose is all about citrus and tropical fruit - pineapple, mango, citrus rind and grass. Taste displays more grass, some pine, pineapple and citrus hops with just a hint of bready malt. Mouthfeel is lighter in body which is the way I like my pales. 
This beer reminds me a lot of how FFF Zombie Dust tasted to me the first time I had it on tap which is to say epic. It comes across fresh, fruity, easy to drink and incredibly well made. I hope this stays available in my area - can't wait to try more of their beers. 4.5 Rating
EDIT: As this beer warms it is getting more vegetal on both the nose and palate. Not sure if this is normal or if I have a bad bottle. Not undrinkable but not great either. 3.75 Rating 893 charactersbound4er, Oct 17, 2014

Revisited in 2016. Cans of beer brewed in Florida for Toppling Goliath. The beer was much better. Fresh tropical notes on the nose, Citra bite on the palate, very clean feel, excellent beer. 
I had written off Toppling Goliath's hops program after trying Pseudosue and King Sue a while back, but more recent batches have made me a convert. 506 charactersrodmanfor3, Oct 14, 2014

Pours a beautiful bright orange-blond body with a big, 4 finger white fluffy head that reduces slowly to leave high retention, thick lacing, and chunks of white foam. 
The smell is gushing with tropical fruit, fresh citrus, pineapple, mango.
The taste.. all I can say is that this is the DEFINITION of a tropical fruit bomb, juicy as a ripe peach with HUGE notes of pineapple, apricot, mango, citrus, passionfruit, leaving a fruity, gushing hawaiian rainbow of flavor on the tongue. So light, refreshing, crisp, and drinkable, it's scary. Medium carbonation, light in body but not in flavor.
I'd say that Psuedosue has taken the place as my all time favorite pale ale.. the tropical fruityness combined with its extreme drinkability and complexity make for a near perfect pale ale. Wish I had access to this! Would love to try it on tap. 917 charactersgcamparone, Oct 14, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%Pours a light golden yellow with a one finger head.
The smell of citrus hops is noticeable with citrus and fruity esters and a pleasant pine aroma.
The taste is really good for a single IPA with fruit forward of orange/grapefruit citrusy, but mellowed by mango pineapple type flavors that blend into a really well balanced beer.  The balance of citric and pine type flavors make this a joy to drink.
I really liked this beer.  I was expecting something over the top but found a really well balanced mellow beer with just the right amount of acidity from the hops being mellowed by the malt additions. 603 charactersRutgersEng, Oct 06, 2014

The beer pours a peachy, apricot orange color, with good head retention and decent lacing.   On the nose, I get considerable tropical fruit, dominated by apricot, mango and peach, but with underlying orange citrus and light pine as well.  As good as it smells, thiis beer is even better on the palate.  Again, there is a melange of tropical fruit, as the flavor profile replicates the nose, but the flavor intensity is very impressive.  The finish is very clean, with some nice hoppy bitterness to bouy the tropical fruit.  Mouthfeel is medium bodied to full, with a long, tropical fruit and lightly bitter finish.  Alcohol is well integrated into the flavor profile, and drinkability is exceptional.
An outstanding beer, obvoiusly, though it's hard to think of this as an APA.  Whatever, this is terrific stuff.  Very, very impressive. 928 charactersJohn_M, Oct 05, 2014

S:  amazing citrus notes of grapefruit and orange.
M:  mild to medium body with a much more hoppy taste than an average pale ale.
T:  significant citrus hops in the initial flavor profile and finishes very smooth.this is a very happy pale ale, but for hop fans is a must try.
O:  this is easily my favorite go to beer.  It's about $8 a 22oz and difficult to come by only with the brewery only 70 miles away.  This is a far superior Sierra Nevada pale ale or a great "all day" citra from pipeworks. GREAT beer!

4.25/5  rDev -5.1%A: Off white head a finger tall in the teku that slowly receded and left behind beautiful cathedral like lacing. The beer is light orange to pale gold with moderate clarity. 
S: Huge, bright juicy mangos, papaya, guava and other tropical fruits. Moderate grassy,  pine aromas with honey like malt aroma. Clean base malt aroma and fermentation character. very pleasant overall.
T: Moderate bitterness with a beutiful bouquet of tropical fruit flavors on par with the aroma. Mango and papaya with pineapple and goji berries. The malt character is surprisingly balanced with a bready character and a slight bread crust as it warms up. I am picking up a vegetable character in the finish that takes away from the drinkability, but it finishes very clean.
M: Clean and moderate body with moderate carbonation and a creamy mouthfeel. Some resinous/ sticky mouthfeel after a few sips pass the tongue.
O:  A fantastic Pale Ale balanced like one in the bitterness department but with way more aroma and flavor from the hops. The vegetal character I was getting is the only thing I didn’t care for in the beer. I would have liked to have known the bottling date on this thing too! It was from a cooler and I drank it the same day I got it.. not sure I could have drank it fresher. Hopefully that vegetal flavor isn’t the norm. 1,324 charactersguityler83, Oct 01, 2014

Served in a snifter
L - It falls in the lighter end of the amber spectrum. It has golden highlights. A rather aggressive pours yielded about two inches of off-white head. 
S - I get lights citrus notes along with some tropical fruit and pine. 
T - The taste has a building bitterness that is lent from citrus. I also tasted some mango and pine. 
F - Medium with biting carbonation
O - It is a great pale ale. It drinks more like an IPA. A big thank you to Fargrow for the opportunity to try this one. 521 charactersbuschbeer, Sep 28, 2014

Appearance: Pours a straw color that's foggy with a little bit of a white head that lingers.
Smell: big citrus nose. Pine sol notes. Makes me feel clean just smelling it.
Taste:  a little more mellow than the smell. Definitely not overpowering like some others that I've had that share that nose. Makes it very easy drinking. 
Mouthfeel: a little bit of the pine cleaner aftertaste, but otherwise very clean overall. Get it? I crack myself up.
Overall: Definitely see why this scores so highly. A very welcome addition to WI! 607 charactersdon1481, Sep 28, 2014

4.54/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance:  Pours a hazy honey color with a pretty decent head that leaves many clumps of lacing behind
Smell:  Big citrus and tropical fruit aromatics, with pineapple, mango and ruby red grapefruit
Taste:  There might be a hint of toffee malt but it is simply a platform for the hops to strut their stuff and strut it they do - bringing pineapple, mangy and citrus flavors; exceedingly juicy, with a hint of melon in the finish
Mouthfeel:  Light to medium body with moderate to high carbonation
Overall:  A fantastic APA - glad I was able to get a fresh sample
Thanks, mykey120, for the opportunity
And thanks, too, to ta_hagen, for the chance to try the contract-brewed canned version - I am not changing my ratings but that beer falls short of what the brewery achieves on its home turf
And further thanks to darktronica for a chance to revisit the contract-brewed canned version - much better this go round 918 charactersbrentk56, Sep 16, 2014

Column of bubbles rises continuously from the bottom.  2+ finger thick head is full of quite large bubbles.  Dissipates semi-quick, probably due to the large bubbles.  Lots of very sticky lacing left behind.
Big lemon, grapefruit, and orange rind aroma.  Caramel malt.  Mango and honey dew.
Mango, honey dew, and grapefruit on first sip.  A bit of pine.  More citrus afterward in the form of lemon and orange.  Caramel malt, doughy and a bit sweet.  
Moderate body with a smooth mouth feel.  Good mix of creamy, oily, and bitter.  Lingering citrus.  Medium carbonation.
Best APA I've had.  Great flavors, smooth, well balanced. 660 charactersleroybrown10, Sep 12, 2014

S-  holy crap! Aromatic intensity on another level.  Mango like crazy, grapefruit, lemon grass.  The hop level is busting out of the glass in a feeble attempt to contain it.   5
T/M- Despite it being lighter in body, it lacks nothing in flavor.  All the tantalizing hop notes that the nose presented, and then joined by a dense, cracker/biscuit like malt base.  Multiple waves of juicy goodness coming straight at you.  A timely charred bitter finish, yet absolutely no astringency. 4.5
O- Quite possibly the best use of the Citra hop I have encountered.  So much flavor packed into this pale ale.  Hype met...and then some.

5/5  rDev +11.6%There is no question that this is not only my favorite beer of the year alongside many others, but this one has just been an incredible staple all year long. It has all of the beer components nailed. The citra hop really shines in this beer. The wonderful marriage of subtle sweetness, and a citrusy punch gives this beer great balance. Notes of citrus and cantaloupe just make this beer sing. This is World Class. 414 charactersWynnDavis, Sep 06, 2014

On draft at BBQ Brickhouse in Madison. Nice lemony pine smell. Very cloudy yellow orange color. White head. Nice refreshing taste. Very citrusy. Slightly bitter, mostly on the back end. Solid easy drinking brew.
Re-rate on 5/3/14
This time I bought a bomber that was freshly delivered today. Night and day. Awesome fresh hop smell. The taste is so much better too. When I had it on tap the first time at BBQ Brickhouse, it had a lemon pledge taste. Now its just nice citrusy greatness. 509 characterskkleu357, Sep 04, 2014

4.85/5  rDev +8.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5My biggest 'want' finally goes down the ol' gullet! Pours a slightly hazed yellowy-orange color with a tight, white head. Soft lacing. Aroma is very unique. I got a big whiff of garlic and green onion along with some mossy aromas and a bit of cattiness. Melon and mango as well. I know this is Citra but in the nose, the hop comes off differently and I love it. The flavor legit blew me away. Each sip made me say "wow" even louder. The green onion and garlic and cat and hemp is more subdued than the nose. Instead, I get a huge rush of tropical fruit. I've had plenty of Citra brews but this one is very distinguished. It has lots of tropical fruit but the flavor of honeydew melon is so damn rich. Very grassy. I also got a minty flavor that put this one over the top for me. Unlike any other Citra brew I have tried. The body is just hovering around medium. The carbonation is lively. The bitterness isn't too bold but it pricks up quickly. I have had a few from Toppling Goliath and all I have tasted have been phenomenal. This one exceeded my ridiculously lofty expectations. One of the best beers I have had. Enjoyed via bottle. 1,135 charactersVelvetExtract, Sep 02, 2014

Look - maybe even more cloudy orange than previous batches.  
Smell - Mango, Mango, Mango.
Taste - the perfect showcase beer for the Citra hop.  Fruit explosion, dominated by that mango taste with a slight bitterness.
Feel - great mouth feel.  perfect amount of carbonation.  nice finish, doesn't linger too long.
Overall - excellent as past tastings.
11/30/14 - Had two pints on draft at a tasting in Milwaukee at the Sugar Maple.  Spectacular.  I would love to do a blind tasting with ZD from FFF as these are my current #1 and #2 APAs. 681 characterszratcliff, Aug 23, 2014

4.5/5  rDev +0.4%Bomber pour thanks to a trade...
It was love at first sniff-- big citrus, tropical fruits, and skanky pine....immediately reminded me of Lawson's sip of sunshine! 
Color-- could've been green for all I cared-- but a fairly clear dark copper
Taste-- delicious flavors of hops, mild citrus, and rosemary...
Mouthfeel-- slick, oily, full-bodies, and well carbonated
Overall-- its the second TG I've had, and though I loved Light Speed, this is (a little less fruity) more funky and complex... 
This beer belongs in the category of crisp, hoppy, mildly fruity, and just-enough-malt to balance it, along with MBC (A more interesting version of Lunch), Lawsons SOS, and HF PAs... Bravo!! 688 charactersReady4aHeady, Aug 16, 2014

The nose on this beer is perfection, huge blast of peach, pineapple, oranges, slight piney and resin and they all mix together beautiful but still stand out individually. The taste is a slightly muted version of the nose, terribly delicious and refreshing without much bittering flavor in the finish. The taste isn't very complex but it is phenomenal, and the finish is long tasty and smooth. Great mouthfeel not overly carbonated over heavy, perfect lightish body for a pale.
Overall, pretty much a masterpiece of brewing. 607 charactersTheFizzinator, Aug 07, 2014

Honey gold haziness with sticky white carb ta boot.
Super clean... fleshy citrus fruit presence... semisweet, semi-bitter. 
Flavor is unmatched. Malt is very minimal, leaving room for orange juice, faint pineapple, tastefully bitter, the sweet and bitter bits are mild and perfectly in tandem. 
The perfect pale ale, if you ask me. 361 charactersramay86, Jul 30, 2014

4.33/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Hazy fuzzy and orange brew, topped by a firm white head.  Good retention, and very nice lacing.
Tropical and citrus hop aromas from the moment I started the pour; dominant and obvious. Some definite dry biscuit in the background, lurking not far behind the hops. Almost a peppery bite to the aroma; if I didn't know it was all Citra (with no rye), I could have been fooled into a number of other guesses. Ruby red grapefruit is probably the most dominant aspect of the hop profile, to go with mango, pineapple, orange, and lemon.
Bitter and balanced up front, quickly followed by a sweet, juicy note, and finished with a biting, bracing bitterness. Typical of Citra, the aroma and flavor carry a slight mismatch, with more tropical fruit in the flavor. Mango and pineapple, just a hint of citrus juice and peel, and a slight dankness and pine. Malt profile well represented; quite smooth, a bit of honey, fair amount of pale biscuit.
Extremely lively, but very smooth; lots of hop oil coating the mouth; fairly light. Slightly dry, but a medium-length finish. Refreshing. A lot of citrus peel on the finish.
Definitely one of the best all-Citra APAs out there; remarkably well balanced and very, very tasty. 1,211 charactersRoguer, Jul 23, 2014

A: Pours a light golden color with a copper hue. Has almost 2 fingers of white frothy head that reduces fairly slowly and leaves a good amount of lacing. 
S: The nose bursts with pineapple, mango, lemon, tangerine, and has an odd underlying presence of dirt. 
T: Very similar to the nose, but the dirt shows up a bit more. I enjoy the fruits and hop presence, but I think the earthiness detracts a bit. 
M: Carbed well, leaves a slightly dry aftertaste. 
O: I really enjoy this beer. The aroma and flavor balance out quite nicely, but I wish there was less of a dirt presence in both. 624 charactersroger617, Jul 19, 2014

A: Pours a clear and glowing golden color with a substantial one and a half finger bone white head. Pretty good retention and tons of sticky lace left with each sip. Looks incredible.
S: Tons and tons of tropical fruit. Loads of ripe mango, pineapple, jackfruit and apricot preserves. A hint of honey malt and grapefruit in the back. Smells absolutely fantastic. The most fruit I think I've ever smelled in a beer. Hoppy Birthday is definitely in trouble.
T: Yeah, it's over. This beer is ridiculous. Tons of mango and pineapple upfront with some insanely smooth malts blanketing everything. Pink grapefruit flesh, a flash of pine and resin and then a smooth finish with pine and mango. The finish lingers forever, but never leaves you with any kind of bitterness. Easily one of the best beers I've ever had. 990 charactersnotchucknorris, Jul 12, 2014

The beer is transparent and golden with a quarter inch of off-white head. Big aroma of pine trees, resin, citrus, grapefruit, melon. Lovely. Super smooth on the palate with an elegant silky bitter finish. Tropical fruit and pine resin. Really fresh and delicious. Super easy to drink with very little alcohol presence.

American Pale Ale
5.8% ABV
50 IBU
APPEARANCE: A beautiful marriage of raw golden honey and ripe peach color poured into my glass. A lazy haziness that ever so slowly began to clear up. Loose frothy white head that had great retention, leaving behind sticky lacing. 
AROMA: This is a one man show for the Citra hops to perform. Lots of bright tropical fruits up front, mango tangerine some fresh squeezed grapefruit and juicy peaches. Slight pine aromas mixed with grass comes in right before the sweet honey malt that rounds out the bouquet. 
TASTE: Toppling Goliath just pulled the pin and threw a tropical fruit grenade in my mouth, BOOM! Taste super fresh and juicy. The same luscious fruits I got on the nose jump out, peaches, mangos, grapefruit some pineapple playing around in there as well. Not to be out shined the sweet toffee, bready malts come rolling in to give a perfect balance to this APA. 
MOUTHFEEL: Medium silky smooth body with lazy but present carbonation. Has a nice lingering, slightly bitter finish that leaves the taste of mango and grapefruit in my mouth. 
OVERALL: I always love when you have high expectations for a beer and they completely live up and go beyond them. Such a great single hop pale ale. Super easy to drink delicious all around for sure this is in my top 5 favorite APA's.

Pours a clear light amber color with a small white head. Strong Citra hop smell. Very fruity and citrusy on the nose. Mouthfeel is weak and somewhat watery. I have to say I expected more after the hype and this beer's 100 rating. It's not bad for a 5.8% abv beer but I really thought this would be on par with Zombie Dust.

pseudo sue. my first from the infamous Toppling Goliath. thanks camron.
a - pale rusty orange. big ol white head, decent retention/some lace.
s - juicy mango pineapple big tropical fruits all around. pine sap and leafy hops. slight toffee malts, very much hop-centric though.
t - mango mango mango. tons of intense juicy tropical fruit, citrus, and resiny/earthy tones. toffee malt a bit stronger, but still quite a hop party. surprising amount of flavor for a single hop pale ale, and this ABV.
m - good body with some nice foamy higher carbonation. medium bitterness. very very drinkable.
o - i've had beers with mango flavor hops, but not beers with MANGO flavor hops. tasty, unique, awesome drinkability, maybe a little too fruity for some, but very good, especially for the ABV. 965 charactersChico1985, Jun 29, 2014

a - Pours a deep amber-orange color with one inch of bright white head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks good.
s - Smells of citra hops, floral notes, honey, fruity malts, tropical fruits, light resin notes, and some grapefruit. Awesome nose, tons of citrus and tropical fruits to it. I love it.
t - Tastes of citra hops, fruity malts, tropical fruits, pineapples, grapefruit, floral notes, and oranges. More oranges and citrus here, less tropical fruits in general. Very good, not quite as good as the nose though.
m - Medium body and low carb, smooth and creamy. No bitterness and very easy to drink. 
o - Overall I thought this was a great beer; I really liked it a lot. I wouldn't put this on the same level as Hoppy Birthday, ZD, or Daisy Cutter, but would put it on that second tier of great hoppy pale ales with some stuff I've had from Trillium, HF, and Tired Hands. A great beer with nice citrusa nd tropical fruits, and crazy easy to drink. A top 10 pale ale for sure, highly recommended. 1,128 charactersmdfb79, Jun 23, 2014

4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75A- Poured to four pint glasses for a tasting with a slightly hazy, golden-orange body. A white cap builds up to around a finger on the smaller pours with a frothy, foamy texture. Decent head retention falling to a thick ring. Lacing is a combo of sheets and spots.
S- Stone and tropical fruit bomb. Mango really bursts out of the bottle and glasses immediately. Dank herbal mint, tangerine, apricot and general citrus fruit nectar without the zesty edge.
T- Man oh man does mango nectar and pulp really shine in this beer. Complimenting that is dank herbs, mint, papaya, apricots, lime and peach with just a hint of citrus for me. Juicy stone and tropical fruits above a clean yeast and grains.
MF- Light bodied with a hint of creaminess that adds just enough texture for the flavors at hand. The carbonation is moderately high and silky on the palate. Finishes slightly bitter with mango nectar lingering.
Lives up to its reputation and to me is better than the other hugely heralded Citra hopped Pale Ale. Mango and minty dank herbs compliment each other so well and this drinks way to easily. I could kick a keg of this. 1,127 characterscbutova, Jun 14, 2014

4.93/5  rDev +10%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - A gorgeous yellow orange hue, almost golden. A bit of haziness is apparent. Head is moderate and the lacing is quite good.
S - Mango, papaya, peach, pineapple, grapefruit and a slight hint of bubblegum. Slight traces of garlic piney dankness comes through in the aroma as well. A beautiful bouquet of fruits come together in harmony. Super complex; would be perfect with a tad more intensity.
T - Super juicy. Citra hops really shine here and they hit in huge waves of pineapple, peach, mango, grapefruit and papaya just as you would detect on the nose. The bubblegum I was getting in the nose comes through very subtly mid palate as well. There's also a bit of onion / garlic astringency near the finish which reminds me a lot of Enjoy By. So much flavor and complexity for 5.8%; it's mind blowing.
M - Amazing mouthfeel. It's medium bodied and quite malty for how hop forward this beer is, even though you can't really taste those malts. Finishes very dry and is super sticky. Perfect.
O - This is my first TG brew and I am already a huge fan. One of the best APAs I've had, with only Zombie Dust coming close. I think this beer has better flavor than Zombie Dust, but not quite as good of an aroma. I can only hope that Toppling Goliath will distribute to Omaha, NE sometime soon. 1,291 charactersDemoniChris, Jun 08, 2014

A- Poured a straw yellow that darkened after it settled, semi thick 1 finger head left thick lacing.
S- Citrus. Not too in your face, but citrus notes abound. Easily the best smelling pale ale I've come across.
T- Citrus notes, slightly bitter, with a clean after taste.
M- Nice carbonation, light on the mouth, tickled as it went down.
Overall I have some in my fridge to share with friends who have yet to try this but it's just so good that I might have a few to myself. This is a beer everyone should try. Citra hops are my favorite and this is my favorite citra beer so far. 624 charactersJared14, Jun 08, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is my platonic ideal of what an American Pale Ale should be.
On tap at Toppling Goliath Taphouse 
A: Golden hue with about half a finger of head. The crystalline effervescence lingers on to the side of the glass after each sip. Not quite hazy, not quite transparent.
S: Oranges and grapefruit. Smells like I just opened a carton of low-pulp Tropicana OJ out of my fridge. A hint of floral character on the back end.
T: Orange juice is the first thought that comes to mind. Subtle sweetness follows with a bit of a pine and resin kick. 
M: Medium body. Definitely not watery, but it's not hard to cut through either. Leaves back a refreshing creamy sensation once swirled inside the mouth. I wouldn't classify this as being sticky, but it's almost there in terms of viscosity
O: A great example of what an American Pale Ale should aspire to be. Full-ish bodied, yet very drinkable (I even might dare say session-able) but at the same time complex enough for you to want to take it slow and appreciate all the different aromas and flavors in play. 1,056 charactersamano_h, Jun 08, 2014

S: One of the best beers I have ever smelled. Strong floral and Citrus with a tropical finish.
T: Starts off mild with the hops and citrus. Then it punches you with a strong canteloupe and mango aftertaste.

4.65/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Received this from BA BottleCaps80 as part of a small trade, as I've been curious to try it for a long time. Enjoyed out of a 22 oz brown bomber with no discernible dating on the label or bottle. That said, I know this was bottled within the last couple weeks, so it's pretty fresh. Poured into a nonic style tumbler glass.
Appearance - Pours a crystal clear copper orange color that allows me to see right through to the other side of the glass. EDIT: after reading some of the other reviews that all seem to mention opacity from hazy to murky, I can't help but wonder if mind is so translucent because of how close to bottling it is. Anyway, back to the review. Not much variation of hue except for a slight amber highlight around the bottom of the liquid. Atop the body sits a frothy, towering three finger cream-colored head with a slightly orange tint. Retention is moderate, with sudsy lace that eventually dries leaving faint sticky ring impressions around the side of the glass. I've seen more beautiful beers, but this one hits all the basics.
Smell - Such an intoxicatingly delicious aroma that I'm conflicted over whether I want to dive in or sit here inhaling for several minutes. A bouquet of citrus that reminds me of that aroma you get right when you cut into a fresh fruit. Tangerine, mango, sweet pineapple, and even just a hint of grapefruit pith, but without any of the pungency that you get from an IPA. There is just enough pale malt presence provide a water cracker base for the wonderful Citra topping.
Taste - The promise of the smell is delivered on with interest, with the citrus and tropical fruits from before now succulent and juicy with again hints of mango and clementine with accents of grapefruit zest, pineapple and guava. Again there is just enough malt to give this one some nice body, and the fruit profile is so prevalent that it tricks the palate into thinking there is a lot of sweetness when in reality, the only sweetness comes from the grain base. Bitterness is low to nonexistent.
Mouthfeel - Medium-to-light bodied and moderate carbonation, with an incredible juiciness that makes this beer infinitely drinkable.
Overall, just an outstanding beer. It reminds me of ZD in the way the fruit is so aggressive without kicking into that level of pungency and bitterness that you get from an IPA. It's one of those beers for which the taste is so refreshing that it's easy to take big draws out of the glass because it almost gives the impression that it's quenching your thirst. I'm halfway tempted to sit on my second bottle for a month or so to see if the opacity, nose and taste change significantly, as it's not often that I've gotten a hop-forward ale that was this fresh. I say halfway tempted because it's so good that I doubt I'm going to have that kind of willpower. 2,820 charactersLambicPentameter, Jun 04, 2014

It has a great mouthfeel and a very aromatic smell. I loved the taste of it and enjoyed it more than other well liked IPA's like Pliny and Heady. The only bad part is it's not available in California. 285 charactersGoalcam, May 22, 2014

A - Pours a beautiful apricot haze with just over a finger of head.
S - Ridiculous amounts of lush, tropical fruit: grapefruit, pineapple, mango, peach with a hint of pine.
T - Pure, gushing tropical hop flavors balanced perfectly with a sweet malt finish.
M - Smooth, almost creamy, not unlike Apocalypse Cow. 
O - A killer APA - my favorite to date. Definitely deserving of the hype. 454 charactersHalfbrother83, May 13, 2014

Pours a soft pale orange with just under two fingers of white head. The healthy layer of froth that remains leaves some sizeable sheets of lace. 
Vibrant citrusy aromas of oranges, clementines, mango, pineapple and just a hint of malt sweetness. 
Tastes just as bright as the nose promised. Clementines, pineapple, mango, mandarins, grapefruit peel, some cracker and mild lemon drops. Layer upon layer of Citra hop goodness without a hint of alcohol. Delicious and ridiculously easy to drink. 
Fairly light body but not too much so. Moderately sharp carbonation. Fairly bitter citrus zest finish with oranges, grapefruit and kumquat. 
One of the best American pale ales that I've tried. Certainly among the upper crust of Citra single hopped brews out there. Very worthy. This is one of the two or three truly special APAs that I'd actually drink regularly if I had access to it. 1,006 charactersThickNStout, May 13, 2014

Thanks to Mattafett for this one.
App- You know a tangerine. That color. A bit orange, hazy and light peach colored if that makes sense. Does to me. A small head but with a great spider web of cling. Highlighted in the glass. Bubbly white head that vanishes rather quickly.
Smell- A bit light, but clean. A bit of everything on the bottle. A little mango, fruit, dirt and forest. Small amount of evergreen with a small pine and must to me.
Taste- This is clean. You can tell its a single hop and is meant to be a pale ale. I enjoy the light clean flavors on this one. A good amount of the citra comes in as its refreshing crispness takes over. The balance is good. 
Mouth- A lighter medium body, almost touches on a bit thin, then I remember its meant to be a pale ale. A small carbonation. Not as bubbly as I wouldve thought on this one. Good hop flavor remains. Citrus, oily, pine.
Drink- I will say the debate will rage. I still like ZD better, but this is pretty good for coming out of Iowa. 1,047 charactersFosterJM, May 11, 2014

Smell: Tropical fruits- mango, pineapple, citrus, peaches. Also, slight yeast/breadiness (standard TG yeasty smell, same that I smell/taste in Zeelander).
Taste: See above description of smell. Also, excellent balance overall for a pale ale.
Mouthfeel: Medium to Thick for an APA. Carbonation is well-tuned.
Overall: I possibly could be biased but this is better than ZD through and through. I've also had it on-tap many times and even more amazing in that fashion. Best. Pale. Ale. 524 charactersWill_Edgar, May 09, 2014

Review from notes, 3/12/14
Appearance: Orange with some copper and honey accents - nice level of clarity - pours with a medium-sized, off-white head - leaves some impressive lacing, leaves walls at times
Smell: Decidedly ridiculous, with some serious Citra - dank, dank hop cones - very tropical, with an abundance of mango and pineapple - big citrus component with orange and grapefruit - to an extent, this honestly smells like a bag of Citra hop pellets (not that this is a bad thing) - some pale malts in the back, but this is mostly just hops
Taste: Tropical absurdity - huge tropical flavors, pineapple, mango, apricot, and peach - orange, tangerine, and grapefruit - fleshy and oily - nicely bitter, doesn't creep too far into IPA category - some pale malts in the background, but this mostly just tastes like straight-up juice
Mouthfeel: On the light side of medium, very resinous, nice carbonation, finishes with hops
Overall: Pseudo madness
Somebody put hop pellets in a blender. This has a stupid amount of flavor for a relatively low alcohol beer. This more or less lives up to the hype. 1,167 charactersangrybabboon, May 08, 2014

S -- Heady mango, apricot, and pineapple and the slightest hint of malt sweetness and grain.
T -- Tastes like a tropical shake -- lots of layers. Mango, honey, pineapple, hints of floral lemon and grapefruit. Really well balanced, slightly sweet with just a hint of bittering. Very approachable and remarkably interesting. Just beautiful.
M -- Mild to moderate carbonation, medium body, with a subtle lingering resinous reminder. A little more would have given the perfect effervescence to cleanse the palate -- small complaint.
O -- Lives up to the hype. Buy it, talk about it, drink it. Tell others. 751 charactersCPeterson, May 01, 2014

Aroma is sensational: peaches and nectarines, mouthwatering.
Any fan of the citra hop has to instantly be in love with Pseudo Sue: the flavors are very peachy with nectarines and oranges picked at the height of ripeness. Nice long lasting bitterness and lingering flavors that you want to go on forever.
Aside from a slight thin quality to the body, it has little detraction from the enjoyment of this exceptionally well crafted APA. 
Bravo to Toppling Goliath for the ability to produce large batches with an exceptionally high level of quality throughout: this bomber was thoroughly delicious from the first sip to the last, and eminently crushable. Would love to revisit this one again and again, exceptionally high on my recommendation list. 869 charactersHendry, Apr 26, 2014

S: big astringent hops. As you smell you get a tropical tangerine, mango smell, similar to that in heady topper and zombie dust. .
T: big, big flavor. First I get big honey, caramel notes that is followed by hop astringency and bitterness on the backend. Very well.balanced. tropical fruit layers on top of the malt. 
Mf: appropriate carbonation, medium body, which makes it seem more like a 7-8% abv beer.
Overall: a very well done beer. The flavors are nothing new really but very enjoyable and well made. Much less bready than zombie dust. 603 charactersraynmoon, Apr 21, 2014

Lots of really pleasant hop aromas on this one. I get fresh-cut grass, some orangey floral citrus, a little bit of earthy dankness, and some spiciness. Not much malt on the nose to me, but I like it that way. Really great and surprisingly mellow hop aromas without being at all over-the-top with it.
Taste starts out with all those hop flavors, but a biscuity, sugar-cookie like malt profile quickly starts to assert itself, which was surprising because I didn't get that on the nose at all. The hops and the malts play really nicely with each other through the swallow. Finish is only slightly bitter, with the sweetness barely winning out. Exactly what I would hope for in a pale ale - there is an incredible amount of hop flavor in here, but it's perfectly balanced by the malts. I also feel kind of shocked how un-cloying the malts are - I feel like often the way that intense hops get balanced out is through syrupy caramel malts, but there's not much syrupiness here. The only flaw that I can think of is that the aftertaste is maybe a little on the sweet side, but really I'm just quibbling.
Mouthfeel is really great as well - a little bit thicker than what I would expect for the style and ABV, but lots of carbonation to cut through it.
Overall, this is an incredible beer, that totally exceeded my high expectations. Perfect use of hops without going too far. It's amazing how much hop flavor they put in here while maintaining balance and drinkability. I would consider this a benchmark pale ale. Huge thanks to roostor07 for including this as an extra - I'm so glad I got to try it! 1,844 charactersMasterfulIdiot, Apr 20, 2014

Pours clouded golden with a thin head. Strands of lacing stick
The smell is of a robust hop explosion. The powerful aroma came through upon opening the bottle. It has a wonderful citric aroma - grapefruit, orange and mango.
The taste is of bitter citric and tropical fruits. A subtle malt backing has a cracker-like character. It balances the hops while showcasing the citra hops. A touch of pepper mixes in in the long finish.
The body is appropriate for a pale ale that is on the fuller side of the spectrum. Overall, it is smooth despite a bite to it.
A great show of citra hops. A hoppy pale ale, for sure. Not harsh though there is a bit of a bite. A very enjoyable APA. 695 charactersjwc215, Apr 16, 2014

Appearance: Copper Orange with a slight haze, that pours a great white head that laces the glass. 
Smell: Tropical fruits, orange, mango, with a big hop back bite.
Taste: Follows with the smell, delicious fruits with peach, nectarine, orange, and then finishes with a bitterness. Really, really good.
Mouthfeel: Slightly thick, but very very easy to drink. Has the perfect texture. 
Overall: Maybe the best Pale Ale I've ever had. Super solid, and one to look out for. 539 charactersBighead6365, Apr 10, 2014

Smell - lots and lots of citrus. However on the very back end I did get some off smell (cat urine), but that is only when I really tried to get a deep smell
Taste - wow, just wow. This is what a beer should taste like. Great hop/ malt balance with lots of great citrus.
Mouthfeel - great carbonation level and with a taste that rolls off your tongue this is great.
Overall - wish I could get more of this. if you have a chance you MUST get this beer. 531 charactersbeatenbyjacks, Apr 09, 2014

Poured from a 22oz bottle, no #freshbeer info.
Looks gorgeous in the glass. A completely hazy body, color is banana-orange. Frothy head, major lacing with chunks, excellent retention, hits all the notes. Aroma is of strong citrus, lemon, floral and mangoes. Flavor is outstanding! Real lush mango, lemon rind, plump citurs fruit, juicy, refreshing, creamy. So very good, tastes like real hop fruit. Near perfect, think if the aroma was a bit more powerful, i would have a 5 on my hands 519 characterspapat444, Apr 08, 2014

T: Upfront I get a watermelon like vegetable taste. Not as flavorful as the aroma would suggest, maybe some light citrus notes. Cant get over the overwhelming watermelon taste. 
M: Crisp with a light sweetness, appealing dryness as well.

The aroma is bright tropical fruit and citrus. Pineapple, grapefruit, citrus zest and just shines of Citra.
The flavor follows with those tropical and citrus fruits. A really zesty flavor with a very light bready malt in the middle. A light bitterness in the end, which is appropriate for the style.
An extremely clean drinking beer and holds even more fruits than Zombie Dust (an also Citra single hopped pale ale). 468 charactersdar482, Apr 06, 2014

A - Pours a hazy, slightly cloudy golden color.

T - Follows the nose. Waves and waves of citrus, extremely clean
M - Medium body, borders on being slightly over carbonated, but I'm willing to forgive that due to how delicious it is.
This is easily one of my new favorite beers. It is incredible how TG is able to pack so much flavor into a 6% APA. I definitely will be stocking up on this one whenever possible. 609 charactersPattyCakes227, Mar 30, 2014

S: Huge hop aroma. You get the citra hops up front. The hop character overpowers the malt profile in the nose.
T: Huge hop up front with leafy citrus flavors There is a perfect malt backbone in the flavor unlike the nose. There is a sweet caramel and toffee to match the bitter from the hops.
M: Huge mouthfeel, again maybe too much for a pale ale. This is more of a body for an IPA. A little light on the carbonation.
O: A great beer. Well done toppling goliath. The hop malt balance is great. I don't believe that this should be considered an IPA. At 7% and the decently sized body to the beer this is not a pale ale. 778 charactersjvillefan, Mar 25, 2014

A: Pours a deep but clear gold color with a half finger of messy, yellow-tinted head. Recedes quickly to a ring, and leaves some intricate lacing. Very good retention. 
S: Big citrus and tropical hops, sweetish malt, slightly sharp lemon note.
T: Lots of juicy pink grapefruit, sugar coated grapefruit, some sweetish malt peeks, with almost no bitterness present except for a tinge on the finish. Wow, superb stuff. But it leans a little on the sweet side; there’s a surprising amount of residual sugar here. And it tastes a bit muddled as it warms.
M: Medium body, slightly creamy, and medium-high carbonation. 
O: This is very good, but the drinkability is surprisingly low due to the relatively high sweetness and the muddled flavors that emerge as this warms. 812 characterspmarlowe, Mar 25, 2014

This beer proves that not everything needs to be double or imperial to be outstanding. Easily the best APA I've had. The pour is inviting with a deep golden body and foamy head. The smell jumps out of the glass as sweet citrus, orange juice, and five alive. The best way to describe the taste is like Squirt with TANG added to it. It's just that juicy and sweet. The only critique I'd have is that the sweetness would hold me to 2 glasses or the 22 oz bomber. Nothing wrong with that at all, but I just couldn't throw these back all day. 573 charactersPHBoiler, Mar 24, 2014

A: Extremely light in color; a bright, yellowish gold gives off a very welcoming appearance. Nice full head for its light color. The head is a perfectly shiny white that sticks around all the way till the last drop.
S: Very citrusy, and fruity in smell. The citra hop really comes through and is very appealing. I thought that the mango character came out a lot stronger in the aroma rather than the taste which worked to the beer's benefit.
T: Very simple beer (single hopped) that still packs a mouthful of flavor. Very slight hints of mango, but orange came through more for me in the taste. The citra hop still packs an impressive bitterness, however, for a 50 IBU beer this does not seem as bitter as the number would suggest due to the great, mellowing, blend its citrusy components give it.
M: Beer goes down extremely smooth with a fairly medium body to it. The mouthfeel of the head is just as good as its appearence.
O: This is a year round brew that in my opinion makes for an exceptional spring/summer beer. This would be a great beer to enjoy in the sun, out on the deck/porch. I am extremely impressed with this single hopped brew. Goes to show that a lot of the time simpler is better. 1,258 charactersMTBrewr, Mar 18, 2014

S - A massive fresh ripe mango aroma. Pineapple, passion fruit, tangerine. Slight honey malt sweetness. 
T - Fresh tropical fruit bouquet that almost tastes like natural flavours were added. A huge mango presence with lighter notes of passion fruit, grapefruit and tangerine. A slight honey sweetness provides the perfect amount of malt sweetness. 
M - Medium body, slightly creamy. Sticky and oily. Light carbonation. 
O - The perfect APA. Wonderful.

No idea when it was bottled.
A- a light gold. Opaque for a pale ale. No head and virtually no lace. A few bubbles in the center of the beer. Looks more like a sour than a pale ale.
S- honestly when i first smelled it it reminded me of urine. But now i'm getting sweet hops like orange and grass. The malt is well hidden but there is a faint syrupness. 
T- follows the nose a lot. There is no bitterness even though there is a strong hop character. The hops are sweet and citrusy and leaves a tangy deliciousness on the back of your tongue. The hops sit in your mouth waiting for the next sip. Very very delicious taste.
M- so smooth. No bitterness or harshness on the swallow. Not really any kind of carbonation either. Very nice mouthfeel.
O- very very well made pale ale. Definitely my favorite pale ale i've had. So smooth and sweet hops mix so well with the malt. So delicious. 933 charactersmlhyatt, Mar 15, 2014

Appearance: Slight chill haze on a honey a copper a dark gold. Head is bright-white bubbly and leaves distinct sheets and notches of lacing. Decent head retention leaves a small cap. Moderate carbonation on the pour. 
Smell: Citra explosion. Mango, pineapple, tangerine and all things tropical. Light and bright and fruity. Something like a buttered club cracker. Light pale malt sweetness coupled with a slight caramel malt. Slightly bready. Almost like butterscotch. Definitely not an infection, but the Citra is way more prevalent than I've encountered. Peach. Light and clean and fruity. 
Taste: Very slightly bitter. Some hints of pine needle. Tropical but a little less than the nose. Mango, pineapple in abundance, peach, and tangerine. Super juicy and wet. Malts are light and bready with some slight cooked malts. A touch sweet outside of the fruity hops. So much Citra. Mild buttered biscuit. Bready with some caramelized sweetness. Slight bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: Medium to light body with a wet but not slick mouthfeel. Moderate carbonation and decidedly clean. A touch dry. 
Overall: Sue can be my friend. 
It's a pure Citra beer. That makes it good. 1,206 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Mar 12, 2014

A: Pours a deep glowing light amber with golden highlights beneath a very dense and thick off-white head that faded into a soft fuzzy film. Thick sticky sheets of lace were left down the glass. 
S: Huge tropical and citrus hop notes of mango, passion fruit, sugary pineapple, and tangerine nectar. I get a ton of peach as the beer warms. Probably one of the best hop profiles I’ve had the pleasure of smelling.
T: Juicy and sweet hop flavors that follow the nose. I get notes of peaches, tangerine, papaya, grapefruit, sweet dried mango, agave and a touch of evergreen bitterness. The finish is sweet and juicy and the aftertaste is lightly bitter but still very juicy and greasy with hop resin. 
M: Greasy and slick mouthfeel with a smooth and oily dose of hop resin. Wet and splashy mouthfeel, smooth and easy to drink, with a medium-full body. Extremely quaffable. 
O: The best thing since sliced bread. If toppling goliath considers this a pale ale then I don’t want to know what an ipa is. Some of the best use of citra in a beer I’ve had to date. This really blew me away. Thanks again Paul! 1,173 charactersscottfrie, Mar 09, 2014

Hazy, golden hue with highlights of amber; a bit of chunky yeast sediment was the only “flaw” in this beautiful pale ale. A crown of white foam graces the top of the elixir. 
This is the best smell pale ale I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. Period. The nose was so vibrant and rich; lemon zest, limes, grapefruit, pungent and yet tropical. The malt is distant… let the hops sing. And they hit the high notes. The aroma is now ingrained in my brain. Simply perfect!
The palate was a letdown… ONLY because the aromas were so strikingly amazing. It is delicious and complex and beast of a pale ale. Orange fresh, mangos, lemon zest, pinnacle, citrus rinds, pith with a simple hint of pine and floral. Devine. Mouthwatering good.
A solid medium in body. Ideal carbonation. Good mouthfeel. 
Tasty as hell. Drinkable as hell. A superb pale ale. It’s a legit pale ale… it’s not an IPA labeled a pale ale. It is a real deal hoppy pale ale. Really complex and a showcase of the Citra hops. Worth seeking out. 1,114 charactersbditty187, Mar 08, 2014

Bottles are from the new efficient system which raised the ABV slightly
A - Pours a beautiful orange/yellow hazy amber with a 2 finger white foam head with lacing 
S - Tropical fruits, citrus, hops, and even hints of grassy earth. The smell is less hoppy then King Sue and the strength of the smell coming from the tropical fruits is a little weaker
T - Taste's like King Sue's child with an extravagant bunch of tropical, citrusy fruits coming through. Crisp and clean, very session able.
M - Mouthfeel is soft, carbonated perfectly. 
O - Citra hops are amazing coming through on this Pale Ale. Drinks like an IPA 
This is one hell of a brew

3.83/5  rDev -14.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Currently #33 on the Top 250 list. It has a perfect 100 rating. Expectations are sky high. 22 fl oz brown glass bottle with appealing well-drawn label art and unbranded pry-off pressure cap acquired in a trade with the extremely generous Duff27 (thanks so much!) and served into an Avery stem-tulip in low altitude Austin, Texas. Reviewed live. Reviewed as a pale ale because the label clearly identifies it as such.
Served cold - straight from me fridge. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.
A: No bubble show forms as it's poured.
Pours a one finger wide head of white colour. Decent thickness and creaminess. Okay frothiness. Complexion could be smoother and more even. Complexion is typical of the style. Head retention is above average - about 3 minutes. Uneven inconsistent lacing clings to the sides of the glass as the head recedes.
Body colour is a clear translucent pale copper of above average vibrance. Excellent clarity. Very clean; no floating yeast particles are visible. Appears adequately carbonated.
Overall, it's a good looking pale ale but I can't say it's unique or special. I'm looking forward to the first sip, but I can't see how anyone could give the appearance alone a perfect 5 out of 5.
Sm: Has a fresh, inviting aroma with bursts of pleasant citrus (grapefruit and tangerine) as well as accompanying esters. I also pick up on mango fruit, a vague tropical character, fresh floral character, and a kiss of pine. I'd like more of a dank resinous oily character as well as some nectary character, but the hop notes here are fresh and right up my alley. There seems to be good diversity and presence of flavour based on the aroma.
The malts are pretty predictable - clean pale malts and a dash of caramalt.
No yeast character, alcohol, or off-notes are detectable. It doesn't have the off-putting soapiness of many hoppy beers. 
Overall, I'm impressed by how seemingly well balanced it is - I don't detect any untamed hop bitterness and it doesn't seem too sweet either. It's a very enjoyable aroma of average strength.
T: The mango fruit is fantastic - and fresh as can be. The citrusy notes are very well balanced and integrated, with plenty of pleasant grapefruit but none of the bitterness or bite grapefruit hop character tends to bring. It has great floral hop character as well, but I'm not finding much in terms of oily, nectary, or resinous hops - though it does have some lovely pine. No matter, the hop profile is lovely as-is, and I find some of the unique tropical character I encountered in their yellow label Xhops. Candied orange peel. Some bubble gum. Papaya. Melon. Quite juicy.
All these diverse hop notes are near perfectly tamed by just the right amount of pale malt-induced sweetness. If caramalt was used, it barely comes through. There are some buried crackery malts too.
It's a clean refreshing flavour profile, and as such it avoids any yeasty character or off-flavours - including overt alcohol.
Balance is great here overall, to the point that the build feels not only cohesive, but gestalt; it's hard to imagine omitting any note without reducing the quality of the beer. That said, I've had more complex, intricate, and subtle pale ales. (Some of Alpine's offerings come to mind). 
The unique tropical character lends it appreciated nuance, and I'm beginning to think that characteristic may be a common feature of Toppling Goliath's hoppy beers (at least based on the two I've had). Maybe these unique tropical notes are going to be to Toppling Goliath what floral hop extract is to Lagunitas. 
I like it. Above average depth of flavour. Average duration and intensity of flavour. There's a lot going on here for a pale ale.
Mf: Overcarbonated, with a light crispness. Smooth and wet. Just a touch oily. Refreshing. Light to medium-bodied. Not too heavy on the palate. Good presence on the palate. Very approachable.
Not gushed, hot, boozy, astringent, or harsh. It's not real soft or creamy either.
Overall, this texture complements the taste well. They've tailored it nicely to the flavour profile they're after.
Dr: Absolutely an easily drinkable pale ale with some great hop notes. It's another solid brew from Toppling Goliath, and one I'd definitely get again. Based on what I've had so far, these cats deserve their impeccable reputation and I really look forward to trying more of their beers. I could drink this stuff happily all night, and would recommend it to friends and trade partners. I don't know how they got so much complexity and diversity of flavour out of the citra hop, but wow.
That said, I don't know that it's a world class brew per se or that it's the 33rd best beer currently being brewed. It's damn good stuff, but I'd stop short of calling it great. It's not perfect, but I'm a big fan.
Huge thanks to Duff27 for this rare opportunity!

Served in pint-size glass at The Coopers Tavern.
Appearance was a very nice golden orange body, with a great fat finger head that offered a slow disappearing act with decent lacing along the side of the glass.
The aroma of this particular brew was kick-ass Citra hops in action. Hits you hard with tropical fruits like pineapple, mango, and literally jumping out of the glass.
Medium body, and carbonation. Slightly bitter on start and finish. Middle offered notes of that fruitiness I mentioned early. Caramel sweetness and a little grassiness too. The word complex really comes to mind here.
A nice dry finish, that kept me wanting to go back in for more. Solid offering from Decorah. I will search out again this year. 783 charactersBeerDazed, Mar 02, 2014

A - Pours slightly hazy orange with a nice one finger tall white head, quickly dissipating down to a light film, leaving sticky webs of lace down the sides of the glass.
S - Smells of bright citra hops, light caramel sweetness, fresh cut grass and strong fresh zested citric fruit. Much like Zombie Dust this one is all about the citric fruit.
T - Starts off with the dynamic duo of strong citra hop bitterness and fresh tropical fruitiness slowly being joined by the grassiness and some mild caramel sweetness. Finish is bitter with a bit of light sweetness, lingering for a little while after the finish.
M - Medium body with moderate carbonation. Crisp, bitter feel from start to finish. Very easy to consume, even with the added ABV.
O - A really nice easy drinking APA. It has everything I love in these hopped up APA's. I would say this is in my top 3 along with Zombie Dust and Edward. I would love to have this on a regular basis. 1,042 charactersorangesol, Mar 01, 2014

A - Dark orange color with a magnificent two finger head that holds real well. Nice sticky lace all over the glass
S - Citrus notes all over the place. An explosion as soon as I lifted the cap. A fruity implosion covered my kitchen, perfect
T - Wow, citra hops rule. Just like the label says, citrus and mango flavors are dominant. Orange, grapefruit, pez candy, lime juice. Amazing
M - Nice medium body with a great smooth feel off the palate. Low carbonation and just enough bite
O - This, to me, is the end all be all of the APA category. Just hits a 5 in every category. Absolutely awesome and so happy I had the chance to get a bottle. Do yourself a favor and seek this one out! 743 charactersrjp217, Feb 26, 2014

A: Pours a hazy orangish-brown with three fingers of cream-colored head that fades into a thin cap with good lacing.
S: Big citrus kick up front with grapefruit and oranges followed by lots of melon aromas reminiscent of mangoes and cantaloupe. Smells like an amazing fruit salad.
T: Similar to the aroma, lots of citrus and melon flavors here. Oranges, grapefruit, mangoes, and cantaloupe all come to mind again with some dank weed and herbal pine flavors underneath. Absolutely delicious.
M: Medium-light body with moderate carbonation, this beer is almost creamy feeling in the mouth, making it very drinkable.
O: One of the best APA's I've ever had. I love the mix of citrus and melon aromas and flavors. Lots of complex hop notes without being overly bitter or a palate-wrecker. 840 charactersn2185, Feb 24, 2014

Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a CBS snifter. Kudos to my snifter, cause that mofo holds the whole bomber. Served chilled...
A) This is a golden amber. A nice finger of white head reaches the top of the snifter. Settles to a dusting. Tons if tight little bubbles cling to the glass when you give it a swirl. Nice lacing with this one.
S) You get some light pine, and some sweet naval oranges. Tropical fruit cocktail. Oh, this is nice... Very nice...
T) Yes... Yes indeed, this follows the nose. Enjoying some nice pine, tropical fruit, mandarin orange. Closing with some citrus rind, that begs you to take another sip. The drinkability here is top notch.
M) Solid medium body with mild carbonation. This shit is some kind of smooth... Nice clean finish... I could drink quite a bit of this...
O) Very impressed with this beer. Would love to have it available on a regular basis. It is that good... 948 charactersRoamingGnome, Feb 23, 2014

Big Thanks to Mark! Fresher than fresh. I'll call the body "harvest orange", it has that look of autumn. There's a touch of haziness throughout. A few streams of carbonation burn to the surface while a couple random bubbles rise here and there to the dirty white head. The foam is creamy on the pour but settles to a fat ring quickly. That ring leaves dense drink lines.
There's nothing but big, ballsy Citra in the nose. Peppery mango, pineapple, guava, and other tropical fruits are first and foremost but there's that handful of dank sticky earthiness. I always get a touch of lactic sugar from Citra too and in PseudoSue's case it works well. Graham crackery malt lays a foundation and a deep pull reveals the pine. There is even some soft vegetal hoppiness as it warms
The Citra hop still amazes me with the sheer amount of flavor you can get from one strain. There's a ton of tropical fruit in the flavor. Everything from mango to pineapple to plantain. The tropical fruitiness is well integrated, the mango is peppery, the pineapple ripe, the plantain soft, and other tropicals bright but nondescript. There's a decent sprinkling of cantaloupe as it warms, which is slightly lactic, I like that. The malt base isn't very noticeable but what's there is sugar cookie based. Very nice.
The body weighs in at a soft medium with an active carbonation up front that softens to velvet on the swallow. The bitterness is on the low side which keeps the drinkability sky high. There's a mildly sweet finish that quickly brings itself to a perfect dryness. Bueno!
PseudoSue is a flat out showcase of what the Citra hop can achieve. It's tropical, piney, and dank, the best of most varietals in one. The mild malt base allows that character to shine. A competitor to Zombie Dust? I suppose. All I know is that they both FUCKING rule! 1,845 charactersjoe1510, Feb 20, 2014

4.88/5  rDev +8.9%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Bottle into Barrelworks Teku.
Appearance is a hazy golden orange color with big fluffy white head that settles to a nice froth and leaves beautiful lacing. Screams unfiltered dry hop!
Aroma brings waves of tropical fruit and rich bready malts. Smells like you just walked into Jamba Juice and Dunkin Donuts at the same time. Peach, mango, passion fruit , Valencia orange, grapefruit peel, and guava juice banging those nostrils. Underneath all that tropical goodness is the freshly baked sweet bread not unlike freshly baked plain glazed donuts. Mouth is watering at this point...
The palate... Well sure enough those bready malts all are up in that taste! This is where this really stands apart from other pales like Zombie Dust. It's definitely more malt forward with enough caramel malts to give you that fresh sweet dough/glazed doughnut character. But it's not overly done, like in many other malt forward IPA's or Pale Ales for that matter, where it just takes over the beer and ruins the experience. All that tropical goodness is there and blends beautifully with the malt base. You get peach pith, blood orange, mango, guava, subtle papaya, and something akin to a fruity bubblegum aftertaste. Just fantastic!
Mouthfeel is definitely heavier than most any pale ale I've ever had. Does this take points away from the beer? Not really. The heavy side of medium body and abundant carbonation is needed to support all those flavors. It really drinks closer to an IPA or even DIPA. It is what it is, all I know is it's damn good.
Overall I may have found my favorite Pale Ale. Though for every moment there can be a different beer to bring you to that bliss always seeked by the hardcore beer geek. This will go in the books as one of the best Pales I've had along with Zombie Dust, Row 2 Hill 56, and Hoppy Birthday. 1,825 charactersMarcWP, Feb 19, 2014

A- Pretty transparent. Nothing special about the appearance. Thin ring of lacing with medium legs.
S- Citrus: grapefruit, apricot (says the wife), lemon. Great nose out of this beer! 
T- Follows the nose. The beer has a smoothness of papaya; so I want to put this in the taste as well. I get many fruits. Obviously when you are having a citra hop anything, this is dominant. Very little bitter hop background. 
M- Very smooth, rich and creamy. That is where I got the papaya. 
O- A very good APA; up there with ZD. 534 charactersgueuzedreg, Feb 18, 2014

S - Damn. This is intense. Mango is overwhelming. Almost skunky in a way that reminds me of a particular herb I was very familiar with in my college days. Tropical fruits abound... papaya, pineapple, passionfruit.... It's like a box of mike and ikes.
T - Tastes a lot like a dried papaya. I'm amazed at how well the bold hop flavors come through without being overbearing. 
M - Mouthfeel is great, a bit less carbonated than I was expecting, which I find to be a good thing.
O - Really blown away by just how good this is. Perfect execution of what APAs across the world hope to grow up to be. Bravo, TG. 789 charactersChimRichels, Feb 14, 2014

Pours a very hazy golden orange, almost like honey. Small half inch head. Not a big enough glass, or substantial enough pour, for any lacing to really form.
One of the cleanest, purest hop aromas I've ever stuck my nose in. Citrus, citrus, citrus.
Tastes amazing. One of the best pale ales I've ever tried. Tons of pineapple, orange rind, lemon, grapefruit. Mild hop bitterness keeps me happy.
Medium bodied, crisp, well carbonated.

A - deep rich amber color, little to no head. Thin, quickly disappearing white foam with tiny bubbles forms a ring around the inside circumference of the glass. Little to no lacing
S - sweet, citrus happiness, very subtle. Surprisingly faint aroma of moist green grass
T - crisp and clean citrus notes. Subtle tastes of tropical flavors provide a well balanced sweetness to the bite of the hops. Clean finish with a slight last taste of hops
M - nice carbonation provides a crisp finish to this light to medium body ale. A lot less lasting hop oiliness than some of the other top IPAs. 
O - amazing beer. We'll balanced and incredibly enjoyable to drink. Drinks like the most flavorful session beer ever. It's this wonderful middle of the road IPA, that excels at balance. Like if Pliny the Elder and Zombie Dust had a citra hops love child. I will admit that I am very partial to Citra hops and this is one of the best beers to showcase why. 968 charactersBartos, Feb 07, 2014

A-Slightly cloudy, copper/amber color, very little head with small bubbles that linger, no lacing. A bit on the "standard" side, but perhaps it had to do with the keg/tap I got in on versus the beer itself. I would hope for a bit more of a head on this style.
S-Wow. Got an excellent whiff of the hop profile even when the beer was being poured 5 feet away from me, made me very thirsty. Pineapple, fresh green grass, bright citrus notes, very tropical.
T-Those topical notes in the nose really shine here, it has a grassy/citrus fruit/lemon taste with a distinct green pepper hoppy pop at the end. Lots of flavor without being a palate wrecker, which the relatively low ABV compliments. Bit of resiny orange candy-like leftovers linger, which is nice.
M-Medium body, slight carbonation tingle/burning, finishes slightly dry.
O-A bit off on the appearance, but overall exemplary for the style. 921 charactersDersOne, Feb 06, 2014

pseudoSue pours a light orange color with a good amount of white foamy head. Nose is tropical and has some notes of earthy, piney hops. The nose is actually lighter than I expected. But this is a pale ale, not an IPA, so I guess that makes sense. However, the taste is definitely hops galore! Super tropical fruity goodness. I personally love the Citra hop as is, and Toppling Goliath has done something truly wonderful with it here. This one has a very nice soft, carbonated mouthfeel. This is my first beer from TG, and if the others are anywhere near as good as Sue, I look forward to trying more. 641 charactersbrother_kenneth, Feb 05, 2014

The taste was very hop forward but still was had some sweetness. Finished very dry but left me wanting more it has a great balance of citrus malt and hop bitterness. would highly recommend to anyone.
The mouthfeel was light medium it is not so thin its watery and not so thick its sticky it was a perfect feel for the style.

Appearance: Pours a bright golden orange with a moderate amount of bubbles. Solid two fingers of white head that slowly recede into a thin creamy layer. Leaves a lot of creamy lacing around the glass. 
Smell: A very juicy tropical aroma with big hints of citrus hops and earthy hops. Upfront scent of lush and juicy citrus hops with hints of grapefruit, mango, orange peel, pineapple, tangerine, apricot, lemon, passion fruit, and papaya. Earthy hop hints of grass along with some pine resin. Pale malt with hints of grains, cracker, biscuit, and yeast. Very forward with the tropical fruits. Seriously smells more like a West Coast IPA than APA. 
Taste: As juicy as it smells, big dominate taste of citrus along with some earthy hops and malt backbone. Ripe and juicy citrus hops upfront with notes of grapefruit, orange peel, mango, pineapple, apricot, lemon, tangerine, passion fruit, papaya, and melon. Also some earthy hops with notes of grass and pine. Pale malt background with notes of biscuit, grains, cracker, and yeast. Very citrus forward with a nice clean bitterness. A very good West Coast style taste.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with a moderate level of carbonation. Very juicy and slightly oily. Finishes pretty dry and smooth.
Overall: A really great take on a APA. More like a West Coast IPA with a huge tropical fruit presence. 1,408 charactersMattyG85, Jan 25, 2014

4.24/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25a brilliant pale ale, showing the delicacy and also the versatility of the citra hop. mostly clear bright sunny color here, inch of white head with great lacing. the nose is citra hops all the way, citrusy and a little acidic, with pineapple and passion fruit esters happening all over the place. what this beer shows me in one sip, is that the citra hop can be used successfully for bittering as well as all its normal floral and tropical aromatic and flavoring attributes. there is some solid bitterness here in pseudosue, which works awesome with the late kettle flavors of this hop. its really good, easy drinking beer with a lot of flavor, but honestly came in a little less impressive than the zeelander from toppling goliath, which is the single hop nelson sauvin ipa. this has more bitterness and heft to it, but still sings with unique hop flavor, i just adore it. fuller bodied than zeelander, but rather easy drinking still, carbonated softly but its plenty here. this is an art form, and toppling goliath now has to be in the conversation about best users of hops in the country. this is superior beer. 1,114 charactersStonedTrippin, Jan 08, 2014

Nose and tongue perceive the same elements of perfumes, flowers, musky cannabis leaf, earthy floral tones and whole hop cone. This is very dry, very crisp and super easy to drink. My palate seems to have found this differently than so many others but I see why there is a buzz as it's big, bold and daring. 376 charactersKYGunner, Jan 06, 2014

Appearance: Clear orange-gold with a snow white bubbly head, which leaves only a modest trail of lacing behind. Noticed a lot of carbonation on the pour which has almost disappeared after five minutes or so. 
Smell:Grass, orange, lots of pineapple and the piney hop I love. 
Taste: All tropical up front for me: pineapple, orange, papaya, a bit of dank in there with hops hitting mid-palate all the way through the finish. Love the finish.
Mouthfeel: Great carbonation, sticky, almost lip smacking delicious.
Overall: Another great gift from Pintofbrown. Really love this Pale Ale, the nose of this has me really falling in love with hoppy brews. Cheers! 677 charactersdarthvohn, Dec 20, 2013

4.15/5  rDev -7.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a bottle into a Goose Island tulip. The pour is clear with a slight haze and golden-orange in color. it sports a really nice, fluffy white head that slowly dissipates down to some large, clumpy lacing. On the nose I get some sweet and tart notes of pineapples, oranges, and a hint of toast with marmalade.
Medium-light body with a surprising flavor. It's fairly sweet and grainy up front with toast and cracker flavors. At mid-palate, the hops start to kick in, but it's not what I expected at all. I expected a sharp, citrus-fruit wave of flavor, and instead get a dank, mulchy, mossy, hemp-like flavor. Good, just unexpected. The grainy sweetness carries through the back of the palate and balances everything out nicely. The beer doesn't seem bitter at all. The finish is dank and hoppy and slightly sweet.
Overall, a really enjoyable Pale Ale. It's nice to see brewers take this style seriously, even though they must realize that many beer geeks would pass this by without a second thought while reaching for an IPA or IIPA, never realizing what they're missing. Kind of makes me wonder if I should be exploring more pale ales myself. 1,153 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Dec 14, 2013

Very light fizzy head fades pretty quickly, decent but lighter lacing, very clear Golden tan colored.
Nose is phenomenal, just pure hops, tropical fruit and citrus galore, so much fresh hop awesomeness. Mild resin with hint of passion fruit, tangerine, little grapefruit pith, mild candied orange peel, Clementine, little fruity bubble gum, with decent resin and hint earthy spicy pine hop. Little malt base but just barely and I'm not even sure if it's really there, and bits of stone fruit.
Taste starts quite nice, lots and lots of tropical fruit again, some citrus and very very juicy. Some grapefruit, passion fruit, papaya, and all around tropical fruit juice, like the Dole orange pineapple mango banana fruit juices, with some resin and musty dank almost oily but not quite. Mild juicy tangerine and little orange peel, and little candied orange peel little zest. Hint of sweet malts but barely, just enough to deliver the hops. Finish is long but crisp like, tons more tropical fruit and delicious citrus. 
Mouth is med bod, bit of a soft feel, nice carb for growler.
Overall fantastic. Up there with zombie dust or almost gumball head. 1,290 charactersjlindros, Dec 04, 2013

A - Poured into a Kate the Great tulip a nice crystal clear light honey hue with a thin white head that is rather underwhelming. 
S - Aromas of massive tropical notes, pineapple galore, mango, faint passion fruit, Nice light sweet malts, tutti fruiti bubblegum notes big time, light caramel.
T - Taste is tons of tutti fruiti bubblegum, light pineapple, light passion fruit, maybe fine papaya. Nice grapefruit, like a tropical fruit juice cocktail cup just not cloy sweet.
M - Mouthfeel is very nicely carbonated, crisp, super drinkable.
O - Overall this is a delicious beer, great hop profile. Wonderful. 656 charactersrudzud, Dec 03, 2013

Clouded golden hue, beautiful creamy head of snow-drift white head. Looks fantastic.
Aroma: bright, clean, and vibrant hoppiness. Ebullient citrus notes, lemon, lime, orange, and grapefruit, passionate and pithy. A little floral, a touch piney. Traces of tropical fruits, as well. Nice, nice, nice.
Taste: This one jumps on board the mouth and spills joy all over the palate. It floods deliciousness everywhere. The look of it shows an unfiltered ale, and in the mouthfeel, we're getting yeast, as well. Wonderful texture, great drinkability.
A joyful pale ale, a tasty thing with plenty of citrus-y zest to keep the tongue happy. 777 charactersfeloniousmonk, Dec 03, 2013

Full disclosure I'm not a da of citra. Still this is well done.
For whatever reason not getting much on the nose from this one. Little citrus. Little floral. But subtle.
Taste however is a different ballgame. Big citrus flavor. Extremely juicy. Resinous.the hops are subtle with just a little bite at the end. Very refreshing a drinkable. 372 charactersZaximus, Nov 30, 2013

Pours a big2 finger frothy white head with great retention. Beer is a clear pale orange. Lacing is thick and layered with excellent stick. Really nice.
Nose is citrus, pine and cane sugar. Dank apricot and papaya hop bitterness too. Great aroma from a pale ale!
Opens citrus and cane sugar sweetness. Papaya, mango and other tropical fruit hoppiness come in towards the middle complemented by a sappy bitterness. More tropical fruit with just the slightest bit of resin at the end. Finishes tropical fruit sweetness. Cane sugar and citrus aftertaste. I can't see how this gets better. 
Light bodied with ample carbonation. Smooth and light in the mouth and crisp and clean going down. Finishes clean with slightly lingering aftertaste. Excellent. 
This is the best pure pale ale I've ever had not made by Hill Farmstead. Excellent all the way around. 939 charactersSpeedwayJim, Nov 25, 2013

A - Why is this even a category? how my beer looks is the least of my concerns. 
S - Great. Definitely a Citra beer. Citrus, cat pee and other bright smell explode from this beer
T - While still good, I dont see what the hype is about. Its too sweet for my liking (I am a dry beer sorta guy, although I see others consider this beer dry, but I got a different impression). The hops come through nicely, but dont shine as much as the nose lets on. There is some flavor that I cant quite put my finger on that I dont really care for. 
M - Too much sugar as said above, but good body. Not overly thick or watery. More or less what a APA should be.
Overall this is a good beer, but I wont go out of my way to get more. I drank the growler over 2 days and thought I might like it more the 2nd time around, but I had exactly the same thoughts the next day. I dont get the hype around it at all. This was my first TG beer and Ill still seek out others though. 1,057 charactersMCImes, Nov 06, 2013

Appearance - A golden amber color with floaties. Strong pour yielded a 1 finger head and while drinking there was very little lacing. 
Smell - Citrus. Mainly Grapefruit and Mango. It smells very good
Taste - The taste is very fruity with just a slight amount of bitterness. I get the grapefruit flavor more than anything. A dry finish leaving me thirsty for another sip.
Mouthfeel - Lower end on the carbination scale 
Overall - This is a very drinkable apa. With its dry finish and fruity flavor, this is a beer that goes down very easy and in a hurry. 609 charactersshadetree67, Nov 05, 2013

Much thanks to Dontcounttoday for picking this up for me
A: Pours a light, golden amber color with a small white head. Minimal spotty lacing.
S: Amazingly fruity. Peach, pineapple, passionfruit and bright citrus. Sweet with just a little bit of citrus-y tartness on the nose. A mild, earthy caramel blends with the fruit to give the impression of sweet peach tea.
T: Opens with some citrusy and flower notes, then quickly descends into a blissful mesh of tropical fruit. Just incredibly juicy with peach and pineapple coming to the forefront. The finish is clean and crisp.
M: Medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation.
O: One of the best pale ales I have ever had. I figured it would be comparable to Zombie Dust, but somehow it's a completely different beast. It reminds me of peach tea in the best possible way. The fruit flavors are somehow unique from all the other citra hopped beers. Track this one down and enjoy. 968 charactersWankelEngine, Nov 01, 2013

Thanks to drewone for sharing this one.
Pours a hazy honey orange with a foamy bone head that settles to wisps of film on top of the beer. Small streaks of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of malt, citrus zest, and herbal hop aromas. Taste is much the same with citrus zest and herbal hop flavors on the finish. There is a mild amount of hop bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer that is tasty and easy to drink. 630 charactersUCLABrewN84, Oct 29, 2013

S- The aroma is incredible! Huge tropical fruit and sweet citrus notes! Mango and tangerine dominate, with lemon zest, grapefruit, pineapple, and peach also playing big roles. A touch of pine, caramel and pale malt backbone rounds this out. Perfection!
T- The taste is juicy, as expected. The flavors are more subdued than the aroma, but still there is plenty of mango, peach, and tangerine dancing on my tongue to make me quite happy! Only a mild hop bitterness, and a healthy dose of pale and caramel malts balance this quite well. Maybe a bit cloying as it warms, but not too much.
M- The mouthfeel is juicy, smooth and somewhat full for an APA. I would like slightly more carbonation.
O- Overall this is the best APA I've had to date, and it contends w/ the top DIPAs out there! 937 charactersSadMachine, Oct 26, 2013

A: Pours a nice clear medium orange. Lots of sediment in the bottle. LOTS of sediment. Decent sized fizzy and fluffy white head. Head fades out slowly. Great head retention. Pretty decent big fluffy tufts of lacing left behind.
S: Oh yeah. Clearly citra heavy. Mangos, tangerines, pineapple. Super juicy and crisp. Quite spicy pine too. Aroma is nearly perfect. The tropical fruit aspect is just incredible. When swirled I get just a hint of garlic along with the pine.
T: Yup, citra and lots of it. Tropical fruits are more subtle here but similar. The garlicky flavor is here in spades with just a bit of pine to back it up. Oddly not very bitter; more drying than anything I think. Dry, crackery malt contributes to this as well. Lingering tropical fruits in the aftertaste.
M: Medium bodied, smooth and easy drinking.
O: Hell of an APA. One of the very best I've ever had. I think the only competition for this brew is Zombie Dust but I'm honestly unsure if this can overcome the zombie king. I think this has a better aroma than zombie dust but the drinkability and smoothness suffers in comparison. Razor close but I don't want to take anything away from this brew. It is top notch and highlights citra wonderfully. Great dry crackery malt backs it up just right. Excellent craftsmanship. 1,362 charactersDope, Oct 26, 2013

Smell is loads of fresh juicy mangos, papaya and citrus rind. 
Taste is almost exactly the same. Mangos right up front with more noticeable orange and grapefruit elements, papaya and guava. Overall bitterness is mild. This one is juicy, wet and refreshing. 
Medium body lightly creamy with a nice level of carbonation complementing the delicate tropical flavors. Finish is one if the best I've had in a pale ale or otherwise. Very mild bitterness and mangos all the way. Delicious from start to finish. Now I just wish it were regularly available. 632 charactersJackieTH, Oct 26, 2013

this is an excellent beer, leaning more towards an ipa than a pale ale in hoppiness, but as refreshing and sessionable as any pale ale could hope to be. 663 charactersfacundoCNB, Oct 20, 2013

S - Grapefruit bomb, pinapple, orange, hints of mango and a bit of pine. Incredibly inviting.
T - Wow. Takes a second for the flavors to really kick in. Initially just dry and mildly spicy bitter. Quickly transitions to huge citrus (orange, pineapple, grapefruit, and some sweeter mango/peach type fruit flavors. Finish is just sweet sweet sweet from the fruits with a bit of a semi-dry but quite bitter finish/aftertaste.
M - Light bodied, too light. Its fantastic, but I had a few sips. Paused, went back to resume the review and its seriously almost watery. On the bright side, ridiculously easy to put down, still leaves behind a thick feel on the tongue, oddly enough. Ideal carbonation. Overall a fast/easy drinker. 837 charactersMacQ32, Oct 19, 2013

The taste is about as amazing as the smell. Beautifully balanced sweetness mixed with some piney hop resin with juicy fruits filling in the gaps. The mouthfeel is about as smooth and drinkable as I've ever had. This beer is dangerously drinkable. Overall it's fantastic, I am thrilled to have drank this beer.

Date: 10/13/13
Type: 22oz. Bomber
Vintage: September 2013
Glass: East End Tulip
Pours a cloudy golden in color w/ a 1 finger white head that left massive amounts of lacing on the glass. Holy citrus batman! A grapefruit bomb just went off in the nose and is backed by pine and orange peel. Flavors of big grapefruit, orange peel, and lemon zest moving to mild piney bitterness (just a touch). Medium bodied and lush leaving the mouth clean. Like Lionel Ritchie said, "all night long!" 
Overall, awesome APA that really pushes the envelope of what an APA can be. This dogs Zombie Dust, but IMO is just shy of Sosus. However, slightly different style and I am more of a DIPA kinda guy. 698 charactersmikeyv35, Oct 16, 2013

M: Right in my sweet spot. Some gooey, thick vibes, smacking and chewing going on. 
O: This was the best iteration of Sue I've had. Some variation, or have they dialed it in? Of note, this fresh bottle had a bunch of sediment and it poured cloudy. 
Just reaffirms my belief that the hazy debris-ridden IPAs are the best. 712 characterscaskstrength, Oct 08, 2013

Colder it seems a little more out of balance, but as it warmed it showed a nice APA character. Quite attractive albiet a little darker than the average. Really nice citrus and fruity hop aroma. Very pleasant. Nice off-white head with lots of lacing. Again, quite hop forward in taste too. Brings to mind what's the differentiation between and APA and Am. IPA, cuz' this one seems to swaddle that line. Some of the most enjoyable tasting bitterness-present and apparent without excess. As noted, as warms more of the malt flavors show, with never too sweet and blending in nicely. A few drinks showed some hop oil excess, but that was infrequent. Did have a slickness to the fell.
This is a enjoyable beer that is a true hop bomb without being a DIPA. 809 charactersgarymuchow, Aug 30, 2013

Let's see if this beer can live up to the hype. 
Pours a hazy and bright gold color, with a nice egg shell white head.
Aromas are phenomenal. This smells more like a top notch IPA instead of a Pale. Big freshly cut pineapple smell, raspberry sherbert, and notes of sweet fruit hard candies.
Taste easily lives up to the anticipation the nose provided. Crisp and really fruity up front, definitely has a dry note, some light cracker sweetness and light creaminess. Finish is a great mixture of tropical fruits, pineapple, mango and some resin as well.
Mouthfeel is about spot on. Smooth, with full body, and nice snappy carbonation.
Overall, a superb pale. Reminds me a lot of Russian River's Row 2. That one was more bitter, this was a bit more sweet. But that's a hell of a comparison for a newcomer from Iowa. In fact, this might be better, top notch and legit stuff. 944 charactersflexabull, Aug 30, 2013

Score: 98
Early-mid January 2014 release bottle. Served in an O'so snifter and enjoyed on 01/28/14. Thank you Brian and Eric for the bottle!
Appearance: Pours a lovely yellow-orange color with a quarter of a finger of white head off the pour that quickly settles to a ring around the glass. Average lacing, but really good retention. 4.5/5
Smell: Huge tropical fruit and stone fruit hoppy delight! Lots of grassiness, and a little pine-iness too. Tangerine, grapefruit, mango, passion fruit, and pineapple. Big, bright and bold juicy hops galore. Light caramel malt, and a touch of earthy spice. The citra hops here truly shine, and this smells like baby head topper. 4.75/5
Taste: Big, juicy tropical citrus/stone fruit flavors with a bitter grassy/piney finish. Mango, pineapple, tangerine, peach, melon and orange rind. The bitterness and piney/grassy hop flavor lingers nicely. Very subtle malt backbone. Quite delicious, and easy drinking. 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Light bodied, spot on medium carbonation. Really nice hop bite and bitter finish. Incredibly juicy mouthfeel with a very slight dryness to the finish. 4.75/5
Overall: This is quite possibly the best pale ale out there; it's better than Zombie Dust. Big, bright, bitter and flavorful, yet light bodied and low ABV. A chilled bomber of this is the perfect summer delight.
Cost: $7 for a 22 oz (bomber) bottle 1,457 charactersjegross2, Aug 26, 2013

4.37/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Super huge thanks to maximum12 for a growler of this stuff. Dude is an amazing trader and is exceptionally generous, always willing to hook you up. PseudoSue pours the color of bruised pear skins with some goldenrod highlights - it's basically opaque, though I can kind of make out shadows on the other side of the glass. The soapy white head sits at a finger and lasts for a while, leaving behind some good lacing on the glass.
As advertised, the aroma is a beautiful citrus bouquet with tremendous amounts of gushing oranges and grapefruits, outline with a softer tropical set-up, something like mango and maybe even a bit of pineapple. The hops also impart a nice grassy note, coming off with some light white pepper as well. It smells like it'll be pretty bitter, or at least every bit as bitter as an IPA. The line between pale ales and IPAs is getting blurred here, but I still love this aroma.
The taste is all-together fruity and perfumy, with an obvious hop assault, through and through. The nose was a good indication that the malt would be a bit-part at best, and the first sip confirms that fact pretty quickly, as I'm not really getting much malt flavor at all. What I am getting, though, are copious amounts of pungent citrus, grassy and leafy hops, herbal pepper, grapefruit skins, juicy tangerine and even a faint hint of tropical mango.
Very tangy and substantially bitter... PseudoSue joins Zombie Dust in the category of "maybe a bit too bitter and heavy to be a pale ale, but still lighter and more drinkable than most IPAs". The Amarillo and Simcoe combination is beautiful on both the nose and the palate, leaving your mouth with fading fruits, earthy hops, and a back of the tongue, finishing bitterness. Wet and crispy on the palate, nice carbonation, even from the growler; snappy and fresh.
This stuff is very good. Damn good. And drinkable to the nth degree. While I've definitely had a fair share of slightly more enjoyable pale ales, this one is valiant enough to join the best of the best club. I enjoyed this only slightly less than What is Enlightenment, and they are reasonably similar beers. When your brew gets compared to something from Hill Farmstead, well... that in itself is a damn good testament to how good your beer is. 2,266 characterstectactoe, Aug 25, 2013

The bombers were a straightaway high 4, but the new bottles are watered down, and have lost the citrus punch that made this beer great. Each iteration seems to get better, the nose is decent again, and nothing really has changed in the color or mouthfeel. 
The taste needs to pull back to where it was before, less malt, more fruity hops please. 434 charactersAnalogErik, Aug 23, 2013

Decanted into a TG black logo goblet (also thanks to Dan). Pristine clarity, nice orange-amber color, with a firm cap of foamy white head; good retention and lacing. The aroma on this was truly out of this world, I got a blast of fresh tropical fruits from across the room...didn't even have to hold it to my nose. I'm actually kind of skeptical that this was exclusively Citra, as I've never gotten quite an intense nose from that hop by itself. But yeah, pineapple, mango, orange, grass, twinge of ammonia. Whatever the case, excellent. The taste wasn't quite as blasting or intense, but pretty much more on line for a good APA. More citrusy, orange blossom, caramel malt sweetness, good balance, low bitterness, with a more low-key tropical fruit profile. Medium body, crisp, clean mouthfeel. I prefer a little acidic twist in my APA, but this didn't really have that, with the malt profile coming out more and providing more of a balance and toning down the hop profile a bit. Very nice overall. Not really uber-extraordinary for the style, but still quite good. 1,121 charactersRifugium, Aug 19, 2013

Hazy gold with a small white head, which left nice lacing. the aroma is amazing. For an APA with 5.80 % abv, this beer has a nice strong citrus aroma. Grapefruit, lemons, citrus zest, and some s\pine. This is one super hoppy beer. I absolutely love the aroma.
Wow. This taste every bit as hoppy as the aroma suggested, if not even hoppier. Grapefruit, lemons, citrus zest, pine, and some tropical fruit. This is a great hop assault on the tongue, which I truly love.
Light to medium bodied with average carbonation. This is a nicely made beer. This is a must try if you get the chance. 652 charactershardy008, Jul 27, 2013

4.27/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Made a trek down to Toppling Goliath this past weekend and trying PseudoSue was on the top of my list of beers to sample. Initially I wasn't as impressed as I hoped I would be, mostly because I had read all of the hype about this beer and in my mind, it was pretty built up. As the day went on though, I realized that this brew was in fact the best of all of the offerings TG had to offer at their tap room. 
About a week later, I was able to find a place in Madison that had it on tap so I naturally had three pints on a Tuesday afternoon. The smell blew me away this time around. The citrus and tanginess of the hops was amazing and the taste was much the same along with an interesting buttery, bread-like taste that complimented that Citra hops quite well!
I can safely say this is my favorite single IPA/APA. There are some double IPAs that I am rather fond of (including TG's Sosus) but for an easy drinking "sessionable" beer, this might be as good as it gets.
EDIT: Since they have begun bottling and now canning it in Florida, it is not as fresh and juicy tasting. I hate to do this but I have to downgrade it. 1,122 charactersmjpolzin, Jul 21, 2013

O: This is incredible, got this on a trade, shout out to MNBuffalo!! I will absolutely seek this out, it changed my entire idea of what an APA could be. On the flip side, this is more of an IPA than an APA, not much malt sweetness, all the flavors we picked up were from hops. So as far as APA's go this isn't the most classic, but in my opinion it is one of the best.

Appearance. Pours a rich and hazy yellow gold with a touch of amber. Capped with a finger of frothy white head that leaves some great bands of lace behind.
Smell. Huge juicy citrus fruit here. Grapefruits, oranges and lime with a little light toasted malt and some fresh cut pine wood. Smells just amazing.
Taste. Again, juicy grapefruits, oranges, and lime but with some tropical notes as well, guava and papaya maybe. There's a nice toasted light malt base and just a touch of pine. Some bitterness in the finish but it's very pleasant and mild.
Mouthfeel. On the low side of medium bodied with medium-low carbonation. Could be a bit fuller in body with all the flavour going on, but not a big deal. 
Overall. One of the top pale ale's I've had the pleasure of enjoying. Thanks again Steasy66, you the man. 942 charactersRutager, Jul 02, 2013

The label looks like a rock with "TG" in the middle and the mouth of a T-Rex in the lower left hand corner. Written over the label in pencil etching is the name of the beer with the "S" in Sue being highlighted in neon green. To the far left of the label is all the mandatory US information. To the far right of the label is where you'll find a small paragraph that briefly describes the beer. Pint glass? No! This special beer deserves to be poured into a Snifter. I poured this mid west beer into my Florida born Peg's Cantina Snifter. 
From behind the T-Rex came a super hazy bright kumquat orange colored beer. It had that type haziness where I could briefly see my fingers on the other side of the glass. It was all of the beer's hop particles that made it so hazy. The initial head of foam was somewhere between 1/4 to 1/2 an inch in height and pearl white in color. It had good retention that left behind a tiny string of rings and just a spot or two of lace around the glass. Beer eye candy all the way! 
Damn! As soon as the cap came off, out comes a strong aroma of bitter citrus hops and citrus fruits. When the beer settled in the glass, the beer was still hugely hopped. Nothing could calm down the hops. The aroma was basically one big giant citrus smell with a semi sweet undertone. The aroma contained bitter citrus hops, lemon, tart grapefruit, oranges, kumquats, mango, and even a little pineapple. Despite this aroma being hugely hoppy and bitter, my nose picked up a faint whiff of bready malts in the finish. My nose couldn't get enough of this beer. 
At least my tastebuds weren't jealous of my sense of smell. My tastebuds got to taste the same hugely bitter citrus hops and citrus fruits that my nose got to smell in the aroma. The taste was dry and hoppy with a ton of bitter citrus hops. These hops danced on my tongue for a long time before it let through the citrus/exotic fruits. This giant fruit punch had the taste of lemon, tart grapefruit, a gentle touch of orange, and a drop of mango and pineapple. The fruits were more powerful in the aroma. After the fruits had their fun, the beer then ends with a little pine and a brief taste of bready malts. Hop Bomb? Oh yeah! 
The label said that this beer has a 6% ABV. Really? Well anyway, this beer was medium bodied with its fair share of carbonation and a hugely bitter aftertaste. The aftertaste was one dimensional. There wasn't much of a variety of tastes in this beer which is fine with me. The aftertaste contained a large amount of bitter citrus hops, grapefruit, lemon, and mango. This aftertaste will linger on the roof of your mouth for a long time. 
First of all, I have to thank my new BA friend mnbuffalo for sending me this beer. This is one of those beers that disappears right in front of my eyes. It's so good that I'll take a sip here, another sip there, and before I knew it, the bottle was emptied out. Would I drink it again? Oh yeah!! More! More! 3,042 charactersAltBock, Jul 01, 2013

Huge thanks go out to Ri0 for the bomber! Poured into a standard pint glass.
A: Cloudy pale yellow color. Big two to finger head with great lace and retention.
A: Citrus hops explode in the nose. Notes of orange, mango, passion fruit, and bready malt. 
T: Follows the nose. Citrus bomb! But the bitter citrus is balanced by the malt backbone. Fruity up front, sweet in the middle, and bitter on the finish.
M: Supurb! I don't know if it could get any better. Perfect carbonation for a light to medium bodied beer. 
O: one of the better apa's I've had. TG is doing some sick stuff in Iowa. Got to get back home for these guys! 644 charactersGtreid, Jun 28, 2013

A - Pours a pale translucent golden color with a thick finger of frothy white foam that dies to a thick collar and plenty of lacing on the glass after a minute or two.
S - Super citrusy aroma - filled with fresh grapefruit with great intensity. A bit sweaty, lots of tropical fruits - pineapple-y and mango-y. Malt doesn't stand a chance against the onslaught of citra hops here.
T - Thick, resiny citrus thru and thru. Lots of grapefruit and mango. and tons of pine, traces of mint. Solid medium bitterness level with a good sharp edge to it. Mild, dry and biscuity malt in the background with only the faintest hint of sweetness - quite dry overall.
M - Lightish body with a bright, medium carbonation. Flavors give this an impression of heaviness beyond the body itself with its thick, resiny hop presence.
O - Really nice Citra hop pale ale. As one would expect, full of citrusy grapefruit flavors and a big hit of pine. Flavors are dense with hops. Very enjoyable pale ale. 1,140 charactersportia99, Jun 28, 2013

4.27/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I've had this on tap a couple times but never in a setting where I felt I could fairly review it. Picked up this bottle at the brewery a couple weeks ago, set it in the fridge, & here we are. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife as an alternative to hydrating. 
Pour is a translucent yellow that almost turns invisible when held up to the light. Nose is just what you want in a hoppy beer - drippy, dewy citrus, mango, fruitier than fresh-chewed Chicklets, along with a steady but low dose of malt sweetness. 
PseudoSue/PseudoCitra sticks a wet hop lance into the APA 'style'. IPA-level hops lower a wet, lip-smacking boom of tropical fruits growing out of that abandoned island you always see in comics (for those under 25, those are ink drawings in the newspaper...never mind). Mango, pineapple, with a vampire-sharp bite of bitterness to cap the hop deal. Pale malts follow & are prominent but not distracting from the showcased hop. There is a faint hint of feral cat that I've come to associate with Citra. Mouthfeel is a strength: damp, moist, full. Drinkable? Yes. I can see why this should be packaged in a growler as a standard serving. 
I'm not quite as enamored as the masses, but this is a beer that one could enjoy after mowing the lawn, or contemplating life, or post-marathon...versatile. Hands-down excellent. 1,324 charactersmaximum12, Jun 26, 2013

A- Pours a translucent yellowish-orange golden color with fairly minimal head and leaves some decent light lacing. Nice consistent carbonation.
S- Oranges, lemons, grapefruit, a hint of the cat piss aroma that I think is associated with Simcoe, subtle spices that balance perfectly with the fruity aromas, nice balance with the malts, very nice aroma strength. Not sure exactly what hops are used in this, but I'm guessing Simcoe might be one of them.
T- Big juicy flavors of orange, orange/lemon peel, light lemon zest, subtle integrated spices, rounded out with a nice balanced malt presence. Finishes with zesty lemon notes.
M- Drinks fairly light but rounded out to a medium body, fairly juicy, nice subtle carbonation complementing the juicy notes, extremely drinkable. Overall great feel for an APA.
O- This was a fantastic APA and is definitely one of the better one's I've had and easily stands up against some of the top APAs out there. I wouldn't say it's my favorite APA since I'm not a huge fan of one of the hop varietals used in it, I'm guessing it might have been Simcoe. That being said it was a great APA and if you loved Sosus you will love this. 1,287 charactersjaasen64, Jun 20, 2013

A: Clear pale amber body with an inch of creamy off-white head. Good retention, decent lace. Lovely.
S: Fresh, vibrant hoppiness. Grassy, floral, and hugely tropical. Mango in particular stands out. Terrific. 
T: Follows the nose, but with even more mango and tropical fruity hops as it progresses. Clean, crisp, mildly bitter finish. Balanced with just a hint of malt sweetness, the Citra really shines. Wow.
M: Fairly light bodied and highly carbonated. Spritzy at first, creamier after a few swirls. All right.
O: Outstanding Pale Ale. One of the best out there, and more clearly an APA than something like Zombie Dust. Worth the hype.

A: Scrumtrulescent is the only word that can do this beer justice. Also, dem lace curtains!

M: Unbelievably Scrumtrulescent. Carbonation is perfect, even after a week in a growler. Very well rounded beer that leaves you wanting more. 
O: All foolin around aside, this is one of the best pale ales I've ever had. Clark and Toppling Goliath are doing some really great things in the middle of nowhere. This one is very easy to handle by yourself. Big citrus punch that hits the spot on a warm summer day. Nice clean finish that doesn't leave the taste buds burnt out.

A - White foam settles to wisps, thin collar, and specks of lace. Hazed golden body.
S - Surprisingly grassy for a Citra IPA; surprised this is single-hopped, but I guess the flavors are largely dependent on crop. Still, nice notes of tropical fruits and citrus that are typical of Citra and only the faintest crackery malt.
T - The taste is more in line with what I was expecting, with the mix of pale malts and juicy orange flesh; almost like a creamsicle, but with some faint tropical and zesty notes in the periphery. Bitterness is very low.
M - Medium body that is sufficiently hefty for the listed 5.8%. Pleasant, soft, lower carbonation. Crisp, clean finish, albeit maybe a tad watery. Goes down dangerously fast.
D - Good stuff on the whole, but actually a bit understated for my tastes. The Zeelander, which I preferred, had more crackle and intensity. Still, I'd happily order a pint or two of this if it was locally available. Not an A+, but a solid A in my book. 1,057 charactersMasterSki, Jun 12, 2013

The beer pours a soft honey color, hues of gold, orange and copper, slightly hazy with a nice finger of soft white head that has very good retention and leaves nice striations of soapy lace behind. The aroma is wonderful, lots of bright grapefruit and tangerine, lemongrass, pineapple and passionfruit with great wildflower character with some sweet pale malt. Lots of crisp grapefruit, lightly sweet tangerine, bitter lemongrass and light pine with wildflower behind it. Doughy pale malt that is somewhat sweet is dominant at the finish, but is so well integrated with the other flavors, it's a very natural transition. The body is great, moderate to low carbonation, very juicy that finishes lightly dry and very smoothly with a creamy touch. 
Verdict: A tremendous APA from Toppling Goliath, the flavors are balanced so well, the bitterness is kept in check and really lets the beer shine. This really is one of the premier Citra hopped beers out there and any and all comparisons to Zombie Dust are well warranted. 1,101 characterskevanb, Jun 04, 2013

reviewed from notes taken 5/31.
Appearance: yellow bodied beer is a nice big soapy white head! Nice heavy lacing on the glass!
Smell: Citrus and tropical fruits. Sweet oranges, pineapples, with a hint of grapefruit and pine needles!
Taste: Mildly bitter APA. Soo darn citrusy an explosion of citrus and tropical fruit flavors! Oranges, orange zest, mango, peaches, pineapples, and melon. The malts are perfectly matched with the hops in this beer and helps to showcase and compliment those citra hops! Its a light bready malt profile. Mild bitterness in the finish. This beer actually tastes super juicy.
Mouthfeel: low end of a medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. So drinkable and so crushable. Perfect summer beer. This beer is lush and juicy. Carbonation is spot on.
Overall: Psuedosue is a more refined APA than Zombie Dust. The biggest difference is PseudoSue is much more true to style because Zombie Dust feels less like an APA and is more of an IPA in my opinion because it is too bitter to be an APA. PsuedoSue has all the smell and flavor of those Citra hops just like Zombie Dust without the overdone bitterness that is a 3 Floyds trademark found in all thier hoppy beers. PseudoSue is also so crushable and drinkable its really silly how awesome this beer is. 
As a side note: This beer is a fantastic value as well. A $6 bomber at the brewery with no bottle limits! Unheard of, especially the night before a big release(Kentucky Brunch release)! This beer also edges out Sosus as the best hoppy beer that TG brews! 1,594 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jun 03, 2013

Sure does look nice... a murky golden body produces a giant healthy paper white head... no shortage of lacing here.
Awesome. Citra to the max. Lush, tropical hop aromas, namely mango. Some pineapple and citrus keep the nose interested. Clean... fresh... spectacular.
Sweet, juicy melon and mango. A faint papaya type flavor rounds out the finish. Perfect level of bitterness. Extremely drinkable yet extremely flavorful. Better than Zombie Dust.

If Minnesotans are complimenting something from Iowa, you KNOW its amazing.
This is a perfect session beer. Toppling Goliath has mastered the concept of producing a malt bill that creates a light, drinkable body and then pairing it up with a massive hop load that gives the flavor of whatever hop they are trying to show case in a beer that doesn't become excessively malty, chewy, or heavy like so many APAs and especially IPAs tend to be.
I am lucky enough to live less than 20 miles from the tap room. Drinking this beer fresh, mixed with their Golden Nugget (affectionately known as Sue's Nuggets), is alcohol bliss. 640 charactersIowan, May 26, 2013

A: Hazy, medium golden color with one finger of diminishing white foam head. Light lacing remains on the glass.
S: Tropical fruit of moderate intensity really expands in the nose given time. Grapefruit can also be identified as separate but complimentary.
T: Begins barely off-dry, with refined pale malt and sticky tropical fruit hops aromatics that match the smell closely. Acidity is bright and lively early, preventing the hops flavors from turning oppressive. The finish is clean and moderately bitter for the style, and also a little soapy.
M: Thin to medium viscosity, balanced on the palate, with low carbonation.
D/O: This beer is representative of Toppling Goliath's talent for channeling aggressive dry-hopped qualities, while also looking like one of their pale ales (unfortunately). A bit edgier than Three Floyds Zombie Dust, Citra hops border on bold here which is saying a lot for the delicious but docile cultivar. It is also true to the form of the brewer in that is shows no yeast character, which seems to be one of the most unifying features across the Toppling Goliath portfolio. 1,149 charactersbeagle75, May 17, 2013

Citra punch to the face. I heard the nose was a little overrated with this beer, but I have to disagree. Reminds me of Zombie Dust for sure. Some spice and an overload of juicy citrus (tangerine, grapefruit, lemon peel). Fantastic. 
The flavor is quite pleasant, but it is honestly bit of a let down after such a huge and promising smell. There isn't really the depth ZD has. Pseudo seems a little watered down in comparison. The aftertaste is especially disappointing, as it lacks a the unique aftereffect that many citras seem to impart. Still, the flavor matches the smell in character and overall the flavor is well above average. 
Mouthfeel is pretty spot on, besides the watered-down nature of the beer--which I believe derives from the flavor. Medium carb. Creamy and extremely drinkable. 
Overall this is a fantastic pale ale. Not the best, but still high on my favorite list. IMO, this is pretty apples and oranges when compared with ZD. The nose is the only thing that really reminds me of it. The malt bill is clearly different though, and not as refined. I also think the citra character, whill amazing, is a little muted. 1,315 characterslunarbrew, May 15, 2013

A: Pours a light orange with a soapy-looking white head that sticks nicely to the sides of the glass. I assume I would have gotten a larger head if I had poured more aggressively, but I'm happy with this so far.
S: This beer definitely showcases the Citra hop well. Tons of grapefruit and other citrus, which is just how I like my hoppy beers. Obviously very similar to Zombie Dust, which is a compliment in and of itself. It also smells a bit lighter or maybe cleaner than a stronger IPA would be, which makes sense given the lower ABV.
T: I have to say that I picked up more of the hops on the nose than the palate, but I am by no means let down. Still a lot of the same citrus from the aroma. Reminds me of a lighter Sucks, which is definitely a good thing.
M: So easy to drink. I wish it was a bit warmer today because I think this would be the perfect summer beer. The hops are big and in charge, but not to the point that your palate will be destroyed. Plus, after having this one, you won't want to move on to another beer.
O: I was really pleased with Naughty Temple and PseudoSue only served to raise my expectations for Toppling Goliath. This is an amazing beer, no doubts about it. You see it, you buy it. 1,370 charactersAndrew61923, May 13, 2013

A - Light straw colored and wonderfully hazy. On first pour the head does not retain, but subsequent pours into my pint glass leave a tight thin head that leaves splotchy lacing. 
S - Piney and herbaceous orange soda. This brew really showcases Citra in a way that I have never perceived it. The orange-y elements dominate instead of ultra resinous grapefruit. 
T - Tastes just like it smells. It is absolutely a great session beer: the citric kick almost gives it a sour hit that makes me want to keep going...so refreshing! The malt character is very mild and I cannot ferret out what they are , the malt is defintely in the background. Citra hops are very dominate.
M - Light body, nice carbonation. Very drinkable and refreshing 818 charactershopoilcrazy, May 04, 2013

Aroma: Smells like a single hop citra brew should. Grapefruit, mango and I suppose other tropical fruits. I get a little bit of pine too. Tons of bread and caramel too. Love how good this one smells. 
Colour: Pours a darker straw-coloured body, kind of like a saison, but well within the pale ale range of SRM. Comes with a 2cm white head that slowly dissipates (and I mean slowly) into a wide collar. Not much lacing present. Overall looks like a refreshing beer that is begging to be quaffed.
Flavour: Nice. Tons and tons of citra- refreshing grapefruit and orange zest stand out the most. But what's nice about it is that it has a great malt backbone. Sweet caramel, toffee and honeyed bread provide a nice change of pace to the citra, and as it warms up, it melds into a really nice balanced flavour that my best description is sweet pear. It's quite possibly one of the more balanced yet hoppy pale ales I've had in a long time. I'm really appreciating this brew and how balanced it is. One of the better pale ale flavours I've had.
Mouthfeel: Thicker side of a typical medium bodied brew, a resinous nectar that coats the tongue in bitterness yet is refreshing. Pretty solid carbonation, nothing to write home about. Aftertaste is pretty much orange peel and grapefruit rinds- pretty bitter, but it is also accompanied by a lingering honey-like sweetness that mixes in well. The aftertaste isn't too bitter and doesn't linger around long- which I really enjoy because I can keep quaffing away! No heat here either, but then again its 5.8%.
Overall: This is one of the more truly enjoyable pale ales I've had in a long time. I find Zombie Dust to be a better showcase of the citra hops, but unlike Zombie Dust, pseudoSue has quite a bit more balance that makes it simultaneously sweet and bitter, as well as making it quite quaffable because I'm not mouthpuckering after each swallow. So basically its a bit less intense, but is more balanced and drinkable. If TG starts regularly producing this in six packs, I may have to make this a regular session beer! 2,187 charactersStevedore, Apr 26, 2013

A - Produced a nice 2 finger white head, some nice lacing. The beer color is a beautiful golden hazy straw.
S - Big aroma of citrus pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and other tropical fruits. You can tell right away that the Citra Hop is used.
T - An explosion of tropical citrus flavor dancing all over my tongue. A nice big bold flavor that is easy drinking. I like that the grapefruit flavor is much more subtle than the other citrus notes. 
M - Perfect carbonation for the style. Reminds me of drinking a glass of soda that was just poured (that may be a slight exaggeration). Some oily and bitterness lingers on the tongue. 
O - Very glad I was able to buy some bottles of this because of how much I enjoyed it. I look forward to buying more as it becomes available. Nice work TG; a little brewery in Iowa that is making a big splash with the beer they are producing! 907 charactersRi0, Apr 25, 2013
4.11/5  rDev -8.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Toppling Goliath PseudoSue
Appearance: This single-hopped Citra pale ale pours a shockingly hazy golden orange, perhaps a result of hop haze. It looks more like many Belgian saisons or Belgian pale ales that this reviewer has seen rather than the American pale ale that it is. There is less than a finger of creamy, slightly off-white head that has horrible retention, especially for its style. The lacing, however, is above average. There is no visually present carbonation due to the haziness of the pour. Another finger or two of head would have been nice, and the haziness seems a bit much given style, but this is not a bad looking beer, but it is not up there with the best looking pale ales.
Aroma: Absolutely smells like Citra hops. Tons of grapefruit, mango, and orange alongside some mild bitter, resinous notes and a touch of dankness jump out of the glass and permeate every corner of the room that one drinks this beer in. It is a very strong smelling beer, but the hops do not totally dominate the nose; there are some light, bready sweet malts in the background as well as just a touch of spicy yeast character and some strange mintiness. That yeasty, malty complexity really puts this one in the pale ale major leagues.
Taste: Unexpectedly, the taste does not follow the smell as closely as one would hope. It is a very confusing palate assault. The Citra hop notes are surely there, but the malts are much more assertive than the nose let on. They give a creamy, “beer” flavor, rather than the bready, crackery sweetness that most APAs shoot for. The mint flavor and spiciness from the yeast is also much more pronounced. Lastly, there is very little residual bitterness in the aftertaste, resulting in a very drinkable beer. It is not inherently bad, but it is somewhat of a shock after the oh-so-promising nose.
Mouthfeel: The mildness of the flavors combined with the extremely moderate mouthfeel make this an outrageously drinkable and refreshing pale ale. The 6% ABV only supports its sessionability. The carbonation is perfect, and there is just a touch of astringency. Something about the body feels a bit like fresh water, but not in a bad, “watered-down” way; this is not a characteristic this drinker has encountered in any other beers, but it not unwelcome in such a drinkable brew.
Overall: I wonder if I have a bad bottle/batch of this based on looking at other reviews praising how closely the taste followed the nose. If it had done so, this would be a beer to have on hand at all times. As it is, it is a good APA, but certainly not among the best out there. Many people seem to want to compare this to Zombie Dust (both being pale ales that focus on Citra hops), and while there are similarities, Zombie Dust this is not. Still, for $5 a bomber, one cannot go wrong with giving this beer a shot. 16.5/20 2,850 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Apr 25, 2013

The taste follows the nose, with lots of spearmint, citrus, tropicalia, and herbs. The mouthfeel is slick, wet and full. Overall, an absolute winner from the new school of American Pale Ale. 420 characterssacrelicio, Apr 24, 2013

4.6/5  rDev +2.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75I've heard great things about this brewery, but this is the first of their beers I've been able to get my hands on. Growler filled a couple hours earlier at Casanova Liquors in Hudson, Wisconsin. Tasted 3 April 2013.
Pours a lovely bright golden orange, about 95% clear. One finger of white head, decent retention and excellent lacing. A thin drift of bubbles rising up.
Smell is fabulous. Big potent citrusy hops, grapefruit and oranges, with a background of tropical fruit. It's pleasantly sweet and rounded in the nose, with a soft malt backing. The hops dance on top, but there's no hollow underneath. Really nice.
Taste is just delicious. Clean and crisp up front, flowing into a peachy tropical fruit flavor, before fading to a gentle dry bitterness. It starts to become a bit chalky, but just a hair, and the grains keep it from turning to heavily to that side.
Mouthfeel is lovely. Medium-light body, becoming lighter and drifting up like a helium balloon. Carbonation that tingles and then rushes, mixing things up and keeping the flavors playing on my tongue. Pleasantly drying in the finish.
This is a really top-notch, heavily dry-hopped pale ale. Big citra hops in the nose, but there's more to it than that. The rest of the beer forms a perfect stage for those hops, with a lightly dry feel and a mildly sweet base. Reminds me a lot of Zombie Dust, and that's a big compliment. An incredibly tasty, sessionable pale ale. 1,439 characterszeledonia, Apr 19, 2013

4.79/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75One of the most flavorful, hop forward APA's I've had. The single hop Citra comes shining through on the aroma and the taste...tons of juicy fruit notes which include oranges, tangerines, and papaya. 
Not particularly bitter just flavorful which I love. Body is definitely pale ale-ish. Does not infringe on IPA territory in that regard but at the same time it is not light or watery. Seems to be a perfect weight APA in my book....carbonation is spot on too particularly from a growler filled from a keg.
Light golden colored...a little cloudy...nice lacing rims the glass...doesn't look regal or anything but solid for the style.
The aroma is intense and full of not just the fruitiness I noted but it also has a fresh floral hoppiness as well.
As for the taste beyond the immense fruit notes I do pick up some catty notes as well. It was more obvious on my burps after the fact and more distinguishable when drinking when I compared it side by side to Founders All Day IPA for kicks. I'm not a uge fan of the catty notes but am starting to become accustomed to it in more and more beers and it does not bother me as much as it may have a few years ago.
Still, this is one of my favorite APA's going. Highly recommend it. 1,228 charactersZAP, Apr 14, 2013

4.49/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The citra hop is responsible for turning a non hop head into a guy who can really appreciate the great aroma and taste of non-bittering hops. Heard great things about the brews from Toppling Goliath so jumped on the chance to pick up a growler of this single hop citra APA. The first pour from the growler into a pint glass is colored golden with an orange hue with a slight haze present. Tiny bubbles merge into a finger of white head that quickly recedes into a skim layer while sticking to the glass nicely. Aromas of the citra pop out of this brew. Grapefruit, pineapple and mango on top of a clean crisp malt bill. Taste is big time citra-especially the tropical fruit character hits me upfront with a hint of evergreen, than followed up with a bit of malt and sweetness ending with a crisp slight bitterness that quickly cleans up inviting the next drink. Medium bodied and carbonated with 0 alcohol bite. Super drinkable...this is like candy. Yep-I love citra hops. A super brew. This would likely be a regular in my fridge if I could easily get it. 1,056 charactersdeebo, Apr 02, 2013

A- Pours a thick white head with ample lacing. The body is a slightly hazed yellow. 
S- Tropical fruits come through big time here which is no surprise given the citra hops. Peach, Passion fruit, citrus juice (lemon, lime, grapefruit). Not a lot of malt to speak of. 
T- Starts out with a solid hop bitterness, some peach and mango notes with some bready malt tucked in quickly before sliding into a long dry bitter finish. 
M- Good body and some spritzy carbonation. The long astringent finish is nice. 
O- A very nice pale ale. This really highlights the citra hop profile. I'll definitely enjoy this again. 728 charactersGreggy, Feb 26, 2013

A amazing APA, I prefer Golden Nugget and Millenium Falcon... But I believe I gave those 5s thought so that is no complaint.
Edit... The more I drink this one, the more I realize Its earns the 5, while the appearance may not be a 5.... every other category is. And who cares about the appearance of a beer, if that is the one and only flaw!?!?

Citric hop aroma. Hints of grapefruit and some tropical fruit. A little cat piss as well. Not getting much for malt but this is a hop showcase.
The malt gives the flavor a dry character and I think this dryness is why I feel the flavor is a little harsh. Do get plenty of Citra hop flavor. Notes of grapefruit and orange. A little dankness as well.
Body is lighter side of medium and feels about right for a sub 6% ABV beer. Not very well carbonated but that is because of the growler. When I had it on-tap, it was well done.
Toppling Goliath got the best qualities out of the Citra hop. All the great flavor without the harshness that I object to in this hop variety. Just wish they used a little sweeter malt bill to give a little balance. 947 charactersmorimech, Oct 27, 2012

Tastes, excellently, like it smells, only bending more toward the fruity end than the bitter. The result is a very sweet IPA that's very interesting and refreshing but could have been just a bit more balanced. 468 charactersmynie, May 14, 2012

A. Looks like apple cider you'd but from an orchard. Orangey in color and quite opaque. Nice firm white head.
S. This is amazing. There must be loads of hops added to this in the fermenter. Smells liked fresh citrus; grapefruit, lime, and pineapple.
T. Tastes just as you would expect, loads of citrus and pineapple. Not bitter up front, just an explosion of fruit. Becomes more tart at the finish, with a pinch of pine. Enough malt to provide a bit of sweetness, but this is all about the hops.
M. This definitely has body and substance. Like nectar juices.
O. This is an awesome pale ale. I've had nothing like this before. This is very easy drinking and refreshing. I could easily drink this with a brunch, or would be lovely on the porch in the summer. Toppling Goliath has a real winner here. 862 charactersblackdog1101, Dec 26, 2011

Three consecutive drafts at the GTMW '11, around 8-10 oz. give or take. Review from transcribed notes.
Peachy hazed orange, tropical sunshine. Thick layer of white foam, leaving sticky arcs of lacing in the glass. 
Tropical, citrusy, pungent but not too aggressive. Mango, grapefruit, dank green hops mesh with lush fresh fruit notes in the aroma. Some light resiny bitterness is balanced with a subtle pale malt presence in the middle. Big on citrus and tropical mango notes. Light bodied, quenching, and very tasty. I could have sat there and drank this all day. Pretty much the epitome of a hophead's summer session beer. Second favorite after Golden Nugget. Please put this in six-packs guys!
2016: The cans are contract brewed in Florida, quality is good, but the taste/aroma isn't quite there. 834 charactersemerge077, Aug 17, 2011
