How this beer remains both drinkable and soft on the palate despite its 8.6% ABV is magic in and of itself. Opaque, golden-orange pour with a puffy one-notch head. Huge aroma of citrus, pith and pakalolo bursts out of a bottle. Not much pine on the nose or taste - this is all tropical fruit and leafy hops. Guava, papaya, pineapple and tangerine with an earthiness on the back end. Smooth and slightly warm from the alcohol but it comes together as a pillow-soft sip every time. 515 charactersManapuaMan, May 11, 2017

Much darker color than I expected, like amber almost; golden amber. Entirely opaque but particulate; fairly large ones. Head is thick bubbles and off-white; great thick lacing.
Definitely really strong citrus in the nose here. Hop aroma! Wafts over from my glass a foot away. Smells like a really classic citrus focused IIPA.
Oh yeah the mouthfeel—so soft and full. It’s like creamily smooth at the end. Full overall but definitely not too heavy. Not aggressive bitter carbonation; amazing overall.
Strong hops, sticky, has some malt. Dank, and more earthy. Fresh but not like, light. Not bitter at all even thought the bottle says “totaling 130IBU”. Very smooth but full and flavorful, without a single bright flavor blasting forward like in some doubles. 904 charactersj_d_b, May 06, 2017

4.12/5  rDev -7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 410 day old bottle poured vigorously into a Duvel tulip
Look- opaque rusty orange liquid with 1 finger off white head. Light lacing. 
Aroma is outstanding and is the best part of this beer. Bright papaya, pineapple and peach with some bread and earthiness at the end
Taste follows the nose but is a bit subdued in comparison. Still solid though. Starts with tangy and sweet papaya and pineapple, followed by biscuity bread and an earthy quality that becomes more pronounced as the beer warms. Finishes with very light bitterness. 
Feel- medium-bodied and pretty dry
Overall I enjoyed this one quite a bit, but probably won't try again considering the price for me ($8.99 for 500 mL bottle (probably on the steep side, but this is PA after all)). As mentioned, the aroma was outstanding, but the taste, while good, didn't meet the high expectations that were then set. 871 charactersbret717, Apr 17, 2017

Very vibrant grapefruit with hints of wild onion and grass.  Taste is even more massive, as it goes from slightly salty grapefruit to orange in short order, while leaving a little heat behind in the mouth.  Upon further sips, I'm also getting a slightly earthy twist.  The finish on this solidly medium bodied beer is dry, bitter and still has some heat.  Very nice beer! 471 charactersgopens44, Apr 09, 2017

4.23/5  rDev -4.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25In celebration of all things good and hoppy, only a group of brewers who call themselves beersmiths can craft something so aggressive and yet so refined to make their embibers say, "that's too much... may I have another". And that's exactly what Singlecut Beersmiths have done.
Softly Spoken Magic Spells captures the nose with dank grassiness, bruised citrus, ripe tropical fruit and a soft shaven pine perfume. Hazy but not turbid, the fruit juice looking beer garners a creamy lather of white foam to deliver all those fragrances across the senses and landing with a savory toasty, nutty, light caramelized taste that's off of honey and caramel.
Its creamy and mildly starchy structures remain while its sweetness dissolves, leaving a creamy hop presence in its wake. Slightly over ripe citrus tastes of orange, lemon and grapefruit rise first and allow for the ripe sensations of pineapple, mango and apricot to follow closely behind. Grassy and herbal, the mulled vegetation of hops carry a smooth bitterness laced with pine resins and fruit peel.
Medium bodied and stubbornly creamy, the beer's dryness limits the bitterness of hops and balances with a hop forward but malty rebuttal texture as well as taste. Lightly vegetal in taste, a hint of corn and apple come in late as the finish carries a medium long linger of citrus and herb. 1,345 charactersBEERchitect, Feb 24, 2017

4.38/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a snifter glass straight from the bottle. 
Appearance: Cloudy brew with  darker gold colored body. Medium bubbles to the frame creating a subtle white head rising maybe quarter of a inch. Drops to nada with zero lacing. 
Smell: Light malts coming off a hard hint of citrus skin. 
Taste: Heavy malts which might make you think the brew is just bitter, let it warm up a bit and you feel how heavy the grapefruit is. Addicting flavor, robust and complex...lightly sour with notes of pineyness which comes off so smooth. 
Mouth: Medium carbonation and so sticky. Feels a bt sour at the end but the finish stays with you even paired with food.
Overall: Good brew, if you're chasing something that is a palate smasher you are looking at it. You see it don't let it go, not expensive and should've bought two. Always in a glass my friends...Salud! 855 charactersBlurryVisi0n, Jan 29, 2017

Opaque body appearance with a faint orange amber color and light touches of lemon yellow along the edges.   Some fine carbonation can be seen.  Three finger, very creamy forming head, slightly off white in color.  Settles and dissolves very quickly, little cling except from soapy pill like bubbles on the glass for lacing.  Very sudsy collar and hardly any retention.
Large aroma with a mix of dank and tropical fruit.  The dank seems to win out, nearly getting smokey but with a tropical sweetness that bounces between mango and slight touches of sugary grapefruit.  Faint hints of biscuit malt, and supportive, an almost dill like aroma gets going as well.  Pretty impressive but it's a lot of things going on that are more exploratory than complimenting.
Palate leaves much to be desired.  Flat and slightly sugary malt bill which comes off quite syrupy.  Slight hints of minor carbonation that produce very little for the hop flavors to play on.  Good amounts of pine like astringency, but much of the distinct aromatic hop qualities just aren't coming through on the final product.  Fleeting aftertaste but with some good hop flavor that just sneaks in barely.
This isn't really getting the job done in the big DIPA realm and comes off quite a bit of a mess actually.  This beer actually reminds me of homebrew that isn't quite ready slightly.  Drinkable at least. 1,457 characterssmakawhat, Jan 28, 2017

Put away your "Possible Past", invite "Vera" and "Run Like Hell", because after your first sip you realize that the "Show Must Go On". "Point Me at The Sky" as this is one of the few IIPA's that can "Shine on Like Crazy Diamonds" as you taste a beer that makes you ask, "Is Anybody Out There, just nod if you can hear me", because no one should be alone in experiencing "The Great Big Gig in the Sky". Like 'Candy and a Currant Bun", I'm just "Biding my Time" with a taste of "Apples and Oranges" while dreaming of "Any Color You Want", like hazy orange while you drink with "High Hopes". I'm a bit "Lost for Words" while "I'm on the Run" and I "Remember a Day" trying to figure out the magic of a "Saucerful of Secrets". Even when you finish this perfect moment you might "Stop" or "Stay", but you will "Scream Your Last Scream", saying the "Show Must Go On" while "Time" is slipping away like an "Unknown Song". It's "Us and Them" "When Your In" and if you not, we "Wish You Were Here". Drink this amazing moment and realize your "Possible Past" would be less without "Softly Spoken Magic Spells".
SingleCut, "Wots....Uh the Deal?" You are the "Final Cut".
Drinking tonight out of a 16oz can. Hearing my self say during my last sip, "Don't Leave Me Now". 1,306 charactersNickandToni, Jan 28, 2017

Pours a light tangerine color with a thin, white lacing that dissipates quickly. Some lacing is present around the glass.
Smells of fresh cut grass, a freshly opened can of tennis balls, dank hops. Pretty crazy nose 
Tastes initially of lemon grass, citrus, and then transitions into bitter orange peel. Very sharp hop bite on this one.
Mouthfeel is very prickly with a pleasant bitterness. Feels so smooth on the palate.
Overall this is a very well balanced brew. One of the best India Pale Ales I've ever had. I would seek this out again.
Cheers,

4.37/5  rDev -1.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Dark orange - almost rust colored, unfiltered, has a "thick" look to it. Nose - I am getting a heavy dose of overripe apricot and honey, maybe a little melon. Unusual scent - not super alluring, but certainly not unpleasant. Makes you need to find out what taste is driving that unusual smell. Taste has some apricot, a bit of cantaloupe, citrus with a nice malty balance (think Alpha King). Strong, pleasant hop bitter bite at the end. 
Overall - nothing really "softly spoken" about this beer.  It goes after some bold, new flavors, without losing balance. Love the fact that there is something different going on. There is a real nice craft going on here.  My first SingleCut - based on this one, it will not be my last. 724 characters11-52_4hops, Jan 13, 2017

A: The beer is a deep orange/gold color, with a short off-white head that fades slowly and leaves a thick lace on the glass.
S: The aroma contains fruity citrus, floral hops and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out sweet with flavors of fruity citrus and caramel that are quickly followed by a strong floral hops bitterness. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and brings a very good balance. The after-taste is slightly hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
O: Very tasty, goes down very easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this is a very good 2IPA to drink for a long time. 800 charactersTheManiacalOne, Dec 31, 2016

Pours a hazy burnt orange with slightly off white head. Aroma is full of citrus with notes of orange and grapefruit, and a resinous piney note (though not dank). Taste follows the nose with bright citrus and resinous pine intermingling nicely. This is certainly a showcase of PNW hops. Wonderfully balanced and supported by a sturdy malt backbone, though the malt accentuates the hops rather than interfere. On the first tasting this came off a bit fruitier or juicier, however it was during a tasting of Fieldwork IPAs. On the second bottle on a fresher palate I got a lot more balance and it tasted remarkably close to Pliny. Either way a delicious world class IPA. 784 charactersspark3148857, Dec 30, 2016

Dank hop flavors up front that slowly transition to bursting, juicy, fresh citrus hop flavors: ripe pineapple, tangerine, melon, and papaya.

O - This beer lives up to the hype.  The ABV is completely hidden and the price point is absolutely perfect.  Singlecut continues to bang it on the IPA's. 860 charactersjzeilinger, Dec 02, 2016

On-draught @ Single Cut. 5oz for ~$8.
Soft mouthfeel. Balanced flavour.
High B / GOOD
***
Bottle impression:
Has a pulp bend towards the finish that detracts from the cleanliness of the overall whole, but elsewise it's a balanced harmonious build for an imperial IPA and it hides its ABV quite well.
Soft perfectly carbonated medium-bodied mouthfeel.
B / GOOD
***
12.07.16: further impressions. Currently #165 in the Top 250.
BOTTLE: 1 pint 9 fl oz format. Brown glass. Unbranded silver coloured pry-off crown cap. Fun yet minimal label design. Bottled 11/15. #1017. Purchased at the brewery a couple weeks ago.
8.60% ABV. "IIPA." "130 IBUs."
APPEARANCE: ~2-3cm off-white cap over a murky mucky dull orange body. Head lacks the robust consistency I'd expect in a great imperial IPA, as well as the soft fluffiness of a refreshing looking brew. Nontransparent. Largely nontranslucent. I see no yeast/lees within, but it appears unfiltered. Head retention is good for the ABV - about 10 minutes.
AROMA: Slightly tropical without overcommitting or suffering from that boozy pineapple note I loathe in (I)IPAs. Papaya, melon, maybe guava. No tangerine, orange, or the like; a juicier more citrus-emphatic aroma would be an improvement in my opinion. I don't get any piney, oily, or resinous hop character. No oniony notes either. The malt backbone is sweeter than most and darker than most, echewing the traditional pale malt only approach to IPAs in favour of something more robust and also more noticeable, which slightly takes the focus away from being squarely on the hops; the label mentions Scottish malts - not sure what that means, but I suspect caramalt was used in addition to pale malts. I don't detect any grapefruit.
Hop profile seems to be somewhere between the new world/Kiwi hop character that has become so popular recently and a more conventional floral hop character. In any case, the hop profile doesn't seem ideal for my personal tastes, but I'm intrigued by the aroma. Could be more fresh, more juicy, and more expressive in terms of hop aromatics, but I'm curious to try the first sip.
TASTE & TEXTURE: Definitely firmly in the tropical fruit camp of hop profiles - far more so than the aroma suggests. Papaya, guava, melon, soft vague berry, and a bit of a creamsicle almost yogurty note not unlike that found in Hill Farmstead's Simcoe-hopped beers. Not real resinous or piney, nor juicy or citrusy. While it packs a hop punch, that hop pungency is tempered by a robust malt backbone comprised of pale malts, I suspect caramalt, and maybe amber malt. Indeed, the malt presence seems to cut short the hop flavours, reducing the beer's depth of flavour.
Flavour duration is good, with a lingering dragging rind-like bitterness hanging in the aftertaste. Flavour intensity is moderately high.
Unrefreshing given its dragging mouthfeel and overcarbonation. Coarser than most imperial IPAs, which combined with its full body makes it a beer with less drinkability than cleaner juicier more brightly hopped imperial IPAs. Far less soft than I remembered it being on-draught, and far less approachable to boot.
I can't imagine this bottle has dropped off that substantially in the 3 weeks since it was bottled; I'm not as obsessed with freshness as many seem to be. But it definitely measures up worse than I remembered it, even if it's still pretty good albeit shallow fare. Balance could be better dialed in. The mouthfeel needs to be lighter, softer, and more refreshing for this to really take on great expressions of the imperial IPA style.
OVERALL: I do like it, but I enjoyed this much more the first couple times I had it. Its coarse mouthfeel combined with a noticeable ABV hold it back in terms of drinkability. Maybe this bottle was off or this beer is uncommonly susceptible to age; this is substantially different than I remembered it (and described it above).

Aroma is citrus and pine with a bit of dank. 
Predominantly resinous hop with underlying grapefruit and other tropical tones. Nicely balanced sweetness. Full body mouth feel.

Poured into a shaker glass, comes out a fairly hazy, dirty-orange color, with about a finger of off-white head that leaves some lace.  The smell is awesome...I'm guessing Citra in there - tropical fruit and just a touch of pine.  Very aromatic.  The taste is also tropical with a hint of pine, and just a slight, soft bitterness on the finish.  Produces some crazy hoppy burps.  Mouth feel is great.  Overall, super surprised by this beer.  I'll be looking for more ASAP. 569 charactersFFreak, Nov 17, 2016

Goddamn, I need to get to the brewery. One of the better beers I've had in a long top. Hazy and golden. Overripe papaya, mango and orange on the nose- insanely aromatic. The flavor develops nicely along the same lines with a really structured malt backbone- this beer is so balanced for how intensely hoppy it is. Lots of honeydew melon and overripe tropicals.

4.51/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A: Poured from the half-growler into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is hazy golden-orange with only the smallest of a white head on top.
S: Awesome nose, touches all the American DIPA bases that I like to touch: modest caramel malt or honey sweetness is noted, but it's followed by juicy (citrus) and piney hops, with good dose of tropical fruit salad in there as well. 
T: Bread doughy malt foundation, with a touch of caramel and even butterscotch and brown sugar noted. Sweet candied oranges and orange peel. Tropical fruit and ripe melon is there too. Bitterness - piney, I think, more than anything - is subdued until the back end of the palate and on the aftertaste. It is tasty - sweet without being cloying. Heat from the 8.6% ABV is noted on the way down into the belly, but not on the palate at all. 
M: Carbonation is light (I did get this from a growler station a couple days ago; it shouldn't have flattened out that quickly) and the feel is a bit on the slick/oily side. But it's not offensive at all; you can tell this is a Double rather than a "regular" IPA from the fuller-bodied heft. 
O: Excellent beer - another big winner from Singlecut. If their prices were more reasonable, I'd drink their beers all the time. 1,245 charactersKendo, Oct 28, 2016

It pours a murky honey color with orange hues, and two fingers of foamy, egg-white head and lacing with great retention.  It's a lovely pour. It has a rich aroma of lemon, grapefruit, sweet tropical fruit, onion, grass, and floral hops. It's dank and has a great balance of citrus, onion, and hops. It also has a significant malt presence and you can taste the sweet tropical fruit at the finish. Everything blends and balances extremely well.  This ale is medium-bodied and moderately carbonated, with a fairly creamy mouth feel that is pleasing.  The 8.6% ABV is just right for a DIPA and gives it substance without being overwhelming. Overall, this is a terrific DIPA that deserves its "World Class" rating. 759 charactersMacMalt, Oct 23, 2016

The pour reveals an orange-hued, murky beauty of a beer, propping up a finger of light tan head.  As you pour this, a full frontal assault of citrus aromas attack your olfactory senses: oranges, HUUUUUUUGE grapefruit, some prickly passion fruit, maybe some pineapple.
The taste, though, is where this really shines.  The citrus continues its attack, hammering the palate with grapefruit and orange and pineapple - but softens with a creamy feel that I can only attribute to the Scottish malt the bottle references.  I have been beer nerding for a while, and the taste and feel for this 8.6 % ABV beer is staggeringly good.  I could drink bottles of this - and then take a LOOOOOOONG nap. 807 charactersovaltine, Oct 05, 2016

4.25/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Half a 500 ml bottle served into a pint glass. Thanks to Dan for the share.
Appearance -  turbid looking bright orange coloured beer with a small but long lasting white head. Seriously hazy with some sediment floating around.
Smell - loads of tropical fruit, some orange, pineapple, grapefruit and melon. Not quite as big of a nose as I'd expected, but still, this is really nice.
Taste - with 130 purported IBU's the bitterness smacks you in the mouth first. There's some citrus up front, leaning orange and pineapple and a dank pine resin like flavor mixed in as well. Very bitter throughout but there's just enough sweetness to make this seem sufficiently balanced. If this is your thing, you will love it.
Mouthfeel - smooth and fairly heavy bodied with lots of carbonation and a slightly drying astringent feel.
Overall - while not quite as good as is rated here, this is the second DIPA from Singlecut that has impressed me and as a result this brewery will have me looking for their products (especially IPA's) when I happen to be visiting the states. A very good representative of the way the style is going. 1,121 charactersDenisKolkin, Oct 02, 2016

In both the aroma and taste, it is filled with citrusy and tropical fruit goodness. The hops pack a serious punch; moderate bitterness and sharp pine. Medium bodied and dangerously drinkable.
Excellent DIPA overall. 327 charactersGajo74, Sep 28, 2016

Medium body, nice bite of carbonation smooths by the end, finish leaves a clean linger with no hint of alcohol.  Simply a stunning and juicy DIPA.

Pours dark orange, with fairly small head.  Smell and taste are citrus, pine, and tropical fruit.  For me, the latter predominated, especially in the taste.  The juiciness is fantastic.  Interesting malt notes, too, and the high alcohol barely reveals its presence.  Medium feel, nothing special.  But the beer as a whole is special--now one of my favorite DIPAs. 482 charactersprofessorchow, Sep 11, 2016

This beer poured with a very murky dark orange appearance with a thin ring around the glass and some lacing on the sides. Aromas pack an incredible punch with sharply strong hops and grassy citrus. Taste follows that nose with a strong, dry, earthy pine hop flavor with some great fruit combinations like mango, orange, grapefruit flavors.  Mouthfeel is great and compliments the flavoring well by making a dry, good carbonated beer with some light creamy textures. Overall, this is a fantastic beer all around. 564 charactersfitzy84, Sep 04, 2016
4.28/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Poured from a 16.9oz bottle into a can glass, date of 8/21:
Appearance: pours semi-dark orange, with some yellowish tint. Body is very hazy, not quite turbid, but hazy nonetheless. Head is slim, and dissipates after a minute or so, leaving mild lacing.
Aroma: slightly underwhelming here, but I did drink this directly after drinking two Trillium beers, so I might be slightly desensitized at that point. Subtle notes of peach, some pine, some bittery grapefruit.
Taste: lots to like here. Fruitiness comparable with the two Trillium mentioned above, and the hops bang the palate with flavor. Super-duper peachy and orangy, with some light, dry malt underneath. This is an excellent beer, although slightly under the radar. 
Feel: medium to full-bodied, with medium carbonation.
Overall: this is a great beer. In the age of hour-long lines at the hot hoppy breweries, miniscule limits, and hype, the fact that i can get something this good on the shelf is awesome. 969 charactersTheElectricOne, Sep 04, 2016

L: Yellow-orange in color.  Attractive color.  Pretty turbid and damn near opaque, but not quite hazy.  Not much of a head.
S; Up front, very sweet.  Fruit notes, peach, grapefruit, citrus zest, maybe pineapple as well.  A bit of pine as well.  Think a super fresh fruit salad.  
T: Pretty dry right up front.  Lots of pith, after that comes the citrus notes.  Malts are overshined by the hops, but are definitely present, providing a toasty grain quality to the beer.  Other fruits are picked up on the aftertaste as well as a small touch of alcohol, though its not hot and solvent-like.
F: Body is somewhat heavy, is a bit more of a sipper than a super crushable beer.  Bitterness is somewhat assertive though its not rediculous.  Carbonation is one the higher end.
O: IMO a top notch IPA.  Though its missing some minor aspects like mouthfeel that would take it over the edge, the hop profile is outrageous and there's tons of flavor here.  For an IPA of this style with something of a distribution, I really can't complain. 1,043 charactersedward_boumil, Sep 03, 2016

T- grapefruit followed by a mellow creaminess, there is loads of pine on the linger, with a danky finish only 130 IBUs can justify

With the excellent blend of dankness and tropical fruit, this offering seemed quite reminiscent to Bon Bon from the same brewer. The difference seemed to be that the mouthfeel is less grainy making this "magic" brew slightly more drinkable than the Bon Bon. 312 characters57md, Aug 21, 2016

The high ABV is disguised pretty neatly, but there's still a light burn in the mouthfeel from the booze.  There certainly isn't anything 'light' about this one.

A- Pours a hazy medium amber color with a 1/2 inch of off-white head that retains well before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and some spotty patches of surface foam.   resilient lacing leaves a solid ring behind. 
S- Nice aroma of sweet cereal grain malt and juicy hops.  Notes of mango, melon and peach.
T- Flavor is a bit more grassy and resinous but still has plenty of fruity character.  Bitterness is relatively mild and the taste is overall more dry than the aroma lets on.  The alcohol is incredibly well-concealed.
M- Soft but with a nice hop complementary hop bite.  Medium carbonation and a body leaning toward the lighter side.
O- Fantastic stuff.  I think I prefer Mo' Shuggie just a bit more but this is still awesome.  Can't wait to visit the brewery. 836 charactersImmortale25, Aug 04, 2016

A: A cloudy orange pour with a small and light white head. 
S: HUGE burst of orange juice. Some light grapefruit and tropical fruit but it's pretty much pungent orange juice otherwise. Yum.
T: More of the same. Very juicy, loaded with oranges and some spicy pine now, especially in the middle and finish. Great sweet, juicy, candied citrus flavors. Doughy malt. Big wave of dry bitterness in the finish leading into a soft resinous and piney aftertaste. 
M: Medium bodied, soft and smooth.
O: Stellar DIPA from Singlecut, perhaps the best I've had from them. Very reminiscent of top-notch Trillium IPAs with the soft doughy mouthfeel and the huge juiciness. I don't usually like to compare but it's pretty spot-on and it's also high praise at the same time. Great brew. 793 charactersDope, Jul 31, 2016

4.12/5  rDev -7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Awesome Pink Floyd reference. Bottled 7/13
Pours a nice foamy fluffy almost 1 finger head that fades at a med pace with decent foamy lacing, super murky sunrise yellow to orange contrast color.
Nose brings super heavy hops, big spicy earthy hops, a little pine, tons of candied citrus and candied stone fruits, dank resin, faint fruity bubblegum, sweet candy caramel toasty malts, perhaps a touch of the pine sap oniony mosaic but hard to tell behind the rest of the big hops and sweetness.
Taste brings sweet syrupy malts out front, big sweet candy malts, caramel toasted grain, a little toffee almost butterscotch candy, combine with hops for a candied stone fruit, sweet syrupy apricot preserve, a little orange juice citrus candy, faint medjool dates, a little dank resin, touch piney but thankfully no onion or mosaic profile, plenty of fruity flavors but sweet candied fruit. A faint booze on the back end, with more toffee and butterscotch malt flavors, a little syrupy, sweetish but drier sticky finish, and lingering of the sweet candy toffee butterscotch malts and the candied apricot and sweet fruits.
Mouth is med to heavier bod, a bit syrupy but a caramel like rich syrup, sticky finish, faint warming booze, decent carb.
Overall not bad, much bigger and heavier than I expected from these guys, but the characters are pretty interesting together. 1,365 charactersjlindros, Jul 30, 2016

Taste: right upfront you get a thick syrupy sweet Bready Carmel malt middle of the mouth grapefruit peel tangerine peach. Finishes with more grapefruit zest and a some pine biterness.
Feel: thick syrupy chewy mouthfeel. Really malt forward. 
Overall:  a really sweet malt forward Dipa. There's enough biterness there to balance out the malt sweetness but still a little more on the malty side then the bitter side. A really good big double IPA. Would definitely drink this again! 572 charactersMasonz223, Jul 25, 2016

S: Immediately upon opening the bottle, notes of melon, peach, orange, grapefruit and fruity hops fill the room. This is one of those beers that you want to keep on smelling. It's amazing!
T: Similar to the aroma, the beer tastes quite juicy. Tropical notes galore with that almost pear/melon Tree House finish. Well done.
M: This beer is has a moderate amount of carbonation. The hops are apparent, but not too much in your face like many IIPA's are. Has a pillowy, crisp mouthfeel with a dry hoppy finish. 
O: I've had several of Singlecut's more notable IPA's and this one takes the cake and then some. This was a spiritual experience. This beer looks, smells and tastes like Tree House. It's frankly quite remarkable. A+ all around. I just wish it wasn't $9.99/bottle. 896 charactersMA_hops, Jul 24, 2016

Another hazy IIPA but this one doesn't leave much lace and doesn't have much of a head. Aroma is delicious though. Notes of peach, citrus and pineapple. Big malt backbone complemented by just a touch of a grassy hop bitterness. Flavor matches the nose. Hints of peach, clementines, grapefruit and a pineapple sweetness in the back. A touch of bark and resin hop bitterness towards the finish... but the malt profile really shines here. Huge citrus fruit notes. Light bodied in the mouth with ample carbonation that really tickles the palate. Very drinkable.  
A really good IIPA from a up and coming brewery that's making its mark. The best IIPA brewed in New York? It's certainly at least in the conversation! 773 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jul 23, 2016
4.27/5  rDev -3.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Bottled on 7/13/2016: Pours completely hazy orange color with a lot of bubbles that cling to the sides of the glass which leads up to a 1 finger beige colored foamy head that faded on the average side and left minimal spotty lacing.
You can smell this from a mile away - the nose bursts with tropical fruit and graham cracker up front, including a lovely mix of mango, pineapple, peach, tangerine, guava, orange, light grapefruit and then caramel, brown sugar, toasted grains, tea leaf and light floral/peppery spices. The citrus hops blasts your nostrils and bring some piney hops along for the ride in the fruity hop bomb of a nose. Really nice to breathe in, very juicy and hoppy.
Taste is much more balanced than the nose with more sweet malt, biscuit, bread crust and some honey mixed in with the dominant tropical fruit and graham cracker again up front then followed by a fruity mix of peach, mango, pineapple, tangerine, guava, orange, clementine, red grapefruit, caramel, brown sugar, toasted grains, zesty piney hops, faint wet tobacco, peppery spices and a hint of coriander. The bitterness is on the high side but works well to both hide the ABV and weave into the nice citrus hop accents.
Mouthfeel is tart and zesty with a sharp bitterness, a slick feel, light carbonation and a finish that's like orange juice that is starting to sour. The aftertaste has some grains, a sweetness and lots of citrus fruit as it fades on the dry side. Overall it was a very enjoyable offering which I'm glad I bought and consumed right away; this was only a week old and it showed as the hop presence really came off as fresh. 1,626 charactersCHickman, Jul 22, 2016

Produced a hazy orange/mango brew that is blanketed by an eggshell white, 1 inch, dense, creamy head. Nose is filled with Pineapple, Mango, and Peach, and is backed by a slight grassy bitterness. Taste follows the nose and it's absolutely delicious! Finishes dry, leaving such an awesome taste of citrusy goodness to linger. Super drinkable, I mean seriously, I could crush a few of these in a sitting with no problem. The 8.6% is hidden superbly. This is my new favorite from Singlecut, and one of the better DIPA'S I have had in quite a while. Cheers!! 635 characterspaulytasker, Jul 19, 2016

nose is earthy dankness, onion, light pineapple and orange, citrus peel, grassy herbaceous note.
good flavors on the palate, opens with a bright orange and ripe mango, a nice bready and caramel malt, finishes with a light bitterness. overall feel is pretty smooth but borders on thin and the alcohol is showing at times.
overall there is nothing obviously wrong with this beer but having tried a few other singlecut brews, Im starting to think theyre a bit hyped. again nothing blatantly wrong with this beer but doesnt fit the bill for a world class IIPA. 630 charactersHyptochrons, Jul 16, 2016

4.35/5  rDev -1.8%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25The appearance is the weakest part of this beer.  It starts with a large-bubbled, quickly descending head.  It settles to nearly no bubbles at all....certainly no lace.  The liquid is cloudy with a dark gold color.
Semisweet, with a candy sugar nose.  There's a strong grapefruit smell that reminds me of Fresca (in a good way).  The combination is attractive.
The flavor starts with a far drier malt base than the nose.  The hop bitterness stays at bay until the swallow and then it comes in a subdued way--still strong but not extreme.  I feel alcohol warmth deeper in my body in the lower esophagus and stomach--very unusual.  Full bodied with a neutral carbonation level.  Long lasting, well balanced, aftertaste. 719 characterssmcolw, Jun 24, 2016

3.69/5  rDev -16.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Bottle. This brewery has been fairly hit or miss with me. Often I find their beers far too sugary sweet. Sometimes, I enjoy them, though. This one is orange and cloudy. I was expecting it to be paler but I don't care either. The nose is more interesting than most of their beers. I get the standard candied hop syrup aroma that I equate to Singlecut. Yet, there is also an interesting earthy hoppiness as well. The flavor is like hop flavored marzipan. Sugary, hop-fruity, piney, mildly eathy, and very bitter. Simply too sweet. This is very highly regarded but I don't think their IPAs suit me. 595 charactersVelvetExtract, Jun 24, 2016

4.91/5  rDev +10.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow. What a surprise. I live an hour and a half from Treehouse and with two kids, I can't often justify the trip. This was the first beer that I've had that I liked as much as the typical Tree House brews. I've been following Single Cut for 7 months now. I was unhappy with their Bon Bon (although plenty seem to love it), so-so on their Does Anybody Remember Laughter, better with their Half/Full Stacks. And I did rather like their Mo Shuggie. And then this. Finally, something in stores that nails the New England hazy juice-bomb style. If you like TH Julius, Haze, AlterEgo etc. then you will like this too. It's got all of that dank juicy goodness but is more polished and refined than something like a Pioneer Trailblazer - another attempted TH copy, in my opinion. Sadly, everyone else seems to agree and now I can't find it anywhere. But for a few sweet short days I had my hands on 4 of these. My only regret is that I drank two of them while fixing the power steering pump on my car, when I should have been lying in my hammock on my deck. 1,049 charactersdms, Jun 19, 2016

Lots of tropical aroma. Taste is very hop forward yet well balanced. Has a prominent fruitiness, apricot and mango perhaps. Feels syrupy on the tongue. Finishes with a unique orange zest bitterness. In the current craft market jammed with IPAs this is one of the best. Love this one, would definitely recommend it to any of my IPA aficionado buddies (they can buy their own). 482 charactersTLWalsh, Jun 18, 2016

1 pint, 9 fl oz bottle poured into Spiegelglau IPA glass: Opaque honey amber appearance and smallish head, thin lacing doesn't cling much. Presents with malt, caramel and tropical fruit aromas layered on earthy forest dankness. Chewy fruit nectar and hop flavors up front with a nice bitter orange peel finish under lingering dried apricot and pine, and all this sans a syrupy viscosity. Light carbonation, light feel. This is the good medicine. I'm impressed! 642 charactershrdr, Jun 17, 2016

While the nose is dank and fruity,the to me is onion and garlic potato chips. Needless to say,this isn't really for me though it is kind of novel. 404 charactersJohnnieB71, Jun 17, 2016

The aroma was tropical fruits and dank earthy hops.  The flavor had tropical fruit, but a bit more earthy or vegetal then I was expecting.
Moderate carbonation and medium mouthfeel.
A decent DIPA but I preferred many of SingleCut's other options to this.  I have preferred there brews from a tap over any of the bottle offerings. 478 charactersjhavs, Jun 15, 2016

Nose is big on grassy and onion notes.  Definitely some big  citrus, namely orange there too.  Nice, but not a whole lot going on.
Flavor is unexpected - big onion and grassy notes, as expected.  But big bitter start to finish.  Bright ripe citrus of orange and a bit of grapefruit.  But theres a nice spice here and some other pungent aspects.  
Feel is nice - not overly juicy but not overly astringent or drying/bitter.  Fully formed, no watery aspect.
Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA - different from what I typically go for, surprising, but all the better for it. 695 charactersoldn00b, Jun 13, 2016

~2 days from bottling date
Appearance- Pours a deep orange golden color, completely hazy. Half finger thick, soapy white colored head, dissipates to a fine layer. Some spotty head lacing on glass.
Aroma- Bright citrus zest, grapefruit, orange juice, peachy, orange creamsicle. Huge mango notes, sweet tropical fruits, fleshy fruity ripeness, papaya, pineapple chunks. Touches of piney resin and herbal hop notes in the background.
Taste- Citrus and grapefruit up front. Mild tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, some papaya and peach. Sweet breadiness in some spots, and a good amount of pine resin, dankness and earthy spice on the finish.
Feel- Medium bodied, pretty sweet and sticky. Carbonation feels a bit lower than expected, not much crispness, but there is a good amount of creaminess.
Overall- This strikes a pretty nice balance between juiciness and bitterness. Lots of citrus and tropical fruits, but it finishes with that classic dankness and spice. Really well balanced and enjoyable. Malts kind of carry the beer along but let the hops shine. 1,072 charactersOrangeMen, Jun 12, 2016

Look is that hazy, glowing orange liquid almost like an Orange Julius smoothie. 
I got lots of citrusy, tropical notes from this beer on the nose and the palate. It's tasty but also pretty standard to me in terms of what breweries are pumping out. One qualm I had was that I got a bit of earthy hop or yeast on this that took away from the flavor and gave a less than crisp feel and taste to the otherwise light, easy-drinking and smooth double IPA. 
I think I'll try to revisit ASAP for good measure, but this already made a good impression on me. 575 charactersONovoMexicano, Jun 11, 2016

M: Soft, medium bodied but crisp with an approachable acetic quality. 
T: Semi bittersweet passionfruit, bottom of barrel mangoes, crushed citrus leaves, twist of grapefruit peel. A bit of smoky malt, well placed as if the glass was overturned on a smoking plank and then filled with beer. Finishes with notes of pineapple, dank papaya and resin. A real treat for any conehead. Sweet but with an abrasively assertive bitterness. 727 charactersorcrist_cleaver, Jun 09, 2016

4.59/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.5#1000 - Hot damn. Total accident and I meant this to be a notable beer. I don't think things could have worked out any better! Cheers!
L - cracked the bottle and the first thing I noticed was that typical fog that usually comes drifting out of the bottle, however this time it was incredibly still, just below the surface of the bottle. It would stay in place if I rotated the bottle, creating a rather eerie effect. It's so goddamn cliche, but it reminds me of a magician casting a... spell. Or disappearing in a cloud of smoke. Pours a dark ripe orange with a bubbly head that dissipates quickly. 
S - wow, is this a Tree House beer? Getting loads of tropical juicy aromas. Orange peel and grapefruit rind acidity stand out. Softer scents of peach and mango are sprinkled in to create a very balanced, complex, and silky smooth nose with lots going on. Well done. 
T - bright bitter grapefruit rind up front. Acidic and piney and surprisingly bitter for how juicy it is. Very resiny and pithy. Leaves a mealy grit sensation between your teeth in the last half and on to the lingering bitter finish. Candied topical fruits of orange and guava reminiscent of Trillium give the brew a lip-smacking sweetness. Sometimes Trillium and Tree House can seem too much like "chick" beers because of how fruity and juicy they are. This has that but also a powerful hop punch that reminds you THIS IS A DIPA. 
F - I dunno, probably the weakest part of this beer. Kinda disappointed. So much flavor and substance, but the feel is somehow thin and dissipates just as fast as the head. Does not do a good job of delivering the flavor and sorta falls flat before I can even swallow. Not bad and has a soft, low carbonation, but could be much better given the company of the other categories in this review. 
O - one of the best beers I've had from SingleCut. I was expecting something a little softer and more orangey, but instead I got this bitter rindy punch to the face! No complaints! This beer is outstanding aside from the feel. Glad I got two bottles. 2,048 charactersagreenman19, Jun 03, 2016

The color is golden amber with light head. The smell has an earthy hop smell almost like weed with herbal quality. The feel is good with some mild bitterness and low sweetness with a mostly dry finish.
The taste follows the aroma with slight citrus/earthy hop flavor and mild malt in the middle with a subtle alcohol flavor for the strength it finishes on the dry side with a slight toasted malt flavor. This is a good Imperial IPA however I prefer the hop flavor of the 1st Singlecut IPA I tried over this ...this is still very enjoyable and crazy how easy to quaff it is for 8.6% 663 charactersSlatetank, Jun 01, 2016

Smell is mango, papaya, passion fruit, and guava. Can you say tropical?
Taste follows beautifully, but has a piny grapefruit finish that really pulls it all together. 
Mouthfeel is medium, moderate carbonation and it works really well,  juicy not dry, and the drinkability is off the charts. 
Overall this is one of the best I have had and I have had many, can we call the this a North East DIPA? Thanks @Mcballz13 for this treat! 590 charactersSawDog505, Jun 01, 2016

Some floaties swirl in the beer. A decent head pops up but doesn't leave too much lacing.
Smell is just a punch to the face with hops, this is definitely a big hoppy beer with some sweet undertones. The flavor is pretty expressive at first. Nice fruitiness with peach and mango, but with some significant raw hop flavors to take you back to reality. There's a fruity sweetness from the malts that simply don't quit and become more prominent when warm. Finishes with oily resin.
Overall I was pretty impressed by this, very much reminded me of Haze from Tree House, though not as drinkable as the flavor didn't really stay throughout the duration of the beer. I would most definitely drink this again. 836 charactersBranfordBound, May 31, 2016

4.01/5  rDev -9.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4This one is somewhat of a miss for me to be honest. The body is a hazy copper. You get a bubbly off-white head that vanishes quickly to a glass-like surface. Smell is a tropical fruit explosion with a lot of mango and papaya. There are hints of white pepper and pine resin. Here's the rub, while the aroma is complex and varied, it's also way too saccharin and, unfortunately, the same is true with the taste. I find it to be very sweet up front. The good news is the mouth is good, despite the sweetness, thanks to a great finish that is surprisingly dry and sticky. Overall this is an interesting beer, but it's not one of my favorites from Singlecut. 653 charactersCayseyW, May 28, 2016

L - hazy, opaque golden orange. Slightly off white two finger head. I was able to pour about a pint into my Spiegelau IPA glass. Head settled to a skim coat of foam.
S - Bright fruity aroma. This reminds me of some of the wonderful Trillium IPAs.
T - I'm anxious to taste this...bitterness at the tip of your tongue is accompanied by sweetness. Biscuity, maybe slightly grassy (I got just a hint of it). Sweetness flows to the back of your tongue as the bite of the bitterness lingers on the tip. Lap your tongue against the roof of your mouth and get a floral and mango aftertaste. As the tastes linger in your mouth, the bitterness gives you a sense of a dry sweetness on the back of your tongue, if that makes any sense. If anything, this is just a skosh too sweet. That's really splitting hairs, though. 
F - Mild carbonation. Slightly less than some other IPAs. Slick mouthfeel. That sweetness really coats your mouth and hangs on for a while.
O - This is a fantastic beer. A guy at work recommended this as a "very, very good beer", so I had to try it. Even at that pricepoint, I'm glad I did. Since it is a large bottle, this is the type of thing that I would buy again for a special occasion; like when you're going over to a friend's house on a Friday night and you want to bring something that will impress. This is it. 1,474 charactershuntley101888, May 27, 2016

Strong grapefruit and apricot aroma.  Watery mouthfeel up front with a strong prickliness to it mid-palate into the aftertaste.  There's moderately strong bitterness and nice malty sweetness, almost like a nectarine, but relatively little of the strong fruit impressions in both the appearance and aroma carry over to the flavor.  There's a tinge of alcohol on the backend.  This is good, but I like other Singlecut offerings better. 575 charactersthebeers, May 27, 2016

Bottled 7/13, enjoyed 7/14.
A: Pours a very dark amber, nearly completely opaque. Minimal head with almost no lacing.
S: Super fruity straight out the bottle. Incredibly appetizing aroma. Little to no yeasty malt... Just straight up hop juiciness.
T: Tons of tropical notes up front. Mango, pineapple, maybe some peach. Light caramel malt sweetness. Big, dank, herbaceous flavors follow.
M: Very smooth with medium bitterness on the finish. Perfect dryness at the end… Not pucker worthy, but definitely crushable. Drinks way below its ABV.
O: My favorite of SingleCut’s offerings, this one very much reminds me of something out of Tree House / Trillium. The tropical notes are slightly more muted, but an insane level of drinkability and powerful fruity aroma carry this beer into very special territory. Definitely worth seeking out fresh. 881 charactersavas, May 27, 2016

Bottled on: 5 17
Served in a snifter
Super dark and murky, apricot nectar-like appearance. Completely opaque. I can appreciate the looks of a hazy, East Coast-style hoppy beer, but this was hardly the most attractive one I have encountered. The body was topped by a crackling, off-white crown that quickly dissolved. No lacing to speak of.
The aroma was pure tropical fruit bliss. Uber juicy and remarkably fragrant. I could smell this beer as soon as I opened it. Overripe mango dominated. Intense papaya notes. Loads of peach and apricot as well. Somewhat dank and weed-like. Candied orange peel also came through strong. All in all, amazing.
The flavor profile was also outstanding. Again, tropical fruit notes came through big time. Mango was most apparent. Tons of peach and apricot. Candied orange peel was also quite noticeable. Amazingly juicy. Slightly sugary and sweet. The finish contained notes of white grapefruit. Just slightly pithy and bitter. Perfect to balance out the sweetness on the front end.
The mouthfeel seemed a bit fizzy and overcarbonated initially. Later, however, it turned super soft, supple and slick. A fine, moderate effervescence made the liquid glide across my palate.
With Trillium down the street from me and Tree House less than two hours away by car, I tend to think of SingleCut beers as being the best hoppy "shelf beers" I can find whenever I need a quick hop fix. Softly Spoken Magic Spells however is on a totally different level from their other offerings. This truly competes with the best hoppy beers made by some of the best breweries in the country. I can only hope that this occupies a regular spot on the shelf at my local liquor store. 1,774 charactersDamian, May 25, 2016

Easily the best beer I've had in a while, I'd almost swear it can from Vermont. I bought it on a suggestion from Craft Beer Cellars in Framingham, I bought 2 and gave one away.   I will be heading back for a lot more. 486 charactersmickyge, May 25, 2016

Pours a hazy, cloudy amber orange with a frothy white foam head.

Tastes like bitter pine, fresh orange and grapefruit citrus, melons, papaya, apricots, peach, nectarine, plum, some burnt bready caramel malt, with dank woody earthy grass.

Very hazy deep orange color with a thin white head that dissipates really quick. dry-hopped aroma is really prominent, with a rich toasted malt character. Something incredibly grainy that melds with the grapefruit and orange. I can't describe what about this beer makes me go crazy, but it has that crack quality that just makes you want more. It could be the mouthfeel which is very rich for the style and incredibly smooth. 511 charactersPhigg1102, May 24, 2016

I have sought out SSMS's since I saw it on the Beersmith's website earlier this spring. I love what Singlecut has been up to and am very happy to be able to regularly snag their best bottles and draft. Lets get into this one specifically though-
L- nice hazy straw orange color with a glow in the light - solid fingers worth of head that recedes as you go. Hazy but not turbid. 
S- my lord, earthy pine explodes in my nose, with citrus hues but resinous sprucy pine cone sap comes across like a tornado. 
T- more resinous pine with that PNW feel but still centered in the juicy east coast IPA sphere. A lot of bitter grapefruit mellows into a dry oaky finish. My mouth is in heaven at this stage. The 8.6 is so perfectly hidden. 
F- Originally it felt thin, then thick, but it really centers right down the middle with a moderate soft feel and a dry close.
Overall, this is a wonderful beer. Among the top of my list of juicy beers I've tried including TH Green, Fiddlehead Second Fiddle,
Grimm Lambo Door, & Trillium's Vicinity. I am running back to the store tomorrow to buy whatever is left if that gives you a better overall summation of my drinking experience - cheers 1,237 charactersSolebird23, May 23, 2016

4.29/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Bought this on the night it was released - ten bottles it it from the Brewery because I love SingleCut so much!  In addition, I was hoping that this would be on the level of the Bon Bon that got me hooked on these guys and for the most part, this fit that bill. The flavor was just a bit hair one-dimensional but given how tasty and smooth this was, that wasn't much of a deterrent here and this went down quite smooth for the amount of alcohol that was present. 
As the case with the other beers from SingleCut that I've reviewed on here, the pour to this was great. Cloudy, off-amber, and with a moderate head. That quickly settled as there wasn't any lacing to be seen after my first few sips. Massive melon and citrus rind in the nose with even more in the taste, to go with mango,  grass, and a dry mouthfeel. Sweetness up-front gave way to the inner dankness of this beer that was easily visible as this was held up to the light. The bitterness was subdued here given that this had 130 IBU's and domestic hops. That's where the Scottish Malt came through and gave this the complexity and depth that balanced out the fruit flavors!
Plenty of booze here but you wouldn't notice it until the bottle was polished off. While not quite like the beers with Southern Hemisphere hops, this had enough going for it to remind me of those from start to finish. So much in common with Trillium's offerings and easily a good substitute for those who can't make it up to New England. Worth pouring out into a SingleCut snifter as both seem to go hand-in-hand. Another offering that's proof of SingleCut's rapid ascension! 1,614 charactersJerzDevl2000, May 22, 2016

A -  Muddy peach juice body.  Finger of lightly yellowed head.  Ok retention and low lace.
S - Brilliant.  Bold, sweet, fruit juice fills the room when you crack the can - orange, peach, papaya, and mango.  Touch of bitter cilantro on the back end.
T - A fantastic blend of tropical fruit and bitters.  Sour and bitter grapefruit pith, bitter plant stems, white peach, and papaya.
M - Smooth fully body for the style.  Nice carbonation.
O - A delicious juice bomb. Reminds me a lot of Tree House. 554 charactersvfgccp, May 13, 2016

Mango up the wazoo with tangerine and slight grapefruit. Taste is the same with a little bitterness on the back end. Feel is light side of medium, soft and juicy. Overall this beer is absolutely fantastic. Just outstanding. 464 charactersCNoj012, Apr 10, 2016
4.67/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Served on draft, into a 16 ounce teku at 39F.
Color is freshly squeezed tangerine juice. Solid orange with no transparency.
Nose aroma is tangerines, pineapple, mango. Very fruity and herbal.
This ale tastes amazing. I wouldn't expect anything less from Singlecut. Just a really refined and balanced juicy hop bomb. This beer is all about the hops and they shine through strongly. I've never gotten the supposed onion flavor in a beer before, but this ale has it. Onions in abundance. 
The carbonation on this ale is kind of weak, and it fades fast, but this may have something to do with the heavier texture and haziness. Not a dealbreaker and it could have something to do with serving temperature or just this particular keg. 732 characterspinyin, Apr 10, 2016
4.52/5  rDev +2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The beer comes in a hazy deep gold to pale amber.
The aroma jumps out with ripe mango, sweet pineapple, juicy orange, some grapefruit, peach, kiwi, resin and intense dankness on the finish. Very much a Singlecut, but with an amped up juiciness.
The flavor on the other hands is dry instead of being as sweet and juicy as the aroma. It follows with some mango, juicy pineapple, onto lots of oily and bitter grapefruit peel. A light bready malt in the middle gives the beer a hint of sweetness onto a very dry, almost astringent finish. Dank, Pinesol bitter finish.
Reminders of Trillium come to mind with this up there as one of Trillium's best beers. 653 charactersdar482, Apr 10, 2016

Cloudy golden orange color reminiscent of peach nectar (a la Yoga juice), smell is very tropical, peachy, and strong (I could smell it while the growler was being filled), tastes just like the smell, very juicy with a bitterness that follows, the beer has a hearty, creamy, thickness, again like drinking peach nectar juice, certainly the best IPA so far of several excellent offering form Singlecut, beautiful tasty magic! Great name too, although it drinks more like a loudly wafted magic smell! 538 charactersChipChaight, Apr 10, 2016

Everything the nose suggests, plus a nice piney and grassy bite on the end. Feel is spot on, it finishes so clean, something that some of these hazy IPAs struggle with, but singlecut achieved with such elegance. phenomenal beer, sad I only have half a growler of it left.

Nose is in your face tropical fruits, citrus, bubblegum? Super sweet and pungent, excellent. All Singlecut beers have an exceptional nose and this is probably the most fragrant.
Insanely juicy, tropical and citrus. Mango, pineapple, sweetness. Definitely some solid balancing bitterness on the backend that reminds you it's a DIPA...
Thick and creamy, like trillium/TH. Dry, insanely clean finish.
Overall an exceptional beer, and by far SingleCut's best offering to date. Most of their other beers have an exceptional nose and then fall off in the taste department, but this beer is solid throughout. This beer defines NE style IPAs. Seek this one out, you won't regret it... 753 charactersNiiPA324, Apr 07, 2016
4.39/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Digging the Pink Floyd reference!
Hazy apricot-orange pour with a thin, white head; comparable to Tree House beer minus the billowing head.
Not as huge a nose as some of the other Singlecut hoppy beers I've had. I'm getting mainly overripe mango and pineapple with a bit of honeydew melon.
Explosively juicy taste. Overripe pineapple and melon once again, with lots of sticky hop oil. Finishes with some candied sweetness and quite a bit of bitterness. I drank Maine's Dinner last night, and I have to say that this isn't too far off from it. Kind of reminds me of a mix of that beer's Dank tropical and pine notes and the sticky, resinous, candied hop flavors of Grimm's Lambo Door. Couldn't pick very many better IPAs to reference than those two.
The mouthfeel is thick and creamy - close to TH level. Finishes very dry and and pleasingly bitter in spite of this - I can feel the hop oil sticking to my tongue.
Overall, I'm thinking this is Singlecut's best beer yet. Really hope that they keep it around and it makes its way into bottles in the coming months. 1,067 charactersTomMorris, Apr 06, 2016

This pours like a juicy-looking mofo, it's like a bright orange, super hazy and opaque, with a half inch head, and lots of lacing.
This smells like what I imagine Melon and Mango City to smell like, it just smells so ripe and juicy, with herbal pine. I can't wait to dive right into this bad boy.
This is the best beer Singlecut has put out so far. It hits you up with the juiciest of juice bombs up front, lots of mango and melon, some grapefruit, orange zest. But on the finish there's a really heavy duty but pleasing bitterness that balances everything out. This is exemplary.
This has a super juicy mouthfeel, with a good level of carbonation, and a pretty creamy and full body.
This is absolutely tremendous and stands up with the best IPAs in the country. 810 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 02, 2016

4.75/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured on tap at the brewery.
Pours a hazy deep orange color with minimal head and lacing.
The aroma is an ungodly amount of citrus and mango. A touch of resiny pine can be detected on the back end.
The taste follows the nose with a lot of citrus as well as mango and honeydew melon. The back end provides a touch of bitter pine notes to balance out the sweetness.
The mouthfeel is perfect. It's medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Creamy and smooth with no alcohol detected.
Overall, this is one he'll of a DIPA. It's so juicy and creamy it's almost impossible to not want more. It's a bit lacking in balance but it more than makes up for that with its incredible aroma and flavor profile. 700 charactersScaryEd, Mar 31, 2016
