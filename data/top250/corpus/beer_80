4.15/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 4Pours nicely thick with almost no head from an aggressive pour in to a teku.  Leaves no ring or lacing and no head to speak of whatsoever.  Smell is barrel aged stout goodness.  Notes of chocolate on the front, with a strong vanilla sweetness in the middle and boozy bite in the end.  The taste is not as pleasant as the nose to be honest.  A touch sweet up front but in a pleasant way that is nicely balanced by some roasted dryness on the back end.  Where this beer completely falls apart for me is in the feel.  WAY too carbonated for the style.  I feel like the taste really suffers because it has this very tiny bubble carbonation that does not allow all the richness this beer has to truly coat your tongue.  You can't form a head if you try and as soon as it hits your tongue all you feel is bubbles and head.  There is a silkiness to the other parts of this beer but is overshadowed by the feel.  Overall this beer is really good but there is something off with the carbonation that hurts the overall experience substantially. 1,034 charactersAmguerra305, Jun 02, 2017

3.18/5  rDev -29.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.25Appearance: Pours an inky, black body with a sustained, light sandy-beige head.
Smell: Char-hinting heavy roastiness with a crust of bitter dark chocolate, with lesser touches of dark fruit, vanilla-infused molasses, woodsiness and peppery alcohol.
Taste: Bulky roastiness, a bit ashen and chary and laden with booziness and soy. Rolls sweet to bitter (charred) with a salient, less-than-satisfying alcohol presence coupled with woody tannins. A bit of dark chocolate, licorice, gummy molasses and prune. The nose held a bit more promise, though the heavy char, soy and booze leave it lopsided and unbalanced.
Mouthfeel: Medium-plus body. Light carbonation.
Overall: Downright overhyped. 691 charactersChainGangGuy, May 29, 2017

Expresso, light vanilla and bourbon. Taste is spot on! This one is bourbon forward almost a bourbon bomb! But the bourbon yields way to a silky vanilla, oak and cold pressed coffee. Notes of toffee and creamy chocolate also present. Nice silky body. Smooth creamy feel as you sip. This one is a excellent BBS! Cheers Bells 432 charactersMFMB, May 27, 2017

A:  Dark black like oil in a glass with very little head... a little tan head comes out when swirled. 
S: Big bourbon nose, with vanilla and oak dominating. Caramel an molasses in the finish with a healthy dose of ripe to overripe fruit. 
T: Holy shit. Rich with a touch of bitterness coming out first with vanilla, and bourbon following.  Finish is caramel, and brown sugar with a long coffee linger. 
M: Medium thick in body with a creamy feel and moderate carbonation. 
O: This is a pretty phenomenal beer. 550 charactersBeejay, May 25, 2017

The aroma is coffee, dark rich malts, oak, bourbon, and cocoa. It's actually super complex.
It's just so rich, the mouthfeel is so thick and coating. The flavor is chocolate forward with just enough roast and some molasses sweetness. the bourbon flavor blends perfectly, the oaky vanilla and coconut blend perfectly with the chocolate nose. It's absolutely spectacular. 396 charactersScott17Taylor, Apr 14, 2017

4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The 2016 release of this barrel-aged imperial stout is a looker: a slightly rocky medium brown head perches atop an impenetrably black body with faint mahogany footlights; head retention is modest and lacing is good, consisting of bands, ladders and cavelets. The nose is medium-large: moderate, full-range bourbon notes in beautiful balance with a seamless blend of caramel, more subtle milk chocolate and hints of toffee; moderate alcohol overtones top things off. The palate is a delicious blend of milk chocolate and darkest toffee, with hints of caramel and fudge; as on the nose, the bourbon character is moderate in intensity and consists of the entire range of bourbon flavor notes, and is almost perfectly balanced with the malt character. An insistent alcohol undertow flows beneath the malt. Overall, the flavor is right on the tipping point between sweet and bitter. The finish is a goodly hit of booze and dark toffee, followed by the onset of a mild chocolate-and-oak bitterness that lasts for a few minutes. The mouthfeel is commensurate with the extra-full body, and is slightly astringent; the texture is sticky/creamy, viscous and slightly peppery from the well-expressed carbonation.

S: Oak and bourbon followed by chocolate and small amount of coffee. Also has a some what overall smokiness to it. 
T: Solid overall mix of flavors, nothing overpowering. Like that the bourbon and oak are there but they are not super strong to crush everything else. The more sips I take the more I get chocolate and cherries?, then a little coffee. 
 F: Little lighter on the bodied than I expected but still solid, definitely very smooth and easy to drink.
O: Really good BA stout, especially if you don't like the ones that have a huge bourbon taste. I will be looking to get other bottles of this. 662 charactersBum4ever, Mar 23, 2017

Half finger tan head.  initial impression is smooth chocolate coffee with dark fruit and bourbon.  Mouthfeel is thick and silky, although for the ABV and style just a little more fullness would be nice.  Finish is smooth, with bittersweet chocolate dominating.  Alcohol is quite well hidden - just a little warming on the finish.  No rough edges.  Maybe cellaring would improve things a bit, but frankly this is too good to mess with.  Excellent offering from Bell's. 556 charactersdbl_delta, Mar 21, 2017

12 oz bottle, 2016, poured into a tulip
A- Black with a two finger mocha head.

T- Milk chocolate/cocoa, some roasted coffee, caramel malts, some dark fruits, some toasted malts, bourbon, some vanilla.
M- Smooth, medium to full body.
O- This beer lingers on your tongue in the best way possible and is incredibly easy to drink for a bourbon barrel aged stout.  As I'm drinking this it just keeps opening open and show the layers of this beer.  Another great imperial stout from Bell's! 629 characterslarryi86, Mar 19, 2017

L: 1+F light tan head with medium retention, spotty lacing, and a thin ring. Not bad for the ABV. Beer is perfectly black.
S; Lots of bourbon barrel, roasted malts, cocoa, and some vanilla.
T: Tends to follow nose at beginning, but branches off with coffee, cocoa, dried dark fruits, and vanilla, with a bit of a dairy quality mid palate. ABV barely noticeable, a little bit of heat at the end, but no big deal.
F: Medium-bodied, probably could be a bit fuller for the style and ABV. medium carbonation, so pretty good drying overall and the ABV does not linger. Very solid construction, balance is pretty good. Probably improves with aging, so I'll look into that.
O: Somewhere between great and gotta have it. Maybe the aging will move it into the elite tier. It's very solid on its own merits. 877 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Mar 12, 2017

Bourbon character is subdued which allows the beer to hide it's ABV really well. Mouthfeel is damn near perfect thick fudgy creaminess, broken up by a good amount of carbonation for a BA beer. Overall this excellent beer if you like sweet, chocolaty, fudgy stouts. 95 points! 670 charactersMikeyMcD86, Mar 11, 2017

The first bottle I had of this, fresh out the gate, was excessively dry and bitter; it was pretty unbalanced, not at all what was expected from the brewer notes. However, this second bottle I'm trying... this is more like it. Now I understand.  The dry finish and herbal notes are still there, but now there is more complexity to be found mid-palate. The bourbon and barrel characters are both more pronounced, with the bourbon and Double Cream Stout contributing some balancing sweetness. Perhaps there is some variation between runs, but this particular bottle is quite pleasant. 595 charactersdarktronica, Mar 09, 2017

4.58/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours an inky black with a minimal chocolate head, which dissipates to a small ring around the glass.  Smells earthy, dark chocolate, marshmallow, slight hint of bourbon. Tastes of dark chocolate, bourbon, coffee, dark fruit, and finished with a caramel flavor. Minimal notice of the alcohol, most sips you couldn't taste it, sometimes it was a light burn in the background. Body is a bit on the thin side for a BA stout. Overall it's a little surprisingly complex, usually don't see something this complex without another additive like coffee. Goes down easily but a thick enough body to make it more of a sipper than crushable. 629 charactersRiff, Mar 07, 2017

Toast, vanilla.
Marshmallow cream and dark chocolate's underlined by bright cut of bourbon. Lives up to the billing. Sweetness would push it over the top, IMO.

A: Pours inky black, minimal cola-like head with almost no retention.
S: Coffee, bittersweet chocolate, dark fruits, and bourbon barrel (caramel and vanilla).
T: A surprising amount of coffee that lingers from sip to swallow. Aromas materialize on the palate in a symphonic manner. Finishes with some bourbon heat.
F: Not as thick as other BA stouts... even with the Double Cream Stout playing part. 585 charactersshareallthebeer, Feb 20, 2017

4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Pours dark & almost completely flat with just a thin lacing. True to style but not the most visually appealing. Aroma is classic bourbon stout with notes of molasses, vanilla, fudge with some dark fruit. Enticing with no alcohol flare on the nostrils. Flavors follow suit, thick fudge upfront with warm oak, molasses and vanilla coming next. Vintage bourbon supporting notes but all folded-in expertly. The end has a tad of tannin / leather and just a smidge of heat which serves as a nice contrast to all those decadent flavors upfront, though it borders on throwing things off.  Mouthfeel is velvety and viscous. 614 charactersajm5108, Feb 19, 2017

A: Pours jet black in color with a 1/3 inch, foamy, dark brown-cola colored head with minimal retention. Thin, tan lacing throughout.
S: Aromas of coffee, dark chocolate, cherry, raisins, caramel, vanilla, and roasted malts with small hints of bourbon.
T: Starts off with bitter coffee/espresso and dark chocolate followed by caramel, vanilla, cherries, and roasted malts. Finishes with a nice bourbon barrel character followed by the return of mild lingering coffee bitterness with slightly sweet notes of dark chocolate.
F: Full bodied, thick, smooth, and super creamy.
O: Overall, this is an awesome BA stout. Bourbon barrel character is definitely present, but at a nice level that pairs excellently with the other flavor profiles, especially the coffee and dark chocolate. Looking forward to trying it with some age on it. Definitely worth seeking out! 922 charactersBeerGuy8315, Feb 14, 2017

3.95/5  rDev -12.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Have to say right up front that I'm biased by having drunk a number of Firestone and Bottle Logic stouts recently, and those memories persist, giving the disadvantage to Black Note. The look is dark, almost black, but in a very one-dimensional way. Moving it around it front of light doesn't bring out any subtlety, the way it does with many other stouts. The head is very thin, also nothing to get excited about. The smell, to my mind, is the best part of the beer: it promises depth and complexity, especially as it warms, with bourbon, chocolate, and vanilla next to currants and figs. But it simply doesn't translate into the taste, which is somewhat splintered, unintegrated. You can detect many great indvidual flavors that simply don't meld. A slightly vinegary undertone doesn't do it any favors. My biggest recent point of comparison here is Bottle Logic Byzantine Vision, which, although it derives some of its complexity from adjuncts, has one of the best integrated flavor profiles of any "big beer" I've tried. Mouthfeel is rather thin, and evaporates quickly from the tongue. I realize I'm in the minority here, but I find it to be a solid but unremarkable example of the style. 1,192 charactersJayORear, Feb 11, 2017

~3 months from bottling date
Appearance- Pours a black color, opaque. Thin layer of dark tan colored head, soapy / bubbly. Alcohol legs coat glass w/ a film-like layer, lots of small beads of head lacing.
Aroma- Dark chocolates, rich fudge, savory sweetness. Loads of fresh sweet bourbon, dry oak, creamy vanilla, barrel char and smoke. Roasty malts, coffee, caramel, dark fruits, creamy sugars.
Taste- Roasted malt, dark fudgy chocolates. Bourbon, charred wood, spicy oak, tobacco, leathery earthiness. Vanilla, caramel, brown sugar, molasses, milk chocolates. Coffee, dark fruits, raisins, cherries.
Feel- Medium bodied, creamy and very silky smooth, drying from all the barrel characteristics. Moderate to lower carbonation.
Overall- Decadent richness combined with such raw and flavorful barrel characteristics. So much bourbon and oak, with all the underlying complexities of vanilla, char, smoke, tobacco, etc. Nuanced flavors of chocolate, dark fruits, and creamy sweetness just make the beer so complex and complete. A true treat to try. 1,063 charactersOrangeMen, Feb 05, 2017

Aroma of old moldy oak barrel, meat locker, snuff tobacco, leather, cigarette butts, and slight vinegar. 
Flavor is a touch milky to start (somewhat thin), but then forms a bit more character with tobacco, earth, and finally on the finish it all comes together - bourbon, rich chocolate, oats, and leather on the aftertaste. 
Feel is thin to start, then begins a medium profile, and finally a thick juicy finish with a roasty dryness. 
Overall, this is the 2nd 2016 bottle I've had this year, and I remember the first one being better. This seems to have some issues regarding smelling a bit vinegary and ashy, with the flavor really lacking until the finish. I remember the first bottle being flavorful all the way through. Sad, but I have one more bottle I can take care of yet before my 2016 stash is depleted. 
Rated with price in mind ($6/bottle). 894 charactersThe-Adjunct-Hippie, Jan 16, 2017

Look: Pours surprisingly thin jet black, with a small light mocha head. Minimal lacing left on the glass with each sip.
Smell: Huge bourbon and roasted malts. Fresh coffee and dark chocolate.
Taste: Dark chocolate initially, vanilla, touch of bourbon accompanied by some alcohol bite, but barely. Roasted coffee and hints of sweet caramel. Touch of bitterness on the back-end levels out any sweetness. Just excellent. 
Mouth feel: To me this is really smooth. It's not too thick nor too thin. It finds a balance inbetween the two.
Overall: Bell's can brew stouts with the best of them and this is an example. The bourbon is just present enough to enhance and let the other flavors of the stout's bases to shine. If you see it, order a glass or get a bottle. You won't be disappointed. 829 charactersBrewsOverHoes, Jan 07, 2017

Hard to get anything else beyond that. The taste definitely has bourbon in it and heat from the alcohol but you do get a great medley of other flavors. Chocolate comes out with hints of vanilla and coffee. Smooth feel with decent carbonation. One of my favorite barrel aged beers. Was scared of it by the smell but the flavors balance so well together and the smooth feel make this an experience any craft beer drinker needs to have. Glad I have multiple bottles. 549 charactersMeyers1023, Jan 07, 2017
4.33/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25L- Very dark. Pours with a solid mocha head. It fades to a thin ring around the glass. 
S- Heavy on the roasted malts and bourbon. Some bittersweet chocolate. Pleasing. 
T- Roasted malts and caramel. Bourbon is there, but not as strong as the aroma. A little chocolate in the base. Not quite as smooth and balanced a flavor profile as I would like. 
F- This was a target of mine for a while because I heard it had a nice, creamy mouthfeel and that's what I look for in a stout. Well, it wasn't quite there. I was a bit concerned when I saw how thin it poured. It did have a rich, smooth feel, but it wasn't nearly as thick and creamy as some of my favorites. 
O- I was excited to finally get my hands on one, but it was merely solid. There's nothing wrong with it per say, but it didn't live up to my (admittedly high) expectations. 
If it matters, this was the 2016 B2 version. 883 charactersZoomslowik, Jan 07, 2017

4.08/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Now for something completely the hallmark of style.  A big roasty stout put into bourbon barrels.  This was one of the early ones, but it still keeps on rockin' in the free world.
Pours black.  Shocking.  Creamy 1/2" tan head.  Aroma of roast and bourbon.  This is going exactly as one would expect.
Taste, chocolate and bourbon, decent amount of alcohol heat in the mouth feel.  Not as highly hopped as some beers in this style, helps contribute to the smoothness, that and an appropriately lower carbonation aspect.   A little bit of dark fruit bitterness to it.   Good format and price structure helps get that overall bump.   Viscous, is there molassess going on here?  Some burnt caramel feels to it. 707 charactersrodbeermunch, Jan 04, 2017

Pours ultra black with a small khaki head. No lacing on a finished glass.
Smells chocolate, almost like cocoa powder with a touch of brown sugar and an ever present oak barrel esque ness from the mash.
Taste virtually follows the nose with the sweetness and booze amped up.
Exceptionally smooth on the swallow though the body itself is a touch lackluster by comparison to the rest of the beer 
Overall I'm glad I finally got to try it out after all these years. I feel that it is a great stout but nothing earth shattering. 680 charactersRaime, Jan 01, 2017

12oz bottle poured into a snifter
A- pours a viscous jet black color with a small creamy khaki colored head that eventually reduces to a ring around the glass
S- opens with fresh espresso and dark chocolate followed by dry fig and black molasses.  The barrel aroma is alive and well, giving off notes of caramel/toffee, wet oak & vanilla whipping cream.  More dark fruit emerges near the close, currant, dark cherry, and compliments a bold bourbon aroma on the finish
T- Plenty of dark chocolate, fresh espresso and charred malt up front, followed by sweet vanilla cream, molasses and burnt brown sugar.  Dark fruit notes of fig, raisin and black cherry emerge, followed by the barrel notes kicking in; wet oak, vanilla, caramel and spicy bourbon.  The finish is almost port-like, with more bourbon & char lingering 
M- medium heavy body with moderate-low carbonation leads to a foamy mouthfeel than continues into a slightly warming, creamy finish 
O- everything you look for in a straight up, bourbon barrel aged stout.  Just enough barrel elements, and the blend of the two Bell's stout seems to work better than each on their own 1,151 charactersTreyliff, Dec 29, 2016

Smells perfect for a bourbon barrel aged stout. The bourbon and oaky notes lead the charge, followed by molasses, dark chocolate, cocoa powder, vanilla, syrup, burnt coffee, hot fudge, dark fruit and then more chocolate with a hint of piney hops which makes for an extremely complex and wonderful nose.
Wow, it tastes just like it smells but with booze and heat from the high ABV, however it does not negatively impact the flavor. Even more chocolate and coffee come through with espresso, chocolate syrup, smoked malt, charred wood and brown sugar adding dynamics before some earthy and woody barrel notes kick in. It's hot in a good way with the rich malt, bourbon and barrel notes making for a delicious combination. World class indeed. 862 charactersCHickman, Dec 28, 2016

I like the aroma, the brew smells like vanilla, bourbon, dark fruit, molasses, dark chocolate, and coffee.  Taste is similar to the aroma, but there's also some caramel and burnt/charred malt noticeable too.  Mouthfeel/body is medium/full, it's creamy and coating with a moderate amount of carbonation.

Viscous pour, jet black, low carbonation.  Aroma of roasted coffee, figs, and whiskey.  Taste matches the color and smell...pure stout distilled down to its essence.  Sip slowly and savor the layers of flavor.  A high ABV leaves a lingering warmth on a cold night.  Find a warm fire and enjoy. 376 charactersNickSMpls, Dec 18, 2016

Dark brown with redish tint, mocha head that last awhile, leaving tan lacing
Smells of vanilla, camel, bit of bourbon
Alcohol sting of the tongue while absorbing the flavors from the aroma 
Not as thick as I'd expect, maybe the Cream Stout?

4.68/5  rDev +4%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Look: The beer is a dark brown, with light on the edges, and virtually no head. What little head there is comes in khaki, and dissipates quickly. 
Smell: an initial dark fruit/raisin smell, and some vanilla comes through. Malts as well. After generating some head, the barrel and bourbon come through in a big way. 
Taste: Bourbon, vanilla and the barrel really are prevalent throughout, but, as the beer warms, a raisin comes through, as does some of that coffee, chcolatey flavor
Feel: a medium full body, some carbonation, but not much, and a nice smooth finish. 
Overall: A solid bourbon barrel Stout showing off quite a bit of flavor. The finish is long, and the beer is tasty. 686 charactersCfred371, Dec 17, 2016

4.6/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a 12oz bottle into a tulip.  Pours a deep brown/black with just the faintest hint of red.  As the pour starts, no head began to emerge, so I poured more aggressively.  Despite best efforts, this beer yields only the faintest meniscus of mocha head which recedes with almost no lacing.  The nose is dominated by vanilla and bourbon on top of the typical stout nose profile.  The palate, when first poured, is primarily dark chocolate, marshmallow, vanilla, and bourbon (the bourbon note though, significantly, is not a saccharine one, but a reserved whisky taste that accents, rather than dominates, the palate).  As the beer warms, the creamy vanilla and marshmallow come more to the fore, and the bourbon notes open up into deep overtones of cherry and oak.  The mouthfeel is thick, but not syrupy (a huge achievement).  This is an elegant, and simple BB stout.  Rather than seeking nuance through a wealth of adjuncts, this beer takes simple concept, the unmodified bourbon barrel stout, and executes it masterfully.  Though I have a personal taste for the more experimental BB stouts of Deschutes and others, I have a tremendous respect for what Bell's has done with this outstanding brew. 1,204 charactersLAp, Dec 16, 2016

4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Serving: 12 oz. bottle poured into a Founder's CBS snifter. Bottled on 7/1/16, making this almost 5.5 months old at this point.
A: Pours a nearly pitch black color with just a hint of caramel-mocha head on the rim. Tons of alcohol legs up the glass, very oily.
S: Tons of vanilla, marshmallow, caramel, and cocoa up front. Soft notes of bourbon and oak come through right at the end. Not a huge barrel presence, but it's there.
T: More oak and bourbon up front in the taste. Huge vanilla, marshmallow, caramel, and fig in the finish. Even picking up a small dash of hops from the usually quite aggressive Expedition Stout in the finish as well.
M: A bit thinner than previous editions, but still medium mouthfeel overall.
O: I've had several vintages of this beer in the past (both fresh and aged), but never had the chance to review it fresh until now. This one has always been my favorite BA Imperial Stout in Michigan, ahead of KBS and BB Plead, mostly because it's the most drinkable to me. I really love that marshmallow/vanilla vibe from the Double Cream Stout, and it almost puts this on the spectrum of a VBDL. It doesn't pack quite the punch as I remember, the barrel might not be as big, and the mouthfeel a touch thinner, but this beer still kills it whenever it decides to show it's face. 
Recommendation: You haven't had one of the best beers from Michigan until you've had this one. 1,402 charactersSparty1224, Dec 13, 2016

A jet black pour out of the bottle, producing a modest tan head that retreated fairly quickly. A soft bourbon presence on the nose, along with caramel, coffee, cherries, and chocolate. I tasted the caramel first and it quickly gave way to all of the above notes. Rich chocolate but not too heavy. The bourbon was a bit hot and this should evolve nicely with a bit of age. 407 charactersBuck89, Dec 10, 2016

A lot of sticky broken  lace coating glass.  Smells of oak and vanilla up front and dark fruits.   Towards bottom of glass getting more alcohol coming through but oak still strong.  Flavors blend well into one.   Plum, raisin, vanilla, oak and some bourbon heat.   Carbonation at first distracts from smooth creaminess that follows nicely.   Light feel that is not a heavy sweet coating that sometimes goes with stouts.   Not tiring on the mouth to the end even as it warms.  Overall it was great, just some slight room for improvement if the alcohol burn didn't distract. 678 charactersDMarlinJ, Nov 26, 2016
4.26/5  rDev -5.3%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Thanks, gillagorilla!
Pours a pitch-black color. The head is...well, it's more of a shabby-looking film, really. Lighter tan in color, it features really bad retention. Naturally, no lacing is left behind. 
As expected, plenty of rich yet nuanced bourbon barrel shows up aromatically. Oak, vanilla, and even mild marshmallow all appear. The base is loaded with notes of roasted malt, baker's cocoa, and espresso. What it lacks in intense fudge and brownie batter notes it makes up for with notes of licorice and dark fruits. The barrels have done their job here, and that's take away the sharper features of Expedition Stout while adding additional depth. And deep it is! It continues to unfurl layers as it opens up, and seems to feature more complexity (aroma-wise) than even many of the style stalwarts.
It first features a flavor of dark fruits and licorice (how 'bout that, just like the aroma dictated...), which then gives way to espresso around the middle. The finish, natch, is quite oak-laden. As a nitpick, the barrels here seem to take on more of a generic oak quality, instead of offering vivid bourbon flavors of vanilla or toasted coconut. In fact, compared to many other barrel-aged stouts out there, this doesn't seem particularly sweet at all. Despite the seemingly drier, more utilitarian approach, it doesn't come across as being harsh (unlike fresh Expedition Stout) or out of balance. It's every bit as complex as it needs to be, yet still finely balanced. This is close to my ideal stout, it just needs a bit more actual bourbon presence (as opposed to just oak) and maybe 10% more depth.
Because it's so well attenuated, the mouthfeel is surprisingly - dare I say - crisp. It's not light-feeling or dinky (by any stretch), but it goes down surprisingly easily. It does this all without a vicious, alcoholic bite. Carbonation is obviously low. 
This, in my opinion, is the best beer Bell's makes. It's an excellent blend that's both balanced and tempered by bourbon barrels, while retaining the stronger qualities of the two (especially Expedition Stout). I surmise this one will be a mofo to find - I'd gladly make that effort to seek it out again. It's easily on par with some of the better barrel-aged stouts on the market.

The bourbon and oak come through loud and clear on the aroma but here are also strong notes of dark fruit.  Unlike many other stouts, I didn't really pick up any discernible coffee or chocolate on the smell.  Very straightforward but very good overall.  Taste is more complex than the smell and along with bourbon and oak aplenty there are slightly sweet, dark chocolate flavors.  Maybe the bourbon masked it on the smell.  Mouthfeel is super smooth and creamy with no real carbonation.
Suggested food pairing: Prosciutto

Overall: 4.5 (This beer is very good and I would definitely drink it again)  This one meets the high expectations it has come to engender.  Depth of flavor and smell with a spot on mouthfeel.  It's a shame that it's so difficult to come by, but well worth making the effort to do so. 975 charactersSHDoyle, Nov 25, 2016

4.1/5  rDev -8.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Very dark brown mahogany with a fleeting mocha head.
Thick, rich smell that I can even feel in my throat when I take a small whiff. Nutty, thick chocolate, walnut and wet, dense oak, with a faint, spicy, peppery bourbon resting in the background.
Taste is heavily charred, dark oaky, woody, nuttiness, finishing as a slick, waxy chocolate. There is almost a hint of peanut butter in there. Bourbon continues to not be overpowering on the palate, with a spicy kick of heat on the very back end.
This is blended expertly, with a full bodied feel, soft hefty froth, some lightening tang, a nice balance of flavors, and a complexity and deepness of characteristics not often found in the barrel aged stout. However, this review was for the 2016 version, and I found, having a 2014 version about a year later that the heat of the beer doesn't actually seem to mellow out substantially over time, sort of putting rest to the idea of hoarding these for a better day, at least for this beer. If you don't like what heat this beer does bring, you probably shouldn't buy a ton to cellar. 1,080 charactersSabtos, Nov 10, 2016

Looks thinner than expected.  Nose is dominated by the bourbon with notes of raisin, chocolate, and roast.  Taste is super balanced between the barrel, dark fruit, and roasted malts.  Highly drinkable for a BA stout.  Feel is on the thin side with moderate carbonation.  Great stout....but the thin body holds it back from being world class. 445 characterslemmy187, Oct 12, 2016

4.66/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5The beer pours a nice creamy tan colored head that dissipates quickly but leaves a nice ring around the inside of the glass. The beer itself is a nice , dark black color with a nice texture. The texture is a bit creamy and looks fairly smooth. While it doesn't have the same deep or heavy appearance other beers of similar make and style.
The smell is good. The smell has a nice and moderate bourbon note that mixes well with the other notes. The other notes consist of a nice cocoa notes and dark chocolate notes with a light creaminess. There is also a light alcohol note that surprisingly does not take away from the smell but adds an interesting note to it.
The taste is fantastic. It's a nice combination of barrel notes with imperial cream stout and imperial stout notes that work very well. The barrel notes consist of a nice moderate bourbon notes. The other notes consist of a nice creaminess but with strong cocoa and dark chocolate note to it.
The feel is very good. It's a heavy bodied beer with moderate carbonation but has a very nice and very silky feel to it. It's different from other stouts and this creaminess is fairly unique. It adds quite a bit to the beer's character.
Overall, this a very good beer and one that probably will get much better as it ages. With the very unique taste and wonderful texture, I can certainly see why this is one of the most sought after beers; other than it's rarity. This beer is a great and worthwhile whale to seek when it's available. Happy hunting fellow beer geeks.
UPDATE: 1 Year Aged.
It turns out I was right and aging this beer was the best idea I had. The bourbon notes come out a bit stronger and the alcohol note fades out and smooths out to create a much more cocoa nib and bourbon mix that is a delight. The dried fruit comes out more in the finish in both the taste and the smell. The feel is a bit thinner than I remember but it's still pretty good. 1,923 charactersHattedClassic, Sep 17, 2016

The taste follows closely with bourbon, complex roasted malt, cocoa, earthy hops, lactose, and some subtle dark fruit; much better intensity and very smooth.  Light bitterness, dryness, and sweetness. The alcohol is completely hidden.  Above average body and below average carbonation.  Overall, this is a smooth, complex, and tasty IS. 503 charactersalarmclock314, Sep 14, 2016

Looked pitch black, moderately carb'd, good aroma of dark fruits and bourbon....but really fell flat for me. Lacked the intensity of barrel, roast, chocolate, hops that other top tier BA stouts offer. It felt pleasant but just a bit flabby, neither sweet and chocolatey nor intensely dark and licorice-y....it's as if someone had mixed a milk stout and an imperial Russian stout...which is I suppose indeed what they did here. A fine stout; but not one I'd go out of my way to try again. 538 charactersPDXAmbassador, Sep 04, 2016

Pours dark black with a half finger of brown head that subsides rather quickly.  The smell is intense in a good way: vanilla, chocolate, coffee, smokey ash and a hint of coconut. The taste is a complex mixture of much of the same from the nose.  Amazing!  It is not overtly sweet, and well balanced by some coffee bitterness.  Chocolate, vanilla, caramel, bourbon -- you name it, it's in here.  The mouthfeel is pretty good, though I wish it were a bit thicker.  But really, that's my only complaint.
Expedition stout has always disappointed me whether fresh or aged, but this thing is a beast that makes my level of respect for Bell's go through the stratosphere! 694 charactersnawpnawp, Aug 12, 2016

T:   Vanilla, caramel, dark chocolate, raisin & a kiss of Bourbon up front.  More vanilla, Bourbon notes, fig & raisin & carob as this warms, slight smokeyness too.  Finishes with dark fruit, vanilla, Bourbon, & chocolate
MF:  Chewy, warming, decent carbonation for the style
Despite the style & abv, this went down fast.  Every bit as good as I hoped 580 charactersrusspowell, Aug 10, 2016

12oz bottle into a tulip.
Pours an opaque dark brown/black with 1/2" of off-white head that dissipates at a moderate pace.  Retention & lacing are below-average to style.  The nose betrays quite a bit of Bourbon & noticeable heat.  Caramel & toffee, vanilla & milk chocolate are also detectable.  The palate is vanilla, milk chocolate, caramel & Bourbon - in that order.  There are additional notes of pitted fruit & black coffee, along with some spice.  Feel is soft & dense, with low-to-moderate carb & a fairly delicate malt body.  Altogether quite impressive. 570 charactersMUTINY, Aug 09, 2016

S:  has a strong smell of bourbon with hints of chocolate.
T:  a big bourbon taste but it doesn't over power.  hints of chocolate and coffee but didn't get any fruity notes.
M:  light carbonation with warming fell afterwards.  this beer has been one of the most smooth bourbon beers I have tasted.
O:  I would love to have more of it but it was just so hard to find here in Chicago(i live in the burbs). 481 charactersRedsunsx01x, Aug 07, 2016

A - Dark body, opaque, with a short tan head that fades quickly.  Minor lacing.  Pretty typical for a solid barrel aged stout.
S - Roasted malt is forward, with a strong alcohol and wood hum, and hints of chocolate and vanilla.  Fairly quiet, all told, but the nose promises deliciousness.
T - And this beer delivers.  Solid.  Front is boozy bourbon vanilla and wood, middle of dark chocolate and cocoa nibs, molasses and bread, close is slightly acidic.
M - Some carbonation, slick, warmth from the alcohol, and a biting close that scrubs the weight off and keeps things clean.  A bit to brisk for me.
O - Glad I stumbled into this one, and that I got to try it.  I think this is rock solid, a signal of Bell's skills.  A strong, solid take on the bourbon-barrel aged stout. 800 charactersTsar_Riga, Aug 05, 2016

It's aroma is great.  Roasty, full of bourbon, molasses, chocolate, oak and more.  It's high abv is very prevalent in it's aroma.
Malty and sweet, boozy and warm, with notes of molasses, black licorice, more boozy warmth, figs, and coffee.  It's downright tasty.  It's slightly thinner than I was expecting it to be.  It's absolutely full-bodied, but probably a touch thinner than bells expedition stout, and I wasn't expecting that.  It's a great beer.  One that *almost* lives up to it's mega-hype. 608 charactersjp32, Jul 16, 2016

Taste- right upfront you get some vanilla and dark chocolate middle of the mouth rasin plums burnt sugar slight milk chocolate finishes with more dark chocolate dark coffee roastiness and a nice smokey almost burnt woody characteristic. A creamy vanilla taste shows some flashes in the aftertaste. But mostly the burnt roasted notes linger in the finish.
Feel: medium to full body better body then the 14 dry in the finish creamy mouthfeel.
Overall: I had a 14 and now a 16 the body on the 16 is better and there are more of those barrel notes in the 16. I think the 16 is slightly better. A really really good beer. 694 charactersMasonz223, May 17, 2016

This is an exceptional beer.  Thick and heavy bourbon and chocolate.  Not too complex, but the oak and vanilla notes shine nicely.  Creamy and definitely some dark fruits coming through as well.  Would love to just have a full glass of this myself to drink over an hour or so and taste all the changes as the temperature warms.  Really great offering Bell's.

Aroma is heavy on the chocolate but also has striking scents of black cherries, figs, toffee, possible raisins, lactic/vanilla sweetness and has small notes of wood and booze.  Unique beer as it is so thick and malty, bread notes even, but passes over tongue watery/slick smooth.  This slickness contains chocolate notes (chocolate being the dominant taste profile), wood, lactic/vanilla sweetness, I guess in a way I'm saying beer has a chocolate milk vibe at times, with black cherry, raisins/figs, possible plum (runs the dark fruit gamut) tastes in the background.  Wonderfully balanced beer and probably too sweet for some but one that I recommend to any beer drinker (not just stout drinkers). 797 charactersclayrock81, Feb 05, 2016

Pours viscus black in color with a kahiki head. Rich aromas of bakers chocolate, fudge and vanilla with hints of oak, and dark fruit. Taste has surprisingly just as much chocolate as the nose with an enhanced presence of rich vanilla and caramel, hints of oak dark stone fruit and bourbon. Nice thick velvety feel, alcohol is very well hidden. Incredibly balanced. 378 charactersFcolle2, Jan 26, 2016

L: Black as night, with a nice ruby hue on the edges when looked at through the light.

A — Pours a dark rich pitch black hue into the glass, there is a thin filmy dark coffee brown head that forms and leaves behind a trace of oily lace with each sip.
S — Smell is strong and focused, notes of barrel, vanilla, oak, lightly charred coffee and malts. Slightly boozy. Dark chocolate, coffee, espresso, caramel cream.
T — Licorice, anise, bitter espresso, coffee, chocolate bark, dark chocolate malted milk balls, vanilla, Bourbon, oak, chewy.
M — Full-Bodied, rich, lingering full finish.

The beer is awesome. Minimal head and little lacing. Smells like roasted cashews and has a nuttiness to it in addition to the sweet, bourbony smell.
The taste is smooth, sweet bourbon and oak. A faint alcohol flavor and a bit of carbonation on the end.
Hard to imagine a better stout than this. 389 characterserickehoe, Dec 02, 2015

Look:  Dark sultry body.  The head is a creamy mocha.  It quickly dissipates to a thin ring around my favorite 15.5 ounce brandy snifter.  This appears viscous.  The legs and lacing appear luxurious. 
Smell:  The smell is rich and amazing.  It has a nice balanced bourbon smell, with medium roasted malts, faded coffee, easy dark chocolate, and creamy sweetness that brings everything together.  Easy, and balanced.  
Taste:  Well, well, well.  Everything described above is within the taste, and more.  Dark chocolate has a bigger part than noticed in the smell.  The oak bourbon barrel is nicely integrated, and provides big flavor.  The dried fruit blends well.  The finish is very short.        
Feel:  Medium body, somewhat dry.  Not as creamy as expected.  Full mouth feel.
Overall - Deluxe.  I am a big fan of Expedition Stout, so naturally, I am a lover of Bell's Black Note Stout.  I was never a fan of Double Stout, but it does a nice job combined with the other elements.  Laid back big stout drinking here.  My final words - I was expecting more... 1,074 charactersmabermud, Oct 29, 2015

A: Pours pitch black with a creamy mocha head, lots of tiny bubbles in the head, good amount of carbonation, looks oily thick, lots of lacing, good head retention.
A: Bourbon, dark chocolate, dark fruits like figs, plums, raisins, alcohol is pretty mellow, smells big. 
T: First impression is that this is incredibly smooth, up front bourbon, dark chocolate, dark fruits, a hint of coffee roasted bitterness in the middle, finishes dry, slight bitterness at the end, picking up a hint of Expedition stout soy sauce flavor, tastes world class., booze is well hidden. 
M: Thick, oil like mouthfeel, incredibly smooth, great balance of carbonation in the mouthfeel, really good.
O: This is world class, it's a 2014 and it has aged very well, for 11.40% it's incredibly smooth, great balance of flavors, if this was available in Southern CA I would try to buy a case each year to cellar. 926 charactersBrolo75, Oct 14, 2015

L: Nice and clean, with a dark tan head.
S: The booze still comes through a bit, so nothing too spectacular here.
T: Dark chocolate, slight caramel, only a hint of booze. The aftertaste is amazing - toffee, vanilla, and perfectly roasted coffee.
F: Smooth and not too rich for the style and ABV. Proper amount of carbonation.
O: The aftertaste is amazing. Similar beers have a bitter aftertaste, as you get from some chocolates and coffees. There was something strange in that as the beer sat and warmed it fell off; I don't think my palate suddenly gave way, so this was pretty curious. 641 charactershoppymcgee, Sep 17, 2015

4.24/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours black with one finger fluffy tan head. Aroma is oak and vanilla from the bourbon, chocolate, and dark fruits. The barrel comes through big time on the nose. Smells boozy, but in a good way. Taste follows the nose with barrel as a highlight. Some chocolate notes and licorice come through from the base beer. It's sweet with slight roast on the finish. I'm not getting as much dark fruits on the taste. The cream stout comes through in the mouth feel. The silky, creamy character really got my attention at first, but that didn't last through the whole glass. What it gains in creamy smoothness is lost in low carbonation and a lack of roast heft that I appreciate in expedition stout. That's being picky because this is a great beer and worth seeking out. 761 charactersdanh53, Sep 15, 2015

Poured out pitch black and had a dismal dark mocha head that dissipated rather fast.  Strong smell of bourbon, some dark espresso,some  boos, slight burnt sugar, figs, and some dark chocolate after swirled (complex.) Stong Dark chocolate and roast, a little bourbon, slight boos, Lots of vanilla in the finish with a pleasant smooth ending note.  This beer is dry and thin in the mouth with low levels of carbonation.   This is a impressive beer worth trying.  A sipper at that and one with a lot of interesting complexity.  Definitely worth picking up and trying, Cheers! 593 charactersDrinkMoreBigBeers, Sep 04, 2015

First noticed that it was quite a thin head, different from many other high ABV stouts that I've had. Rich mouth feel without being syrupy. Bourbon is well integrated with other flavors, including molasses and dark fruit. Exceptional quality stout and one I'd look to procure again. 327 charactersSGerrard, Aug 29, 2015

A- jet black, little carbonation, small light khaki head.
S- dark chocolate and bourbon are dominant.  Also some vanilla and earthy wood and some coffee or expresso.
T-  lots of smooth vanilla bourbon and mocha.  Super balanced and velvety.  Nice dry finish of wood and sweet chocolates with a hint of coffee.
M-  full bodied, but I'd have thicker stouts.  I guess that's the cream ale talking. 
O-  really great take on the style. Bells did an awesome job blending and aging this one. 516 charactersEveningCordial, Jun 01, 2015

Look - Oily black. Thin light tan head. Lacing not so much.
Smell - Bourbon. Black licorice. Sweet. Chocolate.
Taste - Bourbon/alcohol taste is very subdued. Honey and fruit. Sweet chocolate finish.
Feel - Heavy. Really no carbonation to speak of. This is what I like in a stout.
Overall - I got it! I like it better than KBS. Too bad this isn't as readily available. 398 charactersmadelfonatree, May 31, 2015

Taste is mostly the same, with the bourbon taking a backseat. Also, some dark fruits come out into play from the expedition. The mouthfeel is thinner than I like for this style. Is it what people say it is? No. is it still an amazing beer? Absolutely. 363 characterswinningwes91, May 16, 2015

Split a 12oz botttle(2013) with my wife and two of our friends to celebrate the births of our children.    Lucky for me, most of my guests didn't care too much for BA stouts, so I had the lion's share of the pour.    As complex as BCBS without being overly boozy.    Got a huge espresso nose, but not a lot in taste. 359 characterstmbgnicu, May 15, 2015

not live up to the hype 2014 poured into a Bruery Snifter dark as night.
Just slightly above average Stout high B low A at best would drink it again but not sure I would seek it out . Smell was tame, Taste was smooth but not anything that made me go wow on any level. mouthfeel once again good not great. 503 charactersmaxifunk777, May 12, 2015

Served in a snifter
Bottled March 12, 2014
It pours jet black. There is no light getting through this beer. It has an inch of mocha head that recedes leaving only spotty lacing to remind me of its presence. 
Licorice and dark fruit are noticeable in the aroma. Roasted malt in in there too.
The taste is of dark fruit, plum, raisin. It kind of has a port-like flavor to it. The dark malts are subdued. Some anise comes through on the finish.
Full mouthfeel
I have only had a 2012 prior to this. i remember loving it. This one reminds me more of a barrel aged Expedition stout. I have one 2012 left. I guess I will have to get my hands dirty and see how they compare. 687 charactersbuschbeer, May 02, 2015

4.39/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Thanks to fellow BA cvm4 for sending this bottle along in a trade. Enjoyed out of a 12 oz brown bottle with the vintage "2014" stamped on the front of the label. Poured into a 33 oz brandy snifter. Reviewing from notes after enjoying on 2/14/15.
Appearance (4.25) - A pour of moderate aggression yields a finger of caramel-brown foam that dissipates fairly quickly, leaving more of a ringlet around the edges and a spackling of lace on the sides of the glass. Beneath the head lies a dark walnut brown body with no light able to pass through except for a gentle glow of refraction right around the edges.
Smell (4.5) - The smell really makes a good impression, with notes of graham cracker, caramel and some molasses are the initial aroma, with trailing scents of chocolate and roasted malt close behind. There is a slight hint of astringent booziness, but it's faint and really only serves to cut through the sweeter aromas.
Taste (4.5) - Not quite as impressive as the aroma, but good enough that the difference is negligible, the taste isn't quite as sweet as what the smell suggested was to follow. Still notes of caramel and molasses, now complemented by vanilla and some oak, with a stronger presence from the alcohol that wasn't as prevalent in the smell. Again, bitterness comes in the form of roasted malt char and some cacao bittersweet characteristics.
Feel (4.0) - Body is on the slightly heavy side of medium, but still doesn't rise to the girth that I want to have in big imperial stouts like this one. I know the barrel-aging makes that difficult. Carbonation is low and soft, without any of the harshness that might cut through the decadence of the beer. Finish is semisweet.
Overall (4.25), a really nice barrel-aged stout and one that I would gladly drink again if it weren't pretty much a trade-only beer for me to access. However, I don't think I would go out of my way to trade for it again, as there are barrel-aged imperial stouts that are just as good, if not better, that I personally have an easier time getting my hands on. 2,055 charactersLambicPentameter, Apr 24, 2015

Creamy and smooth with lots of mellow bourbon, deep roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, and oak notes. I’ve been chasing this stout for a long time and was not disappointed. Thanks to Dan and Tom for meeting up with me. It’s nice to get to experience these beers with local members of the beer community. 413 charactersdboon, Mar 25, 2015

4.68/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A: Pours black with a one finger khaki colored head that settles down to a ring above the beer fairly quickly. Not a particularly dense looking body, but this is no Kate Moss by any means.
S: A dark, rich blend of espresso and mellow bourbon. Charred barrel, raisin, toffee and baker's chocolate. Smells absolutely incredible. So much espresso.
T: Opens with an amazing soft bourbon and dark, dark chocolate. Vanilla, light coconut, toffee, black currant and faint molasses and raisin. Tons of rich espresso throughout and the espresso and barrel notes together are fantastic. In the words of Salad Fingers: Practically Orgasmic. 631 charactersnotchucknorris, Mar 14, 2015

T: the chocolate and bourbon are up-front - bittersweet, rich, and dark; undercurrents of vanilla and molasses run throughout, accenting other impressions of espresso and anise
M: full-bodied and smooth as silk, mellow bittersweet action, slight drying on finish with a flash of char at the very end

12oz bottle split between three samplers.
Pours surprisingly translucent with no head. Smell is bourbon and lots of roastiness.
Tasteis rich bitter, with chocolate and coffee.

A: Beautifully black and almost pours like motor oil. Barely any head to speak of. 
S: Deep aroma of coffee, bitter chocolate and dark fruit. Finishes with alcohol even after 2 years of aging.
T: First sip gives way to the deep scents, revealing some tobacco and leather enveloping the dark fruit flavors. Barely any alcohol heat allowing the focus to remain on the beautiful sweet and bitter balance.
M: Heavy and thick on the palate, appropriately lightly carbonated.
O: The best way to sum up this beer is to explain that I audibly giggled after my first taste. While I would never proclaim to be the most seasoned beer enthusiast in this community (or even anywhere close) this is the best beer I've ever had, a statement I have never made before. 781 charactersTBonez477, Feb 08, 2015

The nose reveals an astonishing balance between molasses, toffee, coconut, prunes and sweet milk chocolate on the one hand, and wooden, accentuating, slightly hot barrel qualities. The barrel is easily noteable on itself, while it hits the spot by supporting the malty aromas as well, in an outstanding, intriguing way.
Tastes earthier than the aromas revealed, with toasted, bready malts, accompanied by bakers chocolate and a decent amount of whipped cream. That creamy foundation then gets extended by cane sugar, big time toffee and molasses, which blend very well into the burning, wooden alcohol. Boozy Bourbon gets replaced by big chunks of wood, very chewy, with matured coffee beans, creating a pleasant balance, preventing this successfully from becoming too sweet and boozy.
The warmer the beer gets, the more present turns the Bourbon. It provides coconut and a hint of vanilla during the opening, while it becomes quite dominant, as the sweet malt qualities hit the tastebuds. Finishes with ash, scorched malts, slightly dry, while it remains its smooth, chocolate defined mouthfeel. 1,236 charactersaleigator, Jan 30, 2015

5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had searched high and low for this beer for a few years and could not find one in a store. I finally traded for some and man am I happy I did! This beer is what Bourbon County wants to be when it grows up!
Appearance: Dark as night very little head if any. Settles quickly to a light caramel colored film around the edges of the glass.
Aroma: Jesus this beer smells so good. Lots of barrel immediately detected. Bourbon out the ass! Vanilla and chocolate maltiness dominate.
Taste: Man this just doesn't get any better really. The taste is sweet but not too cloying. Its perfectly balanced between the two base beers. Not too much barrel but you certainly detect the bourbon and the flavors that come with a bourbon barrel aged beer. Vanilla, chocolate, bourbon and oak dominant barrel finish. Mouthfeel is also velvety and oh so smooth. Perfect balance accomplished with this beer!
Overall: I have been saving this beer to try for a big number but I just felt like what the hell why not tonight! I also paired this one against the two base beers as an experiment and this is a case where the sum of the parts are better. I will say I do tend to enjoy the Double Cream better than the Expedition but I can understand where that needs to be utilized as a base ingredient. Overall this beer is layered and superb in my book. I think this is much better beer than many of its companions out there. Totally worth the effort in trading for this one! 1,450 charactershumuloner22, Jan 20, 2015

4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A smallish, dark tan head is in a big ass hurry to get moving off this pitch black brew. 
Smells quite rich and desert-like with prominent notes of milk chocolate, chocolate cake, black licorice and black cherries.  
Taste starts with deep, sweet and bitter chocolate notes followed by a touch of vinegar, an uncertain candy sweetness, obvious oak, subtle earthy hops and medicinal cherries. 
A warming alcohol cuts through a heavy, slightly syrupy body.   
An ambitious and exceptionally flavorful beer that could've ran wild but keeps it all in check. 557 charactersstephens101, Jan 16, 2015

4.11/5  rDev -8.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 42012 bottle.  
Pours a pitch black and sits still in the glass.  A delicate head quickly fades.  Aroma is intense with notes of bourbon, luscious vanilla, tobacco, charred malts, and caramelized brown sugar.  You don't have to dig deep in the glass to get a wide range of decadent aromas.   
Flavor takes on a little different approach with more of the dark fruits that is evident from the Expedition Stout portion of the blend.  A touch of chocolate, and lots of the barrel character.  Sweet at times, but not cloying with the added lingering bitterness.  Booze is fairly noticeable...even after 2 years in the bottle.  Silky feel that is thinner than I prefer.
Overall, well done.  Not a home run for me though as the flavor did not stand up to the greatness the nose brought.  Some of the espresso may have been lost in the bottle age. 838 charactersBosoxfan20, Jan 13, 2015

Aroma of dark chocolate, dried red fruits and bourbon.
Bright  creamy note of dark chocolate opened on the tongue followed by espresso, chocolate milk, vanilla, and bourbon. Roasted malt notes lingered with every sip.
Very creamy and smooth.

A:  Black with garnet highlights.  No head, light lacing.

Whilst pouring into a Bells snifter of sorts, the head is minimal, not even covering the puddle at the bottom of the vessel and quickly dispersing to the circumference of the glass....clinging for dear life.  I would consider the body medium, not quite motor oil and mildly opaque on the edges...but a dark beauty none the less.  
The nose is of melted bakers chocolate, smashed raisins and a little of that coconut aroma you get with a lot of barrel aged beers.  Can't sniff anymore, gotta taste.  
And boom goes the dynamite!  Am I drinking a beer or eating Raisinets for alcoholics? I already new this beer was going to be great, I'm looking at the giant 100 as I write this review, but I didn't think there would be so many.  The mouth feel is creamy, small flecks of booziness, vanilla, burnt brown sugar, chocolate and warm raisins. My favorite part may be the semi sweet bitterness that lingers on the back of my tongue.  
I'm in love and I can't imagine how much an already amazing beer will improve with a couple of years in the cellar. 
Cheers to great beers! 1,147 charactersTridement, Dec 10, 2014

BOTTLE: 2014 vintage. Bottled: 08/12/14. 11.4% ABV. 12 fl oz. Brown glass.
Expectations are sky high; this is currently #25 in the Top 250. Served cold; allowed to warm over the course of consumption.
HEAD: 1 finger wide. Beautifully creamy, full, and thick. Has an exquisite rich shiny complexion, which is gorgeous combined with the rich khaki colour head. Leaves a thick even coating of lacing as it recedes. Retention is excellent - ~8 minutes.
BODY: Deep dark black. Opaque. No yeast particulate or hop sediment is visible.
A special and great looking stout with apt carbonation. I can't wait for the first sip.
AROMA: Amazing bourbon barrel notes. Rich white oak, authentic vanilla (not artificial vanillin extract), barrel sugars, and toasted wood. Wow.
As amazing as the bourbon character is, it doesn't seem to eclipse the base, which brings notes of subtle dark fruit (fig and plum primarily, with subsidiary notes of date), chocolate, and subtle coffee with a kiss of roast. Pleasant cream is also noticeable, but I'm not finding the espresso mentioned on the label - as nice as the coffee is.
Constructively, I have come across stout aromas with richer more expressive chocolate and more complex roasty coffee notes. I nitpick, but it's an incredible aroma overall.
As it comes to temperature, hidden notes of marshmallow and toasted coconut begin to emerge, as well as a fleeting kiss of faint char and burnt sugar.
Moderate aromatic intensity. This evocative aroma suggests a luxuriously well-balanced beer with plenty of subtlety and complexity. Mouthwatering. Wow.
No hop profile or yeast character is detectable, nor are any off-notes.
TASTE: The open greets the drinker with notes of cream and soft bourbon. The bourbon barrel character is fantastic, boasting notes of authentic vanilla, slightly toasted white oak, and barrel sugars that remain strong throughout the beer, lending it a natural guiding cohesion. The bourbon doesn't overwhelm the base beer, but rather accents its notes of impressively subtle dark fruit (fig and plum), roasted barley, and coffee.
The coffee, unfortunately, is quite shallow and uninteresting compared to other stellar imperial stouts; more complexity, diversity, and depth of flavour is needed for the coffee note to play with the big boys.
Chocolate is similarly limited; I get some creamy milk chocolate, but it's limited in scope and intricacy. We've all had better chocolate notes in beer. As it warms, though, some fudge emerges.
The foundation is comprised of dark malts and chocolate malts, which form an easily imposed-upon neutral stout base - a blank slate into which the more interesting notes can insert themselves.
I find a glimmer of coconut which never fully resolves. And the marshmallow I thought I found in the aroma is absent here...or is it? It flirts with notes of grape and currant, but never fully commits.
Balance is nearly impeccable, with few flaws noticeable aside from a faint charred and burnt character at the bottom of the second act. There's definite complexity and nuance in this build, but I can't find the espresso promised by the label, and if we're nitpicking (as I feel we must do whenever a beer is in the Top 250), I have had more complex & intricate imperial stouts. But few feature such a well-attuned harmony of bourbon barrel and base beer notes. This tastes like a gestalt whole.
Still, this is a delicious brew of the highest quality, and I find myself drinking slowly to savor each sip.
TEXTURE: Damn. This beer just melts into the palate with incredible softness and angelic delicacy. Creamy, comforting on the palate, and fragile. Smooth and wet, enhancing drinkability. The creaminess coupled with the softness is divine, and carbonation is near perfect. It's aptly full-bodied and has ideal thickness, which is needed to support the beer's many flavours. Incredibly well executed, with superb overall presence on the palate. This is a mouthfeel that elevates a beer beyond its taste, and accentuates the notes in the flavour profile, coaxing out their nuances. Majestic. 
If not for a slight harshness brought on by burnt sugar and char in the late second act, this mouthfeel would be perfect.
OVERALL: Shockingly drinkable for its unnoticeable 11.4%. Easily one of Bell's best beers (if not THE best), and absolutely a beer that deserves its high ratings. I'm not sure I'd consider it the 25th best beer in the world, but it's a treat of a brew and avoids the common pitfalls of the style: it's not too sweet or dessert-like, it doesn't have acrid or overly bitter coffee, the bourbon barrel doesn't eclipse the base, it doesn't lack a roasted barley presence, and while it has notable complexity, it doesn't sacrifice balance to attain it.
Its main flaw is that pesky burnt/charred character.
High B+
Might easily become an A- with age. But I could never hold onto a bottle for that long; it's too good.

4.75/5  rDev +5.6%I feel very blessed to have gotten the opportunity to try this.  Thank you Tuskies
Poured into a snifter, it is just about all black with slight hints of deep walnut as light comes through.  Not much in terms of head but has whisps of lace here and there.  
Nose is all bourbon chocolate.  Very sweet and syrupy aroma and quite aromatic at that.  
The taste isn't nearly as sweet as I feared it would be.  There is a prevalent boozy, vanilla bourbon flavor with pronounced oak.  Chocolate comes in as you get that smooth transition into the maltiness of the beer.  No hops or bitterness to speak of.  Lingers nicely on the tongue.  Never becomes too sweet and syrupy.
Slightly dry in mouthfeel with almost no carbonation.  Coats the mouth pleasantly and hangs around.
A great dessert beer.  Very well balanced.  The vanilla in the oak plays well with the chocolate from the malt.  Nice even bourbon flavor throughout. 922 charactersMrIncognito, Dec 05, 2014

Pours opaque black. The thin khaki head fades to a thin film and ring on top and leaves spots of lace. 
The smell is an inviting combination of dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut, pipe tobacco and black coffee. 
The taste is of dark chocolate, black cherry, roasted (almost smoked) dark malt, vanilla, toasted coconut and bourbon. 
The texture is heavy bodied wilow carbonation. 
Hard to come by on the West Coast, I'm glad to have gotten my hands on this one. An absolute world class barrel aged imperial stout. 536 charactersFurlinator, Nov 27, 2014

4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752014 bottling poured into a small Great Lakes snifter. I just had a bottle of BCBS out of the cellar a few days ago so it will be pretty fresh in my mind for comparison. The beer pours out very, very dark, but not quite black. Carbonation is low (not uncommon and perfectly acceptable for a barrel-aged stout). I'm getting lots of dark fruit and barrel character on the nose instead of the roasty notes I expected. Plums, dark cherries, and some vanilla and bourbon notes. I also get some bittersweet chocolate notes.
The beer has a full body and a strong, complex flavor. Some sweet malt and a big hit of bourbon up front greet you first. The texture of the beer really enhances all this rich flavor. Some of the dark fruit slides in and out, but mostly it's toffee-like malt, toasted oak, and bourbon. You half expect the bourbon to intensify towards the back of the palate, but it maintains consistency of strength and never quite burns you. It lingers while the profile gradually tends toward dark chocolate and espresso, then keeps lingering on the finish after you swallow.
Very interesting beer. It has a lot of intense bourbon flavor, but never quite seems as hot as it threatens. It's much more like BCBS than KBS, in that it embraces the bourbon instead of coffee and chocolate. Spectacular beer that I hope I am fortunate enough to score again some day. 1,366 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Nov 24, 2014

Pours a black body with a very thin head. Not as boozy as expected but bourbon is strong in the flavor. Nuances of coffee and chocolate are present but this would probably open up in a few years. I will say it was very smooth and alcohol was very well hidden. 333 characterspapat444, Nov 04, 2014

A  sits black in the glass with a deep cola edge, two fingers of mocha foam sits around for a couple sips before falling leaving just a couple dots of lace
S  chocolate syrup, vanilla, bourbon, charred wood, some booze, sweetened coffee, chocolate covered raisins, prune, and a hint of smoke
T   much more charred bourbon barrel in the mouth, darker coffee and a little licorice, a pumped up boozier version of the nose and it works well for me
M  leaning towards full but thinner then expected, bubbles fluff it up a bit and a fair amount of heat on the way down, lots of roast lingering long and strong
O  well rounded and very tasty if you don't mind intense boozy barrel, need to mellow out a bit but drinking well fresh 
This needs some cellar time for sure, I could see this already great beer getting much better down the road, pretty stoked I have two more bottles Cheers alfie!!! 967 characterswordemupg, Oct 21, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.1%Had on tap at the Bryant Lake Bowl. This is a big bourbon barrel aged stout that smells and tastes like a bourbon barrel. 
It pours black as night with a dark tan creamy cap that rapidly dissipates. The beer has legs and lace.Tthe beer hits the palate with all the major  flavor groups - big alcohol, bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, sherry, caramel and the flavors delightfully linger long.
Big and chewy, the beer is a delight. 425 characterspat61, Sep 25, 2014

4.58/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52014 vintage. Pours oily dark brown with reddish highlights. Thin head that dissipates fairly quickly. Looks a bit thin in the glass. Smell is milk chocolate, toffee, dark fruit, vanilla, and bourbon...nicely complex but all in balance. Flavor starts with vanilla, then dark fruit, then toffee and chocolate before ending with a balance of roasted malts and bourbon. Wow...crazy complex beer, but subtle the whole way through...again everything is in perfect balance. Mouthfeel is a little thin with some bitterness and alcohol burn at the end...probably the only area for improvement with this beer. Overall this is one of my favorites. Not the big and bold Cherry Vanilla Coke flavor of BCBS, but one of the most balanced BA stouts I've ever had. 748 charactersMoshulu, Sep 18, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +5.6%2012 into a Hunahpu's day snifter with a friend.
A: Opaque black with minimal light coming through on edges in a copper-orange hue. Minimal delicate lacing on the top. Somewhat flat with a minimal ring of bubbles hugging the glass. 
S: fig, toffee, dark chocolate, malt, tobacco; bourbon whiskey, hints of vanilla, mild oak 
T: bitter dark chocolate; raw tobacco, charcoal;  sweet; dark fruits; toffee; egg; butter; finishes with a smooth burnt caramel
M: medium viscosity, oily, coating of mouth,; buttery, silky, lingers; a little more carbonation wouldnt have hurt 
O: Incredibly balanced and smooth with a rich blend of interesting flavors. After 2 years the beer has mellowed and accepted the char nicely without ruining the bourbon flavor or the chocolate, coffee, toffee flavors you'd hope for in a bourbon stout. Overall, a great beer that I'm very happy to enjoy. If I was able to get this beer properly aged again, I'd be happy to trade for it. Very pleased; Does not possess an overly alcoholic taste even though there are definitely notes of bourbon whiskey initially. A smooth, buttery feel that lingers provides an opportunity to experience all the flavors in this beer. Overall, it is slightly better than what I remember first tasting 2 years ago and offers some pleasantly unusual tastes compared to other barrel-aged bourbon stouts. 1,355 charactersediaz, Sep 07, 2014

12 oz bottle; Snifter
A – Jet black, thin brown head disappears almost immediately. Looks like pure motor oil.
S – Tons of vanilla, boozy warmth even on the nose. Sweet chocolate, mild oak.
T – Tons of vanilla, sweet chocolate malt notes, a hint of coffee. The burnt flavors are there, but seem to be “sweetly charred,” possible some caramelized flavors. Lots of bourbon and molasses, but very well balanced.
M – Milky, silky, very sweet. A lot of bitterness on the finish, some burnt notes.
O – This is a phenomenal, balanced, complex barrel-aged stout. My gold standard is Bourbon County, and the malt and hops here are much more balanced with the alcohol than with BCS (which is not to say I like Black Note more, just that it is more balanced.) This beer stands on its own as a fantastic example of barrel-aging. 851 charactersinfinitebruner, Aug 11, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Amazing balance of flavor, aged about six months. Dried blueberries, coffee, chocolate, oak and bourbon. Some of the barrel aged stouts can be overwhelming with bourbon barrel flavor, this is a perfect balance. The consistency is just right too, not overly syrupy or flat. It has a decent effervescence with a balanced mouthfeel. Aroma is great, but belies the complexity of the beer. 384 charactersChrisfarleywine, Aug 01, 2014

S: A big aroma of bourbon, dark fruit, and chocolate. Very enticing.
T: Tasted of bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, dark fruit (plums, raisins), vanilla, and some coffee in the finish. A massive, assertive, muscular flavor. Extremely complex and flavorful. 
M: A good amount of carbonation with a thick, chewy finish. Full-bodied.
O: Bell's seems to have a knack for making stouts (see Expedition and Java Stouts) and this one just adds to the pantheon. Not a brew for the faint of heart, Black Note is quite a robust beer and one of the best examples of the style. 752 charactersavalon07, Jul 30, 2014

Smells like whiskey, chocolate, and vanilla. The aroma is strong but not overpowering. A very nice blend.
Tastes like it smells--it's clear that this is Bell's direct response to BCBS. Whiskey and stout barley start things off, moving into a bittersweet middle of vanilla and dark chocolate, finishing off with the pleasant burn of ethanol. 
Tried this side-by-side against a regular bottle of 2013 BCBS, and Goose Island's brew was a narrow winner due its firmer body and more complex finish. The fact that Black Note gave it a run for its money is quite a compliment, though, and I look forward to sampling some more of these in the future. 724 charactersmynie, Jul 28, 2014

Aromas of sweet chocolate, tart and bright coffee/espresso, raisins/plums/dark fruits, and bourbon envelops the overall package.
Take the chocolate, coffee, dark fruits, bourbon, perfectly balanced them, and what you have is Black Note Stout.
Mouthfeel is thick and chewy, perfect for how I like my stouts!
This is a truly remarkable BBA imperial stout, really. Bell's nailed it on the head with this one and I'll be on the hunt for it again this next release season. 605 characterslarryarms847, Jul 27, 2014

A- Pours a very dark brown, settles into the glass with a near-black body and frothy, mocha-colored head. Some carbonation bubbles coast up the side of the glass and meet the head.
S- Roasted malts, barrel character including oak, bourbon, burnt sugar, toasted coconut, hint of cocoa.
T- Pretty similar to the nose, roasty malts and bourbon characteristics. More coconut, caramel and vanilla than I would have expected. Some lactose qualities with oak and booze coming through as well. 
M- Full bodied, but a bit thinner than I would have expected. Carbonation is medium with a coating, sweet and boozy aftertaste.
O- I had high hopes for this one, but was somewhat disappointed. A very good beer, but not in the same class as BCBS, Parabola and others. The flavors do not some together quite as well as others and the flavor/aroma is somewhat less than I expected. Hoping the one I have cellared will turn out better. 936 charactersstephenjmoore, Jul 22, 2014

Appearance - Dark pitch black with a nice creamy, foamy 1 inch thick head. Tons of thick lacing.
Smell - Classic bourbon aroma, with chocolate, vanilla, coffee and added sugars. Roasted malts, some smoke also. The cream stout is noticed slightly at the finish. 
Taste - First sip starts off with plenty of bourbon, along with some dark roasty malts, coffee and chocolate. The addition of the cream stout comes in after the initial blast of bourbon, and adds some sweet, creamy notes. Some dark fruits such as raisin and plum add a tart, bitterness. Vanilla is a large amount of flavor in each sip. Smoke and wood are also picked up at the finish.
Mouthfeel - Bourbon and Dark roasty malts are the dominate flavor throughout this beer. Palate gets dark fruits, coffee, chocolate and the cream stout flavors. Aftertaste is malty, woody, bourbon warm.
Overall - Excellent beer yes. Complex flavors, big, bold flavors. Is it the best beer ive ever tasted? Not at all. Honestly id prefer a simple barrel aged expedition stout over this 50/50 blend. The huge java/mocha flavor of expedition is replaced with some cream stout flavor that im not a big fan of. In all, a great beer that everyone needs to try but nothing to go crazy over. 1,256 characterswvsabbath, Jul 08, 2014

You would be hard pressed to drink a full bottle of this beer by ones self I feel. Solid 4.5 beer. 388 charactersricknelson, Jun 23, 2014

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.52014 version, it is a 12 oz. bottle poured into a tulip/snifter style glass. Liquid come out of the bottle is a cola brown color but gets dark brown as it rises in the glass. Not much in the way of highlights. Slightly darker than tan colored head, mostly small bubbles goes away after a few minutes, not much in the way of lacing. Each sip gives sort of a syrupy cling to the glass though. Decent looking beer, decent representation of the style. 
Smell is really good. Dominant feature throughout is vanilla and oak aromas from bourbon barrel aging. Outside of that there's plenty of dark roasted malts providing a nice sweet and rich chocolate characteristic with a touch of bitterness. At the end there's some candy coated dark dehydrated fruits. 
Taste is a step up. Lots of roasted malts providing the chocolate and the faintest light roasted coffee flavor; a little sweeter than I anticipated based on the smell, but in a good way. The candy/liquor coated dark dehydrated fruits (figs, raisons, dates) come through a little stronger. Broubon, vanilla and oak are obviously strong characteristics as well. Everything is meshed really well together, you can tell this is a carefully crafted beer.
Mouthfeel is probably the best part. I guess I'd say full bodied with an appropriate lasting/lingering flavor, but it doesn't feel as heavy as a full bodied beer, more like it'd be a medium body. Nice and smooth with a low medium carbonation level. Appropriate sweetness gradually moving to a warming finish, almost hot. A little bit of age could do alright to take a little heat away but I wouldn't do it more than 6-8 months, this was ready to drink now. Really drinkable, this one goes down nice and easy and is a year round bourbon barrel stout. Huge props to EasyReader for this one, you're the man! 1,809 charactersAndyAvalanche, Jun 22, 2014

 Expedition stout is far and away a better stout than Black Note. Lacked the mouthfeel, taste was overly carbonated for a Barrel Aged brew, smelled fantastic but was not in the same ball park as BCBS, KBS, or Pt5. All that being said, its a solid beer just not worth the hype in my opinion. Plan on aging a couple just in case it improves.. hopefully it does. 455 charactersHesscabob, Jun 20, 2014

Dark black appearance with a small rust-colored head dissipating quickly. Nose is intense bourbon sweetness, roast. Taste is so much bourbony sweetness in the front that really pops. Tangy on the sides. Nice roast toward the back and throughout. Just a little sourness that doesn't quite belong. Lingering oaky finish. Mouthfeel all right, not super-thick but decent carbonation. A little syrupy. Overall, a fantastic barrel-aged beer that could be thicker but tasty as all get-out. Aging it these 1.5 years certainly didn't hurt. 620 charactersfoobula, Jun 10, 2014

A- Very dark chocolate brown, near black. virtually no head to speak of, but left a nice ring around the glass, with some very light runny lacing.
S- Nice smooth bourbon up front, dark chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, some vanilles, followed by deep dark fruit.
T- Very good throughout, good smooth and not overpowering bourbon, deep chocolates, hints of dark mixed dark fruits. Very good stout flavors.
M- Thick, creamy, smooth, slick and sticky. Everything lingers on the tongue. 
O- This is a very good beer, but after reading all the reviews I was expecting more. I cant say I was let down, but not up to the super hype and the years of waiting IMO.
 Was kinda of surprised that the lacing didn't coat the glass with a bigger head, the smell is awesome and the taste is wonderful but I have had some much less expensive that comes very close or equals this one. The feel was amazing though, every stout should strive for this part.
Very glad I finally found it to try and will defiantly pick it up again at some point, just wouldn't run out and drop a lot of dollars on it next time. Very good beer and do recommend it to everyone. 1,158 charactersGryphon69, Jun 08, 2014

4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25We pop the top on a bottle of the 2012 stock (thanks Ashley P.!!), and pour into our oversized tasting snifters. It shows the deepest Tootsie pop brown, letting though a few faint rays of shimmering ruby when scrutinized intensely under direct light. The pour was delicate and produced only a few aggregates of chocolate mousse colored bubbles, but a rough swirl of the glass kicks up more of a crown. Spots of lacing are found peppered around the glass in rows. No haze or sediment is noted, and carbonation appears to be light. The aroma, right from the start, gives epic waves of buttery, warming bourbon smoothness, even when still cold at fridge temperatures. As it warms it really starts to bud, offering notes of densely roasted chocolate and brown malts, singed molasses crisp, sweet brown breadiness, rich milk chocolate creaminess, dried raisins and candied black cherries, plum juiciness, soy sauce saltiness, plastic and chemical phenols, powdered cocoa, charred oak, gentle charcoal, harsh fusel ethanol, and faint grassy hop bitterness. Our first impression is that this beer is absolutely fantastic, and lives up to the hype with everything you would hope for. As we sip, the taste begins with fusel boozy burn of bourbon and its accompanying soured oak, sweet and lactic creaminess, cloying cherry fruit juiciness, sweet chocolate, coffee, and general brown maltiness, dark plum flesh, burning stomach acid acidity, and crisply roasted espresso beans. The middle peaks with undeniable sweetness of white sugar, musk, tannic breakfast tea leafiness, slimy Muscat grape skins, cloying milk and dark chocolate syrups, ethanolic rumbles, and smoky X-mas ham. Following through the end is a blend of bitter char and light smoke, sweeter brushes of both melty nibs and powdered dark cocoa, fig, truffle and sesame oiliness, musky oakiness, gravel, heavy creamer, and a final heavy roast of the malts mixing with the fleetingly smooth sweetness of the bourbon. The aftertaste breathes of rich and dark chocolate cocoa, bittering leathers, plastic phenols, fuming smokiness, distant floral hops, black cherry and plum juiciness, burn of bourbon, cooked brown sugars, buttery pie crust, diacetyls and sweet banana esters, basement musk, and perfumed phenols. The body is medium to fully, but chewy, while carbonation is light to medium. Each sip gives excellent slurp, smack, cream, froth, and pop, with the lips left speckled with quickly drying residual sugars. The mouth is coated and left sapped with those same sugars. This remains for quite some time, eventually giving way to a surprisingly mild tannic pucker focused towards the far back of the palate. The abv is appropriately warming, and the beer sips wildly slowly, as you’re not quite sure if you’ll ever see her again, and want to savor every last minute you have left with her.
Overall, the most enjoyable aspect of this brew was its flavoring. The wood and the bourbon exemplified here are exceptional, and scary mellow with the additional two years they had on them. There are no real shockers with this beer. What we mean by that is you kind of get what you expect, without any major surprises or curveballs. We know it is becoming ridiculous with all of the things that are showing up labeled “barrel-aged” this, or “oak-aged” that, but this guy is one of the original heavy hitters, up there with the likes of Bourbon County. We try not to compare, but they have a good deal of parallels. The buttery diacetyls shine, and the bourbon remains sweet and rich throughout. What we get here, specifically, is the sweetness of chocolate from the base beer, but this also adds a needed bitterness on the tail end, keeping things balance the whole way through. This is the best beer we’ve had from Bell’s to date, as we’ve not yet been introduced to their barreling program, but we are ultimately happy and pleased with the final result. This beer deserves all the recognition it gets, so if you find some, cherish it, and be sure to share it with some close, like-minded friends who can really appreciate what they’re embarking on. 4,122 charactersTheBrewo, May 31, 2014

Poured a deep walnut color with very little head and thin lacing made up of tiny bubbles. Very boozy nose, there was no hiding the bourbon. Also hints of cocoa and coffee in the nose. The taste came in two layers, first a mellow milk chocolate that then bloomed into a roasty acidic Irish coffee that left a nice burning sensation on the way down. The mouthful was thin and light on the tongue.
Overall, a very enjoyable experience that required ordering a second. Not quite up to the level of KBS or BCBCS in my opinion, but a great beer. 667 charactersshangwang, May 31, 2014

4.12/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Appearance is a very rich, dark coffee black with nice lacing.
Nose is initially alcohol with sweet soy and burnt sugars and roasted chicory. Savory finish.
Taste is sweet and smooth malt and dark chocolate, with tart alcohol that fades into a pucker.
Mouthfeel is meaty, full, and smooth without much carbonation. Alcohol throughout.
Overall, it has lots of unique character, but the alcohol is a lot, which becomes distracting unless it is a dark, cold winter night. 472 charactersdorianmarley, May 29, 2014

4.34/5  rDev -3.6%look: 3.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25This is a great beer. I got it in a trade and poured into a snifter.
The pour was nothing special. Typical stout black and the head was just average. It's barrel aged so I expect a small amount of head and it delivered about a half finger worth. Good enough.
Smell was great. I pick up the bourbon and a lot of chocolate. It reminds me a lot of a Zhukov even though Zhukov isn't BA.
Mouthfeel is the best part about this beer. After my first sip I looked at the glass is amazement. It's incredibly silky smooth. One of the best I've ever had in this regard. Incredible.
The taste is great. Incredibly chocolaty with a good bourbon flavor. It's as if someone made a chocolate candy with bourbon infused. You get a slight alcohol presence from the barrel but it's not overtly so. It's nice.
Overall I was impressed. After the pour I was a little skeptical if it lived up to the hype but after drinking this beer I must say it's worth it. I would totally buy this next time it's released no problem. 1,001 charactersBrew_Bro, May 25, 2014

A. Black with a two finger tan head that recedes to an 1/8 inch covering. 
S. Bourbon, vanilla, oak, toffee, coffee, caramel, creme brulee ... holy shit! 
T. Vanilla, oak, caramel, toffee, dark roast coffee and a hint of booze. No hop bitterness detected - could use just a touch on the finish to clean things up on the back end. 
M. Creamy and full bodied without coming across syrupy and gloppy. 
O. Barrel-aged beers generally don't excite me (see my BCBS review). That said this beer is very enjoyable and very well made. Its richness and creaminess never gets tiring like so many BA beers. Its alcohol, though present, never gets in the way. Well done. 675 charactersbound4er, May 24, 2014

Picked up a 2012 bottle in trade and poured into a tulip glass. One finger of caramel-colored head and a very dark body. Bourbon scent was quite mild and did not overtake the initial flavors of dark chocolate, roasted malt, and dried fruit. The creamy texture pushed this one over the edge for me. Flavors continued to develop as the beer warmed. 469 charactersDawgboned37, May 20, 2014

5/5  rDev +11.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I've always loved Expedition stout and since I've heard they did a barrel aged version I couldn't get away from wanting this beer. It's been a long journey and thanks to a local Pittsburgh distributor I finally came into contact with this one. 
Pours a pitch black hue with creamy tan head floating above the head, let me tell you about this BA version of Expedition fine lacing left evenly around the chalice. 
Aromatics dark malts charred oak, with vanilla and whiskey rich character...also has a toasted marshmallow note with booze that is much needed for a dark imperial stout called Black Note. The finish is full of caramelized dark sugars and it so nice and full of nearly burnt malts. Smells so good, it's amazing what a whiskey barrel can do to a stout, I'm glad New Holland tried to put whiskey into some stout barrels to see if the inverse were true. Each time I take a sniff I get hints of umami from soy sauce tainted meat and spicy notes of ginger impregnated in a marinade of chicken breast. 
Flavor has milky creamy dark chocolate notes, flowing with heat of bourbon barrel aging effects, charred oak, and rich vanilla booze infused stout character. Dark fruit with plums and over ripened fruits that are soaked in alcohol infusing through the palate with each sip. In the backend I definitely get that meaty soy sauce, umami character that I've come to know and love salty/sweet and a bit of braised beef or grilled tuna approaches the palate. I believe either of these would be great pairings amongst this beverage.
Mouthfeel full bodied creamy texture seduces your palate, even slow bubbling carbonation what a great experience that is too be had by all lovers of great barrel aged stouts. Salty sweet combination reigns supreme on the palate and leaves me wanting more and more.
Overall, one of the best barrel aged creations I've ever had...light years ahead of the complexity of KBS and Arcadia Shipwrecked BBA beers. I will hold onto the rest of the six pack I have left. 1,999 charactersWVbeergeek, May 20, 2014
4.8/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.752014 version poured into an Ikea snifter. The liquid is totally black, with some mahogany hues on the edges when you hold it up to light. The pour produces a nice dark brown, nearly purple cap that leaves some nice lace on the side.
Dark chocolate is the main aroma I get on the nose, followed by plums, bourbon, and vanilla. There are some nice spice flavors as well - maybe cinammon? Like a delicious, complex chocolate cake. There's a slight alcohol burn without being solvent. And it's decadent and desert-y without being cloying. Doesn't smell like much at first, but lots of smells come out as it warms to room temperature.
Flavor follows the nose, and lives up to it. On the palate, it's everything from the nose mixed together perfectly, and I feel like you get different flavor notes with every sip. Hazelnuts come out for me as it warms. The aftertaste is chocolate, plums, and raspberries, with an ever-so-slight bitterness that compliments it perfectly.
Body is the right amount of thickness without being syrupy. Unfortunately, I find it pretty over-carbonated. :( It's much better after I've let it sit for a while and let most of the bubbles run out. Before that, I feel like the carbonation impedes the flavor. Still, I guess it's better over- than under-carbonated, because at least this way I can wait and the problem fixes itself!
Overall, it gives BCBS a run for its money - it has a pretty similar flavor profile, and is much less sweet, which I think is an improvement over BCBS. Still, the over-carbonation is disappointing, but that's really the only flaw I can find in this beer, and, like I said, it's pretty much the best flaw you can have because it fixes itself. It's an incredible desert beer without being cloying, and the alcohol doesn't quite kill you. This is pretty much exactly what I want in a BBA Imperial Stout. 1,854 charactersMasterfulIdiot, May 20, 2014

Unfortunately the store label covered some of the dating but it looks like 3-12-14. Deep, dark, black body with a very small dark tan head. The head dissipates almost immediately, as expected for the high abv.
One of the better aromas I've had from a stout. Strong vanilla, caramel with light notes of roasted malt and bourbon. Light licorice note as it warms.
Delicious! The bourbon is much more noticeable in the brew than other barrel aged beers I've had, and that's good! Plenty of the aforementioned vanilla, caramel, and roasted malt with light added notes of molasses and a citric finish - light orange peel.
The mouthfeel is a bit lighter than expected but it does not detract from the overall experience. If I could get a few bottles of this and try it as often as I've had KBS and BCBS, it might be a tough fight to pick a winner. 886 charactersFanofHefe, May 19, 2014

Appearance: Pours with a dark brown head of about a finger on an aggressive pour. The head settled in to a thin later across the top while drinking. Sits jet black in the glass with above average active carbonation for the style. 
Smell: Potent bourbon front greets the drinker. Vanilla, oats, and barley are well integrated with the bourbon front. bright oak, cherries, and dried fruits make up the body. Some mossy hops round out the aroma. 
Taste: Oak wins out on the front with a mixture of dried fruit and smokey bourbon. The bourbon opens up more on the body with the additions of vanilla and dark chocolate. There are roasted dried coffee flavors on the back end. Interesting combination of vanilla malt sweetness and bitter coffee grounds. 
Mouthfeel: Carbonation is light and suits the heavier tones of this brew. Rich coffee, vanilla, and bourbon textures left on the palate long after drinking.
Overall: Love the vanilla tones of this beer. Bourbon character is potent and meshes well with the chocolate, coffee, and dried fruits. Would be interested to see how this beer ages, drinks really great right now. 1,137 charactersKFBR392, May 17, 2014

The pour is majestic - a velvety jet black that immediately starts forming a beautiful head on the glass. The head is mocha in color and quite thick and foamy.
Aromas are sweet and spicy - predominantly bourbon, vanilla and chocolate. There is a hazelnut presence as well. The taste mirrors the aromas quite well, its hot/boozy as it touches your tongue and as the alcohol fades, vanilla, hazelnut and chocolate take over. There is a cinnamon taste that reminds me of spiced rum as well. The finish is sweet and there's a mildly bitter aftertaste that lasts several seconds.
The mouthfeel is thick although not quite to the point that I would describe it as chewy. Carbonation is very light.
Overall this is a fantastic beer that's deserving of the hype it receives. Beautiful example of a BBA stout - reminds me of BBPt5. 952 charactersHoppySeb, May 16, 2014

A: Poured from the bottle into a Piraat tulip/snifter-type glass. Body is inky jet black with only a hint of head on top - which then disappears immediately anyway, leaving behind absolutely no lace. 
S: Bourbon, molasses & vanilla. Quite pleasant nose.
T: Pretty much follows the nose, with bourbon dominating, some molasses and a lot of vanilla. As it warms I note some dark fruits (black cherries come to mind) and even licorice on the aftertaste. High-ABV (11.4%) is noted more as warmth on the belly than as heat on the palate - a neat trick for a beer of this strength and considering the bourbon. Also as it warms up I'm getting more general roastiness cutting through the bourbon. Oh and the ABV is definitely working its wonders, buzz-wise.
M: Full-bodied, heft-wise, and fairly slick in feel, though as it warms up the carbonation seems to activate itself and cut through that slick feel. . . .
O: Real nice. I'd love to do a blind tasting with this, Goose Island Bourbon County Stout and Founders KBS. This one is heavier on the vanilla/molasses side of things, while others have more roasty malt to balance the bourbon. 1,218 charactersKendo, May 16, 2014

T - wow. This is awesome. Roasted barley, dark chocolate, boozy bourbon, dark fruit - faint blackberry, blueberry, plum; oak, vanilla, cream
F - full bodied, sweet and sticky, super creamy, heavily boozy but that was expected

Pour had a thickness to it, brown in color, pours into a dark brpwn with a small dark tan head that built up then dissipated shortly after to minimal remnants
Vanilla, bourbon, fruity deep sweet, alcohol, hints at dark fruit
Taste is incredible wow didn't know what 100 meant but ok ok I see now. Just everything good is there in the taste. Vanilla, molasses, bourbon, warming booziness, caramel, tootsie roll, spicy warmth that builds and has a perfect close to a dry finish. Dark malts, chocolate, has a nice bitter element, sweet.
Mouthfeel is very smooth yet kinda sticky with great finish, can carry the weight of this one

Review from notes, 4/18/14
Appearance: Dark, deep brown - pours with a wispy, light brown head, leaves some nice spots of lacing
Smell: Huge chocolate and some nice bourbon - smells very, very rich - big chocolate malts, with burnt and roasty notes, and some some caramel - some dark fruits and a ton of bourbon - chewy caramel, chocolate cake - decadent to say the least
Taste: Even bigger than the aroma - big, chewy malts - sweet caramel, molasses, and dark, roasty malts - chocolate in all forms, with semisweet chocolate, dark chocolate, and some milk chocolate - lots and lots of bourbon, but this mostly works - woody with some booze, demands to be sipped
Mouthfeel: On the full side of medium, or the light side of full - adequate carbonation, smooth
Overall: More appealing than a brown note
This was a beast. It was bigger than I expected. At least an hour should be devoted to sampling this beer, even if you split the bottle. It a bit bourbon-heavy, but I would try this again. 1,029 charactersangrybabboon, May 08, 2014

Also I thought this was pretty thin in mouthfeel compared to other world class BA stouts. It was fantastic, all the dark chocolate, fig, a good balance of bourbon, just a little thin for my liking when I'm drinking a desert beer.
Other than that it is a really good beer, taste, appearance, smell all fantastic. 432 charactersbcp5296d, May 06, 2014

Smell: Smells to me like chocolate and some whiskey. Very chocolately. 
Taste: Boom! Huge sweet chocolate and lots of fruits. I get a lot of cherry here, but its got that dark fruity taste that Expedition has. Tons of sweet chocolate and a nice bitterness to finish. I love the interaction between the chocolate and fruit. The bourbon is not overwhelming, and it finished with just a bit of nuttiness. Love how this tastes. Hugely different than I remember from the 2012 batch.
Mouthfeel: It's light but creamy. I feel the carbonation is perfect. Not as thick as some which I enjoy.
Overall: What an awesome experience. I just loved the taste and that fruit chocolate nuttiness going on. Crafted perfectly. 802 charactersfastenoughforphish, May 04, 2014

3.8/5  rDev -15.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42014 vintage. Batch # 12811. 12oz bottle poured into a snifter. Pours black with a little light getting through; small khaki head that fades leaves solid lacing and retention. The aromas are full of milk chocolate and bourbon. Smells pretty typical for the style. The flavors are good, but leave me wanting more. Lots of milk chocolate giving it a sweetness along with some dark chocolate giving it a bitterness. Lots of dark fruits in the mix. Maybe some black cherries and some raisins. Some vanilla. Black coffee is there. Some oak/wood notes. Slightly spicy. The bourbon is there and isn't overwhelming at all, but there's a very subtle warmth in the finish. The alcohol basically goes unnoticed, but there's hints of booze that pop up every once in awhile. Mouthfeel is full-bodied with moderate carbonation. I was expecting for it to have that thick motor oil/milkshake mouthfeel, but it's not quite on that level. It's still creamy and fluffy though. This is ultimately easy to drink, but makes a nice sipper.
This is a nice offering from Bell's. I missed the 2012 bottle by 5 minutes, so I made sure I snagged a bottle this year. It's very good stuff, but ultimately left me underwhelmed. I guess maybe my expectations were just too high considering Bell's is one of my favorite breweries and the hype that always surrounded this beer. 1,344 charactersBB1313, May 04, 2014

This one pours dark and opaque, as I would expect given how light-repelling Expedition was. Small, mocha-colored head that recedes quickly, with a little bit of lacing. Surprisingly, there's a good bit of visible carbonation.
Smells strongly of dark fruits, with some dark chocolate, and mild, smooth bourbon.
The taste is similar, and pretty great. This is one of the dark fruity-est stouts I've ever had, just a ton of sweet, but earthy fruit flavors- currants, raisins, cherries, plums, etc. Some bitter dark chocolate, and subtle bourbon that folds in nicely with the other flavors.
Creamy, smooth moutfeel, despite the appearance, there's not much carbonation noted on the palate. Unfortunately, the body seems a bit thin for a bourbon barrel aged imperial stout- maybe I'm spoiled by other one's I've tried, but the body just doesn't quite stack up. A disappointing tick against a pretty damn good beer.
This is one is definitely one of the best BA stouts, but it just misses the top tier due to the slightly thin body. If it was thicker and more viscous, it would be near perfect. The dark fruit flavor in this is just amazing. 1,207 charactersGreesyFizeek, May 03, 2014

Pours a deep dark brown with ruby edges. The half finger of head dissipates quickly. The bourbon notes on the nose are soft and almost sweet. This offering has a hearty body that holds up well to the bourbon. Also, the bourbon flavor is just right - not too hot. The roast profile might be a bit muted, but that would be my only criticism of this gem. 526 characters57md, May 03, 2014

A pitchblack, viscous-looking beer that from the pour produces a thin, maybe half a finger thick, dark khaki-colored head. What little head there is persists well and forms a ring around the edges of the glass above the body.
Burnt caramel, oak, and barrel are what my nose finds and I want to say this is bourbon-barrel aged (I haven't read too much into this beer). The aroma is similar to BCBS with vanilla hints and a pungent malt presence that smalls gooey. I do get a hint of hops but not much.
Nice! Lots of oaky spice and a thick molasses flavor. It"s sweet and caramelly, but I get some hop spice towards the end.Oak and other bourbon-like notes begin becoming more apparent, as do the malt's flavors.
This brew has a spritely effervescence that makes its presence felt through the thick creaminess and viscosity. It's sweet, has a bit of a bite, and a tiny hint of bitterness, but what is most notable is how well buried the alcohol is. 
This is an excellent brew. So many flavors work their way through and are joined my what seems like just as many sensations. I suppose my only qualm is that this resembles BCBS in numerous ways, yet is about 2.5 times the price per bottle. 1,286 charactersONovoMexicano, May 01, 2014
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Funky Buddha Brewery snifter. Back label says PKGD 03/12/14. Celebrating my 900th review with this miracle of a gift provided by mjshearer1.
A- Pours a fully opaque black color with a 1/2 inch light brown head that retains a bit before becoming a thick ring around the edge of the glass and a bubbly center patch of surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing leaves a thin jagged ring behind.
S- Big rush of dark roasted malt with heavy notes of dark chocolate, bourbon and molasses. Also some caramel and vanilla undertones. Booze fume is there but works well with the rest of the aroma.
T- Initial dark chocolate comes across subtly and then the barrel creeps in and brings a bit more intensity as well as some vanilla sweetness. Wonderful black coffee aftertaste brings the profile around full circle. Additional notes of raisin and more molasses. So drinkable for the ABV and yet the flavors linger good and long so that they can be savored by only sipping sporadically. As it warms, it somehow becomes more sweet and even less boozy, however the dark roast becomes even more prevalent making it a bit more bitter.
M- Quite creamy and viscous plus there's some sticky residue in the afterfeel. Medium-low carbonation and the fullest of bodies.
O- A great BBA beer that's full-on with the bourbon presence but not so much that it becomes too hot or one-dimensional. Though I still think BCBS and KBS are both above it, this one is certainly a major contender and deserves to be appreciated for its own unique qualities. 1,534 charactersImmortale25, May 01, 2014

A- Black with hints of coffee brown, thin khaki head
S- chocolate, bourbon, vanilla. Pretty heavy on the bourbon. Reminds me of a chocolate-covered vanilla wafer cookie. Some roast and oak barrel notes
T- heavy coffee flavors, rather bitter, hints of chocolate. Oakey-barrelly notes.
M- Excellent balance of thickness and dryness. Really nice
O- A masterful creation. Bell's best beer, next to Hopslam (which I love). More grown-up (sorry) than KBS, and more finnesse than BCBS. Seems less sweet than either. But the sweetness that is there plays off of the aggressive bourbon flavors, and keeps them in check. This vintage may improve, but in my opinion, it is ready to drink. I prefer this to KBS, but I also prefer BCBS to this- by just a nudge. Another outstanding contribution to the genre of barrel-aged stout. 858 charactersDubbelTrubbel, Apr 29, 2014

I have to say that I LOVED this beer. It changed so much as it warmed. First espresso and vanilla, then big, bouzy bourbon, finishing chocolate and roasty as it approached room temp. Not as viscous as I expected, which was surprisingly refreshing. Lingered on the tongue for a while, but not heavily (make sense? I hope so).

A great beer but another example of a "world-class" brew that doesn't quite live up to the hype once I get a chance to try it.
Fairly thick pour into the glass but not the thickest beer I've ever seen. More bourbon in the nose than what I got once I tasted it. The roastiness that is characteristic of Expedition Stout was here as well. It helped make it a fairly complex beer once the roasted malts and bourbon blended together but I may actually prefer this one with a little more age on so some of the roasted flavor could fade away. 
Would like the opportunity to try a fresh one just to see what changes happen in the 1 year+ that this bottle sat for. 702 charactersmjpolzin, Apr 27, 2014

 Awesome bourbon aroma that carries right through to the taste with a perfect finish. Smooth velvety drinking like a cream or milk stout with just the right amount of roastiness and bourbon flavor. The body can't be overstated for a barrel aged beer. 
This is hands down the best barrel aged stout I have ever tasted to date. Significantly better than KBS. Makes my top 3 beers in general right now. Hard to believe people liked the '12 version better - can't even fathom much improvement.
 Gotta admit, I have been disappointed by Bell's offerings overall. Not bad, but never had anything special other than aged Expedition, until now. If you don't like bourbon all that much, I wouldn't recommend. If you don't like a strong coffee profile/presence, I would. 915 charactersWesMantooth, Apr 24, 2014

4.46/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.52014. Poured into a tulip glass. Pours black with a mocha film on top and a few bubbles around the rim. The smell is very potent. Coffee, chocolate, toffee, licorice and bourbon. Strong bourbon and barrel taste up front. Darks fruits come through nicely, especially at the end. Nice alcohol burn to go along with it. Huge flavor on this one. Very creamy mouthfeel with a dry, somewhat bitter coffee/licorice aftertaste. Another great bourbon barrel beer, although I prefer a couple others to this. 497 charactersMikeypnh, Apr 22, 2014

- Pours like motor oil, thick and black, with small amount of dark foam.
- Smells awesome with notes of coffee, sweet toffee and bourbon with fruit notes in the background. Not an overly intense nose, but interesting and pleasant.
- Taste is magnificent. Layers of coffee and oaky bouborn,with a charred/roasty bitterness that persists to the finish and is balanced against a nice stone fruit sweetness. Great medium -thick mouthfeel. This beer is just so well balanced and complex.
- Overall a superb beer which has a lot going on, but nothing is overpowering. Flavors and smell are great, the body and complexity are quite good and is just extremely well balanced.
IMO, much better than KBS. More complex than BCBCS, more balanced than BCBS. BCBS may still be my favorite of these, especially if aged a few years. 832 charactersdeschutes_fan, Apr 21, 2014

Pours a translucent dark brown, black in the class with a fizzy dark mocha head. Aroma of bitter dark chocolate and barrel - char, vanilla, oak, some bourbon. Notes of mocha and dark roasted coffee as well. 
Very good barrel aged stout, however missing a lot of the richness and depth of flavor that expedition has. Very little dark fruits, thinner body, and a lighter pour as well. 389 characterstimc100, Apr 20, 2014

A: Pours a pitch black with a small khaki head. Very little lacing.
S: Overwhelmingly bourbon. Hints of chocolate, malts, maybe some vanilla. Not a very complex smell but enjoyable..
T: This is where Black Note makes its mark. Wow! Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, toffee, a bit of fruit just very well blended. Beautiful taste!
M: Very creamy, almost like drinking a stout milkshake. Nice!
O: An extremely good BBA stout. #1? Probably not, I can think of a couple better but I thoroughly enjoy this beer and definitely worth the hype! 585 charactersJayCheG, Apr 19, 2014

T - Layers and layers of flavors - chocolate, vanilla, coffee, fruity, booze, oak, warming alcohol. Velvety mouth feel, rich and creamy, each drink coats and warms on the way down. 
O - This is an amazing brew where the actual brew meet and exceeds the hype and expectations. I was able to secure one of these with the limited release and DAMN I want to get my hands on a few more. Truly a world class beer. 630 charactersandrewjraab, Apr 19, 2014

A. Poured jet black with a fine bubble amber head that retreats to an amber rim. Slight effervescence. Not especially thick (but maybe the serving temp is a factor).
S. Awesome. Some dark roasted malts, toffee, vanilla, dried figs, and BOURBON.
T. The taste certainly follows the nose. Dark roasted malts, bourbon soaked oak, vanilla, figs. Minor notes of coco and coffee. Some sweetness from the aging but not overpowering or negative. A little dusty. Not hot at all.
M. Way smooth. Moderate carbonation - especially for the style. Heavy body. Slightly oily.
O. Well done. A super well crafted ale, top to bottom. They just brought it from the cellar and threw it directly on the shelf. I went for it without refrigeration, but if a beer could hold up to that, this is the one. This is not boozey beyond what is expected. I feel perfection is unattainable but one cannot get any better in the taste and mouthfeel metrics. 1,005 charactersmacher0, Apr 18, 2014
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottled Dec 28, 2012.
Beer is jet black with a small tan head.
Nose is very good. A nice blend of bourbon scents (oak, vanilla, bourbon itself), dark fruits, and chocolate. The nose reveals a well blended barrel-aged stout, with the barrel being obvious but not overwhelming.
Taste lives up to the promise of the nose. There is nothing unexpected here: it has all the flavours one would expect from a bourbon-barrel aged stout. What makes it great is two things: (i) the base beer is of a very high quality; and (ii) the flavours are very well proportioned. Bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark fruits, chocolate and some roasted malt are all there, and all harmonious with one another. 
Mouthfeel is also great. Full bodied, moderate to low carbonation level and very very smooth. Despite the high ABV, it drinks quite easily. Alcohol hear is there but surprisingly muted for what it is.
Overall, terrific. Absolutely a first rate BBA stout. 938 charactersjrenihan, Apr 18, 2014

A- Dark as night, not as thick as some other stouts and around the edges of the glass light can get through. Minimal lacing and head on this one
S - The nose is fantastic here on this one... reminds me a lot of BCBS but with more dark fruits on the nose. Huge bourbon nose followed by vanilla chocolate and figs
T - dark fruits on the mouth, figs and dates dark chocolate and lots of bourbon on the finish
M - Medium bodied with more carb than i expected

Location: DiCicco's Ardsley
Glassware: Tulip
Appearance: Pours black as black can be. A modest produced next to no head. What little carbonation there was had a light caramel color. There is a large viscous ring that surrounds 
Aromatics: The beer starts with a mouth watering bourbon smell Smooth flavors like vanilla, caramel, toffee. Stronger flavors like bitter chocolate, coffee and molasses. 
Flavor: Starts cold with a huge bourbon flavor that nearly over takes over the beer. As the beer warms it starts to find its balance and you find new flavors like the dark fruits, prunes maybe some raisins. 
Mouthfeel: The beer hides the alcohol very well but ultimately it finds it's way to hang on the lips. 722 charactersKornWallace, Apr 16, 2014

Nice look - very black but looks a little thin for BBA stout of 11.5%. Smell is absolutely incredible. It doesn't get much better than this. Tons of suger and vanilla, good balance of caramel, chocolate and bourbon. Taste goes right along with the nose and is possibly one of the smoothest and most balanced BBA stout I have come across. It is certainly up there with BCBS and with less in your face bourbon to go along with it. Black Note has truly lived up to all of the hype and then some. 540 charactershops202, Apr 16, 2014

O: Quite good despite the dominant barrel and chocolate flavors. Would like to see if aging a few of these bring out the flavors I got in the aftertaste. Mouthfeel was the star of the show for me. 722 charactersblankenhoney, Apr 13, 2014

A: dark black, tan head. dissipates into a rim around the perimeter. 
S: Bourbon heavy. some nice chocolate and vanilla notes are present with roasty malty, but bourbon dominates. 
T: thankfully much less bourbon heavy taste. it had the girth and complexity of expedition with a smooth mellow creamy sweet note from the double cream. they complement each other beautifully. chocolate, vanilla, oak, and toffee flavors. the finish had a lot of Bourbon heat though. only drawbacks are the bourbon heavy finish and a little too sweet. 
M: Perfection. thick and creamy and full with a nice feel throughout. 
O: A real treat. Not heads and shoulders above the other BBA stouts but comes in close to the top. might not be worth all the hype and might be too bourbon heavy but still enjoyed thoroughly.
Re-reviewing this after opening a 2014, comparing side by side with 2012.
Definitely still a bourbon-heavy nose is in the fresh version, while 15 months in the cellar calmed that down in the aged version. 2014 is boozy with a lot of barrel characteristics. 2012 is boozy as well but better integrated barrel character. 2014 is prickly, and thin while 2012 is smooth but still a little thin. Overall I'm not sure I agree with my high marks on this fresh, but the aged version is drinking nicely right now. Regardless, I think there is way too much hype surrounding this. There are equal BBA stouts without the craze and price that are attached to Black Note. 1,565 charactersMCain04, Apr 13, 2014

O:Very good. Well balanced. Slightly bitter aftertaste. I believe some aging would improve this beer nicely. Definitely improves as it comes up to room temperature. Bottle was taken from basement which was probably around 45-50 degrees. 812 charactersdid3376, Apr 13, 2014

It poured dark brown with a wisp of an off white head that receded almost instantly. Smelled of whiskey/booze, hints of dark chocolate, dark fruits like raisin or prune, roasted malts in the background. Taste was interesting. A big punch of whiskey up front, then mellowed out into dark chocolate, and a bit of tang from the dark fruits. It's wonderful on the tongue. Finishes dry with a nice warming sensation. Makes you want to keep sipping this. I thought this tasted very similar to Blackout or BA Siberian. It's on the thinner side for a stout. 610 charactersDavepoolesque, Apr 11, 2014

T: Big bourbon flavors up front. Roasted malts, dark chocolate, vanilla, and cherry.
M: Thick and creamy. Coats the tongue nicely. Drinks way too easily for the ABV.

About an 1/4 inch of espresso colored head that vanished very quickly.
Its as dark as midnight,when poured its a lil thinner then oil.
It smells of coffee,bourbon and vanilla....the best smells that comes from beer IMO.
Taste is the same as smell,AMAZING ..although I prefer some more bourbon I understand the 2 years it aged it deff calm the bourbon flavor allot.Mouthfeels is quiet smooth and not very chewy as allot of BA beers are.
Overall one of the better BA beers Ive had up to date....Highly recommended. 555 charactersBubalooBrewMaster, Mar 31, 2014

A: Pitch black with a minimal amount of tan head that dissipates quickly. No lacing, doesn't seem to 'stick' to the glass like most do to some extent.
S: Slight booze and roasted malt are most up front. Then chocolate, molasses, vanilla, and coconut.
T: Even better than it smells. Roasted malt, chocolate, molasses, vanilla, pepper, and best of all, a nice mellow bourbon that's not so in your face like many other examples. I swear I also pick up just a trace of cherry in there. Very nice!
M: Not as viscous as some, med-heavy body. Creamy and silky smooth, also slick and oily. Carbonation is very low, but not quite flat.
O: Way more drinkable than it should be. A beautifully crafted stout with tons of complex flavor that meets the hype. So glad I picked up 1/2 a case! 812 charactersd5001986, Mar 30, 2014

Pours jet black very little head has solid legs like a good wine. The aroma has bourbon, vanilla, almond, roasted malt and almost a Dr. Pepper sort of vibe. Vanilla leads on the first taste, very creamy, and then bourbon and dark chocolate. The mouthfeel is rich but not heavy, you get a creamy texture from the cream stout element. Overall this is a wonderful beer and worth the hype. I have had this before in a bottle and it's maybe even a bit more enjoyable on draft. 523 charactersunclejazz, Mar 27, 2014

Gobs of bourbon in the nose, with notes of vanilla, toasted coconut, chocolate, licorice, coffee and roasted malt with it. A lot going on in the aroma of this beer!
The bourbon is not as assertive on the palate as it was on the nose, but it is most certainly there.  With the bourbon comes vanilla, licorice, and toasted coconut. At 11.5%, the alcohol is very well hidden. The bourbon lasts a long time. Starts sweet and finishes slightly bitter. The palate is as complex as the aroma. This is one silky smooth beer, it's got a big body with almost no carbonation. Overall, one of the finest examples of a BA stout I've ever had! 685 charactersJohnG190, Mar 20, 2014

DEEP vanilla caramel aroma. Oaky. Robust. Nicely faded coffee. High heat burn, but it's damn nice. 
Lots of caramel, vanilla, robust, strong aroma. Smooth, super drinkable. Low (perfect) carbonation. Sweetness is low; 70% chocolate. Bitterness is non-existent. Nearly perfect flavors. Slight rubber aftertaste on the very backend. Sweetness is perfect. Flavors are great!!! Prickly carbonation. 
Yep, this one meets expectations. Knocked out of the park, flavors are exception. Feel could be slightly improved. Well blended. Complex. Highly recommended, hope to try again sometime. 688 characterschugalug06, Mar 09, 2014

A: pitch black, inch tan head. looks like a delicious imperial stout
S: the smell is a little off-putting to me. kind of a syrupy soy smell that i got from uncle jacobs. not bad, just not a smell that appeals to me personally.
T: so rich and complex. milk chocolate. caramel. vanilla. a sort of fig-like jammy fruitiness. licorice. obvious strong hop profile perfectly balanced out with a very rich but not overpowering sweetness. bourbon character is very subtle, but i dont miss a stronger presence. such a great balanced brew. delicious.
M: very fullbodied and an almost creamy carbonation. very effervescent for such a thick stout. absolutely perfect feel for a big stout.
O: dont care for the smell, but past that, its as good an imperial stout as ive had. 792 charactersPhatAtUT, Feb 28, 2014

Virtually zero head, but nice beige/tan collar. Zillions of tiny bubbles coat the edges, but lacing is minimal and not at all sticky. Nose was subtle, but sexy -- bourbon, coffee, dark chocolate, and vanilla hints compete with one another. The palate is where this stout really displays it's showcase qualities -- bourbon and chocolate dominate. Reminds me of a less syrupy sweet version of BCBS and/or a less boozy version of Parabola. Roasted coffee and vanilla make appearances as well. Great finish and mouthfeel. If you don't love this stout, then you obviously have your head up your coo-loo. 699 charactersJohnParadee, Feb 22, 2014

S - Bourbon hits the nose initially , followed by dark fruits, oak, bitter chocolate and hint of vanilla
T - Almost like the nose, bourbon hits the tongue immediately followed by tons and tons of chocolate. This is a chocolate bomb. Dark fruit follows with hints of vanilla. A roasty coffee goodness lingers on the tongue afterwards. 
M - Lots of carbonation for a BA stout. I wish it was a little bit less. Thick viscosity as expected that coats your mouth. 
O - Delicious beer that I will definitely try to get more of. Very nice to have in the cellar. 678 charactersmikul93, Feb 18, 2014

The aroma is bourbon, oak, vanilla, dark chocolate, hints of dark fruit (cherry and dried plums), coffee.
The flavor hits in the front of sweet and dark chocolate, molasses, and vanilla. There's hints of coconut and dark dried dark cherry and plum as well. Bourbon flavor hits throughout. The finish is of sweet roasted coffee and drying oak.
The mouthfeel is very full and bold at first and falls off reasonably quickly by the end of the beer.
This beer changes throughout with temperature, very much so compared to other bourbon barrel aged beers I have had. A very interesting beer to take an hour or so on.
In the end, slightly weak on the finish, thin, and quite overrated. 783 charactersdar482, Feb 13, 2014

4.59/5  rDev +2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: Black with thin brown head that dissipated quickly. Sparce lacing
Smell: Vanilla and oak. Dried fruit maybe prunes. Some bourbon. 
Taste: Big vanilla flavor. Slight bourbon. Dark chocolate makes an appearance as the beer warms.
Mouth feel: Medium body and low carbonation. Slight burn from the alcohol but not bad given this is over 11%
Overall: Wish the mouth feel was a bit thicker but that is only a minor gripe about this amazing beer. It's more balanced and smooth than bcbs. 496 charactersshadetree67, Feb 01, 2014
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5From a trade with midwest4016. Added to "sweeten the deal." Good look, man! I'm excited for this beer. Bottled 12/28/2012, so it's been sitting for 13 months. Time to let this baby loose.
A- 12. oz bottle poured aggressively into a Bell's snifter. About half of a finger of a light mocha head fades within a minute. No light getting through on this one. Mastery of the art of darkness. A few bubbles of carbonation continue to rise, feeding a light film and ring of foam around the edge on top of the beer. Spotty lacing. Really good looking beer.
S- BOOM. Bourbon. So smooth. Beautiful notes of chocolate, toffee, vanilla. Huge dark fruits, as well. Without a doubt, the bourbon dominates, but it does so without being overwhelming. This aroma hits all the right notes. Just as I was typing that, my dog farted. Fuck you, Ginny.
T- Same as the nose, except, there's a roastiness that comes out as it warms. So glad that was maintained from the Expedition. That's what takes it to the next level for me. Smooth chocolate, warm bourbon, sweet toffee and vanilla. But the roast makes this a nearly perfect beer as far as flavor goes. Only drawback is that it is a HAIR too sweet. Still... Awesome. 11.8% ABV? Hidden remarkably well.
M- Light carbonation, though it almost borders on medium. Heavy, oily mouthfeel, though it was a tad thinner than I anticipated. Delightful warmth from the alcohol. Chocolate and bourbon smother the palette. Well done.
O- Amazing beer. Ages incredibly. I've now had a vintage, but have not yet tried the beer when fresh. Needless to say, I will be seeking this out when it is released this year. Phenomenal representation of the style. I could get lost in the sweet music of Black Note for eternity. Must. Get. More. 1,752 charactersjbwimer, Jan 30, 2014

Appearance is on par with other barrel aged stouts. Black, dark roasty almond colored tiny head. Leaves little lacing.
Aroma is fudge, vanilla, toasted coconut, fig jam, bourbon, spice cake, and creamed coffee. I've got to say the aroma on this one of the best I've come upon in a barrel aged stout! So balanced between everything, thinking the year in the cellar helped take the bourbon back a notch.
On the palate there is a huge surge of coffee and fudge with the dark fruit taking a back seat. Bourbon throughout with coconut, vanilla, faint oak, and Brandy beans. If I had to describe the flavor I would have to say its like a not so boozy BCBS and Parabola had a baby. It's somewhere in between that spectrum but on a scaled down level. Just smooth.
The mouthfeel is where this suffers a bit. Not bad but maybe just a bit thin, with aftertaste disappearing rather quickly. The flavor screams viscous but the body thins out a little soon failing to support the formers gung-ho approach. 
Overall a truely worldclass barrel aged stout. Quite smooth, very flavorful, surprisingly easy drinking for 12% abv, and very balanced between flavor nuances. I think I enjoyed this a bit more than Parabola but a little less than regular BCBS. 1,285 charactersMarcWP, Jan 16, 2014

A: Black and deep, practically no head whatsoever

T: More of the nose. Rich espresso, bourbon, roasty malt, chocolate and vanilla from the oak. Bitterness is present but in the background. Lots of flavor, very well balanced
M: Pretty thick, very smooth
O: One of the better barrel aged stouts I've had. Better than KBS, not as good as BCBS. 476 charactersanteater, Jan 12, 2014

M- thicker body with little carbonation. It is ridiculously smooth and easy to drink for a big beer. No burn to report from the high abv and barrel aging. This was bottled in February of 2012 so let's keep that in mind.

Pours jet black capped by a one and half finger tan head. Great retention and plenty of lacing, especially for a barrel-aged brew. Plenty of oak, dark chocolate, and even hint of whipped cream with hints of booziness on the nose. Opens with semi-sweet chocolate, dark fruit especially black cherries and prunes joined by chocolate milk notes. Hints of bourbon and the perfect touch of oak and boozy alcohol add to the complexity on the finish. Lighter side of full bodied, lower level of carbonation, but higher compared to most barrel-aged stouts. Velvety, creamy, luxurious on the palate--really exceptional. Awesome brew, and without a doubt better than when it was fresh. 751 characterschanokokoro, Jan 03, 2014

Pitch black pour with a one finger caramel-colored head that fades quickly with minimal lacing. Bourbon and milk chocolate dominate the nose along with hints of licorice, oak, booze, and some subtle dark fruit. The taste really rich and is once again dominated by the bourbon and milk chocolate along with hints of fudge, licorice, vanilla, dark fruits, espresso, brown sugar, and oak. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and slightly syrupy with a smooth and subtly warming finish. Overall, this is right up there with my favorite BA Stouts. The ABV is well hidden and it's not as hot and boozy as most in this category. Highly recommended! 699 charactersbeerdrifter, Dec 29, 2013

Smell is definitely some nice chocolate, dark fruits like raisins, burnt malts, and some fine brown sugat. This is REALLY an amazing smelling stout that reminds me of BCBS with a four years on it yet this only has one year. This really smells well put together. Taste is everything in the nose with a TINY bit of booze from the barrels but it is very muted and as perfect as I could possibly ask for. This is no normal stout. It tastes amazing. Mouthfeel is really nice and thick which is awesome for this stout. Overall this is one of the best stouts I have tasted in a great while. Ironically this is the third time I have said this today as I have been blessed by the stout gods today. This hasn't ever happened to me before ever. Get one if you can because this is one of the best stouts I have ever tasted. 917 charactersNeedBeerHere, Dec 27, 2013

A - Deep black with no light and a minimal tan head.
S - A nice mix of bourbon, oak, vanilla, chocolate and coffee. Great depth and very inviting.
T - A very balanced and complex blend of bourbon, oak, chocolate, vanilla and other subtle flavors. Assertive yet delicate. This is far from the bourbon bomb that some barrel aged beers deliver.
M - A moderately thick consistency with a low carbonation. Provides a very smooth delivery of the flavors.
O - A fantastic beer!!! 569 charactersGJ40, Dec 20, 2013

Aged 1 year, from 12/12/2012
Look - Pours a medium viscosity jet black with no head to speak of (common for these aged stouts, not a big deal). Negligible lacing (the fact that there was some at all is amazing).
Smell - Rich chocolate, coffee, woody, nutty, fruity. Malty w/bourbon throughout. Not overly woody, just right, the fruit is slightly sweet.
Taste - Smooth fudge chocolate and coffee with dark fruits and a touch of bourbon at the end. Sweet vanilla in the finish.
Mouthfeel - Full-medium bodied with low-medium carbonation. Surprisingly not boozy (seriously). Sticky coating in the mouth.
Overall - This is super tasty, from reading other reviews it appears that this one definitely enhances with age, glad I got to try one that was aged one year. Cheers! 854 charactersJMScowcroft, Dec 19, 2013

Deep brown nearly jet black, ring of tan head, little to no lace really. Smell is bourbon forward, lots of coconut and vanilla, well roasted, chocolate with liquorice and coffee as well as a bit of a fruity hint in there as well. Taste has quite a bit of chocolate, coffee and oak, coconut, vanilla witha bit of a light lingering sweetness, bourbon in the finish. Medium-full body, lightly carbonated and bit oily with a creamy mouthcoating as well. Just awesome stuff, an awesome beer consumed on a night filled with awesome beers, would love the opertunity to revisit this again. 605 characterspeensteen, Dec 14, 2013

I completely stumbled upon this like it was meant to be.
Black, of course, with a creamy tan ring of a head collecting at the edges. Smooth bourbon and roast aromas featuring thick molasses, toasted coconut, vanilla, wood, and toffee. Super smooth taste: loads of chocolate, dark fruity esters, vanilla bourbon notes, and some oak with a little espresso in the finish. Rather light on the alcohol for its strength. Very pleasant, definite whiskey barrel, but far from overly boozy or harsh. The flavor is good, but I am madly in love with the lingering after taste of berries, coffee, and an almost marshmallow-like element. Luscious, heavy mouthfeel with light carbonation.
Better than the Bourbon Barrel 9000, which, while good, was immense and sticky. This was more cohesive and not too rich. Excellent. 829 characterswedge, Dec 13, 2013

A- Poured from the growler into an 8oz snifter. Small mocha tan head forms but quickly dissipates falling to almost nothing and lace is out of the question.
S- A balance is found immediately between then bourbon and stout. Rich as it gets with high quality Bourbon aromas, deep chocolatey fudge and strong oak barrel. Feels as if there is some age but not in a negative way.
T- Reminds me of Damon in a way but maybe a bit less pronounced in the stout category, just really smoothed out. Bourbon whiskey, vanilla, dark roast coffee, fudge, caramel and deep roast grains.
MF- Lower end carbonation and pretty heated from the almost 12% alcohol. Thick oily body with a somewhat creamy feel.
In the same realm as Damon goes for Bourbon stouts but a bit more of the whiskey shows and more alcohol heat noticed, still super balanced and smooth. Big oak and chocolate fudge comes to mind. 1,006 characterscbutova, Dec 01, 2013

A: Very dark in color, pours with just a thin layer of tan head that reduces very quickly and leaves no lacing. Appears to be very thick, yes without coating the inside of the glass they way comparables do with swirled.
S: Surprisingly sweet aroma, followed by roast, bourbon, chocolate.
T: All the flavors going on combine so well into a balanced blend of goodness. Lots of chocolate and bourbon up front, with lingering coffee, roast, sweetness.
M: Very coating on the tongue, rich and smooth. Carbed well, and very drinkable for a beer at 11.8%.
O: This is an incredible beer. A little thinner than comparables, but the aroma and flavors are all certainly there as expected. I was able to purchase 1 at a release event on Black Friday 2013, and yes, drank it the next day. I'm not sure this one would benefit much by aging, it's already pretty dang smooth at 11 months from bottling. I'd love to get some more in the future! 973 charactersroger617, Dec 01, 2013

I really like this beer around room temperature with a little age on it. Again this beer is a lot like bcbs or Kbs where it is a little hot when fresh. But as far as quality it is up there with the big dogs as well. 303 charactersvinny21bal, Nov 19, 2013

Literally no light can pass through this viscous looking libation. A splash of tan color in the center and a thin ring around the edge are the only indications of a head on this beast. If one looks closely, it is apparent that there is *some* carbonation, however, as there are small bubbles intermittently rising to the surface. 
The rousing aroma is very chocolatey, like the finest dark chocolate available to humanity! The next two aspects I detected were roasted walnut and of course that vanilla-like Bourbon that's oh so pleasing! The more subtle notes present include dark roast coffee, molasses, and fig/dark fruits. I could sniff this beverage all day and be happy, but thankfully the evaluation of the nose is over and it's time to drink this baby! 
As I take a sip, so many things come to mind... First of all, after all this contemplation of the color and aroma, the beer is now the absolute ideal temperature for drinking. The flavors do not disappoint as they are as tasty as the aroma teased at. The sweet malt intermingled with the only slightly sharp, oaked bourbon character is particularly balanced and well done. It's so velvety smooth, fully coating the mouth with the flavors lingering. It's so big bodied, and nicely intoxicating. The finish is semi-dry with a nice earthy nuttiness. 
Overall, this is one of the finest beers available to humanity! Bells, you have indeed made a grand statement about the art of the dark! I am glad I had this to make this pseudo-holiday 'Stout Day' a real cause for celebration! Hey, it is Friday... 1,628 charactersNeorebel, Nov 09, 2013

Poured into a snifter it darkens the cup, with lil to no head. It's aroma just reeks of an old bourbon warehouse, where the forgotten barrels have just soaked the bourbon for ages and the rest has been stolen as the angel's share. That and chocolate, big espresso, deep dark fruits all bring together a symphony for the nose. 
The taste however is what really sets this ye old American Double apart- it isn't overwhelming. It's smooth, it's as though the fermentation of this fruit allows for delicious lambic carbonation to build giving it a drinkability like none other I've tried before.
Bravo bravo Bell's, you've done it. This not only lived up to the hype but far exceeded it. It's a damn shame that you're not in Texas, you leave me no choice to pillage other states and take their stock. 1,019 charactersAbbbp, Nov 01, 2013

A - Pours an extremely dark brown color with good clarity that can be seen around the edges of the glass when held to a light, showing more brown highlights. A thin half finger of head forms briefly, fizzing away slowly over a minute or so to leave a thin tan collar of foam...no real lacing.
S - Even without putting my nose to the glass, I am hit with the aroma of this beer. Tons of sweet toffee/caramel and brown sugar notes. Lots of vanilla, toasted coconut, bourbon, roasted malt notes.
T - Notice dark fruits up front - rather pruney. Vanilla and brown sugar sweetness, a touch of burnt malt, dark roasted malts, hints of licorice. Bourbon...noticeable for sure, but well controlled - mild booziness, but in proper proportion - well done.
M - Medium body with a medium carbonation that seems just a touch to high for my preferences. Very mild boozy warmth, nice variety of sweet, mild roast, finishing with cool licorice.
O - Overall, a very good BA imperial stout. Very nice aroma filled with lots of bourbon complexity, plenty of sweet notes, mild booziness - lots of good stuff for a stout lover. Body is a bit thin for me and carbonation a bit high...too much life here for my preferences. Minor complaints. Glad to finally try this one...has been eluding me for a while. Excellent BA stout, but doesn't weigh in at the top of the scale for me...several others that outshine this one. 1,455 charactersportia99, Oct 31, 2013

I went to Deagan's in Lakewood with my wife and some friends for Cleveland Beer Week. We got there as soon after 5 pm as we could because we heard that they were tapping this beer at 5. 
The beer was brought to me in a snifter. I got a thin ring of rich brown head over a beer that was as black as night.
The smell was malt and dark fruit, with strong notes of chocolate and a good whiff of booze.
Roasty and malty made up the first impressions of flavor in this delicious beer. Milk chocolate soon turned up and made a good show through most of the rest of the tasting. Vanilla, wood and a hint of bourbon came in and finished it off beautifully.
This beer was smooth. It was almost Fonzie smooth. It felt like silk going down, and was the most enjoyable beer I had that evening. 821 charactersCFHMagnet, Oct 29, 2013

Pours a pitch black color with a thin brown cap of foam. Smells of sweet oak, whiskey, bittersweet chocolate, and oak tannins.
Taste is marvelous. The seamless meld of imperial stout and whiskey barrel could not have been more perfect. The taste follows suit with the nose, with the mouthfeel being rich, thick, and chewy. The carbonation is just enough, but not overdone.
An outstandingBA stout, damn near perfect. 575 characterstaylor714914, Oct 24, 2013

Pours dense pitch black color with a small tan head with decent retention, that reduces to a spotty lace cap that lingers. Light spotty lacing clings on the glass. Aromas of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, toast, vanilla, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, raisin, licorice, light coffee, cream, light char, and roasted earthiness. Damn nice aromas with good balance and complexity of roasted malt and barrel notes; with good strength. Taste of big dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, vanilla, toast, toffee, bourbon, oak, clove, light coffee, cream, raisin, licorice, light char, and roasted earthiness. Minimal bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of dark chocolate, cocoa, roasted malt, vanilla, toast, toffee, oak, bourbon, clove, light coffee, cream, raisin, licorice, light char, and roasted earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors with very balanced barrel complexity; with zero cloying sweetness after the finish. Light carbonation and full bodied; with a very creamy and slick mouthfeel that is nice. Alcohol is very well hidden with only a minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is a fantastic barrel aged imperial stout. All around fantastic complexity and balance of dark/roasted malt flavors with barrel character; and very smooth to sip on for the ABV. A highly enjoyable offering. 1,443 characterssuperspak, Oct 11, 2013

A- Pours black as night with a finger of tan head that recedes to a collar. Very little lacing, but it does leave nice alcohol legs when swirled.
S- The aroma explodes with bourbon, dark fruits, and oak. Sweet figs, dates, raisins, and prunes. Vanilla, grains, perhaps some sweet chocolate, and definitely a good bit of booze round out the nose.
T- This beer is both bold and subtle at the same time. Focused, yet complex. There's a lot of bourbon, and that makes it mellow, smooth, and boozy. Then there's plenty of the fig/date/raisin flavor. This is all complimented and rounded out with touches of vanilla, vinous flavor, oak, and a surprising bit of dry roastiness in the finish. Quite complex and delicious.
M- The mouthfeel is moderately thick, and very smooth/creamy thanks to the barrel. Lightly carbonated, and a good bit of warming booze.
O- This is a very nice representation of the BBA stout style, and I look forward to trying my other bottle with more age on it. 994 charactersSadMachine, Oct 10, 2013

S: Mellow bourbon, roasted malts, perhaps a hint of chocolate. Aroma really isn't that potent, but it is certainly appealing.
T: Just hit the bourbon barrel stout jackpot. Front end hits with a mellow, but firm, bourbon punch. The flavors radiate over the palate as I get whiskey, woody notes, and vanilla. The stout flavors come in on the finish with darkly roasted malts and hints at bitter chocolate. 
M: Not as viscous as I would like, but not thin by any means. Soft and silky. Only slight alcohol warming. The ABV is well hidden. 
O: Simply outstanding. This is certainly a top tier BBA stout. Hopefully we'll see this again from Bell's sooner rather than later. 875 charactersCMUbrew, Oct 05, 2013

Answer: A beer with a head that's darker than most brown ales. Bell's Black Note is black on black, that's for sure - it's darker than deep space. Almost amazingly, the foam never collapses. 
Did I mention the blend is also aged for a few months in bourbon barrels? This fact isn't apparent at first but comes clear in due time. There develops so much vanilla flavour that it smells almost like cream soda (but has enough roasted malt to avoid seeming artificial or candy-like). 
The taste resembles an iced coffee of sorts but also contains rich notes of fudge, vanilla, chocolate macaroons, treacle and a bit of fig too. It offers an unrivaled combination of sweet malt, bitter espresso and dried fruit qualities. The bourbon barrels work behind the scenes to add complexity but don't feature much in the spotlight. 
The mouthfeel is super lush and surprisingly light; it's not often you find the phrase "goes down easy" used in reference to an 11% stout. But there is a good amount of brown sugar in the mouthfeel and a vein of red wine astringency that brightens this very dark beer. 
Bell's Black Note is definitely a product of the black arts - it's wickedly good and somehow manages to balance delicacy and density. Unlike most bourbon barrel stouts, this one derives more from rich, chocolatey malts than it does barrel aging or bourbon. It's a big beer but not the kind to put hair on your chest; this is one to cuddle up to. 1,521 charactersbiegaman, Oct 02, 2013

A: typical… body is black as night, created a slight film of head that was dark tan in color. Big alcohol legs. Not much lacing. 
S: a phenomenal balance of chocolate, bourbon, oak and vanilla gets my loins moving. some faint espresso/coffee is also detectable... and becomes more noticeable as the brew warms. balance is unlike any other I have previously had. BCS is much more bourbon forward for comparison purposes.
T: following the nose. Big chocolate, bourbon right up front. The oak creates a bit of a dryness mid way through and the finish is an awesome vanilla creaminess that brings the entire brew together. As this brew warms I am picking up more licorice and an ever so slight smoke/burnt presence with slight espresso character. 
M: full body, chewy, it leaves a terrific slight heat on upper gums, with a lingering chocolate, bourbon presence on the palate.
O: my God! I cannot thank Match1112 enough for this one. It’s definitely one of my favorite brews, and I wish I had a bomber of this! The balance of this brew is fantastic. 1,117 characterstut2528, Sep 22, 2013

3.98/5  rDev -11.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4Bottle: Poured a deep black color stout with a nice large dark brown color foamy head with good retention and some lacing. Aroma consists of bourbon with some vanilla notes and black chocolates. Taste is also dominated by a well-balanced mix between some vanilla, bourbon, creamy black chocolates and light bitterness. Body is thinner then I had anticipated with good carbonation and no alcohol was apparent. Very solid barrel-aged stout but I would have loved a bit more of body to this beer. 493 charactersPhyl21ca, Sep 21, 2013

The head is a thin dark brown mocha color that dissipates quickly. Heavy vanilla on the nose with slight coffee and bourbon to follow up. Rates of vanilla creamy chocolate and coffee and bourbon to finish it all off. Light carbonation make this a very creamy enjoyable BBS. The best BBS I have ever tried hands down sat this on the shelf for about ten months a very smooth blended flavor, it all works togeather. 501 charactersMrappinin, Sep 14, 2013
4.95/5  rDev +10%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On- tap served in a snifter
A- Jet black with a millimeter of mocha head that quickly dissipated to a ring.
S- Coconut, vanilla, alcohol, coffee, chocolate, slight raisin 
T- Smooth, tastes like a Mounds bar, dark chocolate, vanilla, coconut, very similar to the nose
M- Creamy, surprisingly easy drinking for such a big beer, it's a good thing the flavors are so big or you'd be in trouble. Not as thick as other bourbon barrel aged stouts, but I kinda like it. Bourbon County stout was pretty thick and actually took me a while to get through just one bottle. I think this it perfect mouthfeel for a 12oz. serving of this weight of a beer.
O- Living in Kalamazoo, I'm lucky to find this on draft somewhere every couple of months. This hits everything on the head and is the benchmark for me in BBA stouts. I tried KBS a few weeks after having this and thought there was no comparison, this is the better beer. If I could have one more beer before I die, this would be it. 978 charactersPaulyB83, Sep 13, 2013

Review #825
The beer poured a dark brown/black and a touch thinner than expected. A mass of tan colored bubbles topped the liquid, but they quickly dissolved into a small ring.
The nose was amazing. Bourbon notes dominated. Boozy, but in a good way. Vanilla came through strong. Raisin and dark fruit notes were evident as well. Good dose of molasses and brown sugar sweetness. Dark chocolate notes appeared as the beer warmed.
Like the nose, the flavor profile was very bourbon forward. Tons of fresh vanilla bean. Sweet up front with brown sugar notes. Raisins and plums were also noticeable. Lots of espresso in the center. The finish was disappointing however. It was excessively roasty and tasted somewhat ashy. Bitter, earthy hops came through as well. Toward the beer's end, the finish turned acrid and rather unpleasant.
The liquid was medium bodied for the style. Slick, rich and creamy with a fine, mild effervescence. Quite smooth and supple.
Bell's Black Note Stout started out so strong, but the bitter and charred tasting finish was really disappointing. When fresh, perhaps the sweetness of the Double Cream Stout would help even out some of the harsh aspects of the flavor profile. 1,305 charactersDamian, Sep 11, 2013

A-dark black in color, with a head that quickly dissapates. 
S- molasses right away, followed by darker fruits, and a hint of toffee.
T- a nice subtle bourbon undertone at the first sip. This becomes more pronounced as it warms. 
M- the body is a little on the lighter side IMO. I would like a barrel aged stout to be a little thicker.
O- A good overall BA stout, but I think there are a lot easier to find, and at least equal in taste stouts out there. 499 charactersHoppyKilaMonster, Sep 11, 2013

Incredibly inviting nose with sweet and spicy bourbon barrel notes excellently integrated into the elements of the base beer.  Spicy whiskey/bourbon with toasted oak and vanilla.  Toasted coconut and vanilla notes really stand out along with the dry, earthy  oak presence.  Underneath, there's some luscious chocolate, licorice, vinous fruit, oatmeal and toast.  Smells amazing!!! 
Viscous and full bodied with a strong bourbon presence that is perfectly integrated into the flavors of the base beer.  Some dry toasted oak and spicy bourbon along with smooth vanilla bean and roasted coconut.  Again, the toasted coconut flavor is realy prominent and the vanilla rounds out the hot booze.  Great bourbon flavor.  Underneath, there is a nice combination of sweet and roasted malt notes with hints of dark chocolate, burnt sugar, toast, oatmeal and coffee bean coutered by licorice and vinous fruits.  Slightly dry in the finish with a good amount of boozy heat and warmth in the chest.  Abv not masked very well but the base beer flavors aren't obliterated and it's still somewhat easy to drink.  Very nice.   1,281 characterscorby112, Sep 09, 2013

I am a huge fan of BBA stouts, I have had CBS, CW BBA stout, KBS, Class X kern River, BCBS, Parabola etc, some live up to the hype and others fall flat, I am about to test drive Bells Black note:
Appearance: Opaque black no like gets through as you pour it almost no head forms and the head that does form is dark dark tan with fine bubbles.
Smell: Wow interesting, this has dark plum, raisins, black licorice, the bourbon is there but very muted and hidden, I also get almost a sweet coffee on the nose. 
Taste: The taste is very good this is definitely a top 5 for me, the hidden bourbon is no longer hidden that is the first upfront flavor, but even though that is the upfront flavor it is not hot like one would expect for 11.8 %, as it continues to ease over my taste buds the other flavors emerge vanilla first, then a touch of sarsaparilla, and finally on the very back of the tongue coffee candy that reminds me of loomis coffee candies in the gold wrapper my mother used to eat them when I was young. 
Mouth feel: not much to say here this was very typical, smooth and creamy not the best mouth feel I have had but not the worst. 
Overall: I am very impressed with this beer, I still give higher rating to my all time favorite CBS, but this is def in the top 5 for me and worthy of seeking in the future, cheers fellow BA's 1,404 characterssoughtbygod, Sep 02, 2013
4.66/5  rDev +3.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5a thick black pour with less than a finger of tan head. lots of bourbon / vanilla in the aroma, pecans, brown sugar, coffee, cocoa. wow - this is a deliciously sweet yet dark stout. reminds me of peruvian morning with its nutty sweet pecan/brown sugar flavor overtopping everything.. the bourbon barrel taste is there but blends ver nicely with the chocolate/coffee/sweet notes of this that it doesn't become overwhelming like a lot of BBA stouts tend to do. this is everything i want to taste in an imperial stout. medium to full body with low carbonation and a silky smooth mouthfeel. the alcohol is present, but is not overpowering.. it's masked fairly well. honestly, this drinks way too easily.
one of the best stouts i've ever had by far. for those looking for a subtle roast, subtle sweetness, lots of chocolate and coffee taste - this is the one to go for. 865 charactersfacundoCNB, Sep 02, 2013

Pours oily black w/ a very thin tan head that quickly dissipates to a narrow collar. I know it's not supposed to matter with big stouts like this, but I still like to see a little head+retention.
Aroma is big powerful bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, rum-soaked tobacco, toffee/molasses, and caramelized dark fruit. Fresh-baked sticky buns. Smells phenomenal.
Taste follows nose. Dark bitter chocolate, coffee, bourbon, dried figs/dates, vanilla, caramel, and more bourbon. Nice boozy heat warms the throat. Everything very nicely balanced, maybe just a touch sweeter than I like my BA stouts.
Mouthfeel is sticky, chewy, a little syrupy.
Overall, a solid barrel aged stout, in the same league as Parabola and KBS and better than BCBS. I'd buy this every year if I could. 848 charactersdraheim, Aug 28, 2013

Appearance. Pours black with half a finger of nice brown head.
Smell. Smooth bourbon with tons of oak, vanilla and sweet chocolate, and a little molasses.
Taste. Sweet dark creamy chocolate, smooth bourbon and oak barrel, a bit of vanilla and molasses. Very nice.
Mouthfeel. Full body with creamy smooth lowish carbonation. Great stuff.
Overall. A bourbon barrel imperial stout done right. I should probably crack my 750 from the original bottling soon. This is drinking very well right now and that one is probably at its peak. 569 charactersRutager, Aug 09, 2013

Overall very excellent and highly recommended for the bourbon barrel aged stout connoisseur. 459 charactersalpineclimber, Jul 29, 2013

A: Pours a dark, black coffee color with just a touch of mocha foam. Oily legs when swirled.
S: Opens very sweetly with coconut, maple, and vanilla. As it warms an oaky bourbon flavor joins the initial sweet scents. Complemented by aromas of fig, plum, hazelnut, and brown sugar. A little bit of warming booze. Near the end there is some milk chocolate.
T: Bittersweet chocolate is more potent here. In combination with oak, cappuccino and a hint of smoke, this nicely tempers the remaining sweetness. Dark fruits show through and blend nicely with the chocolate. The finish is all bourbon and mocha.
M: Medium thick and very smooth/sticky. Almost no carbonation.
O: A wonderful beer. Undeniably complex and well crafted. Up there with Parabola and BCBS. I really love the aroma, very sweet but interesting. 853 charactersWankelEngine, Jul 18, 2013

4.41/5  rDev -2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the Michigan Craft Beer stand at Comerica Park, during the Tigers-Sox game. Was about to order something else, but the bartender told me they just put this one on. Score!
Poured into only the finest plastic cup. Nearly black, caramel around the edges. Carbonation is visible here, and there was only a thin head that didn't survive long. Chalk that one up to the serving vessel, I suppose. 
Smells fantastic - rich chocolate, caramel, booze, bourbon, oak and milk/cream. Smells like a top class bourbon barrel imperial stout. 
One hell of a tasty stout, and by a very wide margin the best - and strongest - beer I've ever had at a ball game. Despite the plethora of bourbon barrel stouts out there, I really never get tired of the stuff, and this one is no exception. Similar flavors as in the nose - robust whisky and cream notes, as with some nice vanilla and rich chocate-caramel. Damned tasty stuff. 
Mouthfeel is a little thinner than I'd like, with zesty carbonation. Still, a creamy, silky beer. 
Hats off to Bell's for this terrific stout, and to Comerica for putting this one on tap. Made my night! 1,122 charactersJohnnyBarman, Jul 11, 2013

I love the smell of bourbon on a stout. This has the perfect mix of malt and bourbon albeit a little less sweet than I'm used too. This beer showcases how a well integrated barrel character can affect a moderately low abv (for an imperial bal aged stout) can be. It's not sweet like Black Tuesday or BCBS which is nice for a change. I personally don't mind those diabetes bombs, but these guys do a great job while keeping things moderate. 543 charactersPlinyBeMiney, Jul 04, 2013

Black with brown edges. The head is not durable but the ring is.

3.63/5  rDev -19.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.75Let's be real, this beer is all hype. It's not really that good. It has a hint of bourbon barrel, some decent roasty notes, but every time I have it, I expect it to be pretty good. It never lives up to any of the other beers I've had that night. BCBS is in another league, and even just an above average beer like KBS kills this. If you've gotten this far, here is my full review.
A - Fairly dark, not the darkest stout out there. Decent appearance overall.
S - Pretty dry, doesn't smell very sweet. Has a hint of bourbon barrel there. Some chocolate notes.
T - Fairly dry in the taste as well. Doesn't have a lot of bourbon. It tastes like an OK roasty stout got thrown in a bourbon barrel for about 2 weeks. I'm not sure what Bell's is doing, but they're doing it wrong. It's truly not that good. There are an incredible amount of bourbon barrel stouts I'd seek out over this.
M - It's fairly smooth, but nothing too incredible. The best quality of this beer is that it's not very boozy. It's a bit thin for the ABV, but at least the booze is well hidden.
O - This beer is not worth seeking out. If it was on the shelf at $3 a bottle, I probably wouldn't buy it. That is NOT good for a bourbon barrel stout, let alone a very good one. I actually would for trade value I guess, but definitely not to drink. Skip this one unless you just want to tick it. It's like Hopslam, just a tick. Nothing special. It's outdated, and many many other breweries have caught up and surpassed Bell's. The only beer I consider worthwhile from them is Two Hearted. For the price, it's the only beer they make that's worth buying imo. 1,621 charactersnrs207, Jun 24, 2013

After a visit to the abbey of Westvleteren this was the one to open (strangely enough)! Poured in my small Struise chalice this is a wonderfull stout to look at. Almost pitchblack and a very nice bubbly head. Little to no lacing. Smell is like a ba stout should be. Nice boozy smell. The taste is one of the best i have ever encountered in this style. Very very impressed.

the beer pours a sludgey jet black with a thin creamy off tan head. night nice barrel aged shine. smell is black roasted malt and bourbon. good wood presence and good balance. taste is silky and smooth. the heat is on for this one as the ABV is very noticeable. goes down easy and is definitely one of the better barrel aged stouts. just a bit more in your face then some of the others.

A: Pours pitch black with a good sized and dense medium brown head. Head fades slowly with nary a trace of lacing. Decent retention, however.
S: Huge bourbon notes. Almost pure bourbon with the sweet, sweet caramel and some toasted coconut. No real sign of the stout, it's buried under the mountain of bourbon I think. Maybe a little chalky chocolate. Great bourbon aroma regardless.
T: Well, strong bourbon again up front but not overpowering at least. Loaded with sweet caramel. Ultra sweet caramel. Wonderful toasted coconut again. Roasted malt kicks in, wow is this nice. I love both of the base beers and this is just fantastic. Super smooth and creamy with loads of chocolate to boot. Tastes like a caramel chocolate cream milkshake. Bourbon stands alone in the lingering aftertaste with hints of sweet caramel and toffee and coconut. Not drying at all like a lot of barrel treatments.
M: Heavy but not too thick. Slick and ultra smooth. Creamy. 
O: Whoa, glad I got my hands on this one. Masterful blend and barrel aging. The smooth creaminess really makes this one stand out. No harsh flavors, no excessive booziness. Strong flavors, yes. Great complexity, yes. Awesome barrel treatment, yes. Perfect blend, yes. Great beer, Bell's, my hat is off to you. 1,283 charactersDope, Jun 19, 2013

Bottle No: 455/1534
Pours a pitch black darkness that is quite thick. There is a nice quarter inch thick head that is light tan colored and is pretty dense. A nice swirl rises a head up to about half and inch and with some dense small bubbles. 
Aroma is delicious! Starts off with fudgey chocolate notes. Delicious chocolate cake sweetness and richness. There is some nice bourbon sweetness that follows the chocolate notes and the bourbon is slightly balanced by some nice roast. There are some dark fruit notes present mixed in with some dark chocolate bitterness that shows itself on the back end. 
Flavor starts off following the aroma. Starts off with nice fudgey and milk cocoa sweetness. Then there is a nice mix of bourbon with the coca notes. The Bourbon notes add some slight heat and some nice vanilla and almost cinnamon spice notes. There is a nice dark fruit notes with some raisins and prunes notes mixed in with the sweetness of chocolate. These notes are however not too strong and are very well balanced by the roast notes and the cocoa. All the flavors in this brew are very well crafted and represented. Yummy cocoa notes blended with bourbon notes that bring some vanilla and some nice dark fruit notes. All these notes are also very well balanced. Nothing overpowers the other notes and they all play well together. The body is nice and creamy and velvety smooth. 
Overall I'm glad I got to try this brew. It is quite delicious with great fudge notes and some slight roast. Then there are some definite bourbon notes that are present and give the brew some nice body and good dimensions but that don't overwhelm. Bravo Bell's. 1,699 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jun 18, 2013

Appearance: Dark opaque with a small tan head that quickly recedes to the perimeter. Lots of little bubbles, nice.
Smell: Rich chocolate, vanilla, coconut, dark fruit, Bourbon. Amazing.
Taste: Wow, just wow. First, I get intense fudge brownie like chocolate richness with some coconut and Bourbon in the background. Afterwards in the middle of the drink, the Bourbon asserts itself more and overpowers the chocolate. In the end, the chocolate pops out again as the Bourbon subsides and leads into a smooth, balanced ending of chocolate and Bourbon. There's a background element of vanilla/coconut present throughout the whole drink.
I honestly can't find anything wrong with this; the booze is just hidden so well.
Mouthfeel: Velvety and silky smooth; just about perfect. Not as viscous as BCBS, yet definitely fuller in body than say KBS. 
Overall: I don't know if I like this as much as BCBS, but it's damn close! There's just not much to dislike in this beer, even if you try to find things; this beer blew me away. Can't wait til' Bell's distro hits NY! 1,103 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Jun 17, 2013

Decent hiss on opening. Dark chocolate brown, not your typical RIS motor oil look look, with a modest dark tan head that falls relatively quickly to a collar.
Undoubtedly a rich vein of bourbon running through notes of liquorice bullets, choc-caramel slice, soy sauce, used coffee grounds and molten plastic. Predominantly dry, big and deceptively complex.
A tad sweeter, with impressively rich caramel fudge and butterscotch giving way to coconut, vanilla and the woodier aspects of the barrel.
Light bodied for 11.8%, in no small part due to above average carbonation for the style. Makes it easier to drink, but reduces the oomph.
Worthy BA RIS no doubt, but not quite in the top echelon for me. Lacking a little in presence and intensity. 789 charactersspicelab, Jun 15, 2013

Look- Pours a dark brown revealing a couple of centimeters of light tan foam. It rapidly settles to a thin ring rimming the glass and no lacing is left behind. 
Smell- Bourbon forward with sweet dark fruit, vanilla, tobacco and mild char. 
Taste- Bourbon, figs, raisins, tobacco, a touch of vanilla and char. A prominent oak flavor is  in the finish. 
Feel- It's oily with a medium viscosity and a tad hot from the 11.2 abv. 
Overall- A beer that I look forward to and I'm fortunate to have scored a few. A bourbon barrel forward stout with a slightly thin and hot feel. As a bourbon lover I enjoy it fresh, but I'm not opposed to cellaring a couple for a smoother alternative. It definitely ranks near the top of the class. 824 charactersPrager62, Jun 03, 2013

A-Hard not to fall in love with the darkness. Head dissipates quickly. 
S-Wow, Bells nailed it. It's easy for BBA beers to be overwhelmed by the bourbon on the nose. Lactose from the Double Cream turns the aromas into an almost candy shop of fudge, chocolate, vanilla, and caramel. 
T-Easily top-3 stouts I've ever had. The taste was reminiscent of a 2-3 vintage KBS but with sweeter notes brought on by the lactose. 
M-Very creamy and dangerously easy to drink. Enjoyed quite a few at a Bells tasting party and didn't enjoy the walk back to my car in the morning when it was blizzarding...
O-Hard to compete against and hope Bells introduces this into their yearly lineup. Have went back and forth comparing against KBS and have given up. They're both very different beers. 818 characterskylelenk, May 30, 2013

A: The beer is jet black in color. It poured with a patch of beige bubbles on the surface and a collar around the edge of the glass.
S: Strong aromas of vanilla are present in the nose along with notes of bourbon.
T: The taste has lots of flavors of bourbon and associated vanilla from the barrel aging process.
M: It feels full-bodied on the palate and has a moderate amount of carbonation along with some warming from the alcohol.
O: This beer definitely tastes strong but does a good job hiding most of its alcohol. 557 charactersmetter98, May 30, 2013

A: Pours a very deep brown, practically black with a small tan/mocha colored head on top that forms a pretty tight cap. Decent read retention with thin lacing. 
S: Dark chocolate upfront with some light roasted malt. Bourbon mixed with vanilla and a bit of brown sugar and molasses as well. 
T: The first flavor I got was vanilla with dark chocolate, a great combination. The bourbon kicks in adding some wood, a bit of caramelized sugar, and some molasses. Faint dark fruit as well, cherries. Slight bitter/roast on the back end. 
M: Full bodied with moderate carbonation, pretty smooth. 
O: A very nice beer, understandable why it scores so hi. Very impressed and look forward to trying it again. 722 charactersmdaschaf, May 21, 2013

A- yaya, jet black. Lots of retention leading down to a thin layer of lacing around the glass in mocha color. 
S- Chocolate milk/bourbon that is so sweet that it is pleasant beyond belief to smell. Oak, woodiness behind. 
T- By far the smoothest beer I have ever had. Cream, bourbon. I have had the sum of it's parts, and this beer joins the two and kicks ass afterward. 
M- Again, sooo fkn smoooth. I have neglected this beer in my cellar; even though I have a few in my celar. I have been paying too much attention to Prairie. Great stuff here. Top 15 for sure. 672 charactersgueuzedreg, May 18, 2013

Nice full body that holds well on the tongue, with low-medium carbonation. 444 charactersmverity, May 16, 2013

A - Pours a bit thick, midnight black with almost no head to speak of, only a tan line around rim, no lacing.
S - Amazing espresso smell, chocolate, and bourbon! Such a sweet aroma, the nose is its best quality IMO.
T - Starts out with a bitterness like dark chocolate, then a smooth warmness comes out, and it ends with huge espresso notes. Reminds me of a mocha. Has some hints of dates as well.
M - Super full bodied, thick like a syrup almost. Coats the mouth and warms the body.
O - One knock is its drinkability, otherwise this is a homerun. This is my first Bell's beer, I'm very impressed. 668 charactersda_beers, May 08, 2013

Awesome smell. Heavy on the bourbon, but also a lot of chocolate and vanilla present. One of the best smelling beers I've sampled.
Pours a very thick black with no head at all. Dark as night, very pretty. 
Lot of stuff going on with the taste. Bourbon is very present, followed by a bit of vanilla, chocolate, and charred wood. Hides the 11+% well. Very thick bodied and smooth, awesome mouthfeel. 
Overall, I love this beer. A little heavier on the bourbon than I would like, but I can still see why this is such a world class stout. 584 charactersCManuel, May 07, 2013

A: Slick. Black. No head at all. Nothing, not even a rim around the edges. Holding it up to a light directly yields nothing. Not a single bubble rises in the glass. I guess since Mikkeller already has Black Hole they couldn't name it that, because light does not escape. Perfect.
S: Imagine someone taking a bar of Green's organic dark chocolate and punching you in the face with it. Sweet molasses, delicious white chocolate, vanilla, bourbon. Woodiness, oak. Something else I can't quite name. Perfect.
T: Bourbon immediately. Then it hits: creamy dark chocolate, vanilla, mellow rye whiskey notes. Alcohol burn, but the good kind. Not hot at all. And it lingers, and just hangs out in your mouth reminding you that it's almost impossible to get in Maryland, so I'd better make this bottle last. Perfect.
M: Creamy, more carbonated than expected given how black and imposing it is, but there's not as much thickness as some of the other world-class stouts I've had. Still, this is not a knock on it.
O: My favorite bourbon barrel-aged beer of all time is Bourbon County Coffee, followed by regular BCBS. Those are my standards. This matches, if not exceeds, both of them in all categories except mouthfeel. Make it a little thicker and more viscous, and it gets a perfect score from me. Until then, this is #3. 1,365 charactersnihiloexnihil, May 01, 2013

A- Pours a very dark brown that appears an opaque jet black in the glass. A very thin mocha head appears that has decent retention but recedes to a flat top.
S- Dark chocolate, vanilla, bourbon, fairly sweet but nicely balanced and fairly aromatic.
T- Dark chocolate mixed with sweet bourbon balanced with a nice creamy vanilla presence and light oak. Finishes with light bitter chocolate balanced with more vanilla and a light clean booze (especially when considering the 11.5%). Nice balance between all the flavors, a little bit on the sweet side but not overly sweet.
M- Very smooth, nice carbonation, very easy drinking, decent body- not too thick but not overly light like some people complain about, overall an incredible feel for a 11.5% beer.
O- This was a fantastic barrel-aged stout which was actually one of our favorites of the night, which was impressive considering we paired it with the likes of Nooner, Marshall Zhukov, Hopped Up Johnnie, CBS, and KBS. Easily one of the better barrel-aged beers I've had and I hope Bell's continues to increase production of it as I would love to try it again. 1,270 charactersjaasen64, Apr 30, 2013

4.75/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Very happy to have tried this at DLD near the FFF brewpub in Indiana. Poured into a 9oz plastic tumbler.
The appearance is a blackened, near opaque color coated with a half finger of bone white head at the top, with slight streaks of carbonation visible at the edges of the glass. Leaves behind excellent lacing, which is impressive given the serving vessel and ABV. Contains a viscous, liqueur-like feel with each swirl, and ranges from looking like a freshly made cup of espresso coffee to a glass of fortified dessert wine. The head never seems to vanish, which adds charm to the beer's look. Looks quite menacing, yet inviting overall.
The aroma is most definitely complex - right at the front, there are traces of roasted chocolate notes soaked in oak, followed by huge caramelized and creamy vanilla bean and brown sugar aromas. Having never had either of the base beers used to make this, I cannot say where or how both of these draw the line against each other. However, in this case, this holds so well on its own that I pretty much don't need to! (Although I would still love to know.) Dark fruits abound such as blackberries and blueberries (on the sweetened side, not tart), slight tinges of coffee, maybe some coconut, but it's really the chocolate and oak and vanilla creaminess that shine here. It's truly refined and strives for balance in ways I haven't seen a stout of this kind go towards.
With my first sip, I expected an explosion of various flavors melding and conflicting with one another, but it's surprisingly as wonderfully soothing and comforting as the aroma. Large notes of dark chocolate abound with dried, juicy fruity notes imparted by the oak, only to be followed by a massive vanilla, crème brûlée-like flavor that feels wholesome and decadent without being overwhelming. The blueberries are there as well full-fronted in a sense that I usually only get with dessert wines, but what's more surprising of all is how isn't that sweet at all, but rather just the right balance of sweetness from the cream stout balancing gloriously well with the roasted, semi-dark chocolate character and light coffee. It's really these flavors balanced with the well carbonated, creamy mouthfeel that this beer is such an instant classic. The wood has really refined the flavors and makes it a relaxing yet full-bodied drinking experience, to the point where it adds character and fruitiness to the chocolate and vanilla, and finishes off the beer in a wonderfully buttery aftertaste that goes on and on. I really wanted to munch on something like Whoppers while drinking this in order to keep the chocolate flavor going! This felt like it was melting each time in mouth the warmer and warmer it got. What a fantastic thing that is.
This beer, like so many of these barrel blended stouts across the country, has been romanticized to death, and I said all I could with the little yet fabulous pour I was able to get. I really want to track this down in the bottle and see how it compares to the tap version, but this does well for me (especially if I can find more pours of this size for $5). A glorious stout. Works for any occasion at any time of the day. Like The Abyss, not a chore to drink at all. Absolutely worth tracking down! 3,256 charactersmagictacosinus, Apr 29, 2013

Wow. I thought BCS set the precedence for me, but this blew it away. Dark, dark color. Little head with respectable lacing. Sweet bourbon, where's the booze? To me, this was perfectly balanced and complex with each flavor joining hand in hand rather than going to combat. A peacemaker, if you will. Only thing, I wish this was as available as BCS. I could drink this all day, anyday. Then shower in it. Probably drinking the bathwater after. Just kidding. No, I'm not. FIND THIS! 511 characters4amepiphany, Apr 28, 2013

A - Pours pitch black, with just a thin, soapy tan cap. Minimal head retention and lacing, but some sticky legs. Usually I'm a big fan of Bell's label designs, but I gotta say this one is lacking.
S - Thick base of roasted malt, with notes of bourbon, vanilla, cocoa, and a hint of coffee over top. Slight alcohol note detected. Overall pretty sweet and boozy, without too big an emphasis on the roast/coffee character. Subtle notes of dark fruit come through as well, namely medjool dates. Probably not the biggest or most complex nose, but very rich and inviting. 
T - Starts off with a barrage of sweet vanilla and bourbon notes, with dark fruit and milk chocolate poking through. Finishes slowly, very slowly. Long after the swallow, a pronounced coffee roast rises up out of nowhere and permeates the palate with roasty, charred goodness. Definitely a stout on the sweeter side, with bourbon vanilla in the forefront, but also mild earthy notes of wood and molasses. A very saturated profile overall, with a dense residual sweetness that just doesn't let up.
M - Thick and creamy, very low carbonation. Heavy on the palate, and sticky on the lips. Slight alcohol heat, but very little considering the ABV. Just a dense, unrelenting stout.
D - Overall a seriously bold stout from Bell's. The barrel character really transforms the beer into a thick, bourbon-stout concoction. Delicious, but deceptively drinkable. Not for the faint of heart. 1,520 charactersConverge, Apr 27, 2013

A- This beer pours an inky black thick body with a deep tan head that covers ½ of the glass before fading to a thick ring. 
S- The aroma during the pour is a rich black malt with full barrel oak aroma and some buttery graham cracker malt and molasses make up the finish. 
T- The full roasted barley flavor is rich but mellow with a big leathery oak flavor to follow and a blend of paper straws and deep chocolate nougat finishing with a sherry hint. The chocolate malt lingers after each sip. There is also a chalky quality in the finish which is pleasant. 
M- This beer has a medium mouthfeel with a slippery texture and a nice alcohol warmth but very little carbonation in the mouthfeel.
O- This is a nice full flavored stout with big barrel character and it stayed very mellow in the malt bitterness and had some nice chocolate malt flavors which I thought started to get covered by the big oak character. 932 charactersrhoadsrage, Apr 23, 2013

4.68/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.752012 vintage 12oz bottle dated 12/28/2012, poured into a Bell's snifter today and quaffed 4/13/2013. This review is also based on the four times I've had this now- twice on tap, and twice in the bottle. This is the first time I've had a chance to sit down, relax and write a review. And I am thoroughly enjoying this just like all the other times.
Aroma: Smells delicious, like a dessert port. Decadent chocolate accompanied by vanilla, bourbon and oak. And it actually smells thick and creamy, like how I would imagine liquid Ritter Sport (German) chocolate would smell like. I mean, I've had my share of BA beers including the recent vintage of KBS and last year's BCBS and this definitely has them beat in the nose.
Colour: Pours like a thick, viscous motor oil. Jet black body, illuminates with just a tiny hint of dark, dark cola brown at the surface. Not a ton of head, it pours with a brief, less than 1 cm dark brown head that is ephemeral. It leaves no traces, not even a collar. You get spots of lacing here and there but for the most part it's this viscous liquid dark chocolate. Nice.
Flavour: Very, very complex and I really love this beer. Up front, and especially early on while it's still at cellar temperature, there is quite a bit of straight up bourbon, vanilla and oak wood. This quickly gives way to this pure chocolate sweetness, with a bit of molasses and fire-roasted marshmallows, just like the ones you make s'mores with. As the temperature warms up, I start to get a little bit of dark fruits- figs in particular, which actually reminded me of Expedition Stout the first time I had this beer before knowing what the components were. The finish is smooth and creamy, a little bit of espresso and cream like a cappuccino- but I want to say something more like macchiato- less cream, more bitter espresso yet smooth. This beer drinks like a dessert drink and there's nothing like this beer that I've had the privilege to drink. Even as it gets close to room temperature, the heat is pretty indistinct and covered up by all the complex flavours and smells of this beer. tl;dr- this is an incredibly complex beer that somehow melds all the flavours together well while hiding its 11.5% ABV very well.
Mouthfeel: Initially, I would have guessed they had to have some contribution from Double Cream Stout, because the mouthfeel reminds me a lot of that particular Bell's offering. It's a very thick bodied, very smooth and creamy beer that is actually well carbonated based on how my tongue perceives the beer. It fizzes quickly as I swish it around, coating my palate in a thick and viscous chocolatey heaven. The aftertaste is sweet, bitter and creamy all at once- like if I made a macchiato and put a block of dark Belgian chocolate in it. Simply sublime.
Overall: I've just been so impressed with this beer. It's one for the ages. I say the same for BCBS, but in the realm of subjective preferences, I'm going to take Black Note over BCBS if I were ever offered the choice (which is probably going to be very rare). It's exceptionally smooth, creamy sweet and such a decadent pleasure to quaff. The heat, even when it gets close to room temperature, is relatively minimal. It's truly a joy to drink and I treasure each opportunity I have to be able to drink this beer. 3,297 charactersStevedore, Apr 16, 2013

4.66/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Mmm... Bell's Black Note. Half Expedition Stout, half Special Double Cream Stout - two beers that I love - aged for months in old bourbon barrels. How can you go wrong, right? This is one of those beers that often gets compared to KBS and BCBS, so needless to say - I'm very excited to try it. The pour is pitch black as it tumbles out like old motor oil that should've been changed months ago. The half-inch tan cap lasts for longer than expected and leaves behind some wet lacing. Very nice looking beer.
The aroma follows suit for this style of beer very closely. In other words, it's pretty fantastic. The bourbon barrel notes are the first thing to jump out - smooth bourbon, wet oak, vanilla. Very powerful without being brash. Lots of rich chocolates up front, too. Milky sweet and savory. Nice, sweet molasses underbody with plenty of roasted malt and coffee in the tail end. The aroma has a perfectly inviting warmth to it. It doesn't change much as the beer warms up, it just gets stronger. I'm okay with that.
I certainly don't think I would have been able to pick out Expedition or DC Stout had I not been told, but after taking a few sips, I certainly can believe it. The mouth feel is fantastic. Silky, smooth, chewy, robust, thick - just so pleasing to let this one sit and swish around your palate for a bit. Huge robustness right out of the gate with a solid bourbon character that lasts from start to finish. It has one of the richest, creamiest, and most full-bodied inductions of chocolate that I've ever tasted. Sweet, delicate cocoa with a faint wisp of bitterness. Milky, creamy, and elegant. 
The barrel flavors are definitely pronounced and become even more heady twenty minutes in. Heavy oak and vanilla, still with the solid meshing of warm bourbon. Some lightly burnt coffee beans make their way in and out, but must really be searched for. The roast from the malt injects a little more bitterness that plays well with the sweetness of the beer and the warmth of the booze. A nearly perfect trifecta of balance is happening on my palate. The finish shows some super-dark, bourbon-soaked and lightly sugar coated fruits; dates and figs being the best descriptions. That's what reminds me the most of Expedition. The finish has lots of dark chocolate, roasty malt, and oak-soaked bourbon with a fading vanilla note. Incredibly complex and super enjoyable.
Incredible beer. I love both of the base beers, so mixing them together and aging them in bourbon barrels is most-likely going to be a success, and it definitely was. Very drinkable for being nearly 12% ABV, but it's still better to enjoy this one over the course of an hour. Insanely complex and insanely delicious - get some! 2,713 characterstectactoe, Apr 13, 2013

This BA stout has every opportunity to push into syrup territory but doesn't, thanks to its great bones. Excellent concentration of flavors and supporting carbonation. This is one of the more restrained and balanced BA stouts I have had. 519 charactersgunpwdr, Apr 12, 2013

Black Note pours jet black, with maybe half a finger of dark, mocha foam crowning the beer. Head retention is good, but the lacing left behind is minimal. The nose is spectacular, with aromas of vanilla, marshmallow, brown sugar, bourbon, and a dusting of dark chocolate all waft out of the glass. The only (minor) complaint I have is that the barrel characteristics are highlighted so much more so than that of the base beer. The flavor profile does have some more cocoa to it, as well as even just a little bit of espresso. It comes at the expense of the nuanced bourbon barrel profile. The marshmallow disappears completely, and vanilla and caramelized sugar fade. All are replaced by more of a straight off boozy bourbon flavor. It's great that more stout shines through, but the tradeoff isn't quite worth it. Still, the flavor's very good (just doesn't quite live up to the expectations set by the nose). The mouthfeel has a certain silky quality to it, and it's paired with an appropriately subdued carbonation. The body just isn't quite full enough to really be excellent though. I've had a couple of "hyped" beers that didn't quite measure up lately, but I'm happy to say that Black Note isn't one of them. Superb barrel aged stout from Bell's 1,420 charactersaxeman9182, Apr 09, 2013

The taste is a real treat. Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, dark fruit, coconut, and dark roasted malt. Sweet without being too sweet. The alcohol is noticeable, but is not hot. In fact it is just right. 
Full bodied with soft carbonation. Smooth and silky to drink. As I mentioned, the alcohol is noticeable, but there is no alcohol burn to the taste. Just a tremendous beer. No wonder it is so highly sought after. 584 charactershardy008, Apr 06, 2013

A: Black opaque pour, very VERY dark and ominous. Minimal head and lace.
S: Initially BIG barrel notes, more whiskey-like than bourbon to my nose...burnt sugar, oak, and a touch of smokiness. Nose is rounded out with notes of sweetness, caramel and vanilla.
T: Caramel and vanilla, lots of it caramel, especially...marshmallow too. A decent bit of warming from the alcohol...milk chocolate, suggestion of roast, light woodiness from the barrels. Well-integrated barrel-aging.
MF: Smooth, full body with lower carbonation levels. Just a touch of heat, and it isn't distracting.
O: This is a good barrel-aged beer, one that shines with a bit more caramel/vanilla/marshmallow sweetness than even BCBS (we tasted the 2012 of BCBS version tasted side by side with BN). It has a lighter body than BCBS too, while still maintaining an Imperial Stout-like mouthfeel with good drinkability.
Good stuff. Thanks again Aaron, cheers! 1,041 charactersScotchboy, Apr 01, 2013

A: Pours an opaque black with some browning on the edges when held to light. 1/2 fingers width of light mocha colored head builds and then quickly recedes. Leaves only small patches of lacing. 
S: Massive bourbon upfront. This is followed by rich dark cocoa and chocolate fudge. Oak, vanilla, the barrel notes are huge. Hints of roasted malt and dark fruits as well. Maple syrup. Incredible aroma. 
T: The initial sip is luscious dark chocolate, followed by bourbon, and finished with coffee and roasted malt notes. The flavor levels with each sip are just wonderful. I also get raw oak, faint dark fruit notes, vanilla, some bitterness on the finish. 
M/D: Velvety smooth, full bodied, fairly thick but not chewy, carbonation a touch higher than I prefer for the style, but appropriate. No hint of the ABV and drinkability is excellent. 
O: Overall, just an excellent beer. I feel very lucky that I was able to get a hold of a bottle of this. Excellent from top to bottom. Definitely worth seeking out. 1,056 characterszac16125, Mar 30, 2013

A - Pours a pitch black body with two fingers worth of mocha foam. Settles out into a thin cap. Moderate lacing and retention. 
S - Starts off with the bourbon...oak, vanilla, and some char. Then some roasted malts and sweet cocoa powder. A touch of dark fruits too. No element really dominates here, just well integration of two base beers + a barrel.
T - Just all kinds of balance going on here. Smooth vanilla and oak, a bit of a bourbon butterscotch, lightly bitter coffee beans, and dry cocoa powder. A little bit of everything here. Finishes with a real faint but pleasant alcohol warmth.
M - Creamy, smooth, and decadent....thank you Double Cream stout! Surprisingly high drinkability compared to other BA stouts.
O - Perhaps the most balanced and easy drinking BA stout I have ever had. This is a damn impressive beer and I wish I somehow had year round access to this. Forever ISO, but I still prefer BCBS for its unrelenting bourbon element. 1,088 charactersdavey101, Mar 26, 2013

A - pours a solid black with about an half an inch of light coffee colored head
S - right up front there is a boozy smell showing the alcohol but gives way to a mixture of chocolate, coffee smell with a little vanilla and very little roastiness. Kind of a sweet smell once you get past the bourbon scent
T - the taste of this beer is amazing. Right off the bat was the bourbon but that faded quickly as the chocolate came through. Pretty rich taste without it being sweet. Notes of caramel and vanilla mixed in with a malty, roasty quality to it. 
M - the feel of this stout lingers and leaves with a rich, creamy taste. Very smooth going down. I didn't pick up any carbonation.
O - this is a really good stout. Its no wonder I've heard so much about it. There are a lot of stouts out there that really give you a shot of bourbon or booze that tends to take center stage in front of the other qualities. I was a little concerned that this one would follow suit but it was a pleasant surprise as to how much chocolate came through without it being too sweet. Very easy to drink and very well balanced.

Pours oil black with a thin quarter finger cap of mocha head. A few dots and veins of lace. 
Smells of sweet vanilla, bourbon, chocolate and roasty malts. Very inviting. 
The taste doesn't disappoint. Smooth, sweet boubon, oaky vanilla, dark chocolate, creamed coffee, dates/figs, leather and syrup. Booze is near non-existent. Phenominal depth and balance. 
Smooth, creamy, medium heavy body yet lighter than expected. Nice light carbonation. The elixir coats the tongue and lingers for a long bourbon soaked, chocolate covered dates aftertaste. 
Outstanding. I'm a fan of Bell's stouts and this is by far my favorite. Wonderful balance between the roasty, chocolatey malts and sweet barrel character. After getting shut out of all of the local stores supply, I'm very happy to have gotten to try this. Definately worth seeking out to try. 938 charactersThickNStout, Mar 22, 2013

Glad I finally get the chance to try this beer. Split a bottle amongst friends at my favorite bottle shop. Served lightly chilled.
A) Definitely black on the pour. There was not much had generated, maybe a half finger. It was dark tan in color, and settled quickly to a collar.
S) Needed to warm up a bit, but once it did the aroma really opened up, and was very pleasant. There is vanilla, bourbon, bit of roast, it's definitely got some of that oak barrel woody aroma to it. There's some chocolate too. The chocolate was more noticeable at near room temp.
T) Follows the nose nicely. Pleasantly chocolatey, vanilla sweetness, light roast, oak barrel, and bourbon. The 11.5 ABV is well hidden. The quality of this stout's aroma and taste is reminiscent of BCBS.
M) Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. This is very smooth, very supple, very soft, very easy to drink. No alcohol burn. Nice aftertaste.
O) Ranks right up there with any other barrel aged stout I have had the pleasure to drink. I certainly wish I could get a hold of a few more bottles. Glad to recommend. 1,095 charactersRoamingGnome, Mar 21, 2013

4.66/5  rDev +3.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 12 oz bottle into a snifter. Acquired in a trade with t4haughton.. thanks dude!
A- Pours a deep brown pour, once it's in the glass it's jet black and opaque. The head is mocha brown, modest and about 1/2" and reduces after about 30 seconds to a brown ring. 
S- The aroma is amazing - It's vanilla-bourbon forward, the best way I can describe it is a freshly made Belgian waffle with french vanilla ice cream and maple syrup. There's also coffee and chocolate mixed in there. Dialed in some dark fruits on a whiff, but they're chilling way back there. Extremely inviting, my mouth is watering. 
T- Milk chocolate bourbon vanilla, caramel upfront, progresses into a more bittersweet chocolate and roasted coffee flavor. The finish is just what I like in a BB stout - it's roasty and delicious. The alcohol is subtle for 11.5 ABV. 
M- Medium-heavy body, not quite as heavy as BCBS but creamy and silky. Low carbonation.
I can see why this beer ranks so high.. it's complex and flavorful. Definitely one of the more bourbon forward BA stouts that I've tried. Try it if you like this style! 1,104 charactersgcamparone, Mar 19, 2013
4.64/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes. Poured from 12 oz. bottle into a CCB pint glass.
A: Pours a very dark brown, basically opaque. A half-finger medium brown head forms, and there is no visible carbonation.
S: Chocolate, bourbon, vanilla (from the oak?), leather & tobacco. Overall impression is that of moderate sweetness.
T: Follows the nose exactly. Maybe more pronounced cacao and coffee mixed with the chocolate, vanilla, oak and bourbon. Hang is sweet, with lingering bourbon and oak.
M: Thick body, almost chewy, sticky. Moderate alcohol for style, low carbonation sensation. Silky smooth mouthfeel. I would give it a 6 here if I could.
O: Awesome. This lives up to every bit of its reputation. 691 charactersmacrosmatic, Mar 18, 2013

Always been a huge fan of Expedition and this is one I’ve sought for many years, excited to have a chance to try it (and thanks to Bell’s for the 12oz package and distribution!)
Pours black with a two finger brown head that settles to a light swirly creamy cap and foamy ring, leaves short-lived lacing behind.
Aroma is a big blast of bourbon, rich dark chocolate, oak, vanilla, coffee, a bit of anise, hint of smoke. Good to very good strength.
Flavor is rich and delicious. Quite bourbon-forward, a lot of vanilla and serious chocolate, marshmallow, roasted malts, anise, some dark fruit, little caramel, rather sweet, minimal bitterness, decent alcohol bite, but fits for the style/size. Really good!
Mouthfeel is full bodied, very creamy, smooth, sticky, low to moderate carbonation.
Fantastic beer. Right up there with the big boys in the style. A real treat and worth seeking out. 957 characterselgiacomo, Mar 18, 2013

Poured into my HotD goblet... short lasting dark brown head with a thick glass coating black brew...no real lacing.. retention is pretty sad.
Huge bourbon and dark fruits... cherries and raisins... vanilla and fudgy coffee spiked brownies... very rich... a bit hot, still little cold and the EtOH is warm.
Great mix of bourbon, molasses, tons of bittersweet chocolate... some cold brewed coffee for good measure.. again the alcohol is pretty hot... lingering bourbon/vanilla and brownie sundae on the finish... just lingers forever.. pretty damn well done. Happy that this one isn't overly sweet and an insulin shot isn't needed like BT.
Light carbonation with a silky thick mouthfeel.
Wish I had more of these. I opened up a 2011 750 last weekend and it was heads and shoulders better... but I just think this brew needs time to meld.

A: It absolutely lives up to the name. Opaque. Pitch black, but not intimidating, instead it's very beautiful really. Pours with a surprisingly bright tan head that pretty quickly turns into a nice creamy ring around the glass. Looks almost like the foam on a latte. Carbonation bubbles stream up the glass to keep the ring going. Spotty lacing. Looking in the glass I can see my reflection against the blackness, again, what a beautiful beer.
S: I'm getting big time dark fruit notes on the nose, figs, and plums immediately come to mind. After the initial onslaught of dark fruit I'm getting lots of vanilla, oak, bourbon, dark chocolate, and alcohol notes.
T: Wow. Up front the dark chocolate and fig notes play perfectly together, then in the middle of the tongue I get a lot of the sweet vanilla notes. Finishes with a bitter dark chocolate/espresso flavor. Really amazing.
M: Not much to say about the mouthfeel. Velvety, creamy, not too thick. The carbonation couldn't be more perfect, moderate enough to let the size of the beer shine, but just enough to let you know you're still drinking beer, and not wine.
O: This is one of the best stouts I have ever had, and I'm only two days removed from a bottle share that included Chocolate Rain, Black Tuesday, and Bourbon County Cherry Rye. While all those beers were amazing in their on right Black Note easily stands up to them. I love the fact that Black Note is more bitter than sweet, when you get into these big monster barrel aged stouts a lot of them have the tendency to become big sweet boozy malt bombs, the balance of Black Note is impeccable. This is easily the best offering I've had from Bells. Outstanding. 1,778 charactersbifrost17, Mar 16, 2013

A- The only thing that I am not in love with in this beer is the appearance. It is beautiful in its almost blackness, but sadly the lacing falls short. This is splitting hairs.
S- The malts are so forward that it smells like some stout dribbled into some bourbon. Smoky, caramel maltiness, barrel funk, sour mash, blackstrap, tobacco. This shit is right on. The licorice-y notes almost remind me of amaretto or Dr. Pepper
T- Wow. Absolutely perfect balance. That is between alcohol, sweetness, and barrel, with the hop spiciness reigning it in in the finish, really making it a true pleasure to drink. Why did I only trade for two 12ozers?!?! Coffee, watered down bourbon, great barrel character. Boozy finish.
M- Straight up bourbon tingle, heavy viscosity. So smooth.
This beer is amazing. It really has a great brewmasters touch and intuition. It is not specific as to how long Black Note is aged, but this 2012 is so nuanced that it seems very richly aged. Must force myself to save the other 12 oz for a special occasion and drink Peruvian Morning to get my fix until then. 1,131 charactershopoilcrazy, Mar 12, 2013
4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Consumed on March 11th, 2013 at 50 degrees F in my trusty Triple Petrus snifter. Thanks to Vurt for the bottle.
Beer pours a very dark brown: one shade lighter than black. Super-deep maroon highlights. A smallish light brown head forms and is gone almost instantly, leaving behind only a tiny crown that encircles the brew and leaves minimal trace behind. A gentle swirl reveals that this beer has some legs.
Aroma - bourbon is the primary component, but it's a modulated component, leaving room for some plum and chocolate notes.
Flavor is a bit salty and soy-sauce-like. Smooth bitter chocolate, some fleeting and creamy lactic notes, dates/plums and a wood mingle with leather and a touch of tobacco. Bourbon is mostly absent from the palate. Not especially boozy, all the flavors mingle and merge with none being especially dominant.
Mouthfeel is thick and slick with a little alcohol heat. Warming after a few sips. A little more carbonation would have been amazing...
Certainly the best use I have ever encountered for Expedition Stout, a beer I don't enjoy on its own. Goose Island's Bourbon County Stout is still the standard for this style as far as I'm concerned, but this is a fine, fine effort. Everyone, keep trying to top BCS! 1,245 characterscharlzm, Mar 12, 2013

A pitch black body, a fat khaki head that recedes quickly and leaves a nice round circle around the glass. 
Smell is of watery bourbon, like the stuff i want to drink straight. Stiff & bold - Huge chocolate, cream, oak, and maybe some vanilla.
Taste is of rich chocolate, bourbon, oak, cookies & cream, coffee, and dark fruit.
Mouthfeel is very creamy, rich, and boozy. Moderate carbonation.

2012 vintage. 12oz bottle poured into a CBS snifter. Served near cellar temp (~55 deg).
A: Pours thick and black. Half a finger of tan head that didn’t hang around too long, leaving an oil slick behind. Decent ring of bubbles around the edge throughout. Prominent alcohol legs. Nothing extreme.
S: Not as much alcoholic bourbon as I expected. Cocoa nibs, molasses, licorice and some dark fruit are most noticeable. An additional tinge of sweetness that I can’t identify.
T: Tremendous. Chocolate, a little bitter roast coffee, some dark fruit, vanilla, a touch of caramel/toffee. The sweetness and bitterness are wonderfully balanced. The bourbon and barrel characteristics are there, but I can’t get over how integrated they are with the entire spectrum of flavors. Moderate warming alcohol in the finish.
M: Creamy, more creamy than most oily BA beers that I have tasted. Low-to-medium carb. Full-bodied. Finishes dry and alcoholic.
O: One of those rare beers that just gets everything right. Feels great, tastes great. A harmony of extreme flavors...which is difficult. Worthy of the attention it gets. 1,154 charactersmjtiernan, Mar 03, 2013

Appearance- Oily and dark, viscous, but a shade lighter than other BA stouts. Dark, dark espresso brown. One finger of beige head yields to a foamy veil atop the brew. As you drink, it dissipates further into a halo around the glass, leaving lots of lacing on the glass.
Smell- Caramel-coffee-toffee-creme brûlée. Big complex nose with a hint of bourbon heat. Roasty, roasty malts creep in. This smells awesome. One of the best.
Taste- Big boozy hit. Surprisingly more red wine than bourbon here. Fruity booze yields to a smooth 80 proof bourbon finish. What follows is awesome. Roasty espresso, big caramelly dark chocolate notes- think a chocolate riesen candy. Big strong Madagascar vanilla, creme brûlée and a blunt, dry roasty malt finish. Amazing.
Mouthfeel- Oily, smooth, creamy. A mouth-coating tingly whiskey burn that you really don't want to go away. Akin to the style with just a bit more.
Overall. One of the best, hands down. Extremely grateful that I was able to stumble on this (surprisingly) left over from a tap-takeover. The description does it justice, but this beer is so much more. If you have a chance to try this, try it. It will not disappoint. I thought CBS was the bar for the style, but this changes things. A shred more accessible than others of its ilk, this brings more Michigan BA stout firepower to the table. Drink this. Period. Thanks a ton Bell's! 1,465 charactersSaisonRichBiere, Mar 02, 2013

As the glass arrived, it resembled a glass full of crude oil. Just looking at it I can tell it is syrupy and thick; the head is dark, reddish bruise-black. The head is a thin layer of microscopic bubbles that I can only imagine seeing in places like te La Brea Tar Pits.
Smells like vanilla-cinnamon-chocolate-coffee spiked with a sweet, wheated bourbon. There's a nice coffee aroma as well. It's big and sweet.
The flavor is a boozy bourbon bomb at first, followed with a balanced chicory and smoky sweetness. The vanilla notes come out shrouded in a caramelly, dark roast coffee finish. It finishes surprisingly dry for all that's going on here. This is a real treat for the tastebuds.
Mouthfeel is effortless for as boozy as this is; nice, oily, and smooth sipping.
Overall I am blown away by this. I've had CBS and KBS, and this tops out with both of them; however I like this better than KBS. This is a real treat to find on draft. Amazing beer. 985 charactersFanhitter, Mar 02, 2013

Less than a finger of thick dark tan mocha head, pretty much disappears after just a few minutes, maybe not even that long, leaving a very thin ring around the glass. Very minimal lacing. Black coffee coloring, with small traces of red, very small traces.
Nose really opens up as this thing warms a bit. At first a little one dimensional, with a flat roasted character present up front. After the pour, bourbon, vanilla, molasses, dark fruits, some coffee and chocolate, and whole host of other aromas announce themselves, giving Black Note a super complex, yet balanced overall aroma. There are earth tones in there, as well. Even a bit of tobacco.
Taste is equally complex and balanced, but not quite as amazing. Everything in the nose combines to create a very enjoyable flavor profile, but nothing is too prominent. It's all very balanced. I do find myself looking for something extra, more robust. It's not too hot, either.
Feel's smooth and velvety up front with a chalky finish, if that is possible. Somewhat hoppy and bitter at the same time. Carbonation is definitely noticeable. 
Overall, I do really enjoy Black Note. It's complexity and uniqueness lend it something other bba stouts do not have. It's definitely not as smooth as some others I've had , but it's amazing in its own right. Cheers. 1,364 charactersrodlavers, Mar 01, 2013

2012.
Pours jet black with hardly any head.
Nose is the sweetest of Carmelly bourbon. Vanilla, oak, delicious.
Taste brings out dark fruits that weren't present in the nose but otherwise it's more of that very carmelly bourbon. Booze is well incorporated. Smoothest vanilla, some cola, hint of smoke.
Mouthfeel is extremely smooth, full bodied, light alcohol prick that doesn't detract from the taste.
Overall this beer is fantastically balanced for how big it is. Superb. 517 charactersnatemort13, Feb 28, 2013

Bottle dated 2/28/12, so this bottle is almost a year old. Happy birthday you little minx.
Looks like a stout.
Massive wave of dark fruits hit you on the pour, mainly in the form of prune and plum. Light char and ash mix with vanilla and rich fudge. Tannic laced alcohol heat as well. One the sweeter side, maybe this is the prominence of the aging on the double cream stout? Truth be told I cannot remember the last time I had an Expedition....this calls for future exploration.
Sweet dry fruit and chocolate cake batter. Again the Double Cream stout flexes its relative muscle. Alcohol is abundant but not overwhelming. Vanilla molested plums and raisin. Bourbon is well woven and not abrasively in your face. I would not deem this a bourbon bomb. More milk chocolate than dark with a light oak on the end that hints at the barrel aging as well. 
Not overly thick and syrupy, more towards medium bodied if not veering towards lighter bodied. Rather airy and smooth while not weighing you down.
Overall, this is pretty solid. I like bourbon beers that show nuance and aren't all brawn and no brains. This fits that category well. However, I find Double Cream stout borderline cloying and its inclusion here does steer this beer into a fairly sweet realm. Love 12 oz barrel aged beers and am thankful to have the opportunity. 1,426 charactersBarrytheBear, Feb 28, 2013

The nose is fully expressed in the taste, rich dark fruits, chocolate, coffee, and caramel are all present and craftfully balanced. I've had the pleasure to try KBS, Expedition, and CBS, and would remark that this deserves its place among them. I would say the general flavor palate is quite similar but differs a fair bit in mouthfeel and richess, especially when compared to K/CBS. Compared to those it is much less rich, lacks the sort of near-syrupy richness of CBS or the earthy depth of KBS. There is also a much smoother touch of fine carbonation, more than K/CBS. 
I had just as hard a time finding this as I did finding its cousins. Certainly glad I finally got to see what the hype is about. For some, this will certainly be perfect, (to those who find CBS or KBS simply too much) and others might find it lacking when compared to those, though somewhat similar in terms of flavor. Would I buy this again if I had the chance? Yes. Is it Bells best? I wouldn't say so, but it is certainly up there. Is it an absolutely fantastically crafted stout? WIthout a doubt. Cheers! 1,297 characterssrv33, Feb 26, 2013

Overall- great bourbon profile! This is how to age beer in a barrel. One of the best bourbon beers I've had. Too bad I was only able to get my hands on one bottle. Hopefully they increase production of this next year. Being a bourbon guy, beer doesn't get much better than this. 4.75 770 charactersscreamking, Feb 25, 2013

Poured from the bottle into a Westbrook tulip.
A: Pours black as oil and just as thick. Very thin tan head. Mild lacing.
S: Mostly vanilla and oak at the start. Maybe a little roastiness. Some mild coconut.
T: As you would expect, the vanilla, oaky, bourbon booziness is the first thing you taste. While it is prevalent, it isn't overwhelming like many of the bourbon barrel imperial stouts I've had. A nice sweetness but not cloying. Some mild warming in the chest but no burn. It's faint but there is some mild chocolate, roasted coffee, coconut, and dark fruit (raisins?) as the bourbon notes fade away. They become a little more prevalent as the beer warms. Roasted flavor and maybe some mild oak flavors stick around for a little while.
M: Very smooth, silky, creamy. Carbonation is mild but it is there.
O: This is a truly great bourbon barrel aged imperial stout. The bourbon character is there, but is not overwhelming. This makes it a pretty drinkable despite the 11.5% ABV. Definitely the best BBA stout I've had to this point. Worth making the effort to get if you haven't had it. 1,200 charactersFUwolfpacker, Feb 24, 2013

Forms a small mocha colored head that doesn't bother to stick around for long, receding fairly quickly to not even a hint of surface coating, leaving only a glossy, black liquid in the glass. Only a speck or two of lacing. 
S: Aroma is sweet and boozy; a mix of chocolate, vanilla, molasses, fig, and a very slight mintyness.
T: Taste is sweet and chocolatey, with a bourbon kick. Actually this is the most chocolatey bourbon barrel aged stout I've ever come across. Flavor is sweet with notes of vanilla, raisin, plum, anise, and milk chocolate. A mix of alcohol and brown sugar sweetness on the finish 
M: Very smooth, almost velvety, with a lower carbonation level. A bit boozy, but still a fairly mellow beer. 
O: This beer reminded me of some sort of nouveau bourbon-infused chocolate dessert. Sweet and chocolatey with a pleasant bourbon quality to round it out. Would make a nice dessert, but its not exactly what I'm looking for in a beer. 970 charactersFlorida9, Feb 23, 2013

Soft bourbon and oak notes with a great deal of layered notes in the aroma. The taste is equally full, with a breadth of flavors which compliment. This is one of the easiest drinking beers I've ever had and the -bal compliments the base beer nicely without adding a strong 'booze' presence.
Mouthfeel is solid, if unspectacular. Light up front but a touch sticky at the end. Really, quite light given the complexity, robust flavors and abv. I'm actually more impressed that it's this light on the palate.
Damn fine all around.

O- wow I'm glad I spent so long trying to track this down, this beer is complex, smooth, and delicious.

4.48/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from the 12oz. bottle into a large snifter glass.
Barely a whisp of faint tan head is made off the pour, but settles to a common 1mm collar while drinking. A nice little coffee cream top, with a body that is walnut black in color, just a little hint of see through around the edges.
Nose is very subtle, with hints of classic bourbon barrel aging. A controlled heat mixing with a large thick roast and caramel mix. Hints of charring thickness and booze. Hints of peanut like and salty character, Somewhat one dimensional and a little varied, but it's a good profile.
A real wonderful thickness. Great thick chocolate ganache finish on this beer, with hints of dark chocolate and bitter cocoa coating feel. A real controlled lingering very mild bitterness on the finish that lasts and lasts. Mild sweetness lingers on the tongue with this powder light heat and faint sting from a little tinge of carbonation. Incredibly coating palate and a nice dark chocolate. This is without question the most dark chocolate tasting brew I have had to date. The hint of sweet and punching dark bitter on this is just perfect. 
This brew is all in the aftertaste, with a real incredible chocolate rich darkness. Drinks incredibly easy for such a large stout as well. Very memorable but not for the reasons that are mentioned on the bottles description. I would be shocked if Bell's could pull this beer off on a regular basis.

As it opened, more aromas emerged. This one is an oak monster, which almost completely masks some of the more interesting notes, like hops and chocolate and fruits. Once it hits the tongue, there is an unexpected charred taste that throws this into complete disarray. This beer makes no sense to me. Neither the flavors nor the smells work together.
I wouldn't say it's unpleasant, but neither would I drink this again. There are too many well-crafted beers out there waiting for me. 683 charactersDaveAnderson, Feb 20, 2013

All the vanilla and coconut one can handle, the scent was as smooth as the feel. Very elegant in the nose, the scent is creamy and pronounced. 
The taste is as smooth and creamy as the nose would intimate. Barrel oakey flavor mixed with strong vanilla tones, there's a coconut flavor near the end. Slight hints of chocolate/caramel brownie finish it off. As good as any taste I've had in a stout.

12 oz bottle poured into Kuhnhenn tulip
Bottled on 12/28/12 
Pour: Jet black with a very minimal tan head that dissipated almost instantly. Looks like your run of the mill big bourbon stout. No lacing but alcohol legs are visible. 
Smell: Bourbon, char, oak, vanilla, some chocolate and coffee. Some dark fruits but its all about the bourbon with this one.
Taste: This is a big sweet, huge bourbon forward beer. There is oak and barrel notes throughout the entire taste profile. Vanilla and roast and I'm getting an earthy type character. Chocolate and faint coffee noted as well. 
Mouthfeel: On the heavy side of medium and not like the other big bourbon aged stouts I have had being a bit thinner. It does coat the palate with it's sweet bourbon goodness and is creamy and silky.
Overall: A very good beer and of obvious high quality. Is it the best BA stout I have had, no but a damn fine beer. Not a beer to empty your cellar over or jump through hoops to get but if it is within reach, don't hesitate to grab it. 1,060 characterssleuthdog, Feb 17, 2013

Lacing is nice enough. I gives forth sweet aromas of dark roasted malt, charred oak, licorice, cocoa, and dark fruits(cherry in particular). The taste is extraordinary. Now for the taste. Smooth vanilla fades softly into a smokey, woodsy dark chocolate flavor. Subtle hints of Plum, cherry, and licorice appear throughout. The finish shows strong notes of espresso. there is a slight warming alcohol note at the end as well, but it's gentle and enjoyable. The mouthfeel is rich and creamy. It coats the mouth and lingers on the palate. Overall, great. The alcohol is well hidden among the jungle of aromas and flavors. Buy some if you come across it. 754 characterssilverking, Feb 17, 2013

A: Thick and dark, this beer allowed no dark to shine through. Not much of a head however of what was there the color was a dark brown; it vanished to the sides quickly. Some great lacing followed.
S: Amazing aroma of dried fruit, dark chocolate, a hint of bourbon / oaky, a lot of raisin, hints of a floral aroma came through, along with some spice.
T: Sweet raisins, hints of Carmel, followed by a lot of dark fruit dipped in rich dark chocolate. a nice thick to medium body with a sweet mocha finish. Not too much bourbon present in the initial taste, but it became prominent in the after taste. Almost like a great cookie with the roasted malt, chocolate and hint of vanilla. Some dryness crept in toward the finish, but the sweetness won out. Some heat from the alcohol developed in the finish and aftertaste.
O: A great beer, I expected more bourbon, but it was a very dynamic stout with a great flavor profile. The appearance made me have my doubts but the aroma and taste won me back immediately. It only got better as it warmed. Nicely done! 1,119 charactersAlMarzo, Feb 16, 2013

A - not terribly impressive. Pours like an RIS, black with a little head, dark brown, recedes abnormally quickly. Not bad, but nothing super notable.
S - pretty delicious. A lot of bourbon on the nose, similar to Backwoods Bastard, if I had to compare it to anything else. A little sourness; I assume it's got a subdued hop profile. Malt forward, and very rich. 
T - great, one of the most BBA-forward beers I've ever had. Lots of sweet, sticky whiskey with just a little malt on the end. An almost truly complete profile, delicious. Very negligible points off for the wood notes dominating the base. 
M - smooth, smooth, smooth. Alcohol and carbonation are incredibly balanced; drinks dangerously easily. Sweetness sticks to the cheeks in a very pleasant way. I wish I had three hundred bottles of this instead of just three (now two). 
O - excellent beer, one of my favorite BBA stouts. This is my first bottle; I look forward to getting some year in and year out, or at least asking my Mom to! 1,189 charactersJamesShoemaker, Feb 15, 2013

Where the beers of Expedition and Double Cream are fantastic in their own right, they have room for improvement. Their fusion and the bourbon barrel aging propels the taste into the stratosphere. 
The "Expedition" appearance gives Black Note the majority of its attributes: extremely dark black with a deep mirror-like reflection, insisting on its clarity. But more like the "Double Cream" the beer's head is slow an creamy on its release. The dainty espresso-like creme dissolves back into the beer and is regenerated with a swirl of the snifter. The beer prefers brandy-like legging to any lace. This is one manly looking beer.
Freshly ground espresso and cocoa bean give the beer its strongly roasted scent. But burnt molasses notes provide malty underpinnings and weave into the barrel character seamlessly. Oak, barrel-derived caramel, vanilla, and heavy whipping cream become the bridge that connects the beer's scents. As the stout warms, fruit notes that are reminiscent in Expedition emerge here with vinous wine-like tang, blackcurrant, and raspberry. The fruits accompany the strong bourbon alcohol scent for an overall seductive aromatic experience.
Powerful flavors seduce the taste with bold roasted chocolate and espresso. Backed with the underlying taste of whipping cream, vanilla, scorched malt sugars, and molasses, the beer seems to melt onto the mouth with complete saturation. The sweetness and strength is only tempered by vinous fruit tartness and alcohol. Cherries, tart berries, plumb, currant, and grape meet up with charred oak, sherry, and port-like flavors at mid-palate and develop into a deeply bourbon-infused taste to finish. It's incredibly powerful taste is as variant as it is stern.
The stout's taste is only matched by its body. Highly viscous, the beer oozes onto the palate with creamy warmth and port-like saturation. Its early creaminess develops into a tangy acidity to finish, but with a marshmallow and powdery dryness in between. Its long finish and extended aftertaste is chocked full of bourbon warmth, fruit tartness, and roasty acidity.
Where I often think that Expedition is a little overbearing with roast and alcohol, and the Double Cream is a little too yogurt-like, this combo gives both the finesse and fullness that each may lack. The extended bourbon barrel age has smoothed the beer and added so much complexity to make this stout an undeniable top-tier beer. 2,460 charactersBEERchitect, Feb 14, 2013

Deep toasty, nutty notes are prominent early, with lots of chocolate and a not of booze, along with a hint of roast malt at the finish. Subtle dark fruit is present in the form of cherries and plums. Vanilla and oak surface late.
Flavor is sweet, chocolatey, and raisiny, with moderate roast character. Booze is evident in the finish, along with sweet cherries. Oak emerges as it warms.
Body is syrupy and velvety, with minimal carbonation and significant alcohol warmth.
Less roast character than most, and leaning toward the sweet side. Cherry is fairly dominant near the finish. A little hot, but tasty. 713 charactersbarczar, Feb 14, 2013

4.57/5  rDev +1.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to both mcsecne (Reddit) and erric (Reddit) for bottles of this gem. 
Light fizzy darker colored head, pitch black dark beer with nice long legs, decent thick head as I swirl.
Nose is awesome, tons of dark malts, chocolate galore, some rich thick expensive Belgian chocolate, bakers choc, a little dark even, velvety too. Little espresso and coffee with a bit of roasted malt but no burnt aromas, cocoa nibs. Then barrel, some vanilla with light toasted oak, decent bourbon, little alcohol tingle. Velvety and maybe even creamy oats.
Taste starts with malts again, dark malts with syrupy dark malts, lots if creamy velvety chocolate, cocoa nibs, bakers choc, etc. The malts have a light roast, little bitter tannin char but not really burnt. Cocoa leads to barrel, light vanilla and barrel, must a touch of bourbon. Light warning tingly booze. Light bitter hops but not much. Finish is long creamy chocolate, cocoa, vanilla, light bourbon barrel, little sticky sweet with a bit more booze, so much mouth layered thick chocolate.
Mouth is big bodied, thick and creamy lush velvety, decent carb, some warming booze but doesn't drink like an 11+% beer.
Overall very nice, great base stout with tons of chocolate, nice dark malts and decent barrel but if I could complain about anything maybe a bit more bourbon as I love bourbon. 1,342 charactersjlindros, Feb 13, 2013
4.55/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Big thanks to JLindros for sharing this bottle! Poured into a Kate the Great tulip.
A - Poured a deep dark brown nearly oil with a good half finger mocha head that fades to leave light clouds and a puffy halo. Solid, solid appearance for the high ABV.
S - Aromas of a very well done but classic aroma. Good bourbon notes here but not overwhelmingly so, nice barrel and vanilla much fainter than I've grown accustomed to. Chocolate and sweeter malts with the alcohol noticeable but very downplayed for the ABV.
T - Taste is just delicious. Sweet malts, sweet bourbon and barrel notes. Chocolate and sort sweet, good quality bourbon. I appreciate that. Nice faint alcohol notes, very well planned out beer with everything working in harmony.
M - Mouthfeel is very smooth and creamy, chewy but not boozy.
O - Overall this was a very good bourbon aged stout. Very very nice, wish I had my own 6 pack to enjoy! Well done! 921 charactersrudzud, Feb 13, 2013
4.93/5  rDev +9.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 52012 12 oz bottle
A: Pours jet black, slight head that instantaneously dissipates. Some alcohol legs 
S: Balances, a bit muted but well rounded charred oak, fig, roasted malt
T: roast, oak, charred wood, fig, a bit of chocolate and coffee. More of an earthy dry taste than a caramel/toffee sweetness that's sometimes seen in other BB stouts. 
M: Very well balanced stout. Coats mouth nicely but not sticky. Full body.
Overall: Fantastic beer. One of the best stouts I've had, let alone bourbon barrel stout. This and BCBS are a near tie for perfection. I also really love the 12 oz format of the 2012 batch. If you have a chance to try this stout do not pass it up! 670 charactersmjohnson17, Feb 12, 2013

Thank you to every single person and thing and event that allowed black note to cross the threshold of my mouth. Especially the stranger at the bar and my friend with whom I tried this.
A: Solid black with a faint brown ring of head that is all but completely absent. Little carbonation as this was poured into a growler at the brewery and transported all the way to california before being poured into a snifter.
S: Old yeast and dark bittersweet chocolate, very reminiscent of Older Viscosity, as well as vanilla, roasted malt, oak and alcohol in the nose.
T: Anise, oak, vanilla, dark bittersweet chocolate, medium roast coffee, alcohol. Absolutely delicious. A near paragon of the bourbon barrel aged imperial stout style. Lacks the strong vanilla character I love about the style, as well as caramel and is a bit more faint in oak than I'd prefer.
M: Literally perfect for an imperial stout, to my taste. The fullest of silky, creamy smooth bodies coats the mouth.
O: Rich, hearty, delicious, and impossible to find. Just barely overrated (it isn't really a 100, but then again they inflate ratings on this website, which is unnecessary and stupid). Recommended? If you can find it. I feel my luck may have reached the apex of it's potential given that such an odd way of coming upon a taste of this beer was the result of layer upon layer of sheer happenstance. But enough about me. This beer is amazing. 1,508 charactersBierJager89, Feb 11, 2013
4.56/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a small snifter from a growler of unknown provenance. Thanks stranger at the bar.
4A: Completely dark. No head. Some clinging lace.
4.25S: Rich, deep, dark bourbon, flat malt and stale yeast. A little like an old ale. The barrel aging seems to have mellowed all aspects but heightened the sweetness. Slightly pungent alcohol.
4.5T/5M: Absolutely fucking luxurious. It envelops the mouth the way silk sheets might cradle an emperor. The Double Cream Stout sweetness shines and is accentuated by the bourbon barrels, but the darker, bitterer anise and dark chocolate and hints of creamy coffee from Expedition Stout are also noticeable. I don't even miss the carbonation because this beer is so full and sexy and caressing. The aftertaste is dry and more bitter than the rest of the beer.
5O: This is truly magnificent and I cannot overstate how thrilled I am to finally try it. Definitely recommended. Best bourbon barrel aged beer I've had.
EDIT 16 Jan 2015: Poured from a 12 ounce bottle into a St Bernadus goblet. 2012 vintage. Bottle 28 Dec 2012.
4A: As above.
4.5S: Smells  slightly sharper, but also richer. Dark malts, only a hint of old ale yeast.
4.75T/4.75M: Oh gods. As above, but sharper and more carbonated around the edges. Still velvety.
5O: Still incredible. 1,294 charactersAgentMunky, Feb 11, 2013

S: Chocolate, light whiff of licorice, coffee and a light booze sting
T: Big coffee upfront with chocolate, black licorice and roasted notes. Light addiions of dark fruit in the background. I felt any barrel was really backseat on this bottle but then again I had been consuming bookoo stouts. But really, I perceived more velvety stout qualities than I did barrel so that was a hit for me. 
M: Full bodied, low to medium carbonation, yet I felt it was a bit thin going down. Its not as full or thick as I expected from the pour
O: A good beer but I have been drink a lot of Kalamazoo lately and I actually enjoy it over this Imperial Stout. Odd huh? 759 charactersbarleywinefiend, Feb 10, 2013
4.29/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.2512 oz bottle poured into small Eclipse snifter glass. 2012. Pours a pitch black color with a tiny light brown/tan head that disappears quickly. Scent is sweet vanilla and bourbon up front. A little oak and cherry aroma with some bitter chocolate and dark fruits. Roasted espresso as well. More vanilla lingering in the nose with a bit of toffee. Taste immediately reminded me of a BA stout I've had on multiple occasions. The initial flavors remind me of some of the Eclipse variants, where the overall beer remind me of Parabola (somewhat). Bitter chocolate up front with some nice bourbon flavors (and burn). Sweet vanilla with some sherry and oak flavors. A hint of coconut with some boozy whiskey flavors. More chocolate and a bit of roasted espresso in the finish. Mouthfeel starts out very nice, but tends to be a bit thin in the finish. Drinkability is pretty high for such a high ABV BA imperial stout. Overall, this beer is a great one. I guess for how hard the 750ml bottles were to get, I expected a little more. I absolutely love Parabola and rated it very highly. Although the flavor of this beer remind of Parabola in a way, I feel it is not on the same level. Solid beer overall, and I am VERY glad I scored me a four-pack via trade. 1,248 charactersDovaliHops, Feb 10, 2013

A - pours a viscous black color with almost no head. The froth that does come is caramel in color and appears like a snowflake. Great lacing. 
S - some booze with bourbon and a hint of licorice. Some nice malty aroma with hints of nut and chocolate (very small). Expressi in there too. 
T - a malty bourbon delight with some nice caramel overtones going down. Very pleasing to the palate and dances around like silk. 
M - very smooth and delightful with mild to medium carbonation.

poured out of a 12oz bottle, little to no head is present, but carbonation is perfectly fine (low) for the style. dark dark brown and pretty darn thick
smells of bourbon, chocolate and some roasted barley, and tastes just like it smells. smooth like butter on the mouth, alcohol is detectable but not more than expected. overall, a delicious beer that im happy to have more of

A- As black as they come. A quarter finger of a khaki colored head. Impressive alcohol legs.
S- A roasted malt and a massive creamy caramel. A ton of bourbon and sour mash. A slight oak. Just soo smooth smelling I could smell this brew all day.
T- A slight sting of bitternes at first followed by a nice heap of roasted malt. The Bourbon takes over and dominates the palate. A big sour mash character. A slight alcohol feel and a charred oak flavor. There is a big caramel and underlying toffee note. Its rather well balanced and perfectly blended. This is a bourbon forward beer which is what I love. 
M- Lots of alcohol feel. Drinkable and smooth. Thick and syrupy. 
O- A fantastic Barrel aged stout, one of the best out there. I Barely got a hold of this beer. Hope the amp up the production of this brew. If I can get KBS and BCBS, I shouldn't have a problem getting a Bell's brew. Make more please Bells. 962 charactersTwelveOunces, Feb 04, 2013

A - deep oil black with a nice mocha head that sits after an aggressive pour before shrinking; still present throughout consumption; outstanding lacing.
S - oak and bourbon! Some dried fig notes; molasses; chocolate, coffee, and malt.
T - bourbon and oak! Vanilla, chocolate, mocha, molasses, a touch of black licorice; the booze is there but the flavors are so tasty and balanced that its not over the top alcohol flavors at 11+%
M - the mouthfeel on black note is similar to BCBS, although far less syrupy; it's heavy but creamy; perfect carbonation; smooth; extremely clean finish; fantastic drinkability
O - this beer is the real deal; it's amazingly balanced; full of flavor; it's basically a more drinkable bourbon county without any cloying sweetness and a perfect abv; this will warm you up while leave you wanting more; extremely impressive beer from Bells! 1,072 charactersSkeeterBoganski, Feb 03, 2013

Poured from the 12 oz bottle into a large snifter glass. About one finger thick dark tan almost shining brown colored head that settles slowly into a thin layer. Thick oily dark brown colored appearance while pouring. Darkest of black inside the glass. Truly is a black note. Calm inside the glass, heavy and viscous. Very good lacing on the sides with each sip.
Smell is fantastic. One of the best smelling Imperial Stout. A lot of chocolate and very apparent bourbon barrel aged notes. Some vanilla that is anticipated. No traces of alcohol. Extremely good burnt up malts and very slight amount of coffee. Too much bourbon heavy. Sweetness and maltiness is also present. 
Taste is pretty much the reflection of the nose. Very smooth, lacking booze altogether. Typical Bourbon finish. Burnt up notes are low. Bourbon, wood, vanilla and chocolate in the flavor. Awesome taste overall. Low on the hops so bitterness is only mild. Dry and slightly burnt up finish.
Mouth feel is very much on the full and thick side. Drinks pretty easy, High on alcohol, but no real burning sensation or feel. No astringency of any kind. At 11.8% it drinks very smooth and won't let you feel anything. Provides good amount of warmth. Perfect for the snow season. 
A lot of price for an excellent beer. Comes very near BCBS but does not quite deliver the extra value.

Brewed a little over a month before the date of this tasting (“PKGD 12/28/12).
A: Pours a slick dark brown, nearly black, with a surprisingly watery appearance. The only head to appear are some fizzy soda bubbles along the edge of the glass; slight wet lacing.
S: Sweet vanilla nougat and caramel candy tones with a flowing backdrop of woody bourbon. Overall, the aroma is malty as hell, but the booze and roast make the sugars manageable. Hints of hickory smoke, baking chocolate, and Irish cream play along the edges. Hints of slight oxidation appear in small, sparse doses, giving a cardboard scent.
T: A slow-building masterwork, this palate begins with a luscious wave of residual sugars: tastes of syrupy caramel and vanilla abound. As in the nose, it’s a candy sweetness. Soon after these sugars lay down as the body of the brew, tastes of cinnamon, anise, toasted coconut, and bitter chocolate shift the palate to a character of soft spice, a quick transition to the dark, roasty, finish. In a final burst of flavor, powerful tones of smoke, chili pepper, black coffee, and burnt toast overwhelm the sense and bring this beer to a staggeringly smoked end. Charred bourbon barrel tastes linger in a moderate aftertaste of oak, smoke, and astringent whiskey, along with a dried-out sugar flavor akin to cola.
M: Feels like it looks, actually – a little thinner than expected. With the hidden alcohol and all the residual sugars, it really drinks more like root beer at first. Light, foamy carbonation.
O: A good stout is never unwelcome in January, and this one hit the spot. If you like smoke and barrel, this is your beer – I really thought I’d be able to pick out the beers that go into this blend, but the whiskey pulls it together in one big, woody package. Nothing average here. 1,998 charactersBarryMFBurton, Feb 02, 2013
4.08/5  rDev -9.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Pitch black, little to no head.  OK for ABV.  
Aroma: Medium+ aroma of caramel, oak, bourbon, and chocolate notes with a background of light roast malt.
Flavor: Pretty apparent booze, more roast on the palate than the nose.  Oak/bourbon are covered by other flavors.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied, but perceived a bit drier from the booze.

4.29/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25The thing that hit me about this beer was the aroma. As soon as I opened the bottle I got a very sweet smell: brown sugar, vanilla, chocolate. Pours motor oil black and a one finger head disappears rather quickly. The taste is a nice combination of sweet and bourbon, with a nice bourbon finish. I've had barrel aged stouts that are either too sweet or too bourbon tasting on the finish, but this one has a nice interplay of the two. The subtle various sweet flavors, coffee, and bourbon all work very nicely together. I feel fortunate to have picked up a 4-pack. 563 characterschrisrrob, Feb 01, 2013
4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Poured from 12 oz. bottle into Central Waters snifter. 
A: Pours a deep black with no light getting through. Creamy tan cocoa colored head sits on the rim of the glass for almost the entire drinking process. Leaves some very impressive lacing around the edge of the glass. Rather small bubbles with some oddly configured shapes slowly working their way down to the liquid. 
N: There is a surprising amount of hop on the nose, must be coming from the Expedition. The bourbon is really up front on the nose. Man, this is honestly the first time I've really sat down and dissected this beer. When the beer is at about 55 degrees, the complex layers of oak and creamy depth come forward. Dark fruits blend well with nice chocolate, vanilla, and touches of bitter molasses. 
T: The taste is more of those dark fruit notes, a touch of bitter chocolate, and a bit of sherry/alcohol. The oak is very present, with some drying qualities, yet the creamy, light flavor balance that out nicely. It's almost juicy, kind of chocolate milk like. 
M: Creamy mouthfeel, with proper carbonation. Bit on the low side, that allows the beautiful oak and bourbon to come through, and isn't too busy on the mouth. 
D and O: This really is a nice barrel aged stout. I feel it lacks a bit of depth and complexity as some of the other World Class stouts, but it's close. A real treat. 1,363 charactersMarcatGSB, Feb 01, 2013

a- looks like a barrel aged stout should. pitch black with no light shining through. dark khaki foam rises and falls quickly leaving just a light tan ring around the outside of the glass.
s- bourbon notes are the first thing that hits me, but lots of chocolate, vanilla, oak, slight dark fruit. smells complex and delicous
t- obvious bourbon and barrel notes. lots of chocolate sweetness, but not cloyingly so. roasted malt and dark fruit similar to the nose. a bit of booze at the end, but not overly harsh. nice complex flavor profile
m- nice viscocity, but not overly thick like some of the other big barrel aged stouts. nice lingering flavors with just a bit of boozy tingle. 
overall a very nice beer once again from bells. im not willing to put it above some of the other heavy hitters like bcbs, but it is well above average. im glad I have a couple to cellar for a year or two and see how this beer changes and mellows a bit. 1,001 characterscrewfan16, Feb 01, 2013

A: A deep black stout with a mocha colored head that dissipates rather quickly. An impenetrable black to the edges of the glass.
S: Vanilla, bourbon/bourbon cask, dark dried fruits, a slight alcohol burn to the back of the nose.
T: Sweet, very sweet, maybe too sweet. Bourbon notes, vanilla, chocolate. The vanilla sweetness is out of balance with the bourbon notes, dried fruit and chocolate.
M: The mouthfeel is very nice. Soft and creamy, but leans towards the thinner side.
O: A very enjoyable BA imperial stout. Worthy of the pursuit. 609 charactersbozodogbreath, Feb 01, 2013

A: Pours a shiny black body with a very small chocolate-colored head.
S: Rich notes of milk chocolate, oak and bourbon, light cherry. Very chocolatey with a hint of fruit.
T: Taste comprises dry oak, bitter roasted grain, light raisins, dark chocolate, some tannic caramel, dark alcohol on the end.
M: Between medium and thick-bodied with moderate carbonation.
O: Although the aroma and feel are quite nice, I wasn't as impressed by the taste as I could have been. I can think of a bunch of other stouts that have better barrel characters. Still a very good barrel-aged stout. 607 charactersEtan, Jan 30, 2013

Poured this beer into a balloon glass at room temperature. With a very vigorous pour, I am able to coax two fingers worth of mocha colored head to rise from this black, abysmal beer. The head receded quickly to a tight creamy layer that doesn't appear to leave any lacing behind.
The aroma is more gentle than I expected. The bourbon is obvious and the first thing that I can smell. Deeper into the aroma, I can pick out more complex hints of dark chocolate, oak, anisette, molasses, brown sugar and bruised fruit (banana and peaches).
The taste is complex as all hell. The flavor profile is huge and goes through waves of changes after the first swallow. Up front, it is reminiscent of chocolate milk. The soft, almost creamy texture helps that initial impression. After that, a prominent booziness shines through and dominates the palette, especially in the exhale. It is toasty, oaky, and similar to chocolate covered raisins. The brash alcohol on the exhale brings no real heat, but lends a solvent flavor that creates the impression of whisky-soaked black cherries. I am glad there is no heat, because I am already not a fan of this booziness. The finish brings smokiness, bourbon, oak, vanilla, and roasted malts.
Viscous mouthfeel, creamy; not sticky, but smooth. I almost feel like this would pass as an Irish Dry Stout without the flavor component. Very solid example and just an incredible example of this style.
I found Black Note Stout to be a good beer. Not "World-Class" but most certainly worth purchase again. I bet that a few years on this beer might help it out a little bit. As another BA said on here already, this beer is an above average beer, but not worth emptying your cellar for. Pretty standard Bouron-Barrel-Aged Imperial Stout if you ask me. Tasty for sure, but is a bit middle of the road. I actually liked Victory Dark Intrigue more than this... 1,934 charactersMusicaleMike, Jan 26, 2013

A - dark as midnight with a nice mocha colored head, nice sticky lacing and a thin cap remain
S - very complex, dark roasted malt, light coffee, nice BA note with a touch of bittersweet chocolate and burnt sugar.
T - Wow, it changes as you hold it in your mouth. Creamy and thick with the bittersweet chocolate and dark roasted malt, just a touch of coffee. 
M - thick and chewy, not overly carbonated. Was served a bit on the cool side for me so I let it sit a bit and warmed with my hands. 
O - what a great beer, I preferred it a bit warmer than it was served. The favors and aroma really opened up around 50F. Glad to not only have it on tap, but to get some bottles to age a bit. At least for me, this is the finest stout I have ever tasted. 810 charactersDocrock, Jan 26, 2013

S-Balanced bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, coffee with faint vanilla.
T-Great balance, moderate bourbon, roasted malt, chocolate, slight coffee and slight bitterness.

This poured out as a rich looking black color with a thin brown head on top. Very quick fading retention and no lacing. The smell of the beer is big, lots of bourbon, roasted malts and some subtle vanilla in there. The taste of the beer is very rich with more vanilla, chocolate, molasses and wood. The mouthfeel is slick, kinda harsh at first but softens up as it warms. Lingering sappy finish to it also. Overall this beer is really good and really glad I got to try it finally. 523 charactersKnapp85, Jan 26, 2013

Dark and viscous, tawny mahogany edges, frothy tan foam. Little to no lacing, glassy obsidian surface. Creamy viscous feel, not overly sweet, dry and not at all cloying. Big flavors of toasted almond, dark chocolate, espresso, and toasted coconut. Dry aftertaste of almond, chocolate, and trace pipe tobacco. The base beers are harmoniously blended and sing in chorus with the barrel. Expressive and flavorful, a benchmark of the style that seems to be increasingly ubiquitous and often poorly done. Black Note is in the upper echelon of BBA stouts for sure.

Certainly is black... there's a bit of muddled clarity around the edge of the glass. A short-lived medium brown head produces a dense, stubborn collar - oily lacing above and clouded beading beneath. Very nice looking stuff.
Smooth, sweet caramel bourbon immediately shows some BCBS qualities. It's hard to really even pull in any alcohol character, a big sniff just offers a deeper layer of oak. Milk chocolate and mellow burnt brown sugar. Maybe a bit of molasses. Incredibly smooth - as smooth as you could hope for a beer like this. 
Creamy twist cone flavors covered with silky bourbon and bitter caramel. Faint leafy tobacco dries up the tail end of the palate. Coffee grounds, more milk chocolate, candy corn... pretty damn unique I'd say. This one certainly doesn't need any age but I'm excited to see what it does regardless. 
Very, very good. 950 charactersyamar68, Jan 22, 2013

4.56/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Bottle dated 12/28/12. Poured into a tulip glass.
Appearance. Pitch black. Pours with a finger of hazelnut colored head. This dissipates quickly, but there is a nice ring around the top of the glass. 
Smell. That now familiar bourbon aged smell permeates the nostrils: buttery, sweet and vanilla. An underlying layer is implies creamy milk chocolate. There is something about bourbon aging that give the smell a certain softness, a softness that expedition already has in its chocolate notes. 
Taste. Starts out with a strong punch of bittersweet chocolate. Some vanilla tinged oaky sweetness permeates the whole experience. It occasionally becomes dominant, being manifested as a toffee like flavor. Other times it fades into the background, allowing the chocolate notes of the stouts to dominate. 
Mouthfeel. Excellent creamy body is broken up just enough by tight carbonation.
I just had to review this one after having the first few sips. A very refined bourbon barrel aged beer. It gets to the level of KBS as far as balance goes, something that BCBS doesn't do for me. 1,079 charactersjtingue, Jan 20, 2013

A- black with a little red around corners. Not much head at all.
S- this is the second best part about this beer, it is intoxicating. First smell is of light bourbon and chocolate, middle you get some oak, vanilla, and caramel, finishes with coffee.
T- to me this is where I dont like this beer as much as bcbs or kbs. It has too much sweetness and bitterness, not enough chocolate ot bourbon.
M- this is the best part about this beer, so creamy and smooth. Not much carb but thats ok.
O- I like how drinkable this is, I just wish it had more of a roastyness and less sweet/bitterness. I hope some age will help that. 766 charactersfounder26, Jan 20, 2013

This pours black as night into my snifter with a slight chocolate head that dissipates quickly. Smell is intoxicatingly good, obvious bourbon, malt. The taste is what we are all here for, and this rare one actually doesn't disappoint. I I had to go to Bell's to get it, and was ready for some letdown. Clearly not the case! Let this beer warm up some, as the smooth bourbon finish really gets better as the temp rises. Caramel, and vanilla dominate the drawn out finish. Well done Bell's, well done. 615 charactersHonus1, Jan 20, 2013

The smell is really heavy on bourbon, with some other hints of vanilla and cherry. This smells like a really amazing fancy dessert. Taste has a nice blend of bourbon, buttery heavy cream, cherry, chocolate, and coffee. The alcohol isn't overbearing at all and it maintains a pretty easy drinkability.
This is very delicious and I think it definitely lives up to the immense hype surrounding it. 448 characterswebmanspidey, Jan 20, 2013

Appearance - Pours jet black - 1 finger tan head which dissipates rather quickly into a ring. Lacing is nice
Smell- Bourbon, Coffee, roasted malt
Taste - Wow - In a class by itself. A rush of flavor. Bourbon followed by coffee, followed by roasted malt , molasses. Blend together perfectly. Alcohol is there, but not overwhelming.

Alcohol is also evident in the nose. Tastes of coffee, dark dried fruits, chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, oakiness. Very well balanced and smooth. Not harsh at all, especially for being 11.5%. Nice aftertaste of vanilla that lingers in the mouth. Mouthfeel is full-bodied, velvety smooth and lightly carbonated. A world class beer from a world class brewery. I'm not sure that this could improve any more than it already is. Unless its better with age. I think I may keep some around for that. 744 characters33nickadams, Jan 19, 2013

A- Pitch black in color, pours with a nice tannish mocha head that retreats to a light ring around the glass. Some light lacing, but more of an oily sheen on the inside of the glass.
S- Smells wonderful. A nice combination of roasted malt and some smokey barrel character. Some hints of bourbon, but it is very subdued. Notes of dark fruit, chocolate, and some creamy character.
T- To be honest, it is hard to believe that Expedition stout is the base for this beer, as it has no where near the malt presence. The initial flavor is fizzy, roasted malt and booziness. I get a little chocolate, but the barrel is a little overwhelming. The bourbon does add some vanilla flavor, these may need some time to mellow.
M- A bit fizzy, and a little light bodied. Just feels slightly watery, and doesn't have a whole lot of depth. 
O- I wanted to try one of these fresh, and have to say I was slightly let down. Expedition stout is one of my all time favorite stouts, as it is just so full bodied and creamy. I feel like the barrel aging of this beer made it slightly less viscous, and at this point isn't drinking too great. The barrel is really just coming through as heat and overwhelming booziness. I definitely need to sit on a few of these for a while, and see how they develop. 1,362 charactersGfunk720, Jan 17, 2013

Glass: Snifter
From: Bell's General Store
Price: $24 a 4-pack
Appearance- Pitch black and opaque. Small tan head the faded pretty quickly and only left a lacing along the side.
Smell- Chocolate, molasses and bourbon, and a touch of sweetness
Taste- Chocolate, brown sugar, bourbon and molasses, with a finish of bitter roasted malts. Perfectly balanced and not lacking in any way.
Mouthfeel- Creamy and thick. Low carbonation and a warming finish. Exactly what it should be.
Overall- This beer is exactly what I want it to be. It is a stout no doubt with the perfect addition of bourbon. Most BBA stouts are taken over by the bourbon, while this is not a terrible thing, it still takes away from the beer. The use of Expedition and Special Double Cream gives it both a smoothness in the body but a slightly bitter finish that is perfect for the style. I couldn't and wouldn't as for anything different in a bourbon barrel aged stout. At $6 a bottle it is definitely a treat but one that I would buy a 4-pack at any opportunity. 1,051 charactersSportsandJorts, Jan 15, 2013

4.51/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.512 ounce bottle poured into 10 ounce Kentucky Bourbon Stout snifter. 
A: Motor oil black with a brownish tan head. Moderate pour yields a 1 finger head that recedes fairly quickly but leaves a constant ring around the edges of the glass. Minimal lacing left on the glass.
S: Smells sweet. Picking up vanilla, dark chocolate, brown sugar, and malt sweetness. The bourbon is apparent, but not as assertive as in some bourbon barrel aged stouts. 
T: The sweetness in the nose carries over in the taste. Chocolate syrup, brown sugar, and vanilla hit my palate first, then the bourbon makes its presence known. Doesn't carry the same roast character that is present in a beer like Bourbon Barrel Plead the Fifth, falling more on the sweet end of the continuum. The bourbon adds an interesting element to this stout blend and makes for a really nice drinking experience.
M: As expected from a big, barrel aged stout, the carbonation is fairly low in this one. Nice thickness to this beer. 
O: Really like this one and thrilled that it is available in 12 ounce bottles. Given that this is a sweeter bourbon barrel stout, the 12 ounce serving size is ideal. I'm nearing the bottom of my glass and am not tiring of the beer at all. My only critique is that I would like a bit more roast character, which is why I would give the edge to a beer like BBPt5th, KBS, or BCBS. Despite that, Black Note does not fall too far below those beers. 1,432 charactersdbc5, Jan 11, 2013

4.75/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served at room temp. An aggressively poured head dies down to a thin foam across the beer rather quickly. Whats left reminds you of the sweet crema left atop a well drawn espresso in both the color and body of the dense bubbles of the remaining head. The beer is espresso dark as well. 
Vanilla and candied brown sugar are the first things I smell which trail off to sweet bourbon. None of the smells are over powering any of the others. In searching for what sticks out the most, I smell sweet, fresh brewed coffee from a coffee house, not the kind you make at home.
Vanilla and candied brown sugar carry over immediately to the taste. Dark fruit and bourbon take the middle, front of your tongue while coffee and astringency take over the back. The bourbon is everyone but in a soft, well presented manor. It has a good woody flavor that goes along with the bourbon that I really enjoy, almost a smokey flavor.
The mouth feel is great! This beer embodies why I like BBA beers so much. None of the hot/harsh alcohols just smooth woody goodness that pairs great with those vanilla notes.
All in all, its a sweet but balanced beer. It has lots and lots of good qualities but I think I would like it much more with a year in the cellar. It's not as roasty as some of the beers it shares its company with but its better in the sweet department than they are. I try to limit giving fives but it's tempting with this one. 1,420 charactersBlissJunkie, Jan 10, 2013

M: Damn near perfect to me when considering this style. Really smooth, velvety with a small touch of alcohol on the tail end to remind you of it's ABV

A- pours a deep black with no instant carbonation. Carbonation rises slowly and forms a ring for the duration.
S- smells like sweet fig. Next a touch of bourbon barrel. Ends with a faint smell of graham cracker and possibly licorice. Smells divine.
T- my favorite part. Very well balance between roast/bourbon/ And sweetness. Pleasantly smooth bourbon that rises to the nose aft swallowing. Not much heat at all.
There is a lingering licorice/fig flavor that pleasant.
M-a little sticky, but less than I would have expected. Perfect amount of carbonation. Washes over the tongue with a slight amount of carbonation but doesn't detract from the rich flavor of the beer.
O-dark and Bourbony. Smooth and pleasant to drink. No one flavor is overwhelming. Never pass this beer up. 843 charactersaaronplayford, Dec 29, 2012

Hard pour gives only the slightest head which immediately fades into a tiny ring of white bubbles. A little bit of action from the nucleation point in the middle of the glass, but otherwise its pretty much still and black. Very dark brown while pouring but opaque in the glass. Minimal lacing.
Aroma is sweet, bourbon, vanilla. Very appealing, but fewer layers than expected.
That same aroma follows through but with a lot more complexity from the roastiness of the stout. Still favoring the sweeter elements up from, the finish has a long bitterness from the roast and a little alcohol. Cacao/dark chocolate, light oak. The sweetness ends up being balanced by the alcohol/roast, but this is still on the sweeter side.
Warming from the first sip, the alcohol lends more of a pleasant presence than harshness. Low carbonation level, but not flat, appropriate for the style but maybe could be just a tad higher. Carbonation level seems more appropriate around room temperature, where it's slightly increased.
Overall Black Note is an excellent beer that is smooth and complex. Others may have more barrel character or be more extreme, but this is a great stout. 1,267 characterszachary80, Dec 19, 2012

3.88/5  rDev -13.8%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Draft service into a snifter at The Flying Saucer in Kansas City.
A: Opaque black color with a diminishing residue of light beight bubbles. Scant lacing remains on the glass.
S: Dark chocolate and vanilla are well represented. Little spirit or wood influences transmitted in the smell. No alcohol is detected.
T: Begins very off-dry with rich chocolate and vanilla from the smell as well as dark cherry fruit. Acidity is moderate into the middle as fruit is replaced by some pure roast. Another spike of acidity occurs before the mellow finish fully matures, yielding some late bourbon notes but remaining light on wood and booze.
M: Thick viscosity, creamy but slightly acidic on the palate, with moderate carbonation.
D/O: Best categorized as a dessert beer--it is not as assertive on the palate as some stouts that are born 'imperial' then givven the bourbon barrel treatment. Entirely respectable, it would serve well as a gateway to the world of barrel aged beers. 974 charactersbeagle75, Dec 15, 2012

Acquired via trade
Thanks, Shilt!
Black throughout and thick in body. A very small hint of a head consisting of very smell dark brown bubbles. Very little visible carbonation, but still a menacingly appropriate, beautiful, thick barrel-aged stout. It just looks right.
The aroma is incredible. Big, layered notes of chocolate abound, along with rich, expressive, espresso and subdued bourbon. There's a hint of an alcohol kick but it's tame considering this beer's ABV. There's some mellowed bourbon notes as well, but the chocolate and coffee are quite dominant.
The flavor is boldly expressive; it's an incredible combination of chocolates, espresso, cream, vanilla, and integrated bourbon. The alcohol is present but not distracting. Remarkably drinkable.
Full in body. Creamy. Decadent. Rich.
I had 2 10 oz. pours and was regretting not drinking more. But, hey, sharing is caring. Amazing stuff, and very generous of Shilt to get it out my way. Thanks, again! 977 charactersehammond1, Dec 14, 2012

Overall, a delicious stout and well worth the $8, but I though the character was relatively dull for everything that's been put into it. The bourbon barrel character is smooth, and pleasant with oaky vanilla, but it sits in the background behind even smoother cocoa malts. It's almost like it's too balanced, with few flavors really standing out. I'll admit though, I'm being hard on this very tasty beer. I just don't think it drinks up to its potential. 505 characterstempest, Nov 21, 2012

A-Pitch black beer with thin tan head, just enough to lace the rim leaving the center of the pint obsidian black
S-Can definitely tell the bourbon from a mile away. Oak, velvet, dark cocoa, vanilla and bourbon with an estery British stout character
T-Kinda overpowering, Very sweet malt character, balanced by dark chocolate, espresso with body from the oak tannins and bourbon. Underlain by vanilla notes.
M-Thick and cloying
O-I much prefer the expedition stout to black note even though black note contains some expedition stout. This beer is excellent, but even 8oz is a bit much at one sitting really belongs in a snifter glass served as an appertif or with a dessert course. It is very sweet while at the same time assertively bitter. A very complex beer, I nonetheless might skip the oak barrels or age longer as the flavors as presented are somewhat discordant. 911 charactersWeli, Nov 21, 2012

Review #2800! Solidarity rolls on for me with a beer I've been looking forward to for a long time. This stuff pours a straight obsidian topped by a finger of dark brown foam. The nose comprises bourbon, toasted wood, caramel, and roasted malts. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a touch of dark chocolate syrup. The body is a hefty medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a lightly chewy feel. Overall, a damn tasty stout. To me, the barrel is a bit overpowering compared to everything else, but it somehow doesn't go too far in this way. Good times, indeed. 611 charactersTMoney2591, Nov 19, 2012

poured dark thick black, little dark cocoa head. very viscous looking.
some chocolate, light vanilla, and light roasted malt. the BA was there but lighter than i was expecting. 
similar to nose, a bit like a BA expedition or expedition blended with double cream, but all 3? i guess... i thought this was tame, it was good but lacked a deep complexity. the BA was soft and subtle. the chocolate and coffee were faint. did not really pick up any oak.

Looks like a stout. Black, smallish head. Poured into a tasting glass so I couldn't get a great sense, but it's nothing special.
Smell is vanilla, coffee, bit of chocolate, some oak, roasty bitterness, some dark fruits. It's pretty good, but it's a bit muddled. Not a lot of balance.
Taste gets better as it warms. Vanilla, coffee, bourbon, oak, caramel. Really rich, very tasty.
Mouthfeel was too thin and flat. I don't want it to be hypercarbonated, but more than it has would be good. It's also too watery. I like my stouts to be thick and chewy, which this was not.
This is a solid stout. However, the mouthfeel was really lacking, and it was a bit unbalanced. A bit disappointing. I'd like to try it again sometime, maybe get a better experience. 801 charactersrodkin, Nov 11, 2012

Pours an almost black color with a thin white head, dissipating quite quickly.
Nose; bourbon, oak, charcoal, and some dark fruits.
Taste; bourbon upfront with a touch of bakers chocolate, I too got peanut butter, finishing with a ton of burnt malt and a slight salinity (reminiscent of soy sauce but not like 09' Abyss).
Mouthfeel; oily and surprisingly thin. This can happen with barrel treatments (i.e. Boris vs. BA Boris is the best example off the top of my head) but I think it comes from the Double Cream Stout aspect of the beer as well.
Overall; I wasn't a fan but I will admit, I have been a bit under the weather lately so I know my palate isn't quite up to par...
Retried a bottle of 2013 and can say that the initial review was so low because of the fact that the beer was oxidized. This recent bottle was much better but still not very impressive. The thin body and overly boozy aspect from the barrel aging didnt do much for me. Decent example of the style but over rated and no better than any other barrel aged imperial stout out there. 1,241 characterspixieskid, Nov 08, 2012

A: Pitch black with a thin mocha head that leaves some lacings.
S: Smell is mainly of heavy dark chocolate with dried fruits (currants, figs) and some dark fruits. Some roasted aromas (almonds, espresso). Vanilla comes after.Some nuts also (cashew nuts, peanut butter). The presence of alcohol is noticeable but not overpowering (notes of sherry). Deep but not aggressive. Elegant.
T: The taste mainly follows the nose with a lot of dark chocolate and roasted malts (coffee flavors). Some vanilla. Warming alcohol but without booziness. The aftertaste is on sweet chocolate and bitter chocolate.
M: Medium to high body. Almost flat. Quite velvety. It could be thicker and a bit smoother. A bit sticky on the length, but very drinkable.
O: A great, elegant imperial stout, with an excellent nose, flavorful and deep, still sober on the palate. 883 charactersFux, Nov 07, 2012

S: Strong bourbon upfront, I get dark chocolate, caramel, and licorice behind. Dark fruit in the background adds to the complexity. The aromas mix very well together.
T: Again, strong bourbon and caramel upfront, this time there is more coffee and roast to balance. I get a bit of lactose sweetness to give a bit more sweetness. I also get quite a bit of dark chocolate, intensifying as the beer warms. The beer always stays on the roasty/coffee side, but is very well balanced.
M: A bit on the thin side for the style with low carbonation. Definitely the worst part of this beer, but not terrible.
O: With a bit thicker mouthfeel, this would be significantly better. It still balances roast, bourbon, and chocolate extremely well, better than just about any other barrel aged stout that I've had. 943 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Oct 26, 2012

A - Poured dark black; medium thickness on the pour. A thin layer of espresso coloured head formed and quickly disappeared.
S - Huge whiskey and oak aromas up front. The barrel characteristics dominate the nose with some sweet chocolate fudge in the background.
T - Bourbon, some vanilla and toasted oak up front. Although the barrel is dominant, the base beer comes through more than nose indicated. Chocolate fudge, bitter roast, molasses and light espresso flavours integrate nicely with the barrel flavours.
M - Full body. Thick and somewhat viscous. Light carbonation. 678 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Oct 12, 2012

Nearly black with dark mahogany brown around the edges. No head, save for a thin ring.
The aroma has a lot of the stout - roasted and burnt sugars, molasses, prune, bitter chocolate and some coffee undertones. Creamy vanilla, some oak and hints of soft bourbon. The flavor has more bourbon and more heat. Some burnt sweetness, much similar to the nose. Pretty heavy blend between burnt roast and sugar and prune sweetness. Oak char on the finish. Full, slick body with sugary lingerings. Moderate, appropriate carbonation. Finishes clean for a barreled thing.
Overall, this is good but I would much rather drink Expedition or Double Cream Stout or bourbon. 708 charactersRyan011235, Oct 11, 2012

Poured into my pint glass, the stout was a chocolatey black color with only the slightest hint of a head. The initial aroma was nicely boozy, making it apparent that the stout slept several months in bourbon barrels. The malt in the aroma was present, but was overwhelmed not the bourbon. The initial taste was a sour chocolate with vanilla note and bitter coffee. The booziness lays a pleasingly warm backbone amid the chaos of chocolate, vanilla and coffee notes. The mouthfeel is not quite motor oil, but it is fairly close. Thankfully, the taste lingered several minutes. The aftertaste left a warming sensation that was sticky enough to linger in the back of the throat for several minutes. As far as barrel aged stouts go, this is near the top of the list. 844 charactersJohnnyHopps, Oct 01, 2012
4.22/5  rDev -6.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Mscarpen for this growler, great trader, can't say enough about him. Drank this side to side with the base beers that make up Black Note: Expedition Stout and Special Double Cream Stout.
A- Black as night. Not much of a head on it, fades away pretty quickly.
S- When I took the cap off the growler I smelled it just for the heck of it and even the cap smelled like straight vanilla. No surprise the aroma had lots of vanilla in it, with the bourbon characteristic that's so typical of a good BA stout. Has a hint of oatmeal in the aroma as well.
T- Great bourbon presence, the bourbon and vanilla stand out as the two main flavors. It's a little sweet but not overpowering at all...just right. It has a little bit of a bitter dark chocolate taste to it, and definitely some coffee and burnt notes in the aftertaste. Bell's says you should pick up some dark fruits in here but I'm not getting any. It has a little bit of that lactic taste to it from the cream stout base but not a lot. That adds to it nicely. The alcohol is extremely well hidden. This might be the most vanilla I've ever had in a beer.
M- Creamy, like I said it gets some of that lactic taste/feel from the cream stout. It's nice and think, low carbonation.
O- When Black Note bottles came out earlier this year I swore I wouldn't give my cellar away for it cause some of the reviews I was reading weren't too great. Maybe this beer is a lot different on tap or maybe I just disagree with those reviews but this is a very good BA stout. It's got that chewy feel to it that I always look for, very smooth, good flavors from the barrel aging, balanced, and gets better as it warms up. There's nothing distinct about this that blows me away but it's really good, and definitely worth a try if this is your thing. 1,791 charactersmgp2675, Sep 29, 2012

Aromas of warm bourbon, milk chocolate, vanilla, dark roasted malt, brown sugar and quite a bit of lactic creaminess. The flavor starts off with a big dose of warm bourbon, chocolate and some lactic creaminess from the double cream stout. Hints of vanilla, oak, brown sugar and rich coffee help to break things up and keep things interesting. Big and full smooth mouthfeel with a ton of sweet flavors and moderation carbonation throughout. The finish was quite sweet with plenty of boozy bourbon and some dark roast, lingering on the palate long after consumption.

4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On-tap at Bryant-Lake Bowl for their stout bout. I came to the event mostly to try this beer, and I wasn't disappointed. Enjoyed 12 September 2012, reviewed from notes.
Pours straight-up black. Brought with a thin layer of medium-brown head, but I saw the server pour some more off. Decent lacing.
Smell is rich dark chocolate, surrounded by the loveliest bourbon-y aromas I've encountered in a beer. All sorts of rich dark malt aromas, but they're all tied together in a way that makes it hard to tease out characteristics.
Taste is, well... it's one of those indescribably good beers that is just beautiful and right. The rest of my description is a mostly-futile attempt to explain that beauty. Like a dark malt wash, with a little bit of bourbon. It has a core flavor that holds together so well, it's hard for me to say exactly what it is. No little bits sticking out to grab onto, just this big glom of deliciousness. The bourbon barrel comes through, but is so nicely balanced and integrated - mostly the rich grainy flavors of the bourbon that really shine through. This adds tons of flavor, but without the burn that accompanies so many barrel-aged beers. Moderately hoppy, but the hops don't come through that much because there are so many other flavors they have to contend with. Stunningly good.
Mouthfeel is thick and heavy with that smooth, full oat fluffiness. Medium-low carbonation, as it should be.
One of the best, if not the best, barrel-aged stouts I've ever had, and among the top beers I've had. In the vein of Bourbon County - a big, robust, flavorful stout with fantastic integration of the barrel flavor - but better. IMO, it blows some other highly-rated stouts (Parabola, Abyss) out of the water. I will be seeking this out again. Definitely worth the effort. I could drink this all day. 1,821 characterszeledonia, Sep 18, 2012

2 ounce pour was oily black in appearance with a thin skein of mocha brown head. Smell was distinctly bourbon..vanilla, oak, subtle cherry, along with dark chocolate and subtle anise, toffee, dark fruit. Smells rich and delicious. 
Taste follows the nose. Bourbon barrel, vanilla, figs, dark and sweet chocolates, coffee, dark fruits, blackstrap molasses, toffee. Booze. Bitter coffee, dark chocolate and hopping keeps some semblance of order in all the richness. Mildly warming. It's very, very good. Heavy creamy body as expected. Overall..The bourbon elements in Black Note aren't as over the top as other bourbon whiskey imperial stouts, it frames the dark chocolates and allows all the other flavor elements to really shine. Impressive. 859 charactersJackieTH, Sep 16, 2012

Appearance: Color is a oily jet black. Moderate amount of bubbles. About one finger of deep tan creamy head that recedes to a very thin layer. Decent amount of lacing is left on the glass. 
Smell: Big scent of bourbon whiskey up front with good hints of vanilla, wood, and oak. Sweet dark malts with big hints of dark chocolate, coffee, dark toasted bread, molasses, burnt caramel, toffee, and biscuit. A fair amount of syrup and burnt sugars. Subtle hints of dark raisin, plum, fig, and cherry. A light hint of smoke and earthy hops. The bourbon and sweet chocolate stand out the most. A big and rich aroma. 
Taste: Just as big and complex as the aroma leads. Nicely dark, sweet, and boozy. Big taste of bourbon whiskey up front with good notes of vanilla, oak chips, and the whiskey barrel. A little bit of smoke. Big dark roasted malts with notes of dark chocolate, bitter coffee, toasted bread and biscuit, sweet molasses and syrup, burnt caramel, and toffee. Undertones of dark fruits including dark cherry, plum, and raisin. Subtle earthy hops in the background. The bourbon and dark chocolate elements really stand out. Rich and very good taste. 
Mouthfeel: A fairly heavy body with a moderate amount of carbonation. Thick, creamy, and fairly slick and syrupy. Some alcohol heat is present but its not overly hot. 
Overall: A really great barrel aged imperial stout. The bourbon flavor is big and great and the dark chocolate and molasses sweetness is very good. 1,553 charactersMattyG85, Sep 11, 2012

Pours a jet black into the goblet with a light coffee tan head that quickly disappeared leaving just the slightest head. Some alcohol legs on the glass.
The smell on this one is up there. Rich vanilla bourbon with some great hints of toasted coconut. Fainter hints of toffee and light tobacco.
Taste is as good as I hoped for. The base beer here really holds up well to the bourbon treatment. Plenty of roasted coffee notes, bakers dark chocolate, and a dash of anise. The bourbon adds a great interplay of vanilla, caramel, toffee, and woody oak. No one aspect of the beer dominates but there is a great mixture of a lot of my favorite flavors. 
Mouthfeel on this beer really worked for me. I don't know if it's because it was on tap or not, but I found the carbonation level to be perfect. The beer was extremely creamy and really easy to drink, and the alcohol was perfectly masked.
All in all, Black Note lived up to the hype for me. I was fortunate to get a whole growler, and frankly it seems like an embarrassment of riches. Everyone who got a pour of this agreed that it was top notch. I would definitely go out of my way to get this beer again. 1,265 characterssmokeypeat, Sep 10, 2012

A - India ink black with a tan-brown short head with light lacing and lots of alcohol legs.
S - Bourbon, dark fruit, oak tannin, roasted malt. Very big aroma that's heavily on the bourbon side.
T - Bourbon, medium roasted malt, dark cherry, plum, prune, coconut and a touch of umami, and black licorice (not my favorite flavor). Fairly sweet but balanced with some astringent and hop bitterness. I definitely get the influence of the Expedition Stout. Alcohol is quite noticeable but generally blends in and supports the sweetness. 
M - Medium-heavy body and light carbonation. 
O - Big, big flavors for sure. Didn't quite float my boat as some other Imperial Stouts. For example, I prefer Founders KBS over this for a bourbon-influenced brew. I had this a few hours after having it on-tap. The only difference is there was no head at all from the growler but there was a bit of head on-tap. It wasn't that much of a difference to take points off for the appearance since you don't expect much of a head at this high ABV level. 1,071 charactersTucquan, Sep 08, 2012

Nose is rich buttery bourbon with tropical notes like dried pineapple and dried papaya. Toasted coconut. Let it decant to cinnamon ganache and very subtle meat/umami character. Soft booziness, coffee liquor. So many rich subtleties makes this an incredible experience. Taste is similar to normal and Rare Bourbon County Stout. Super creamy, rich coconut oil mouthfeel. Feels less sharply bitter than normal Expy. Softer and easier to love than normal Expy. Superlative soft mouthfeel. Nice bitterness comes through to cut initial sweetness. Great mouthfeel- mild heat reminds of soft bourbon aging but softness is unreal. Roasty bitterness and coffee character hints that this is not BCS but something else. Very beautiful. Complexities are easier to fall in love with than normal Expedition which can be too aggressive and powerful at times. Had this on tap now four separate times- always delicious and silky. Not sure what's up with that bottle picture, since that is not what the bottled version of this beer looks like. 12/6/2011 9/4/9/5/18=4.5 1,128 characterstarheels86, Sep 06, 2012

A: It's a bit dark in the room, but I can tell there's the typical pitch-black body. What's unusual is that a wisp of a head stays around for several minutes, even after I take a few sips. 
S: Mostly bourbon. There is a little bit of roast and biscuit in there as well.
T: The taste opens up with some toffee from the malts, and then ripe dark fruits make an appearance. Towards the middle the bourbon comes out in full force. It's not the sweet bourbon I'm used to in BA stouts - it's more rough and young. The end of each sip and aftertaste is fairly unpleasant - harsh booziness. 
M: Nice velvety mouthfeel with the appropriate small amount of carbonation.
O: I was not terribly impressed by this beer. The barrel notes are too prominent, and it's pretty boozy. I'd try it again if it had been aged for a year plus, but I didn't find the draught version worth all the hype. 929 charactersWorldWideStout, Aug 14, 2012

Dark black with no head and shiny flecks of garnet in the light. The nose presents a good presence from the oak and a slight touch of oxidation. The taste follows suit with the addition of a nice chocolaty malt base that screams stout.. but definitely not a Russian imperial with only a modestly thick mouthfeel. The mouthfeel is slightly bourbon boozy, but not enough to scream BBA. It's just weak-sauce in comparison to the other stouts I've had. 541 charactersThePorterSorter, Aug 04, 2012

4.22/5  rDev -6.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Draft served in a snifter. The brew pours black in color with a rich mocha head. The cap fades pretty fast leaving spotty patches of lace sticking to the glass.
The smell is vibrant with bourbon and barrel aging characteristics that smell of coconut, vanilla and lots of neutral oak. Roasty grain is present smelling of coffee and chocolate. Some tangy booze rounds things up.
The taste is tangy with bourbon booze quality right out the gate that doesnt diminish during the experience. Bitter unsweetened cocoa lingers in the mouth coupled with coffee, raw oak, vanilla, and some hints of caramel sweetness as it warms up.
This is a medium bodied brew with a light level of carbonation. It is quite a boozy sipper that is enjoyable. Fans of expedition stout will go crazy over this. Very well done and worth seeking out if it doesnt cost you a limb. 852 charactersstakem, Aug 02, 2012

4.2/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Wow, thanks Bells for bringing this to the Milwaukee Brewfest, what an awesome surprise. Definitely the best beer at the event.
Nose dominated by warm bourbon and chocolate notes. 
Taste also begins with warm bourbon, followed by a smooth chocolate rosat, and finishes with more bourbon. Delicious, but I would have preferred the stout to have a slightly stronger presence, as I feel it was largely overshawdowed by the bourbon notes.
Mouthfeel was fairly creamy, but could have been more so. 
Overall, an excellent offering from Bells. I would really be interested in trying a BA version of Expedition Stout and seeing if that might be preferable to the Expedition/Cream Stout blend. 688 charactersthebigredone, Jul 29, 2012
4.29/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Previously I tried this at Michigan Brewer's Guild and it came of strangely sour and off. Maybe from a bad keg? Got a bottle now. Pours pitch black with a very small brown head. Aroma is heavy vanilla, licorice, chocolate and bourbon. Smells very rich. Some up front bite with medium low carbonation. Flavor of licorice at first, finishing with overwhelming chocolate and then sweet vanilla really lingering. Thick and viscous, slightly acidic with some burning alcohol going on. Age would probably smooth it out but overall pretty awesome! Glad I got to re-rate this.
Another rerate here with a 2012 bottle poured on 3/22/14. Mostly similar but the booze tones down considerably now. Big anise flavors and lots of beautiful vanilla chocolate Good n Plenties. This is still awesome. The Expedition seems to shine through a bit with the age on this one. Very interesting. (4.84)
2016 bottle and this just seems watered down. Kinda makes me sad. (4.29) 952 charactersBMMillsy, Jul 29, 2012

Pours a beautiful dark mahogany with coffee coloured head and lacing. Stunning aroma of oak tannins with a strong roasted & caramelized malt background. Robust flavour that lingers for an impressive length of time. 11% ABV is almost completely hidden in the warm malt tones. Coffee, chocolate, licorice and lots & lots of oak. Even some rye or bourbon notes?
An excellent beer! 453 charactershopsolutely, Jul 28, 2012

A - Pours jet black with a nice one and a half finger tall mocha colored head leaving sticky streaks of lace down parts of the glass.
S - Smells of warm bourbon, milk chocolate, vanilla, dark roasted malt, brown sugar and quite a bit of lactic creaminess. Bourbon is strong initially but the other aroma's grow to help keep it in check.
T - Starts off with a big dose of warm bourbon, chocolate and some lactic creaminess from the double cream stout. Hints of vanilla, oak, brown sugar and rich coffee help to break things up and keep things interesting. Finish is pretty sweet with plenty of boozy bourbon and some dark roast, lingering on the palate long after consumption.
M - Big, full body with a TON of sweet flavors and moderate carbonation. Smooth, boozy feel throughout the glass.
O - I have missed out on trying this one a few times in the past so I was really looking forward to trying it when I saw that it went on-tap. Now that I have had it 4-5 times in the span of a week I can say that it definitely lives up to its billing. Awesome beer for sure. 1,226 charactersorangesol, Jul 27, 2012

Look: Black in color with a small tan head and disappears quite quickly that leaves behind a couple dots of lace
Smell: Upfront is a touch of bourbon backed up by some roasted malts and chocolate and finishes with a nice kiss of vanilla and oak
Taste: The taste starts off a little differently from the nose with the roasted and chocolate notes upfront subtle but nice. Vanilla kicks in almost immediately after the chocolate fades and the beer finishes with the bourbon and oak I was looking for
Mouthfeel: Rich and creamy and medium to full in body with low carbonation
Overall: I did enjoy this beer and would drink it if I lived closer to the source. Definitely worth trying but definitely not worth the lofty price tag. I really do hate limited releases and hype 865 charactersDarthKostrizer, Jul 25, 2012

Pours an opaque black with a foamy dark khaki head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is of dark roated malt, cocoa, bourbon, wood, and vanilla. Taste is much the same but the flavors are a bit more muted than I was expecting from the aromas. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a slightly crisp and medium bodied mouthfeel. Overall, this is a good beer with a great smell but a smooth and somewhat mellow flavor. 606 charactersUCLABrewN84, Jul 24, 2012

My buddy dragged me to this event for the sole purpose of trying this beer. And I am happy that he did. 
You can smell the bourbon in the pour and it has the some of the best characteristics of the two brews that were combined to make it. It is a great mixture of the Expedition and the Double Cream Stouts.
Although I am normally not a stout person, this is one the best brews I have had in a long time. I just wish it was more readily available. 507 charactersShibbykaiyai, Jul 19, 2012

Black, with a transient brown head. Moderate legs, but only whisps of some head and a thin collar remain. Bourbon is big in the nose, along with coconut, vanilla, and brown sugar. Quite sweet, barrel aging is front and center. Taste leads with more smooth bourbon, coconut, mild chocolate and roast flavours. Great barrel flavours, creamier notes are slightly present. Medium full body, warming with some noticeable alcohol after some larger gulps. Low carbonation, with great density and smoothness. An awesome BBA'd stout, but not the best I've ever had form the style. Awesome to have tried though. 744 charactersliamt07, Jul 16, 2012

The smell has a pretty good amount bourbon. Thick roasty characteristic from Expedition. 
The taste is wow. The bourbon from the barrel stands out straight away, then you get all that roasty malt and notes of coffee and dark chocolate. The most impressive part is the addition of the creaminess from Double Cream Stout. 
Perfect blending of base beer. 405 charactersVncentLIFE, Jul 14, 2012

4.27/5  rDev -5.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Al's. Luckily this one lasted until I got back from vacation.
A: The stout is dark, a black combination of two already black beers. A crème colored head, pulling some of the darkness of the ale into its whiteness, is ample is size, coating the sides of the glass.
S: The nose is bourbon, tempered by the cream and imperial stout aromas. Coffee and roasted malts, chocolatey, have a sweetness that goes nicely with the vanilla from the barrel. Sweetness, not sugary, is the mark of the stout - rich and warming.
T: Sweet bourbon leads off, the vanilla and coconut pairing with wooden thickness. The wood sets up the stout flavors that follow. The Expedition adds coffee and burnt bread flavors - filling on their own. Lactic sweetness, thank you Double Cream, fills a void, softening up the Expedition's full-on assault. The bourbon remains throughout each sip, mingling with the stout. It returns for a heavy, boozy swansong at the finish, a strong dose of flavor that isn't too strong. The Expedition and bourbon go very nicely together.
M: Mouthfeel is smooth and full, delicious without too much booziness. One glass, allowed to warm, did the trick for me. A heck of a find for Al's and I'm glad that I snagged some - a delicious stout. 1,254 charactersakorsak, Jul 08, 2012

Reviewed from notes.
Appearance - Big khaki head. Not a particularly dark head, though. Decent retention. Oh yeah, it's black.
Smell - Huge barrel notes. Bourbon, vanilla, and oak. Roasted chocolate, but otherwise the stout is a touch lost in the barrel. Boozy, too.
Taste - Chocolate and a building tingle of bourbon. Vanilla flavor throughout. The chocolate comes back in the finish in a much more bitter manifestation. Less boozy in the finish that the smell would indicate. Really wonderful incorporation of barrel and stout.
Mouthfeel - Very creamy, which I assume is the Cream Stout. Boozy and chewy, but not too thick. Low carbonation, which is strange. Nearly flat.
Overall - It's damn good. I don't know how much separates the best BA stouts, but this one is quite nice. I'm happy not to have traded for it and rather just came and drank the equivalent of a 750 on tap. Will be back for more next year.

From a 75cl bottle into a snifter
Batch 10,136
Bottle 618 of 1081 
Blend of Expedition Stout and Double Cream Stout aged in bourbon barrels. 
APPEARANCE: A black pour yields a one finger, medium looking, light mocha colored head with decent retention. Head fades to a good wisp and sticks to the sides of the glass. Jet black body with lower levels of carbonation. Looks pretty solid. A swirly wisp and ring remain the whole way and leave dots of lacing down the glass. Good looking beer. 
SMELL: Some roasted malts and dark chocolate under a very nice bourbon barrel. Oak, milk chocolate and a touch of sweet cream. Not overly bold, but the base beer of roasted chocolatey goodness meshes really well with the bourbon barrel notes. Well done. 
TASTE: Bourbon barrel and caramel malts up front with some roasted notes and dark chocolate in there as well. Lots of barrel on the swallow, with bourbon, oak, vanilla and caramel sweetness. Big, bold and lingering aftertaste is full of barrel flavors, dark chocolate and roasted malt notes as well. Big barrel presence, but plenty of stout still plays and important roll. A very impressive barrel-heavy beer that still shows a solid base beer underneath it all. Excellent stuff. 
PALATE: Medium body with slightly lower levels of carbonation. Creamy smooth on the palate, goes down smooth and finishes somwehat sticky on the palate. Solid feel here. 
OVERALL: This was a good beer for sure. In all honesty, I'm not the hugest Bell's fan, especially after being underwhelmed with Hopslam and Expedition, but this one really pushed all the right buttons. With a thick, dark pour, and bold, balanced aromas and flavors, this one really impressed. An excellend BA imperial stout that I would love to have again at some point. Cheers for the beer hotpipes! We really enjoyed this one. 1,940 charactersJeffo, Jul 04, 2012

Pours pitch black. 1 finger dark mocha head that dissipates quickly. Spotty lace. Amazingly thick legs. Solid. 
Nose is vanilla, lactose, chocolate, fudge, and a boozy tickle. Real sweet but nice complexity. Aromatic too. 
Opens sweet soy sauce, chocolate, fudge, and cocoa powder. Some roasted malt, molasses in the middle. Sweet brown sugar and caramel. More molasses at the end. Booziness throughout sweetens the brew but doesn't overpower or cover the complexity. Amazing. Sweet, syrupy aftertaste. 
Medium to full bodied with low carbonation. Oily and slick in the mouth and goes down with some heat. Messy finish with a lingering aftertaste. Really good. 
There are a lot of barrel-aged stouts with a lot of hype behind them. Some are good, some not so much. Black Note definitely deserves the praise it gets. A nicely complex brew with just the right amount of barrel presence and a great mouthfeel to tie it all together. Can't wait to get my hands on more! 1,099 charactersSpeedwayJim, Jul 04, 2012

The beer pours a blackish brown color with excellent head retention and considerable creamy, sticky lacing all around. The nose is terrific in this beer, as I pick up dark chocolate, coffee, vanilla, considerable bourbon and even some apple brandy. This really smells great... yet as good as it smells, damn if it doesn't taste even better. The flavor profile largely replicates the nose, but there's a nice dash of hoppy bitterness in the finish that really helps to buoy and counter the moderate sweetness in this beer. For such a big beer, it's really well balanced, and is just so easy to drink. Also, despite the high alcohol, there's not a hint of heat from alcohol in the finish. Mouthfeel is fairly full, with a long, chocolate, coffee and vanilla finish. This is just a delicious beer. Really impressed by how well the brewer managed to keep everything in just the right preportion in this excellent beer.
Clearly among the barrel aged RIS elite. Very, very well done. 1,006 charactersJohn_M, Jun 30, 2012

T- Pretty solid brew for sure, but overall very sweet. The sweetness was almost over powering everything else in this brew. Follows the nose well with a ton of vanila. Bourbon is here but fairly light. A good amount of booze too.

S: Bourbon-heavy, with a light semi-sweet roastiness. Overall, a very sweet nose.
T: Very sweet also. Bourbon dominates throughout, beginning with the early sip. Mild roastiness provides the canvass for this great masterpiece of a beer.The double cream stout's influence is noticeable, as the base-beer is vaguely sweet. Semi-sweet chocolate also comes across mid-sip. The finish is mainly of bourbon, with light undertones of semi-sweet roastiness.

A: Near black with no head and just a film of lacing
S: Sweet and malty and bourbony; even a bit hoppy and spicy; man, this is oaky and boozy with just a touch of dark fruits--raisins, plums, etc.
T: Boozy and chocolatey and a touch thin but malty and nearly as sweet as it smells; the dark fruits play off the semi-sweet malts and bourbon quite well
F: A bit too thin for a big stout--much too thin (perhaps unfortunate that I tried this after a huge stout--GI Rare) but still fairly sticky which almost makes up for that
O: This is a great beer but I just wish it had more body; if it did it would truly be world class 693 charactersdbossman, Jun 06, 2012

M: Substantial Thick Creamy mouthfeel. Smooth. Nice tingle on the tongue.
O: Very solid barrel aged stout. Brings the best of 2 great base beers to the mix with a nice barrel accent enhancing a fantastic mix. For an 11.5% it goes down much easier. Seems like an 8.5% Smoke flavor well integrated but not overpowering. Highly recommend! 632 charactersTATURBO, May 31, 2012

4.52/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5This is review #1000 on BA. Poured from the bottle into my Hunahpu's snifter.
Appearance: This beer pours black with just under a finger of thick tan head. The head fades fairly quickly to a ring around the edge of the glass.
Smell: Sweet roasted malt and full of bourbon heat. I'm getting some chocolate and dark fruit notes as well. Lots going on here.
Taste: Doesn't disappoint at all. This is a very smooth and creamy stout, especially given the abv. Roasted malts with some sweet chocolate notes. I'm getting hints of coffee and dark fruit as well. The bourbon taste is rather strong, but it doesn't overpower the other flavors, it adds to them.
Mouthfeel: The body is on the thick side of medium, but I think it could have been a little bit thicker and that would have been alright. The carbonation is tingly and the finish is dry.
Overall: I really enjoyed the balance and complexity of this stout. It was a sweet beer, but not in an overwhelming way. The rest of the flavors were allowed to contribute and it all worked out perfectly. I would love to have more given the chance. 1,091 charactersoline73, May 27, 2012

Pours black with a nice tan head, nice lacing and legs are left behind on the swirl. Nose has a lot of caramel and chocolate, quite malty with some hints of oak. Not boozy. Taste is really wonderful, an excellent blend of two stouts with additional complexity from a barrel. Barrel note is not the sole feature of this beer, and that is the reason we all enjoyed it. An incredibly well done beer and worth trading. Smooth and very easy to drink given the heft. 594 characterspokesbeerdude, May 25, 2012

A: Pours pitch black with a minimal head. Not getting much lace but that’s expected. 
S: I get huge notes of vanilla with undertones of bourbon, caramel and deep chocolate. There are some spicy notes as well. 
T: Phenomenally smooth notes of chocolate fudge, sweet bourbon, caramel, hints of barrel spice and smoke. The finish is super smooth and bourbony and so very mellow. 
M: Ultra smooth and creamy beer. The booze is well hidden and the body is thick and chewy. This feels awesome.

A - pours a pitch black with a nice Lacey tan head. It's what you expect from a barrel aged imperial stout, only the head dues off pretty quickly.
S - a little muted. Deep sniffs show signs of choloate, vanilla, and slightly oakiness. 
T - flavors of intense chocolate, followed by caramel and vanilla. The finish is slightly sweet with a tiny alcoholic burn. Damn, this is Hella good.
M - top notch for a barrel aged stout. It is perfectly carbonated, with a feel of a nice creamy stout. Very sweet and sticky flavors linger as the mouthfeel doesn't seem to fade as you finish the beer. Very nice.
O - damn good beer. I wish the aroma was a little better, other than that, damn solid beer. 738 charactersabecall98, May 19, 2012

4.05/5  rDev -10%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had on tap at Bryant-Lake Bowl. 
A-Served a healthy 10 oz pour in a snifter. This baby is black as a black note with a tan film that stubbornly hangs on til the last drink.
S-Sweet and roasted malts are dominant, the bourbon is there too but subdued at first, becoming stronger as the beer warms.
T-The taste is definitely on the sweet side. The malts are chocolately with a medium amount of roasting. Bourbon character is there but not overpowering at all.
M-A bit oily but not nearly as much viscosity as say a GI BCS. Body is also on the light side for such a strong brew, the odd thing is you would expect the alcohol to come out stronger, but it is really well hidden...a definite plus for this version. Very light on carbonation.
D-Probably the highest for any 10%+ BB stout I've tasted.
O-Tastes like a BB stout, but shines in the drinkability. Lacks the complex flavors of some others but a solid beer. Well done. 927 charactersdeebo, May 15, 2012

A: Pours a jet black with a light khaki head forming on the pour. It recedes slowly to a thin collar that leaves some soapy looking lace across the glass.
S: Bourbon up front in the nose and slowly the dark fruits and pure chocolate start to emerge. As the glass warms the sweeter notes of caramel to show and the roasted malts also get amplified.
T: The dark fruits and the bourbon flavors are up front with smooth oak and a nice combination of dark chocolate and sweet milk chocolate. The finish is roasty with a nice addition of caramel and vanilla from the barrel.
M: Smooth and sweet with a low carbonation and chewier body. There is a mild warmth on the back end of each sip.
O: I really got the nice dark fruit and dark chocolate flavors from the Expedition Stout and the creamy malt and milk chocolate flavors from the Double Cream Stout. Overall, combined with the barrel aging this was a very nice beer. 1,078 charactersTreebs, May 01, 2012

Served in a 10 ounce nonic with a solid black body and a dense head of brown colored foam.
Incredibly rich smell of dark malts and bourbon. Molasses, lactose, coffee beans and bourbon.
Rich malty flavors with deep complexity. Chocolate. The bourbon is there and does not overwhelm or stand out more than the malt. It's a nice complement to the overall brew. 
Very sticky and rich with a full body.
Awesome beer. Wish they would bottle this bad boy on a regular basis. Lighter on the barrel, but it makes for an overall enjoyable beer that is towards the top of the list for the style. 620 charactersjera1350, Apr 30, 2012

A- It was a nice deep black typical of imperial stouts with crimson around the edge of the glass where the light was hitting it. I typically like my stouts a much deeper color though.
S- Sweet bourbon hits you right away. It smells really boozy. Then I get chocolate, roasted notes with some toffee.
T- At first it was too boozy. I let it warm up and It got better. It was smooth and a decent stout but nothing better than what is on the shelf
M- I would like a lot more thickness from this beer with a name like Black note
O- This is an overrated beer if I've ever seen one. Did not live up to the hype. KBS is 100 times better. I cannot stress enough that this beer is no better than another bourbon barrel aged stout on the shelf at your liquor store. I was really struggling to get any complexity's from it and there was no coffee flavor what so ever. Don't get me wrong this is a good beer but It's definitely is nothing special and I still can't believe what people will trade for this. Do yourself a favor and mix expedition and double cream yourself and add a little bourbon. You'll have the same thing. 1,217 characterschinchillin85, Apr 19, 2012

Pours a deep black color that shows no light. There is a thin layer of dark tan head. There is oily residue but no lace.
The nose is amazing. Toasted coconut, chocolate, molasses, light vanilla, and a touch of booze. Rich bourbon notes are married well together.
The flavors involve more toastes coconut, dry oak tannin, vanilla, light chocolate and molasses. The bourbon comes in again and smooths things out. Very tasty and actually quite similar to BCBS.
The mouthfeel is rich and creamy upfront and then transforms into a dry feel. Light carbonation.
Overall, Black Note is a great bourbon barrel stout that really doea live up to the outrageous hype. Great nose, awesome flavors, and velvet smooth. Great brew. 751 charactersChugginOil, Apr 18, 2012

Dark brown/black, tan head, decent lace. Smell reminds me of Expedition Stout with bourbon character on top. Layers of roasted malts & coffee flow freely. Aroma is this beer's best quality.
Taste is about what I expected: a good imperial stout with mild bourbon flavors. Much more Expedition than Double Cream. I applaud their choice to not go overboard on the bourbon like so many brewers do today. Love that smooth & creamy body.
That said, Black Note is a perfect example of the BA hype machine getting out of control. Like most Bell's beers, Black Note is pretty good but not exceptional. It's a step up from Expedition Stout, yet it cannot touch the top-tier stouts like Hunahpu's and Black Tuesday. 752 charactersbrystmar, Apr 16, 2012

Deep brown to black with a tiny amount of dark tan head.
Nose has strong roasted malt aroma with espresso and chocolate present. Some dark candied fruits coming out as well.
Mostly roasted malt characters and more espresso with a nice dose of bourbon barrel. Firm bitterness with some of the alcohol detectable. Overall smooth and easy to drink. There is noticeable residual sweetness but nothing cloying. As this warms more fruit comes out and there is a chewiness that leans towards the double cream stout.
Rich, smooth, and generally a delicious Imperial Stout. I was very excited to get my hands on this and even more excited that it came in a pint glass. Sneaky alcohol percentage and another one of Bell's beers that is so drinkable. 769 charactersstewart124, Apr 05, 2012

snifter= 7$
A&S: A wide range of smells: dark cherries, raisins, bourbon, roasty malts, burnt sugars, marshmallows tones. Kinda smells like a Old ale (lots of similarities to 4D). Medium tan ring of head, with whisks of head in the center. Spots of lacing like a fine wine. Very syrupy looking pitch black colored beer. Not much head probably due to the plus 10% ABV.
T&M: Many similarities to the scent. Differences include lots of bourbon midetaste to the back. Roasty with hints of dark chocolate upfront. Much smoother then their expedition stout, with even a bolder taste. 
Overall: very good, no flaws. I wish I had a bottle to sit down and enjoy vs drinking at a bar. I had really high hopes for this beer and they were pretty much all met. 806 charactersminterro, Apr 03, 2012

The head is a deep tan in color. The head retention and lacing are both quite nice.
The aroma is intoxicating with plenty of vanilla and bourbon notes mixed with super chocolaty and rich caramel aromas. The wood and bourbon really are the star of the show in the aroma though. (I had this again at the TC Winter Beer Fest and even out in the cold with bonfires all around I could really pick up on the barrel aged notes)
The flavor is very similar to the aroma but with a bit more chocolate and a slightly charred flavor. Vanilla also plays a big role in the flavor with the oak shining through well. I also must note that there is some serious tootsie roll character going on in this bad boy.
The mouthfeel is medium and a bit thinner than I would like, but that is a common problem I find in beers that have been barrel aged. The finish is sweet, roasty and enjoyable without being too taxing.
This brew is well regarded in the BA community and for good reason. In my opinion it does not quite rise to the heights of KBS or CBS, but it is a well crafted and aged BA stout that I will surly do my best to have a snifter or two of if I get the chance. 1,324 characterszoso1967, Mar 25, 2012

4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle #1071 - Thanks Shawn!
The pour is pretty standard for any stout, lovely jet back color with no transparency. Watching it pour is like watching motor oil pour from the canister, syrupy and viscous, yet thin enough to resemble something you would want to drink. An aggressive pour yields some head, but not much, and easily dissipates within moments, not uncommon of a high ABV stout. The nose is remarkable, the Double Cream Stout is in full effect in the nose, lots of milky lactose notes, roasted coffee and grainy malt compliments the subtle bourbon and charred wood that comes forth at the end, exceptional balance between the barrel and the base blend, neither seems to dominate, but instead they compliment each other quite well. I’ve had many a milk stout but the is the first time that the nose has suggested harmony between a milky or creamy stout and anything pleasant from a bourbon barrel. The flavors tend to favor Expedition Stout, heavier on the roast and bourbon, but also with a sweeter element, especially as it warms. Big notes of coffee and malt jump out, not unlike the Double Cream Stout, but they resinate in a way more reminiscent of Expedition Stout. The flavors are bigger, more robust and thicker, pairing well with the bourbon, which never takes over the beer, but only adds a nice layer of complexity and woodiness that compliments the roasted coffee and bold chocolate and caramel malt flavors. The body is nice and thick, minimal carbonation which plays nicely into the milky and creamy stout playbook of Double Cream Stout.
Verdict: Exceptional stout from Bell’s, I wish they released more of this so it could get around, but I’m very happy to have had a bottle. The creaminess and roastiness go hand in hand and the barrel aging adds just enough complexity to take this blend to a new level, without overpowering or dominating the palate. If you have the chance to try this beer, make it a top priority, the hype is deserved. 1,972 characterskevanb, Mar 25, 2012

Maybe Charlotte beer week actually has its usefulness??
Deep black, thin layer of darker tan head. Sticks to the glass just a bit.
Aroma, Well blended roast, chocolates, vanilla, peat, anise, coffee.
Taste, even better. Roast malt and anise blend seamlessly into oaky vanilla, caramel, milk chocolate, cocoa.
Slick full body, warming in the throat. Coats well with a near creamy carbonation. If this us anything like Expedition in bottle, it probably needs some time. On draft it is world class right now.
Had Double Cream at my wedding for a reason, this big barrel aged expedition blend ups the game 5 fold.
The list of beers I HAVE to try is getting nice and short. Not worth the effort to try most of them and I'm tired of the game. 853 charactersBung, Mar 25, 2012

A - pours brownish black with a small head on it
S - sweet chocolate, caramel, bourbon. As it warmed, the bourbon started to explode.
T - Starts off with dry chocolate notes that move to an eruption of cocoa. The cocoa fades to a nice bourbon flavor. Dark fruit and some bitter dark chocolates make appearance to round out this beer. I would describe this as really chocolaty with some bourbon
M - a little thin and watery
D - really nice beer here, minus the body. The blend brings together two great beers and the bourbon adds an even greater layer of complexity. Worth the ammo? Probably not, but a great experience nonetheless. 679 charactersbirchstick, Mar 23, 2012
4.41/5  rDev -2%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed (very much) in a chalice at the Hungry Monk during the Arizona Beer Week Eccentric Café event.
Not quite black, but as close to black as purple gets. Strawberry highlights. A tiny tuft of bubbles settles into the middle of the glass, but that's all the head I get. 
Layers and layers of aroma. The component parts are obvious in here, with major black coffee coming from the Expedition, and heavy cream and oats coming from Double Cream Stout. The barrels are in perfect proportion, lending dark cherry, molasses and oak. Nice smooth dark chocolate swirls as well, as does toffee. It’s like a fruity, oaky red wine. Great balance.
Bourbon is in the flavor, but it's not the star, which is great. The front is vinous oak, burnt bread, espresso and spicy black strap. The swallow smooths things out with dark chocolate, bourbon-soaked dark cherries, a lot of buttery toffee and a little bit of toasted coconut. Oats and whipped cream rise at the finish. Gentle waves of flavor roll in with each sip. Strikes an impressive balance. 
A little heartburn on the way down, but alcohol is well-hidden overall. A shade over medium in body, the brew exhibits a nice velvety texture and heft. Very light, tingly carbonation and a little fizz. Slightly tongue-numbing.
Got damn. So many great flavors mix in this brew. It’s like a bourbon-soaked cherry stuffed inside a dark chocolate toffee treat, with a heavy cream chaser. To balance both the Expedition and Double Cream as well as the barrel notes is just so impressive. The more I ponder it, the more I like it. Very grateful to have the opportunity to try it without giving up my first born. Though he might be on the table if anyone wants to send me a bottle. 1,722 charactersPhelps, Mar 22, 2012

Batch 10136, bottle 1022 of 1081. Pours one shade shy of black with a frothy, tan-colored head that dissipates into a dollop of foam in the center and a thin, bubbly band around the shoulders. Nose expresses chocolate malt, a hint of bourbon, vanilla and a trace of booziness. Taste consistent with nose - a superb balance of flavors. The only other quality I pick up that varies from the nose is a slight buttery character. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied with a pleasant, even carbonation. Just a little more body would really make the mouthfeel for me. Overall, a really exceptional and easy drinking stout. Not something I would recommend for extended cellaring by any means, but a really top notch beer nonetheless. 820 charactersJwale73, Mar 18, 2012

 Very dark brown and clear with a tiny collar. An incredibly smooth and silky beer... feels like milk, seriously! Tartness, coffee, and very mellow roast with, of course, bourbon. Not the beast that Expedition is but an immense beer nonetheless. One of us had the opinion that the Double Cream Stout component brings the milkiness and smoothness and I think I agree. Very good, loved it! My only regret is not being completely sober while drinking this one :/

Enjoyed on tap again with sobriety on my side:
Beautiful looks here and a great aroma... chocolate cake, vanilla, some barrels. More wood than liquor. A little too tart. A good beer but I have had better.
Taking 0.5 points off the taste and overall score.

A - Semi-thick black coloring but with a crazy deep violet hue around the edges of the tulip. No head or the like. 
S - The bourbon barrels that the Expedition portion sat in seem a bit weak here. Very balanced malt signature with additional caramel and roasted almonds. 
T - More of the same, generally. Breadyness, spices, further barrel qualities, faint anise, and sweet malts. Good balance, very creamy. I suspect the Double Cream Stout made a stronger showing here than it did in the aromatics. 
M - Very much in the vein of aged Expedition. Toned-down carbonation, medium body.
D - Crazy hype on this one, and I'm not sure it lives up to it. A friend mentioned that it's not quite at the level in this bottle that it used to be straight from the keg. Oh well, glad to have had the chance to try it and I think the blend is genius. Would love to try another bottle to see about variation because I think this has serious potential. 1,098 charactersAuracom, Mar 12, 2012

Appearance: Black to dark brown in color. A touch of a brown lacing. 
Aroma: A whole lot of coconut upfront, with layers of chocolate, vanilla and bourbon. Really nicely balanced. Definitely one of the more coconut forward beers in the aroma I've ever had.
Taste: Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate and bourbon all belnd nicely together. There is a lot of barrel character but it blends almost perfectly with the base beer and there is little to no heat. There is a touch of roasted coffee bean notes. Really balanced and tasty. Near perfect.
Mouthfeel: Full bodied with a nice creaminess throughout. Spot on for the style.
Overall, one of the better bourbon barrel beers I've ever had. There was almost no heat from this being that fresh, and the flavors are incredibly complex and balanced. It is drinking great right now so I'm not sure time would help this much. 1,024 charactersGosox8787, Mar 05, 2012

A: Completely opaque black body with a solid, creamy cap of brown head. Good retention, delicate lace. A swirl reignites the head and coats the glass with some reddish legs. Lovely.
S: Pure, straightforward bourbon-barrel goodness. Vanilla, coffee, bourbon, chocolate, licorice, and some faint dark fruits. Hugely complex, with a nice balance of sweetness and booziness. Terrific.
T: Sweet and bourbon-soaked at first, with vanilla, coconut, coffee, molasses, and spicy alcohol. Delicious.
M: Rich, creamy, full-bodied. Perhaps a bit more carbonation than necessary for the style, but luxurious all the same.
O: What a beer. It was amazingly close to breaking through to perfect scores in every single category, and was a sheer pleasure to savor. If I were to offer a complaint, it would be that it wasn't particularly distinctive - it just tasted like I expect a really, really great BBA stout to taste (much like Czar Jack, although with a bit more intensity that that incredibly smooth beer). It was worth the hype, and I just hope that Bell's makes more of it after they expand. I'd love to have it again.

Served from tap into a Brewvival sampler imperial pint. Poured pitch black with a minimal brown head. Maintained nice lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, roasted malt, cream, wood, and sweet alcohol. The flavor was of sweet malt, roasted malt, cream, wood, sweet alcohol, and spices. It had a heavy feel on the palate with medium carbonation. Overall this was a fairly good brew. I went into this one expecting to be blown away if I am honest. However, it fell short of what I was expecting it to be. All of the aspects on this one were good, but the flavor left a lot to be desired. There was a lot more roastiness going on here and not enough sweetness to balance it out at all. The spice note didn't help this fact either. The bad thing is that it was enjoyed with a group of BA buddies and all of us agreed that it was quite lackluster. Worth trying if you have not done so, but I doubt I would seek it out again myself based on what it takes to land it. 1,090 charactersthagr81us, Mar 01, 2012

poured into a snifter glass. First beer that we drank at a small tasting with local BA buddies on 2/24/12. Reviewed from notes.
Appearance: dark black bodied beer with 2 fingers of medium khaki head that fades slowely to a small ring around the glass. Decent lacing in noted to the side of the glass. 4.5
Smell: you get the barrel right away, but its a nice smelling stout with decent balance. Chocolatey, bourbon, smoke, roast, and faint vanilla. 4.0
Taste: bourbon barrel right away just like the nose. Roasty, smokey almost like a charred wood note. Some vanilla and wood. Mild notes of chocolate and coffee. You also geta hint of black licorice. The aftertaste is most intriguing and unique because it has notes of cherries and smoke. All the flavors are really mild I wish this was a little more robust for a BA stout. 4.0
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with low carbonation. The beer is smooth with no booziness noted to the beer. Thin mouthfeel; this is what is the beer main downfall. Make the beer a little bit thicker! 3.5
Overall: Its an easy drinking barrel-aged stout by Bells. Nice complexity, but suffers on the mouthfeel. Just a nice smooth brew, but its almost too mellow. I was just a little bit dissapointed by this beer, I had way higher expections for this brew. 4.0

Got the oppirtunity to revisit this beer on draft at the olympic tavern tonite. It has changed alot since the last time I drank it. Its drinking much better now! 
poured into a fancy looking goblet by the bartender at the olympic tavern, rockford, IL.
The biggest changes that I have noticed in this beer is the taste and mouthfeel.
It honestly has a bigger whiskey presence and has much more chocolate notes! Its really tasting magnificent. Not so much of a dissapointment anymore. This hangs with alot of the big names of BA stout! The mouthfeel is alot silkier and just plain wonderful. Just a touch of booze and a fantastic whiskey note, and its still quite drinkable for a BA stout. The barrel aging is shining right now!

A- Pours a pitch black with a one finger head that slowly dissipates into a thin cap. Minimal lacing is left behind.
S- Dark rich chocolate, coffee bean, roasted malt, vanilla bean, cream, dark fruits, sweet bourbon and wood. Very well balanced and complex.
T- Initially, the beer matches the nose with dark chocolate and coffee bean upfront followed by roasted malt, plumb, fig, raisin, bourbon, wood and some sweet vanilla bean and cream. As it warms up a bit though, the vanilla bean and cream become overpowered by harsh bitterness with char and burnt toast notes. 
M- The most disappointing aspect of the beer. Medium prickly carbonation with a thin mouthfeel with the bitterness lingering on. Really wish there was some more body and less carbonation. The one good aspect is that the high abv is masked very well. 
O- Black note is a great beer, however, it was too carbonated and was overtly bitter as it warmed up to make it a world class stout. Overall this beer is overhyped a bit, but certainly one to try if you get the chance. 1,079 charactersiadler, Feb 18, 2012

A - Pitch black, with a tightly packed cappuccino-colored head of about a finger that was retained surprisingly well, albeit without any significant lacing.
S - The bourbon asserts itself up front, but there are strong supporting RIS notes of roast, dark fruit, some chocolate and coffee. The bouquet opens up nicely as the beer warms, drawing you back pleasantly for each sip.
T - The nose is inverted, with the flavors of Expedition Stout hitting first, followed up nicely by the warming charred oak and booze of the bourbon barrel. Perfectly balanced, with a hint of sweetness in the finish that enhances rather than distracts.
M - Exquisitely smooth and velvety, the brilliant addition of Double Cream Stout shines through here. Soft and creamy, yet medium to full in body, this stout isn't as viscuous and chewy as some of its peers, but it sits on the palate wonderfully.
This is a beast of a bourbon barrel stout. Its various elements are in awesome harmony, and while it won't kick you in the face the way some of its ilk will (not that there's anything wrong with that), it makes a delightful late-winter companion, even in a ridiculously crowded bar. 1,291 charactersAJacob81, Feb 17, 2012

APPEARANCE
Well, what do you expect? It's black as night, and sat under a mocha-colored head that dissipated quickly. There was no lacing, but the beer had some pretty apparent alcohol legs. There wasn't any light coming through on this one. With a name like Black Note, would you expect anything else?
SMELL
This is heavy on the bourbon in the nose, which brings notes of vanilla and toasted coconut. There is a lot of nice complexity that ranges from sweet to slightly boozy. A hefty amount of chocolate and licorice comes through, and brings a bit of coffee and roasted malt with it. This is the type of beer that you get full from by just smelling - there is a LOT going on! 
TASTE
First off, this beer is remarkably smooth. The bourbon is not as strong as it was on the nose, but it is definitely present. With the bourbon, notes of vanilla, licorice, and toasted coconut come out. Surprisingly, the alcohol is very well hidden. The beer starts off milky sweet, with smooth caramel and toffee characteristics, then finishes with a nice hoppy bitterness. The bourbon lasts a long time after the swallow, making this beer have an absolutely amazing after taste. 
MOUTHFEEL
This beer drinks like a pillow - it's smooth! It has a velvet-creamy mouthfeel, sort of like melted chocolate. There isn't much carbonation, which adds to the creaminess. The beer has a nice big body which makes it a sipper. The intense aftertaste lingers for an extremely long time. 
OVERALL
This beer is incredible. It can hang with the big boy bourbon barrel aged brews and hold its ground. It's a special beer that demands a special occasion, but the taste is so good that you'll find an excuse to drink it! I wouldn't say that this is the barrel-aged stout to end all barrel-aged stouts, but it is absolutely incredible and worth seeking out.
Cheers. 1,878 charactersMaxSpang, Feb 17, 2012

Glad i got to bx early for this event and got a seat right up at the bar. 2 9oz pours of this barrel aged imperial stout.
Poured out the usual motor oil color of dark black with a fairly good amount of head on it. The smell was overwhelmingly of bourbon, i guess that is what you get when you age a beer for 18 months in the barrel! Taste was less bourbony than the smell, was very enjoyable drink. Mouthfeel was a little thin on this one, again because i hold every RIS up to the zhukov standard of thick and chewy!
Glad to experience this on draft, i would by no means pay what people are paying on ebay for a bottle of this, good buy not life changing

A - The constant flow from the tap as people lined the bar at least two deep produced a plethora of pitch black snifters on the bar-top, each one crowned delicately by loose dark brown foam.
S - Heavily roasted, plenty of coffee made its way out of this beer with cocoa and chocolate accents. Mellow oak and bourbon follow up.
T - Burnt toast and charred oak paired with the beer's already strong cocoa and coffee proved to be pretty taxing to drink. Chocolate and warm bourbon heat followed nicely.
M - Voluptuous and rich, the balance of this beer is well done. Plenty of hops aid the roasted bitterness while the thinning alcohol warmth finishes out.
O - While Black Note is certainly a great brew, it's also an example of what hype and "rarity" can elevate a beer to. Don't expect anything life changing from this one; it's another heavy stout but, thankfully, balance sets it apart from some other overly-alcohol-rich stouts. 1,073 charactersBeerFMAndy, Feb 03, 2012

The taste is surprisingly smooth for the abv. I get a lot of vanilla and creamy chocolate upfront with a hint of bourbon and it finishes a bit dry with a hint of hops and bourbon. I would like a little more bourbon but that is just my personal preference. The mouthfeel is thick and creamy with little to no carbonation and very sticky. I feel like this is a fantastic offering by bells and would love to see them start making it on a larger scale. It wasn't my favorite example of the style but definitely among the top. Seek this one out if you get the chance. 866 charactersJAYBLACK, Feb 02, 2012

4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Deep black with a thick brown cap that leaves great lace. Smells of strong vanillin and bourbon, with lots of roasted malt character. Brown sugar and a little chocolate as well.
Prominent vanilla tones, dark chocolate bitterness, coffee, sweet molasses, and alcohol on the palate. The menu says "...with bourbon undertones," but that couldn't be more inaccurate -- bourbon absolutely dominates this beer. Good thing that's what I was looking for. It lacks the bourbon 'attack' (for lack of a better descriptor) that GI Bourbon County Stout has, which is not a slight towards Black Note. The bourbon character is awesome. Loads of vanilla match the sweet roasted malt foundation very well.
The minimally-carbonated, dense body is far and away the highlight of this beer. Quite possibly the silkiest, smoothest body I have ever experienced, in liquid form at least... Mr. Bell does it again. Black Note is an exquisite sipper. High on my list of stouts as well as barrel-aged beers. 982 charactersdpasotti, Feb 02, 2012
4.2/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This was sampled at the Beer Sellar in Indianapolis for their Super Bell's Party before the Super Bowl. It poured a full bodied darkest of blacks with a one finger khaki head. It smells like a barrel aged stout. It has the creamed coffee, chocolate, with a touch or bourbon and vanilla. It is essentially a poor man's Bourbon County. It has a good amount of roast with a good amount of bourbon and vanilla. That said, lighter and less intense than Bourbon County. It's really drinkable because of this. The alcohol takes a backseat as well. The longer you sip the more the char makes itself known, alongside the vanilla. It leaves plenty of roast behind. Regardless, it drinks really nice and everything meshes rather well. This is a nice barrel aged stout. I'm glad I could try it. 782 charactersaasher, Feb 02, 2012

It is black as motor oil with a nice tan mocha head that leaves a nice ring of lacing with each drink. I get nice oak from the bourbon barrel, followed by coffe, and bitter chocolate. The taste is great I get bourbon right up front, next is the coffee and chocolate with a nice sweetness from the malt and cream, at the very end is a roasted flavor for me its a little too much its the only reason this didn't get a 5. The mouthfeel is amazing it feel as thick as other big stouts but at the same time that feeling leaves as you drink it and the carbonation is great for this style. Overall is one of the best stouts that I have ever had, I can't believe its this good. 759 charactersphisigben, Feb 01, 2012

A - Poured into a snifter, its a very, dark black beer that allows no light to get through. It has a small coffee colored head that stays strong along the edges
S - Notes of coffee, vanilla, dark chocolate, caramel malt and bourbon barrel spicyness. You definitely get the creamy sweetness of the double cream stout with the darker expedition favors. As I let it sit and warm up, the nose become much stronger and sweeter as the vanilla becomes more prominent 
T - Initially, sweet vanilla, mocha chocolate, caramel and the heavier coffee favors come through. You definitely get the barrel aged spiciness in this one. One of the nice things about the barrel aged aspects of this is its blended in perfectly with the beer to add new levels of flavor. The spice from the bourbon really lingers on the tongue. As it warms up, the vanilla and sweetness really opens up. 
MF - Velvety smooth allowing it to coat the tongue and mouth beautifully. This is where adding the double cream stout really stands out as that and the aging seem to have taken off some of Expedition's rougher edges. After the beer goes down, it leaves a nice tingle on the tongue to go with the bourbon flavors. This is the part of the beer that is just amazing. 
O - A wonderful, well balanced beer by Bell's. It shows how well barrel aging can add to a beer's flavor without overpowering it. Definitely worth having and a great beer overall 1,455 charactersjeonseh, Jan 27, 2012

4.67/5  rDev +3.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Served in a tulip glass at 7 Monks in Traverse City. Enjoyed in the company of zoso1967 and TCHopCraver.
Appearance: Pours about as black as they come, with some mocha accents sneaking through around the edges of the glass. A bubbly, tan one-finger head tops things off, with pretty spectacular lacing crawling up the sides of the tulip. Surprisingly good retention. You can just tell by looking at this one that it's going to be a beast.
Smell: Very sweet up front in the nose. Lots of molasses, brown sugar, vanilla, dark chocolate, coffee, and licorice. Some oak and bourbon are discernible as well. The more bitter notes are lingering in the background, but provide a nice backdrop for the sweeter elements and really add to the depth and complexity of the aroma.
Taste: I think the taste trumps the aroma of this beer as far as balance and complexity go. Very creamy and delightfully smooth, with the sweeter elements up front again. As you finish a sip, the roasty oak, bourbon, and bitter coffee/chocolate take over and leave you with a pleasantly dry finish, given how much malt punch there is on the front end. So balanced and smooth; I never would have guessed the ABV was higher than 11%.
Mouthfeel: Medium/Full bodied, creamy and smooth, with minimal carbonation. While quite sweet at first, the beer finishes surprisingly dry. As such, it is not all that taxing on the palate, even with an ABV of 11.5%.
Overall: This beer certainly lived up to my expectations and was an incredibly complex, balanced, and delicious example of the style. Very drinkable for the ABV and stands toe-to-toe with the best imperials out there. 1,639 charactersBuckyFresh, Jan 26, 2012

4.82/5  rDev +7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewing the infamous Black Note Stout from Bell's Brewery Inc. Black Note Stout is a barrel aged blend of Bell's Expedition Stout and Double Cream Stout. A huge thank you to BeerAdvocate user FrankenBrew for tipping me off to this under-the-radar tapping.
Score: 97
Unknown vintage keg tap pour served in a 12+ oz pilsner glass and enjoyed on 01/25/12, courtesy of the Malt House in Madison -- one of the best bars in the Midwest.
Appearance: The lighting in the bar is not great, so bear with me. Body is a jet black color with thin caramel colored highlights at the absolute top of the glass. I arrived with a glass of this awaiting me (to ensure getting a pour), so I am unsure if it was served with any head (and if so, what the head looked like). A super thin tan ring of head coats the outside of the glass. No real lacing, but a slowly dripping, thick oily layer coats the side of the glass as you drink. 4.5/5
Smell: The aroma is incredibly complex. There is raisin/fig, other nondescript dark fruit and vanilla from my first pull. Then sticky brown sugar and molasses, followed by light amounts of licorice. Definitely getting notes of chocolate and caramel malt as well. At points, the beer smells like molasses-and-vanilla soaked raisins. The aroma is a perfect blend of stout and barrel aromas. 5/5
Taste: Equally as complexly flavored as the aroma, and incredibly balanced. First impression is an interesting blend of creamy (milk?) chocolate and vanilla. There is a slight roastiness in there, but it's very faint. The flavor of this brew falls somewhere between Kentucky Breakfast Stout and Goose Island Bourbon County Brand Stout. The midpalate is loaded with mellow, slightly sweet dark fruit, creamy malts, molasses/brown sugar and bourbon flavors without the alcohol bite. Light dark licorice flavors are in there somewhere towards the finish, but no licorice lingers in the finish at all. Absolutely no alcohol is detectable, save for a little warming effect as the beer warms, so I was a bit shocked to discover that this beer is 11.5% ABV. Finish lingers with an interesting mix of light chocolate, vanilla, molasses and dark fruit. Each sip leaves a seemingly different mix of those finishing flavors. Some pulls finish with more raisin-and-brown sugar like flavors, while others seem chocolatier, while others seem like a smooth vanilla-and-molasses mix. This is an absolutely astonishing medley of stout and barrel flavors. Everything you could want from either is present. This beer is dangerously drinkable. 4.75/5
Mouthfeel: Not overly heavy, but still thick and viscous. Medium bodied, minimal (if any) carbonation. Mouthfeel is creamy and sticky. Finish is decently (but not overly) sweet -- essentially raisin-and-vanilla like. 4.5/5
Overall: Hoo boy! This one absolutely lives up to the hype. I would have to have them side by side before I can say this definitively, but I think that I enjoyed this beer ever slightly more than Kentucky Breakfast Stout. I had the fortune of drinking five or six glasses of KBS on tap over the past few days, so the comparison is relatively fresh in my mind. Bell's Black Note Stout brings every flavor and aroma you could possibly want in either a stout or a barrel aged beer, and it blends them in an incredibly drinkable, palate-satisfying experience. A world class beer, no doubt. If only I had the time for another pint, I'd have knocked back several.
Recommendation: Seek this one out. Chicago will have a tapping of this sometime mid-February, so if you are the area, make room on your calendar.
Pairings: A medium-cooked New York Strip would go wonderfully with this beer.
Cost: $6 for a glass. I am not sure what a 750 ml bottle sells for, but I can assure you that $6 for a full pint of this brew is one of the best beer deals you will ever find in a bar. 3,843 charactersjegross2, Jan 26, 2012

*From notes
-- Thanks to the folks at RFD for hookin' me up with this epic want --
A: Black. Or damn close to it. Really, this is one dark glass of beer. Minimal head, with a faint, creamy collar.
S: Heavy whipping cream, aged wood, toasty brown sugar and luscious bourbon overwhelm my nostrils.
T: One of the things I love so very much about craft beer is the journey, where the brew leads your palate. Bell's Black Note, my friends, is this kind of beer. It begins rather mellow, it doesn't push the limits and extremes that others in the BA RIS world do. Rather, it's a delicate balancing act of whipping cream, rich chocolate, crushed vanilla bean, toasted tannin and incredibly smooth bourbon. There's also a pretty sizeable hop kick on the mid to finish.
M: Not overly viscous. It's quite mild and medium bodied, allowing the beer to almost flow through, without getting caught in the density of many in-style.
O: Bell's Black Note has easily been one of my top wants for years, and to have the opportunity to have a giant snifter of it at my leisure with good friends was an absolute pleasure. This really did remind me of a Charlie Parker number, as all you gotta do it sit back and let the master do their thing.
We did this side-by-side with BCBS '11, which in my opinion did this beer a disservice. A brew as special as this shouldn't be compared to what I feel is the best in class. Rather, it should stand on it's own. So yeah, BCBS may have packed the oomph that Black Note didn't, but on it's own, this delicate little number really is something special. 1,607 charactersRhettroactive, Jan 24, 2012

Poured from the tap into a snifter.
A- Pours a jet black color with only the tiniest bit of light shining through the edges. A thick coffee brown head leaves good lacing.
S- The first thing I notice is how subtle the bourbon is on the nose (which is much more preferable to it being overpowering). Deep roasted aroma with some hints of vanilla and oak.
T- Amazing how much bourbon flavor you get without the stingy alcohol burn. Waves of roasted coffee, vanilla, milk chocolate, anise, dark fruits, and bourbon all meld together nicely. 
M- Full bodied with medium/low carbonation. The alcohol is hidden so well I would have guessed this at 8%. 
O- Truly a special brew. I'm so glad I got the chance to try this. 739 charactersprojectflam86, Jan 22, 2012

Nose: Lots of bourbon character. Oak and vanilla. Caramelized sugars with molasses. On top of chocolate, roast, espresso, and dark fruit. 
Flavor: Opens with dark chocolate and espresso and moves quickly into vanilla, oak, and lots of dark sugars. For how big it is, this beer actually dries out quite a bit on the finish which aids drinkability immensely and brings forth slightly vinous dark fruit notes. There's also a decent amount of bitterness coming from seemingly both the hops and the roast. Sweetness builds mid palate but dries out quickly. Impressive combination of flavors.
Mouthfeel: Viscous and creamy. Finishes dry with a bit of acidity. Long finish with notes of roast, chocolate, and hints of acidity. 
Overall: In the course of my beer drinking days Bourbon Barrel Stout has shifted from being one of my favorite styles to one of my least favorite. That doesn't detract anything from this beer. Outstanding and well-constructed. 1,061 charactersjacewg, Jan 18, 2012

A. Pitch black, like a rolling thundercloud. Surprising amount of head and retention for a beer this big....a light brown, quarter finger ring circles the glass and rests peacefully through the session. Really good lacing absolutely coats the glass. Top notch. 
S. Lots of vanilla, molasses, chocolate, dark fruit, and oak. Smells like bourbon soaked chocolate cake. It's pretty tame right now. Not exploding off the nose, but it has a velvety, decadent bouquet. Still, I would have liked to see a more complex, assertive nose on this. Good, not great. 
T. That's very nice thank you very much. Packed with vanilla, bourbon, oak, dark fruit, raisin, molasses. Slightly dry, hoppy finish. Black Note has a significant and pleasing dark chocolate presence, backed up with some roasted coffee and oak char. A caramel smoothness softens the edges around this one....just a kiss of booze on the back end. It is very well made, yet somewhat light for a such a bruiser. I expect more of a sweet, cloying, decadent treatment a la Goose Island. This is good, but I have had more complex and better barrel aged stouts. 
M. Is it fair to say this drinks thin? Here is where I feel Black Note loses out to the competition, particularly Firestone, Founders, and Goose Island. There is a decidedly absent feel here. An abbreviated finish leaves me wanting. Well integrated flavors give this a good mark but greatness escapes the Black Note. 
O. Good. A smooth, rich bouquet and decadent molasses make this a very good barrel aged stout. But it is not worth the hype. Not by a country mile. BCBS and CBS kick this in the boobs. Do not trade your cellar for it. But definitely try it if it is on tap nearby. 1,748 characterssiege06nd, Jan 11, 2012

A: squid ink black with a beautiful ring of chocolate milk bubbles around the side. Not much lacing, typical of the style. Awesome. I want to drink the sh*t out of this.
S: Mmmm, delicious bourbon. Vanilla notes. Roasted chocolate malt. A bit of hot booziness. As it warms, the malt profile comes through a bit. But mostly bourbon.
T: The taste is surprisingly dry and hoppy. Dominated by bourbon flavors but fades quickly into a malty, mild coffee aftertaste. Dried fruit flavors overarch more than others of the style. A bit thin for my taste.
M: Thin for a bourbon barrel stout. Also creamy and more carbonated. Pleasant but different.
O: This is a delicious beer and one of the better ones I've had. I love the bourbon and hoppyness flavors and the creamy mouthfeel. Probably from the double cream stout. However, the taste and nose are a bit too bourbon (one-note) dominated. If I had a bottle (not likely) I would definitely age at least a year. Outstanding beer. But it's no BCBS. 1,029 charactersIrishColonial, Jan 11, 2012

Growler to Snifter
Thanks to MrHirschybar for this tick!
App- A very inky black pour out of the growler with only a few bubbles but no color to them. Sadly I feel that this was the end of the line for this grolwer but Steve was gracious enough to save me enough to make a go of it. No cling or lace but very creamy and dense in my snifter.
Smell- Across the board it was a bit thin from sitting but thats okay. It was nicely aromatic with notes from the bourbon and a bit of creamy chocolate but didnt smell overly grainy or small. A little bit of creeping vanilla on a big pull with a slight roast note.
Taste- Still very bourbon forward out of the growler that was on its final leg. Much more smooth than I would have thought as expedition was a bit grainy for me. The double cream blend makes this really nice. A lot of cream comes on the final flavors with a bit more vanilla which was a welcome suprise.
Mouth- As the growler is closing this did lose a little bit on the feel. I felt it was a bit thin to me with a good low/medium carbonation with just touches of airiness to it. A little bit of bourbon, booze and vanilla remain on the palate.
Drink- A very good stout that was treated well and blended very well. I think this one would do well being on tap for me or a fresher bottle. STILL, I will capitalize that one. I cant thank MrHirschybar enough for being a great BA and friend to make this one last for me. I recommend him as a trader and this beer to all. 1,497 charactersFosterJM, Jan 03, 2012

Pours an inky, viscous blackness with a crop of browned head. Fades out with little retention or lacing on the glass. 
Sweet and robust in the nose with dark chocolate and roasted caramel malts. Chocolate cake with vanilla, oak, and warm bourbon. Boozy and sweet but balanced. 
A wave of dark malts crash upon the tongue with chocolate and toffee notes. Coffee tones with sweet vanilla bean and oaky smoothness. Creamy and soft with a burly malt backbone and a dash of anise, tempered by the boozy warmth, which is incredibly smooth. Bourbon soaked chocolate cake on the back end, with some lingering warmth. 
Fuller body, nice carbonation, creamy, smooth and ultra soft on the tongue. Drinks like an absolute dream - excellent balance and I can distinctly taste both of the base beers int he profile, along with the barrel character. THIS is what I want from a barrel aged stout.

Lots of bourbon, vanilla, a huge molasses presence, along with the strong, toasty malt backbone.
Taste is similar: vanilla leading to molasses and then finished with the semi-sweet malt. This beer is SUPER balanced for a BA stout. Really impressed.
The mouthfeel is spot on with light carbonation that lifts the bourbon and vanilla flavors off of the palate. 
I really hope bells decides to bottle this and distribute it. It's definitely up there with the best ba stouts but it doesn't trump them all. A fantastic job by Bells. 669 charactershippityhops85, Dec 22, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -0.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On-tap, served in a wine glass
Pours an ink black, a little sludgy, with little to no head. Just some brown foam around the collar of the glass.
The aroma is of rich bourbon, butterscotch, vanilla, toffee and a large amount of oak. The oak was largely present when the temperature was cooler, but as it warmed, the oak subsided a bit.
Rich, roasty goodness, bourbon, and vanilla up front. Oak carries through the middle with burnt toffee and then a bourbon, dark Belgian chocolate, roasty finish.
Full bodied with perfectly low carbonation. This was a thick stout, but had nice lift off the palate. Not oily by any stretch. Thick, full and luscious with a dry oak finish.
This beer is the real deal. A great combination of roast, bourbon, oak and butterscotch/burnt toffee. Definitely a beer one should seek out. 817 charactersColForbinBC, Dec 22, 2011

Appearance - Dark and black, very little head or lacing to speak of, semblance of legs when swirled in the glass.
Smell - Whoah! Wonderful combo of Vanilla, carmel, toffee, bourbon and oak.
Taste - OMG, what a rare treat! This was served fresh and on tap, starts big bourbon with vanilla bean and oak, then creamy bailey's and burnt toffee, then dark roasty coffee with dark fruit flavors. Lingering oak and bourbon with some pleasant heat between sips. Very special.
Mouthfeel - Medium to full mouthfeel and mouthcoating, silky and so smooth, there is just enough carb to add some wonderfully crisp edges along the sides of the tongue, add to overall complex mouthfeel.
Overall - So complex and well balanced, what a nice treat, plan your trip to Bell's around the availability of this in their taproom, I can only begin to imagine what a year or so would to to a wonderful stout like this, must try!
***Re-Review, this was is a bomber aged for 2.5 years, purchased after the 5oz pour that I rated above, which was poured fresh on draft - part of a flight at the brewery:
Appearance - Pours a solid finger of a warm medium brown cinnamon head that comes down to a thin rich looking cap in a minute, color of the body is an opaque black, 
Smell - Begins with rich dark ripe fruits, sweet creamy vanilla, milk chocolate, a whiff of coconut, and a wonderful bourbon saturated oak. After letting it breath in a large snifter for a few minutes the nose "reverses", with the creamy vanilla and bourbon soaked oak taking the forefront, and the rich fruits and milk chocolates in the back
Taste - Wow, this is delicious, but is very much like the nose after breathing in the glass - the first dominant flavors are a lovely oaky bourbon, the vanilla is more of a dried vanilla bean now, and there to balance are a darker semi-sweet chocolate that's barely been dipped in cream, the fruits are present, hints of plum, fig, and black cherry. At the end of the quaff you get a slight astringency of dark fruit skins, some dried oak, some lightly roasted malt, even a hint of black licorice, and a slightly warming of bourbon that wafts up into the sinuses. 
Mouthfeel - The mouthfeel is nearly full here, but this "effect" is mostly from the bold and mouth-filling flavors. This is very smooth and silky feeling, just short of creamy, but not heavy or mouthcoating at all. In fact, an aged Expedition coats the mouth quite a bit more than this. The finish is on the drier side, with pockets of warm bourbon fruits and dark chocolates left in the mouth corners. Carb on this is almost medium and still very effervescent, and while soft and smooth still provides just a bit of scrub, and leaves wonderful tingly edges over the sides of the tongue. Really a nice mouthfeel here.
Overall - This is really an excellent bourbon barrel aged stout. I've just recently rate a similarly aged bottle of KBS, and this is Better. Better because the flavors are so well balanced, and the mouthfeel is superior as KBS just seemed a bit less substantial. BCBS is still perfection, but this comes pleasantly close. The bourbon is so well balanced by the depth of additional flavors, and the mouthfeel and weight are right for the style. This is also typically more attainable and available multiple times throughout the year. Get your hands on some Black Note. Fresh is good but aged is even better for those that are willing to cellar it for awhile - keep an eye out for this in a 4-pak which has been done a few times recently. Cheers! 3,591 charactersblackcompg, Dec 10, 2011

A: Black with a small brown head. Very viscous with serious lacing.
S: Smell is a nice bourbon with some roast/chocolate in there as well. It's nice, but it's not super strong. I wish I got more.
T: Okay wow, now this beer is something special. At first it's a heavy dose of bourbon with some sweetness, oak and chocolate - similar to Bourbon County. As I drink it, though, I realize that there is more to this beer than meets the eye. It's got some nice depth with some great coffee/roasty notes hiding beneath the surface. This beer is so easy to drink, I never would guess the ABV is so high. Awesome.
M: Thick and creamy. The mouthfeel really makes this one stand out, it feels like drinking melted marshmallows.
O: This beer is just flat-out amazing - one of the best stouts I've ever had. I can't wait for them to bottle it. 889 charactersstarrdogg, Dec 09, 2011

Pours a super dark black color w/ a one finger chocolate head. Great lacing on the side of my glass. The nose is mainly coffee, chocolate, malt and hops. A nice nose, but the general thought at the table was the nose was on the weak side. Taste is bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, coffee and hops. Absolutely none of the 11.5% alcohol is evident at all. Feel is amazingly creamy, full-bodied, and smooth. Easily the best part of this beer. Overall, a World Class brew- glad I got to try it! Cheers. 518 charactersjayhawk73, Dec 08, 2011

S: Bourbon mostly up front, some stout characteristics. Light coffee and cappucino as it warms.
L: Thick black, not much head except a ring of tan foam around the glass.
T: Bourbon with vanilla leading to a dark chocolate malt backbone. Creamy sweet body with lots of cappuccino mocha flavors. Low bitterness leading to a very smooth roasty finish. Some sweetness on the finish with a touch more bourbon.
M: Creamy full body, low carbonation, alcohol slightly warming.
Just an amazing beer. Incredibly smooth with the cream stout base and just enough character from the RIS base as well as the bourbon to round everything out. While this beer is sweet, it is also very well balanced with the bourbon which i love in -bal aged beers. One of the best. 806 charactersbum732, Dec 07, 2011

A: Viscous black pour with a small brown head. What does stick around laces decently. 4
S: The aroma is extremely well balanced. Bourbon and some booze up front, but a lot of chocolate balance it out. Roastiness, I'm guessing coffee, hides in the shadows. Making it's presence known when you need it. 4.5
T: The taste follows the smell wonderfully. The bourbon is up front, but chocolate and booze quickly provide balance and body, before roasty coffee takes over the backend. The balance is there, the flavor profile develops nicely on the palate, and overall the taste is far above average. 4.5
MF: The body could have been a bit fuller, at times I believed it was too watery, still medium to heavy overall. Booze is noted, dry finish. 3.5
O Delicious, certainly lives up to the hype. Balance is enough to make it great. The bourbon is not too intrusive. I thought it was very drinkable. Happy to have had the chance to try this. 4.5

Desert at RFD Washington's Bell's Beer Dinner. Bell’s Black Note Stout paired with a Black Note Brownie with ice cream and caramel.
A: Motor oil black pour without much head at all. What was there was light brown. 4
S: Bourbon mainly with a ton of chocolate, some roasted malts and vanilla are coming out underneath. The aroma is rich and balanced nicely. Just on a different level. 4.5
T: My God this is good. And with this decedent brownie and ice cream...it’s a good thing I was sitting down. So much chocolate is in front of me. The integration of the bourbon and the stout is what really makes this great. 5

a - Pours a pitch black color with one inch of dark tan head and light carbonation evident. Head lasts for a few minutes and leaves some spotty lacing on the glass.
s - Smells of bourbon, oak, vanilla, roasted malts, sweet and bitter chocolate, and caramel malts. Really amazing nose with the bourbon, vanilla, and chocolate mixing wonderfully. Pretty perfect nose.
t - Tastes of bourbon, oak, vanilla, sweet chocolate sweet dark fruits, roasted malts, bitter chocolate, and cream. Again, really great here.
m - Medium to full body and low carbonation. Somewhat thicky and creamy, really great mouthfeel. No alchool heat really at all.
o - Overall a truely fantastic beer; reminds me, as well as others I was with, a lot of BCS Rare. Nose is wonderful and no real alcohol heat, I had no problem drinking 3 full glasses of this one. I put it on par with BCS Rare and the normal BCS, which are two of my favorite stouts. Would love to have it again sometime. 1,184 charactersmdfb79, Dec 07, 2011
4.63/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On draft at Churchkey in D.C.
The beer is black with a thin beige head. After a few swirls of the snifter the head expands to 3/4 inch, leaving a thick sheet of lacing cascading down the snifter. 
The aroma, while nice, is quite a bit weaker than expected, offering bourbon and roast with a hint of vanilla.
The flavor, on the other hand, is a thing of beauty. Bold bourbon presence throughout. Oily thick with a delicious roast character. This is indeed a world class beer and in my top tier of barrel aged imperial stouts. Not terribly complex, per se, but masterfully balanced and just superb.
The mouthfeel is ridiculously good, perhaps the best I have yet encountered in a beer of this ilk. The Double Cream Stout shows itself here. Creamy and full bodied, with alcohol content gracefully disguised.
Worthy of its overall A+ rating, this beer was sublime. 865 charactersHuhzubendah, Dec 07, 2011

Beer served on draft in a snifter. Beer is black with a lazy head of tan bubbles, some lacing, minimal carbonation, lots of lacing.
Aroma is sweet, bourbon, malt, not much else.
Beer is also sweet, smooth, creamy, decent, mouth-feel is the best thing about this beer, high in alcohol, sweet, good finish, a decent barrel aged whatever but don't knock yourself out looking for it like i did. 590 charactersdrabmuh, Dec 07, 2011

Pours super thick black with a ring of tan head and a nice web of lacing. Looks great, and it previews the excellent silky feel.
Smell is good, I get licorice, vanilla, some sweeter bourbon and oak, a little malt, a touch of roast, and some maple syrup. I just knock it cause it isn't really jumping out of the glass. Some alcohol pops out with a swirl.
Taste is amazing and so is the feel, it's so silly and inviting with a range of amazing layers of flavor. Sticky, chewy, semi sweet and savory, there is no heat in there which amazing. Flavors include licorice, sweeter bourbon-very nice bourbon like van winkle 12, nice roasty chocolate notes, oak, lactose sugar, a little alcohol sweetness, some savory slight bacony notes, and some espresso cream. Wow, stunning beer.
Overall this is killing. What a great beer, my favorite bells and that says something. 911 charactersDreadnaught33, Dec 06, 2011

On tap at HopCat - 11/27/11
Poured into a tulip and served with a dark mocha head. There is a nice wall of lacing near the top and stringy lace on the adjacent side.
A lot of woody notes - oak and cedar - resonate amidst smells of dark chocolate and vanilla. 
The taste can be summed up at a high level as earthy and complex. In more detail, I taste oak, vanilla, dark chocolate, burnt grains, tobacco, cedar all working toward a sweet raisin ending. The tongue is finally left with some well placed booziness and a coffee like bitterness.
While chewy, sticky, dry, and full, the mouthfeel is nothing in excess. It is a well balanced feel not distracting but well placed.
At first, I wasn't blown away at the taste. After giving it many sips, I was really intrigued by the nuances of the flavors. Thanks to Hopcat's wood aged festival, I had the likes of KBS, CBS, BA Blackout Stout, and BB Plead the 5th over the weekend. I can easily say that Black Note is on par with the best Imperial Stouts out there. 1,054 charactersTCgoalie, Nov 30, 2011

16 ounce pour into a large snifter at Bell's Ecentric Cafe.
A- Almost completely black, with some subtle mahogany shades on the edges, with about a half-inch mocha head that vanishes quickly. Kind of expected this going in, so not much surprise here.
S- Lots of subtle bourbon notes, chocolate, coffee, vanilla, oak, all mingling together seamlessly. Just a pleasure to smell.
T- Boom. Vanilla and bourbon up front, with nice coffee and chocolate notes in the middle and back, followed by some very subtle bourbon heat. Damn, this is amazing. Stronger vanilla notes come out afterward. Delicious.
M- This is where it goes from being great to outstanding. Thick, full-bodied, and super creamy. Easily the most standout part of this beer, an for good reason. It's absolutely perfect, with just the right amount of carbonation.
O- There's not a lot more I can really say about this beer. The mouthfeel alone puts it in a class of its own when compared to other bal-stouts. Add to that the fanastic flavors that pull through from the base beers without being overshadowed by the barrel treatment, and I believe we have a world class stout that definitely lived up to its insane hype. Consume this with reckless abandon if given the chance. 1,374 charactersJoshVandy, Nov 22, 2011

4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed on tap a few times recently at Bell's, review is taken from notes from each occasion.
Poured into an oversized snifter. Deep black and opaque body, light fails to break the surface. One and a half finger coffee stained head lingers a bit longer than I expected. A slight amount of lacing clings to the walls of the glass. 
Beautiful aroma. Chocolate and caramel aromas meld with the Bourbon. The balance between the the sweetness and bourbon is inching close to perfection. Roasted malt with slight char is subtle beneath. Pleasant vanilla noted through out.
Bell's could not have picked two better beers to blend and barrel age. The bold and assertive flavors of Expedition are complimented wonderfully by the smooth and creamy Double Cream. The flavor begins much like the aroma. Caramel and chocolate infused bourbon rolls across the tongue. Pleasant roast develops on the midpalate only to has the edge softened by a vanilla and milk creaminess. 
Full bodied, though tiptoeing on the lighter side of full. Low carbonation, very appropriate, provide a very enjoyable creaminess to the mouthfeel. Long finish, I would not want it any other way.
Black Note had been my biggest personal wale for the longest time. I am very fortunate to live close to Bell's and have had the opportunity to drink it several times now. Each time I drink it I am as impressed as the first. Tremendous balance in the blend and the bourbon is integrated beautifully. Very easy to drink but one that will certainly catch up with you. As enjoyable as any beer I have ever had, one worth seeking out. 1,589 characterskzoobrew, Nov 20, 2011

Enjoyed it so much, we had to come back a second time later in the day. At 6.75 for 16 unholy ounces, how could you pass up on a second glass?
Appearance: Black,, black, black. It was fun to watch the bartender pour this one as it looked just like she was draining used motor oil from an old Chevy. Zero head and not. Hint of lacing.
Smell: Refined/smooth chocolate, bourbon, vanilla, and dark fruits.
Taste: Wow! The best beer Ive ever had. Complex and refined with flavors of sweet chocolate chips, almost like a chocolate souffle. Super smooth bourbon for sure. 
Mouthfeel: zero carbonation makes it very drinkable brew. In fact, that makes this on a bit dangerous as its smoothness can make you forget the quality (and alcohol content) of beer you are enjoying. 
Without a doubt, this lives up to the hype. If you ever get the chance, make sure to get a taste of this one. 976 charactersMscarpen, Nov 19, 2011

A - black as the name implies. Minimal head disappears almost immediately.

Pours black as night, truly held to multiple lights only the SLIGHTEST of brown legs throw through. Poured into a 6 zo snifter it seem to have some carbonation but hard to comment on. 
The aromas is dark bakers chocolate, roasted malt, espresso and vanilla. 
Wow..tastes like pie crust and bakers chocolate blended with vanilla and hints of oak. Yes as a bourbon lover a bit more oak would be ok, but the chocolate and pie crust flavors are out of control. There just isn't a possible negative comment to be head.
The double creme did the job. This is creamy and full bodied as hell. Well carbonated and sinfully rich.

4.2/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4its huge but drinkable which i would figure its saving grace and the reason why its so sought after. But as for the midwest i would say this is a standard. Of excellence to say the least but in bourbon country its is also the most accessible. Both for attaining the barrells and lets just call it practice. 
The base to this stout is one of my favorite. The beer is not so much noticeable in the nose. I get the malty notes of the nose that was vanilla and bourbon hints. The beer is actually quite lean and easy going. Carbonation isn't particularly creamy. But malt smooth. Tingle. Bourbon, coffee toast, and a nice lingering note. Quite standard. Although a nice treat for the fan. 685 charactersrtepiak, Nov 10, 2011

Smelled strongly of bourbon and sticky maple, felt a slight sting from the alcohol and carbonation. Felt the carbonation was on the higher end for an imperial stouts. Heavy to medium body, slightly creamy like the Double Cream. 
Tasted molasses, BOURBON, slighty roasty flavor, prunes rolled in brown sugar, a touch of vanilla, and some fairly pleasing alcohol.
What a treat to have! It is a worthy member in the pantheon of fantastic Michigan big stouts (e.g., Founder's Breakfasts, Dark Horse's Plead the Fifth and other holiday stouts.) 606 charactersJips, Nov 08, 2011

S:chocolate, coffee, bourbon, oak, multi-dimensional smelling beer. Not too much of one smell disracts from the whole experience. It smells amazing!
T: the ultimate!!! So smooth with a prominent bourbon barrel flavor that compliments the expo and cream that come together. One of the best BB stouts I have had. 
Mouthfeel is oily, full with medium carbs. 
Overall, I can't say enough about this beer. I have been wanting to try this for a while now and feel lucky to have had it. 
On a good note: the lady working the bar said they shitloads of this and we should see more of it around this year!! 756 charactersJDizzle, Nov 07, 2011

Pours a pitch black brown color with a light tan collared head. Dark Chocolate, vanilla, and a touch of earthy leather aroma. Medium/heavy mouthfeel. Roast coffee adds some bitterness, dark chocolate, vanilla, all very well balanced together. Ends with a slight lingering bitterness. I find myself continuing to go back to Bell’s tent to try this one and everytime is just as enjoyable as the last. The 10.5% is there but well incorporated and is not abrasive at all. 528 characterskbutler1, Oct 23, 2011

It pours black with light head - oily looking as expected. The nose has a lot of expedition in it tempered with a nice smooth bourbon backing. The bourbon comes through nicely in the taste as well smoothing out the rough edges of the expo and not bringing too much butter to the party. There is some nice chocolate and coffee as well and it all comes together nicely. Balanced and tasty. Smooth in the mouth, just right on the carbonation with just a hint of heat. Expo is one of my standby beers so I've been dying to try this and it did not disappoint. Very damn good. 653 charactersnormyk, Oct 08, 2011

A: This beer pours an opaque black with a 1/4 inch of medium brown head. Head recedes almost immediately. No lacing to speak of. 
S: Nose is woody oak, bourbon, vanilla, roasted malts and light chocolate notes. 
T: Taste starts with roasted malts and licorice, dark fruits. Oak and bourbon come through.... lots of bourbon, but not overpowering with a slight vanilla character. The bourbon flavoring is blended nicely. Nice deep bitter chocolate towards the finish. Aftertaste has lingering coffee notes to it. 
M: Medium to fuller body, moderate carbonation, smooth, silky body.

A - Black as night...blah blah. But it is a good inch head on a 10oz pour. 
S - Bourbon...and hot. Smells of sweet woods, and alcohol. not to be shocked at the ABV.
T - Its a smoother Expo stout. But nothing like expo stout. Leather and mahogany, following by some burnt sugar and bourbon. Slightly burning.
M - Double Cream shines here. It is very much a filling mouth feel. Hot though, ABV is present.
O - Not the best BA stout I have had. That is still BCS rare. But, this is up there, and unique because of the mouth feel. Not as complex in the noise or taste however. 588 charactersdecadance, Sep 19, 2011

Pours nearly black with creamy tan head. Nose of chocolate, bourbon, and vanilla. Taste of bourbon, vanilla, caramel, wood...very smooth flavors that are well integrated. You can taste the dark fruit qualities of the Expedition Stout underneath the barrel aging here. Thick body with low/medium carbonation. Overall, an outstanding ba stout. Would be great to see this in bottles. 485 characterswaltonc, Sep 10, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -8.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Served on-tap at a recent Bell's event, unfortunately they had just run out of appropriate glassware and poured this lovely brew into a red wine glass at a colder temperature than I was expecting. Luckily my second glass came in a tall Bell's tulip.
Black Note is the color of dark chocolate with a head that looks like liquified wheat - a light brown that had broken down into a cling around the side of the glass and a few frog's eyes by the time I had walked back to my table. I had to sit a while (5 minutes or so) to let it warm, and then the scent really started to show: bourbon, malt, burnt sugar and toasted vanilla with a slight hint of fruit... is that apricot? 
My sips started while it was still too cold... the burnt sugar was overwhelming at keg temps, but as it warmed up the bourbon and double cream stout notes moved forward. The double cream comes through much stronger than the expedition, but this is a unique offering apart from either - most notable is the slight bitterness, as if vanilla beans were roasted before being added for aging. The mouthfeel was lighter than I was expecting, but not any lighter than barrel-aging typically imparts. It leaves the beer drinkable in larger sips than I probably should have been taking, and the glass was gone before I knew it. Not quite in the same vein as a few other BA imperial stouts (KBS on tap is still the smoothest I've had the pleasure of drinking), but delicious nonetheless.
Most importantly, this was my first beer of the night (I wasn't about to let the Black Note run out while I drank something else), and something odd happened: after that, everything I drank (save the Oracle) had stout notes to it. A total palate take-over happened! If you're going to have the chance to try a Black Note, it gets better glass after glass... but everything else tastes like drinking through a BA Imperial Stout filter. be forewarned. 1,904 charactersfvernon, Sep 01, 2011
4.38/5  rDev -2.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had at the Bell's tap takeover at Yogi's out of a snifter. The two guys next to us were drinking Leinenkugel's Berry Weiss. I don't know what to say.
Pours a jet black with a small tan head that immediately fades away.
Smells of bourbon with a little oak and vanilla thrown into the mix.
There is a strong bourbon presence throughout the taste with vanilla and bitter roasted malts as well. There's also a little bit of a smooth creaminess to it, I'm guessing from the Double Cream Stout.
Thick and viscous mouthfeel. Lots of sludge.
Very good beer, but doesn't quite achieve Holy Grail status for me. The alcohol was not especially well hidden which I don't mind, but it knocks it down just a tick. A very good combo of two already good beers though and a very complex delightful treat. 792 charactersjmarsh123, Aug 31, 2011
4.5/5  rDev 0%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served on tap in a cervoise at the Great Taste of the Midwest. I have anticipated trying this for three years, so needless to say, I am excited. 
Appearance: My pour is an ebony black color with a modest creamy tan head. As I would expect with the high ABV, the cap fades rather quickly and leaves just a few dots of lace on the glass.
Smell: The aroma does not jump out of the glass, but it is full and complex. Lots of roasted malt and chocolate fudge are noticeable, with coffee and cream, subdued bourbon notes, and some raisins or other dark fruits as well. 
Taste: The blend here is just fantastic. It is difficult to describe the intricacy of the interaction of the flavors, but I will do my best. A light bourbon presence exists throughout, so each flavor melds in with that base. Full, deep, almost burnt roasted malt create the deepest bitterness and set the tone for the rest of the flavors. The taste lightens up with some creamy coffee notes. Still bitter, but light and creamy as well. From there, gooey fudge makes an appearance, sticking with a full creamy flavor. The bitter, creamy, and sweet flavors all work well with the bourbon to create different sensations. Some vanilla, oak, molasses, and anise add even further complexity.
Mouthfeel: Luxuriously thick and creamy. Using double cream stout really smooths out any rough edges in the feel. Lightly sticky sweet, a touch of oaky dryness toward the end. Creamy carbonation, a deceptive lack of alcohol presence, and a full body. 
Overall: Wow, this is pretty incredible. This is definitely an artful blend of two already good beers. The result capitalizes on the strengths of both beers - creamy and roasty, with the perfect amount of bourbon to blend everything together. This was tapped right as the rain started to come down at GTMW, so it was easy to get several pours as long as you were willing to venture out into the rain. Worth every effort to get it, and I would recommend putting forth any effort necessary to try this beer. 2,012 charactersKickInTheChalice, Aug 29, 2011
4.23/5  rDev -6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed a pour at the GTotMW 2011. Poured into the special taster glass. Very dark with a cocoa powder head. Looks great. The nose is big vanilla, bourbon and chocolate with some roasty goodness. Just a touch of oak as well. Dark chocolate, bourbon, vanilla and roast are the dominant flavors. Again, just a touch of oak. Very smooth, creamy and actually somewhat low-key in flavor. Good, creamy body with a low-medium carbonation is very nice for a BA Imperial Stout that is not overly sweet. This beer is more impressive in its balance, ease of drinking and mouthfeel than it is for its huge flavors or substantial complexities. Very enjoyable and glad I was able to give this a run. A buddy and I liked GL BA Blackout better, which were darn near side-by-side, but that isn't and indictment on the Black Note. 812 charactersseeswo, Aug 20, 2011

A- Pitch black color, opaque, one finger tan head that dissipates to a nice tan layer on top, nice lacing on the side. 
S- The aroma is fantastic, roasted malts, chocolate, vanilla, nice bourbon aroma that is very balanced in this beer.
T- The taste is even better than the aroma, really nice roasted flavors, bourbon and vanilla come out perfectly, some dark fruits are in the background, chocolate, roasted malts, coffee, oak, love this beer, everything I was expecting and more.
M- Medium/big mouth feel, really smooth and creamy, coats the palate.
O- This was one of the highlights of the festival for me. Bell’s tapped this beer at 5 pm, so it was one of the last beers I had at the festival. Got in line in time to get a good spot and waited as the the rain began to come down. This beer is very tasty, well balanced and complex, will seek this beer out any chance I can. 966 charactersChriscrundwell12, Aug 17, 2011

cellphone notes
appearance: served in a (short pour) bells pint glass, dark ebony body, creamy chocolatey head
smell: creamy chocolate waves, bourbon, vanilla, nice and roasty
taste: I think I've had this blend in years past, possibly before the black note name was branded. This one lasted until about 4pm on the eve of the GTOTM '11. A lot of the edge of expedition is cut by the double cream and barrel, which I think is a good think. Smooth and creamy, bourbon and vanilla more subtle than others, molasess, oak, dark chocolate, espresso.

taste: very good - tick it off the list 646 charactersdirtylou, Aug 15, 2011
4.25/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25this is the famed blend between expedition stout and double cream stout, all aged in bourbon barrels. expedition, of course, is the big big stout with big dark roasty malty goodness. double cream is pretty self-explanatory. what isn't self-explanatory is the tying of these two together. how can you lose? the big roasts and big malts combine with the velvety softness of a double cream stout and the vanilla notes and are wrapped in a big bow of love with the bourbon. it lacks the complexity of other world-class BA stouts like a.b. hunahpu's, but is still an all-star. if i lived in michigan still, i'd be picking it up whenever possible. 641 charactersFranch, Jun 17, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -3.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Had this on tap last night at Ashley's in Ann Arbor, as part of a Bell's 25th tap takeover celebration. I (thankfully) received the second to last glass of the night, as the keg kicked shortly after I sat down. The Black Note was brewed in 2008, and the keg had been in storage at a distributors cooler for the last year.
The beer was served in a 333ml tulip filled near to the brim, with no head. The liquid was piano black and looked to be quite viscous. The beer left a ring of film on the sides of the sides of the glass as I drank it.
There were pronounced notes of bourbon and dark, roasted malts in the nose. Behind that there were hints of vanilla, oak and sweet chocolate. The taste was outstanding. I was struck at how well balanced the blend was. The double cream stout mated with the Expedition in a pure harmony of taste. As Larry Bell commented to me "Sometimes one plus one equals three". There were elements of caramel, vanilla and chocolate on the sweet end, and dark roasted chewy malts on the other end. Tieing both sides together was the subtle bourbon flavor. 
The mouthfeel was very silky and smooth, with just the right amount of slightly prickly carbonation. The heat from the alcohol was perfectly subdued and appropriate. I hope that one day the good folks at Bell's will bottle up this masterpiece so that a greater number of folks can experience the goodness that is Black Note. 1,409 characterssurlytheduff, Feb 24, 2011

First (and only at the time of this review) keg to come to Philly!
Served in a snifter, dark brown to black, opaque, with a minimal tan head. Aroma was luscious with dark malts, licorice, vanilla and chocolate; some alcohol noticeable. Taste was rich with malts, dark chocolate, sweet sugars, bourbon-soaked wood; strong in flavor and booze; quite simply amazing all around. Nicely thick and creamy, full bodied. Highly drinkable, and among of the best stouts I've had. 519 charactersRifugium, Dec 11, 2010

A: I'm not going to go too in-depth, as the 7oz-ish pour was served in a 7oz snifter (filled to the brim). It was very black and had no head.
S: Bourrrbon! Vanilla, oak, and did I say bourbon?
T: omg. This is insane. Initially, all I can sense it the bourbon, but that fades into strong chocolate notes with a hint of oak... but wait, it's not done as it finishes with a HUGE blast of vanilla. Wow... this is an EXPERIENCE!
M: Thick & creamy (maybe even double-creamy). Yum!
D: Oh the 7oz didn't last long, but I don't think I would have lasted much longer had I ordered another!
If ever I have the opportunity to drink this again, I will not miss it. Put this on my "top 5." 727 characterspsychotia, Aug 29, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap @ The Great Taste of the Midwest (Madison, WI) on 8/14/10. Several samples served in a tasting mug. 
Pours a dense black, with a rich topping of dark mocha colored head. This quickly fizzles out however, leaving a black and still surface staring back at me. The aroma is packed with chocolate fudge, creamy smelling sweetness, sticky molasses character, and a DEEP burnt roastiness to it in the back. The sweet tang this puts off in the nostrils is just fabulous. 
The taste is bitter and blackened tasting at first with roast and coffee, being quickly followed by the luscious sweet tang of chocolate, vanilla, and sticky charred molasses, before diving into a heady roasted finish and lingering notes of green woody tannins. Just the right amount of charred bourbon flavor is present without any kind of excessive heat. The mouthfeel is full, thick, and chewy and is hiding it's ABV VERY well. Nuff said! 
Badass in a glass sums this up perfectly and I was really glad to finally get to try this one again. An awesome BA blend here and it's definitely one of the best I've had from Bell's. 1,101 charactersKegatron, Aug 19, 2010

Pours black as coal and thick as burnt motor oil. No head no lace. No surprise there. It is called "black" note. 
The aroma is very sweet. Like melted chocolate mixed with coffee and bourbon. Traces of black licorice and prunes. 
The flavor is right where I had hoped it would be. Loads of sweet dark chocolate and coffee. The bourbon is mild but present. Moderate smoked barrel in the finish. Spot on perfection in my book.
Full thick and chewy body. Carbonation is looking for a life raft in this beer. It's there but struggling.
Overall maybe not a religous experiance but spectacular none the less. Made my day I was able to finally try this. 766 charactersbeerwolf77, Aug 19, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Tap pour at the Great Taste of the Midwest 2010. Been looking forward to trying this one for some time!
(A)- Pours a fairly thick pitch black color with a decent brown head that stuck around for awhile. Bits of lacing here and there too. 
(S)- A rich chocolate and licorice aroma with bits of molasses and raisin. A good roasted profile behind that with light hints at a bread component. 
(T)- Very similar to the smell. The chocolate in the smell combined with the licorice creates a light bitter yet sweet profile at the same time. Some molasses. The chocolate flavor is great in the background. Dynamic.
(M)- A good carbonation level and balance. Thick, but also smooth which is great for the style. A good feel and profile with a light warmth going down.
(D)- A fascinating beer that they need to bottle and sell in the future; they would make a killing off of it! One of bells best and most unique. One of the highlights of the event.
**Update. Having had this quite a few times now on tap, I feel that this just gets better and better on my list of the better stouts out there in the market today. Because of this, I definitely think this deserves a bump up from my initial review in the overall rating (from an initial 4.5 overall rating).** 1,253 characterssweemzander, Aug 15, 2010
4.39/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 2.5Yet another goodie at Stub & Herb's in Minneapolis, MN . This shows a solid black brown color with a modest tan head and decent lacing. The aroma says cabernet and sour coffee with a hint of licorice. Awesome and fairly intense. The flavor is an incredible medley of coffee cherry chocolate with wonderful root hints that suggest Vicks Formula 44. There is an herbal hop bite here that blends with the medicinal qualities. This is full bodied and sliky feeling with some resinous qualities perhaps. Minute but very tangy carbonation. Not highly drinkable at all, just too intense but very tasty. There's raisin and juniper and the blend is superb. And I thought the Expedition alone would be unbeatable...Wow! 709 charactersDurge, Aug 07, 2010
4.37/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Yet another one that I was very excited for at Michigan's summer beer fest 2010. Waited all day for this one to be tapped.
Black with really no head at all, nothing too special about the way this looks, just some loose, large bubbles here and there.
Smell is a lot like Expedition at times. Very vinous with dark berries, red grapes, figs and cherries. Bourbon underlies that. Its not at all harsh though there is a lot of very nice creamy smells going on like a milkiness.
Like the nose would suggest its a sweet, vinous and slightly bourbony beer. Lots of dark fruits, berries, cherries, plums, figs, prunes, bourbon, milk sugar sweetness, lots of creamy chocolate. Its unmistakeably blended with Expedition stout. 
A very phenomenal offering from Bell's 760 charactersMbpBugeye, Jul 25, 2010

A - Black and black with a dark tan head. Viscous as any double stout I've had.
S - Sweet bourbon with a hint of malt and vanilla. The bourbon is the dominant factor in the nose.
T - Bourbon up front and sweet chocolate malts through to the finish. A hint of alcohol in the back but bourbon, vanilla and sweet malts dominate the taste. You can really taste the expedition stout here. But the sweetness and bourbon just dominate. Lord this is tasty
M - Viscous and low carbonation. Perfect for a double stout. 
D - At 11.5% this is a sipper. I'm very excited to try this one but any more than 7.5 oz may be tough to handle.

4.18/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3.5Had on tap at Bell's 31 flavors event at City Tap House. This review is based on notes I took from the tasting. The beer is incredibly complex from the mixture of double cream stout and Expedition, which is then aged in bourbon barrels. 
The beer looks like a double stout, and smelled like one: chocolatey, vanilla, woody, and with a tinge of alcohol. The beer tasted just as it smelled, with good burnt and roasted bitterness and a gentle velvety texture. The finish is sweet and creamy, a bit cloying. 
A beer big on color, aroma, taste and alcohol. A must try for any RIS/IS fan, but I don't know if this beer necessarily deserves a ranking in the top 100's, but it is in the top quartile of imperial stouts I've had. 723 charactersSoonami, Jul 01, 2010

A- Black as night, cannot see through it at all. Hardly any lacing, very little head if any. Toward the middle and end of this beer it appears brownish around the edges, slightly transparent with a light ring of foam.
S- Bourbon Barrel with hints of cream, sweet vanilla, bits of chocolate but mostly vanilla. When its cold, its very clean smelling...biting the nostrils. Very nice.
T- Very smooth, caramel, brown sugar, bourbon barrel, cream the whole way through, slight boozy at first then calms down and vanilla toward the end. A bit of a coffee after taste. 
M- Lovely, awesome, very smooth, perfect carbonation, satin and silk. All you could ask for in a beer.
D- Does not feel like a 10.5% at all - way too easy and probably very dangerous. I could have drank this all night and for breakfast in the morning. Very happy I was able to try this and would very much like some more. Good job, Bell's...now make some more! 1,150 charactersjoshuaseresse, Jun 28, 2010

Pours super dark brown with the slightest hints of ruby in the light. No head whatsoever.
Aroma was big thick chocolate and vanilla dominating the nose, with some hints of molasses and oak. I couldn't get much fruit on the nose, but i felt like there was something there.
Flavor was a super sweet big thick dessert drink. I didn't think i'd get through 3 oz. let alone a whole glass, but the flavor was so incredible I had no problems...and then I went back and got another. Vanilla, molasses, chocolate and some roasted cashews on the finish.
Did I mention that this was big and thick?

Black note came to me looking black like night with a bubbly thin layered dark tan milkshake head. Some rough patches of lace on the way down, nice considering the barrel aging.
Smells is of dark bakers chocolate, dark fruit, plums, and some vinious qualities in the back. Sweet roasty notes, cream for your coffee with some coffee as well. The bourbon, while not overly huge is a welcomed guest.
Black Note tastes like you think it will, delish. Dark chocolate, semi bitterseet, cocco powder, A light splash of roasted coffee beans, lucious sweet malt roasty malt. A dark fruit component from the expo, a vanilla creamy vibe from the DCB. Some mollasses along with the sweet vanilla are welcome. A nice amount of bourbon from a great barrel that's not all that boozy.
I gotta say, this is the smoothest BA beer that I've had for a while. Smooth, creamy, easy, a steady slope. While the alcohol seeps in a bit, this is not hot in any way. The way this went down after 20 minutes in the glass brings tears to my eyes.
It's big beer, but i found myself taking bigger gulps than usual for a stout. Much smoother as time passes and temps rise, easy drinking, just be careful, it will get ya. Another treat during beer week. I knew this beer would be a winner ever since I heard about it. 1,394 charactersBARFLYB, Jun 12, 2010

A: Deep brown/black body. One finger dark khaki head that held for some time after the pour. Spotty lacing.
S: Bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, sweet cream, molasses, roasted malts and dark fruits. Complex and well layered. Nothing really overpowers the other elements.
T: Nice blend of boozy-goodness and sweet, dessert like malts. Warm bourbon is present from the first drop. Sweet milk chocolate, cream, molasses, caramel, a little roasted coffee, vanilla and some figs. 
M: Thick, full bodied and viscous. Low carbonation, but appropriate. A bit boozy, but not overbearingly hot. Nice lingering sweetness.
D: At first it was fairly easy drinking considering the thickness, but the beer eventually slowed down for me. This was likely the result of the underlying sweetness. A very nice beer, that is a bit different than the other big stouts out there. Thanks to Bell's and City Taphouse for the fun event. 950 characterscallmemickey, Jun 08, 2010

Black, no head (ordered it from a waiter so it had time to settle) smells like bread, chocolate and Jack daniels.
Taste is sweet (chocolate, caramel, maybe vanilla too) but not overwhelming. The bourbon is present and not 
overwhelming as well except for the quick buzz I'm getting. More 
viscous and somewhat flat than carbonated. A bit of a hop bitterness noticeable. A fine dessert. 
Good but definitely a sipper. I had to work on this over an hour + while sampling others. A fine example of a bourbon aged product. 567 charactersdborginis, Jun 08, 2010

S- tons of milk chocolate, caoco powder, and sweet cream. Roasty and toasty with some oak and bourbon. 
T- oh boy! Opens up with all the rich veinous qualities with port wine, dark chocolate and over ripe black berries. Wood and bourbon with some vanilla and black strap molasses. Plums, dates, raisins all the dark fruits. I keep coming back around and finding new levels of complexity. 
M- thick and chewy with some slick and stick. Perfect carb, just enough to lift it all up but not too much that it doesn't stay on the palate for the right amount of time. Bliss. 
D- well for a brew of this stature and abv this is as drinkable as it gets. I love it in so many ways. 942 charactersoglmcdgl, Jun 08, 2010

Black. Dead, no bubbles, ready-to-be-cremated black. Smell is heavy, sweet malts with a whuppin' stick of bourbon. Boozy & rich as all get-out. 
AEDCB is one to hunt down, because it's a brew at the top of its game. Usually I'm not as wild about the bourbon-screaming beers (ala BCS) but for some reason it just works here. Perhaps it's my love for the Expy Stout, & the rock-solid base brews it's founded on, but the vanilla & oak that rocket out of the dead pool of black give me pause, then make me happy. Good brownie batter would describe the taste & consistency to some extent, along with a blast of alcohol that doesn't seem out of place. Malts are in there I'm sure. Tastes a lot more like Expy, I don't sense anything Creamed about this, not even in the mouthfeel, perhaps it was overwhelmed by everything else going on. 
Excellent beer. I don't know how Stubs landed this one, but if it ever happens again, I'll be there. And if I hadn't needed to get up for Darkness Day, I'd have had multiples. Bell's knows how to do big right! 1,185 charactersmaximum12, May 05, 2010

Nose is of very good whiskey, carmel, toffee and a bit of vanilla. Kind of hard to fully enjoy from a 5-oz. pour sample glass, that is why I had two 5-oz. pours just to be sure. On first sip the whiskey is very up front but soft, well presented and very smooth just like your favorite bourbon whiskey. Layers of caramelized malt roll all over the tongue with such sweetness. Toffee mixes with a nice hop character on the backside that is a bit rustic and nicely drying. Finishes with a mouthfeel that is full, smooth yet very clean and enjoyable. This is my kind of stout, big, rich, with a nice whiskey profile. 739 charactersSPLITGRIN, Feb 21, 2010

A: Pours motor oil black, opaque in the center but lightly translucent at the edges. I have no idea about the history of this growler, but it was taped well, opened with a hiss, and there were clearly bubbles (dark mocha) on the brew. Retention was short. Promising. 
S: Pretty bourbon-forward. Dark chocolate, vanilla, molasses. Anise and some booze. 
T: Bourbon and chocolate are pretty evident. Anise, vanilla, molasses. The finish was hot and slightly harsh. I kept expecting more from the flavor; I picked up a lot of the barrel character, but not much of the Expedition or Cream Stout. 
M: Silky, rich. Hard to criticize Bell's beers on mouthfeel, most of the time, but their barrel aging here leaves a lot to be desired: the beer is fairly hot and tannic. 
D: I liked the beer, but I'm not convinced this is one of the top examples of the barrel-aged imperial stout "style." It's above-average, but nothing to give up the cellar for. 1,073 charactersArbitrator, Feb 21, 2010

I texted my friend from the bar that I was drinking the best beer ever.
A: dark, thin tan head. It looked browner than some black stouts, like it was just happy tasting great that it didn't need to be black as night.
s: rich, creamy smell, obviously bb aged.
T: So Good. Everything was in perfect balance. Rich malts make this beer sweet, the barrels have given the beer vanilla notes, and bourbon. It's perfect, it was worth 8 dollars.

pours inky black and nearly opaque, but holding it to the light you can see that it is crystal clear at its thinnest point. a thin ultra-fine dark brown head forms, dropping fairly fast and leaving a bunch of fine lace behind.
aroma is great. bourbon. light vanilla. anise. dark and milk chocolate. coffee. medium toast whole wheat bread and biscuit. dark fruit. hints of earth. nice depth.
taste is amazing. vanilla and bourbon. bit of butterscotch. caramel and toffee. dark and milk chocolate. bit of bittersweet chocolate too. toasted multi-grain bread and biscuit. touch of cracker. lightly warming alcohol. nice light fruity component that works great with the barrel and stouty character.
mouthfeel is great. nice big body. silky smooth super fine medium-low carbonation level.
drinkability is excellent. big and complex yet drinkable as hell. it doesn't seem near 11% and i think i could sip on this all night. great stuff! 1,098 charactersgrub, Jan 24, 2010
4.21/5  rDev -6.4%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Had this at Stub & Herbs on Darkness Eve. They had one hell of a stout lineup that night and between this brew and Bell's Rye Stout, they were the best. Drank from a small 7oz sampling glass. Taken from notes on phone.
Appearance- Pours a pitch ass black with basically no head, no cap or collar or lacing.
Smell- The first thing that jumps out at me is the immediate rush of vanilla that meets my nostrils. The oak is very noticeable but not the dominate nasal trait. Sort of boozy as well but plenty of Tootsie Roll milk chocolate and a raw cocoa nib scent. Maybe a touch of molasses and caramel as well.
Taste- Starts very slightly sweet with a browny batter like chocolaty fudge. The brew is very intense and sort of concentrated with plenty of oak and vanilla. I don't really get much of the Cream Stout as I think the wood and Expedition just dominate. Some light caramel and toffee sit in middle as the beer finishes with some light molasses and brown sugar. Like the nose, the alcohol is noticeable but not devastatingly harsh. Loads of vanilla and nuts in the warm finish.
Mouthfeel- Not the biggest feel in the world but considering all things involved not bad. Somewhere around medium with a light carbonation that you have to search for. Slick warming feel.
Drinkability- The beer is huge in flavor and smell but a bit lacking in the feel and looks department. But I could drink this thing all day. It's like drinking a chocolate covered peanut and caramel truffle. Really nice beer that I'm really glad I got to try. Keep up the good work John! 1,558 charactersyounger35, Nov 21, 2009

The nose is of dark chocolate, vanilla, and prominent molasses. The chocolate has a fudge-like quality and licorice presence is strong. Booze and anise are evident. Nice rich nose.
The flavor is licorice, molasses, fudge, and dark chocolate. As the beer warms, the licorice becomes increasingly powerful. The finish is alcoholic and somewhat harsh. Molasses and licorice eventually overwhelm the other flavors. The beer is full bodied with a thick and slightly syrupy mouthfeel. I enjoyed the nose, but the taste had too much licorice and molasses for me. I was enamored for the first couple ounces, but I quickly became disenchanted 804 charactersHopHead84, Nov 13, 2009
4.02/5  rDev -10.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3.5Thanks, Chris!
Jet black, rather hysterically so, this beer is blacker than OA Dark Lord. There's a thin, tan head that recedes to a ring rather rapidly
The nose is a pretty excellent combination of licorice, molasses, bourbon and vanilla. I'm not picking up much Double Cream character. Dark chocolate, fudge and a touch of alcohol is present in the back. This mostly smells like what I'd expect BA Expedition to smell like.
Opens with plenty of licorice, molasses and vanilla, there's some bourbon character. Very, very intense, this is almost harsh. There's some dark chocolate mid palate but the finish is disappointing, with the flavors vanishing, leaving just a bitter licorice finish. Full in body with low carbonation, the flavors are great, but the intensity of the licorice is not much to my liking. While I did drink my 4oz, I'm glad I got to try this without having to give up the farm. 901 charactersDefenCorps, Nov 11, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Review from notes I took at All Stout's Day.
A- Poured a nice oily black color. Small 1/2 finger mocha/tan colored head. Little lacing on the sides of the glass that just slid back down into the beer. Makes my mouth drool!
S- Like some others said it was muted when first served to me. I let it warm up a little while I sipping on the Oatmeal Stout and then came back to it. Wonderful roasted malts right in the forefront of this beer which I was a little afraid might be pushed back with other aromas. There were some oak and vanilla notes that came and went along with a light bourbon presence. Some chocolate came through a little more than the others mentioned. The alcohol was there but nothing overpowering. It almost smelled just like a Dark Lord dare I say.
T- Good big roasted flavor right off the bat mixes well with a light bourbon and oak middle. There was a light vanilla flavor that I picked up more and more once I drank it. The middle and the end of this beer was a little more creamy and chocolate notes ran freely. The alcohol was there but it was not messing with the overall flavors in the beer. Big tastes in this beer.
M- Heavy mouthfeel. I personally thought the carbonation was a little bit weak on this and could have used a little more. The beer needed a little help rushing across the palate but made its way in a roasted bourbony sweetness fashion. Nice clean afterflavors that enhance the entire drinking of this beer. 
D- This beer is very drinkable even with the higher ABV. I couldn't get enough of it when I was at Bell's. I am glad I got to try this and it really was worth the hype that it had. 1,634 charactersalleykatking, Nov 03, 2009
4.68/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I was very excited to have this on tap at Bell's All Stouts Day on 11/1/09 known as Black Note and weighs in at 11% ABV.
I had two 8 oz. pours of this delicous brew, but I'll do my review off of my first pour which was into a small 8 oz. snifter.
Black Note pour a deep black with a thin tan head that dissipated quickly. Smells of bourban, wood, chocolate, vanilla and roasted malt dominate the nose. I will say that the nose definetly improves as the beer warms. It was actually a bit difficult to smell all the subtle details when the beer was cold, but as it warms the smell does really shine through. The taste is amazing, a great blend here to be sure as the sweet, sharp molasses charector of the Expo stout is balances perfectly by the creamy smooth mouthfeel of the double cream stout. Flavors up front are of chocolate, wood, vanilla and molasses with hints of lactose sweetness. The finish is dominated by a sweet chocolate, bourban flavor. The layors of this stout are quit impressive and for 11% this is sooo drinkable. On a cold winter day I could drink this all day with out one regret. I feel very fortunate to have been able to try this beer as I know supplies are running very low, but I have to say that this is one of the best blended, barrel aged stout combinations that I have ever had. I think to myself this is such a great idea by Larry and the guys at Bell's I wish they would do a second batch because this beer makes me happy to be alive...well worth the drive and the wait. 1,504 charactersHopHobo, Nov 02, 2009

Scent of sweet molasses, oak, bourbon, vanilla, chocolate, roasted malts, and sugars. The oak and bourbon characters do not overpower here, probably one of the most balanced scents in a barrel aged beers I have come across.
Taste of chocolate, bourbon, roasted malts, molasses, dark fruit, oak, and smoke. Similarly with the scent, this has a nice balance between the base beer and the bourbon barrel.
Mouthfeel is medium heavy bodied and smooth with low carbonation. 505 characterspaco1029384756, Oct 31, 2009

First off this thing blew the shit out of the last regular Expedition I remember drinking, maybe my palate is indifferent to that beer.
A: Great looking beer even next to the multitude of dark beers around it, this one retained a great head that was glorious and made it's identification a little easier. Good lacing on the small glass. Glorious.
S: Not heave on the bourbon surprisingly, but roasted and toasted slight sweet goodness.
T: Big on the oak indeed, got hints of bourbon, somewhat of a chocolate sweetness that pales in comparison to the GI Night Stalker I had before it. The finish is dry with some coffee like bitterness.
M: Thick n creamy, can't complain here.

A - Pours black with a thin tan head. Even though there's only a small ring of head around the edge of the glass, there's a good amount of lacing draped along the sides.
S - Sweet chocolate, roasted malts, caramel, light bourbon, some oak/wood. As it warmed up (and I made it to my second glass), things picked up even more.
T - Just outstanding! Lots of sweet milk chocolate mixed with the perfect amount of bourbon. Much like drinking chocolate syrup mixed with a kick of bourbon and some expresso beans.
M - Not quite as think as I was expecting, but doesn't detract much at all from this beer. Very little carbonation, just right for the style.
D - Glad I was able to get two of these because who knows if I'll ever have the chance to try this one again. Easy to drink for the style, but obviously I can only drink so many before I'd fall over. 997 charactersSean9689, Oct 26, 2009

Pour was a 7 oz glass.
Color is a big oil black with tan head. No lace to to pour, but I am ok with that because there was more beer in the glass.
Aroma: Amazing. Bourbon, chocolate, roasted malts, earthy hops. Also has some cream flavors and vanilla notes with oak. Very robust and smooth. Wow it is good and I am ready to dive in.
Taste: Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, oak, earthy hops. Very rich, robust and all around amazing taste. The bourbon is very warming in a good way. You can definitely tell it is there, but it doesn't wreck the beer.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, creamy, rich. Full bodied with a nice amount of carbonation. Ends pretty clean with a malty bourbon flavored aftertaste.
Overall, I love this beer and want more of it. I really hope Bells does this again, because it has to be one of my favorite beers of the style. Simply amazing and very drinkable! Well done! 982 charactersmothman, Oct 26, 2009

Pitch black with a small ring of molasses colored head. Doesn't leave a ton of lacing.
The nose is bourbon, wood, vanilla, coffee and chocolate. Really well made beer.
Taste is pretty much spot on the nose. Bourbon, chocolate, vanilla, cream, coffee, chocolate, woody and earthy tones...just amazing. So smooth and easy going down but boy does it pack a punch of flavor.
Mouthfeel is thick and sticky, coating your mouth. Smooth and creamy, just awesome. Alcohol is completely hidden by the layers of flavor.
Drinkability is awesome. This 7 oz pour went way to fast, but by the time I realized it, the small keg was long gone. Very happy I got the chance to try this mammoth of a beer. This is excellent stuff. 825 charactersMistofminn, Oct 26, 2009

Lots of woody and roastiness in the nose. Bourbony, vanilla and chocolate are all in here. This smells divine.
Even more barrel flavors come out in the taste. Bourbon, oak and dark fruit skins. Like a perfect milk chocolate bar. There's a creaminess to this that makes this just so damn enjoyable.
Of all the amazing beers we had that night, this was the one I made sure I remembered. I actually let my 7oz last near three hours as I wanted to see how it opened up. It just got better and better. What a beer! 705 charactersrudylaw, Oct 26, 2009
4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4On tap and Stub & Herb's. Only ordered 7 oz. which upon reflection was a big mistake. This may be the only chance I ever have to try this beer, and it lasted for nearly an hour and a half so I had plenty of opportunity to get more.
My pour came from a pitcher so I just got a plain black liquid. However, I saw other pours that came directly from the tap and this one was a beauty. Pitch black with a full finger of caramel brown head. Classic imperial stout.
The smell is the one aspect of this beer that I just couldn't fully appreciate. There was no smoke in the bar, but the lingering food smell plus other distractions make it hard to really get the full experience. But what I got was a spectacular rich bourbon aroma that was just screaming at me to drink it now.
And oh boy...drink it I did. And I loved every single drop of it. Huge caramel and vanilla notes. Smooth luscious bourbon with no burn whatsoever. This might be the smoothest barrel aged beer that I've had to date. Just absolutely rich and decadent, almost like the liquid manifestation of a marble cake with bourbon icing. One of the best tasting beers I've ever tried.
Mouthfeel was full and creamy, exactly as it is supposed to be. I drank my 7 oz. and looked around and most other people in the place had only gotten down half of that. And I wanted more, I needed more, but stupidly I chose not to get more. This is a fantastic beer that I will probably never have again, but I will always remember it as being one of my favorites.
UPDATE 8/18 -- Had a chance to consume about 12 oz. of this beer at the 2010 Great Taste of the Midwest. I have nothing to add to my original review other than that is was perhaps a bit hotter than I remembered but every bit as tasty 1,745 charactersalcstradamus, Oct 26, 2009

A - Pours pitch black with a small, frothy brown head.
S - Amazing aroma of bourbon, vanilla, coffee with cream, and rich chocolate. Some slight -bal notes. The smell of well-crafted beers of this type is seriously one of my favorite smells in the world.
T - Roast and creamy coffee, lots of vanilla and bourbon balanced by an awesome, thick, intense base stout with loads of chocolate, and hint of anise, and some date and raisin notes. Yes, it is awesome. This is definitely up near the top impy stouts I've ever had.
M - Incredibly creamy, smooth, and full palate with soft carbonation. Not really any astringency from the coffee, and not very boozy, especially after it warms up.
D - Pretty high for a bourbon -bal aged imperial stout. I know a lot of people can't stomach much of this type of beer, but I could get through a bomber by myself easily. 938 charactersnickd717, Oct 14, 2009
3.73/5  rDev -17.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5Big thanks to stfun37 for this one.
Black in the glass with a tiny dark brown head that rapidly recedes to a ring.
The aroma is woody and earthy, with a backbone of bittersweet chocolate. Boozy bourbon is present but more subtle than I was expecting, and sweetness is very reserved. Expedition's unmistakable burnt licorice/molasses character shines through with surprising strength here.
The taste is impressively complex; licorice up front, burnt whole grain bread, bakers chocolate, tobacco, vanilla and light earthiness. Medium-bodied without much sweetness. Hot bourbon flavors come through more in the finish, along with woody tannins, strong burnt bitterness and lingering espresso.
This was a pretty interesting beer. The Double Cream Stout and -bal aging have helped tame Expedition's harshness, but not as much as I would have liked. Still enjoyable, but not as remarkable as I was expecting. 906 characterslargadeer, Oct 14, 2009

Only a few minor imperfections with the malt keep this from being fives across the board. If you see how I rate other beers of this style you will realize how good this one really is. 797 characterscraytonic, Aug 25, 2009
4.58/5  rDev +1.8%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at the Brew Kettle. Pours pitch black with a thin tan head . The head does not last long at all. Aromas are amazing. Wood, vanilla, chocolate, bourbon, coffee, roasted malts, and bourbon. Has a silky smooth heavy syrupy mouthfeel. Flavors follow the aromas in line and are just amazing. I could drink this all night. Next time this is on tap I may just find myself drinking it all night. 394 charactersfiver29, Aug 21, 2009

It made me think of what heaven would be like. The mixture was perfect, the blended beers complimenting each other like a great rythym section. Coltrane's Impulse years comes to mind. The beer finished incredibly strong, with a sublime taste that will rest on my palate for a long time. This is an all-time great beer. If you have the means I highly suggest you try it. It is so choice. 503 charactersralflord, Jul 14, 2009
4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I cannot believe I was actually able to land this beer. Persistence pays off people! Much thanks to the wonderful man from Kentucky who grabbed me a small growler of this one earlier in the week and rushed it right down to me. Chilled down in the fridge and then immediatly decanted into a pint glass. This one was consumed on 06/26/2009.
The pour was as dark and inky black as one could possibly get. Amazing this thing looked like a black hole. A very small little puff of tan came up over the top and settled down very quickly leaving the top nearly bare with just a touch of lacing. The there was the aroma. Tons of molasses and bourbon that was laced with huge notes of vanilla and coffee. A hint of licorice maybe? Possibly dark fruit but simply amazing and intense but that was nothing compared to what I was in for when I took that first elusive sip. It was on now. Big. Full bodied, thoroughly coating and amazing flavor. Nearly the perfect balance of hot bourbon, rich milk chocolate and coffee all hit you up front. But as it warms it morphs on you, prune like flavors, hints of maybe some grapes like tartness overlay the vanilla from the barrel and make it a sublime finish that literally seemed to get sweeter with every sip.
Overall I am not gonna lie, this one kicked my butt! It was an supreme joy to drink, but it is strong. Taken in context though, I could have sipped on this at the end of the night, every night. It was simply divine. Much thanks again for getting to try this, it was worth the wait and one of the best tasting stouts I have ever come across. 1,582 charactersmikesgroove, Jun 27, 2009
4.46/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This was the big hit of the world record Bell's tapping. And they gave us a kick ass notebook to review it in.
A - Black as night with a dark coffee head that fades quickly.
S - Alcohol, malt and dark sugar. Not a whole lot going on though.
T - Lots of bourbon. Sweet malt and molasses. All of these flavors are rolling around in you mouth all at once. It's frikkin fantastic. The Double Cream brings a sweetness that really makes this beer. I imagine a Bourbon Barrel Expedition wouldn't be as good. It's surprisingly hot for being two years old.
M - A little thinner than I expected.
D - Really good. Not an easy drinker though. I think it took me most of the night to take down 20 oz. 692 charactersinfestaxion, Jun 27, 2009
4.45/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Ninety-nine down, one to go (or at least until the top 100 changes again). Finally got to try this elusive brew at the Bell's 30 Taps World Record event at Beer Sellar in Indy. Had three 5oz tasters of this stuff.
N.B. This was listed as "BB Double Cream Stout", but Larry Bell assured everyone it was the blend and that the erroneous name was merely due to a label approval issue.
A - A half-finger of dark mocha foam with solid retention, and a little bit of lacing. Pitch black - there was no trace of color, even at the fringes. It's about what I expect from a high gravity Imperial Stout.
S - Tons of bourbon and vanilla notes, a bit of roastiness - it wasn't the most complex nose. I even patiently waited for it to warm up, as it was served WAY too cold, but I didn't really get much more than the basics here.
T - The taste was superb, and was somewhat shocking after the lukewarm aroma. Tons of bourbon, vanilla, sweet malts, milk chocolate, and a bit of dark fruit and barrel. I love the way the Double Cream Stout portion offsets the roasty bitterness and acidity. As a result the aftertaste is surprisingly mild.
M - Mild carbonation, super smooth, lighter in body than I expected (more medium-to-full). Plenty of residual stickiness in this one, and shockingly a bit of heat (even after a couple years in the keg).
D - Super drinkable for what it was - the multiple tasters went down pretty easy. I think out of the ten tickets my wife and I got, we used at least half of them on this superb brew. The only problem is the ABV, and is that really that big of a problem? ;-) 1,591 charactersMasterSki, Jun 23, 2009
4.32/5  rDev -4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Really enjoyed getting to sample this one at the 30 tap party in Indy. Easily the best beer I was able to try... At least in my opinion.
Appearance: Pours a very dark brown, near black and is opaque - no light having a chance of coming through; comes off the pour with no head and just a thin ring around the surface that is pretty much straight up tan; no presence of carbonation in the appearance.
Smell: Smells sweet, like a desert custard of some sort -- creme brulee?; slight presence of alcohol in the nose and some sweet maltiness that comes across like burnt sugar, very enticing overall...
Taste: Very solid mix of the creme brulee sweetness along with vanilla extract and a bit of an oaky woodiness to it; alcohol is definitely present but definitely closer to the bourbon flavor; slight hint of a mild roastiness in the back and even slighter hints of a semi-sweet chocolate. Very wonderful tasting beer.
Mouthfeel: Smooth, rich and creamy; minimal carbonation; leaves a thin but even coating throughout the mouth; mouth is definitely warmed as is the chest and throat from the higher ABV and presence of it being closer to bourbon.
Drinkability: Probably too good for a beer of this weight and ABV. It was definitely tasty, and if I was drinking it on a cold night, it would probably be even higher than waht I gave it (it's kind of hard to enjoy a double stout when it's almost 90 and humid out). 1,414 charactersbamadog, Jun 23, 2009
4.15/5  rDev -7.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This was definitely one of the favorites our group sampled at the Bell's tasting at the Indy Beer Sellar last night. 
Appearance: Pours a very dark brown with soft reddish highlights throughout. Completely opaque and appears viscous with the slightest oily slick on top and a fast-fading cream-colored head and weak ring of lace. 
Smell: Smell is super, supersweet dark chocolate nibs, whole cream, cherry syrup and caramel mingling with warm, oaky bourbon. 
Taste/Mouthfeel: Taste is a spot of roasted coffee with supersweet milk chocolate, heavy cream, warming and soft bourbon, vanilla, and charred oak. No traces in the flavor of the cherry from the smell. Feel is very sticky and viscous at first, and finishes with a slight drying vapor from the alcohol.
Drinkability: Moderate - very sticky and warming the chest. 824 characterskels, Jun 23, 2009

What a beauty! Shimmering black oil...a small dark brown film of carbonation composes the head. Zero lacing, just rich syrupy retention oozes down the sides of the glass. I have been eagerly anticipating this blend of two of my favorite beers and aged in my favorite barrels. It looks about as inviting as Emmanuella de Paula. The smell is a heaven of chocolate, coffee, caramel, bourbon and wood. These are the kind of beers I have in mind when I brew yet am clueless how to achieve this end result. Larry Bell's genius shines on. The weight is incredible. The barrels seemed to have mellowed the Expedition and concentrated the Double Cream. Roasted coffee bean, sweet bourbon, and one of the most incredible malt profiles I have ever tasted comes across on the palate and lingers a long, long time. Sure its big, but its sheer deliciousness positively effects its drinkability. Its defintely in the upper echelon of barrel-aged stouts. Of course if this was bottled, I would have a standing order for as much they could send. This kind of quality makes it awesome to be a craft beer lover in today's brewing renaissance. Just unbelievably smooth, perfectly integrated components that bring ridiculous pleasure to devotees of this style. 1,318 charactersSteamhead, Jun 23, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Review #100
Pours super thick. Looks like liquid pavement. Very dark, dirty head that sat for a good 45 minutes before it disappeared. Leaves little lacing.
Smells... bourbony. Underneath the bourbon is some espresso. Extremely strong bourbon. Smells butter too. Almost like butterscotch. Gives me shivers.
The taste follows the nose pretty closely with lots of bourbon up front, there's an undercurrent of butteriness. Nice espresso aftertaste, slightly roasted. Oh jeez this is good. Feels very creamy. Super smooth. Slightly chewy. Small burn at the end from the 10.5%
Oh its drinkable, but two of these would put you to bed pretty quickly. 647 charactersyoungblood, Jun 23, 2009
4.97/5  rDev +10.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sampled at The Comet in Cincinnati during Hopnosis and at South Park Tavern in Dayton during their Bell's event. Notes from both.
Pours deep black with a touch thinner viscosity than I'd expect. Pretty short head, I'd assume from the barrels but it leaves nice wisps of lacing. Great barrel aroma. Vanilla is very present, accentuated by the double cream but not too sweet, very pleasant(the expo has definitely handled DC's sweetness). Woody and earthy notes in the back. The DC and barrel has rounded out the Expo's huge hop profile though it still lingers. Great mixture of the two beers. Very chocolately, just enough sweetness and hops, great bourbon snap with the fantastic barrel to round things out. Body is full but not thick or chewy. Carbonation is pretty low but still maintains a fantastic smoothness. This beer is too fucking tasty to not be drinkable. You could literally drink this until you passed out before you were sick of it. Stellar. 956 characterspwoods, Apr 30, 2009

A- Deep black with a frothy tan head.Cant be sure about lacing since I had but 2 oz. samples in a plastic vessel.
S-Strong vanilla, oak and chocolate and dark roasted malt. The blend of these two very good beers in their own right made for a most impressive combination!
T-Dark roasted malt, chocolate, vanilla and sweet bourbon notes meld into a joyous mixture. Astringent oak and bitter chocolate finish.
M-Medium body and rather light feeling, most likely due tothe fact of how smooth and creamy it was.
D-One of THE picks of EBF for me. I went back over and over again for this one. One of but a handful of beers I drank enough of to be able to produce a legitimate for. I sure hope that Bell's gets this beer out to the masses! 860 charactersDeuane, Apr 13, 2009

Poured an opaque black while cascading into a fine frothy head; perfect! The aroma was incredible if you're a BB lover. Sweet vanilla, chocolate, oak, and of course, bourbon notes abound; could inhale this all night. The taste was superb; roasted chocolate malt, vanilla, and oak blend so well with the bourbon that it just melts in the mouth. Very smooth and creamy with a very slight hint of ABV; which is scary! One of the best well balanced BB stouts that I have tasted. Too bad this isn't bottled!! 596 charactersygtbsm94, Mar 12, 2009

Appearance: Black body, slight reddish tinge on bottom. No head, as usual for beers on-tap.

Taste: Intense with whiskey-like alcohol, strong with sour mash but malty and dry with a clean aftertaste.
Mouthfeel: Thick. Yeah, that's about it. No particular hops or carbonation.
Drinkability: For such a high-ABV beer, this is amazingly drinkable. If I hadn't had to drive I'd have had another. 517 charactersdanielharper, Mar 09, 2009

T- Lots of dark creamy chocolate, coffee and toast up front. Some dark sweet fruit, molasses and dry bitterness in the end. Hints of charcoal and bourbon throughout. 
M- Very smooth and creamy at first with lots of alcohol bite in the end. As it warmed the alcohol became more present and the smoothness faded. 
Overall- This is a great addition to the Bell's lineup. Good aroma and flavor maybe a little to much alcohol presence though. 729 charactersbr3wmeister, Mar 03, 2009

T: Similar to the taste, Strong alcohol with a bourbon creaminess along with chocolate, dark berries, and roasted malts. Very good, but didn't knock my socks off like I had hoped. 
Overall: Well carbonated and silky mouthfeel. The drinkibility is lower on this one though, It's delicious and smell amazing but it would be hard to put down a couple pints of this. Great beer though, get it if you can, while you can. 649 charactersAdmiralDiaz, Mar 03, 2009
4.84/5  rDev +7.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Served out of a Growler traded for Pliny the Younger.
A: Dark, rich and very inviting. Not much head at all. Very viscous and chewy looking.
S: A barrage of bourbon, vanilla, roasted goodness. This beer smells amazing.
T: What a great brew. This beer has tons of bourbon notes, the vanilla is very strong and sweet. The only beer that I can say comes close to it, that I have tried, is Firestone 12. This pretty much blows it away though. I think it's the greatest tasting Bourbon Barrel aged beer I've ever had. For being a huge hophead, this might be my favorite beer ever. I am glad that Reed415 decided to trade with me; thank you!!! Clapping, hand shaking and jumping 8 feet off the ground go through my mind.
M: Mouthfeel is thick and covers the palate in all great ways. Velvety smooth and the alcohol (10%?) is apparent but helps to define the beer so it's not a bad thing. You almost don't want to swallow it for a few seconds because the taste and texture is so awesome.
D: I would love to drink this all the time but unfortunately this one is pretty rare. If it ever comes out in bottles, I'll buy/trade for tons of it if I can. I think the drinkability is a little low because of the richness of it. It took me a good two hours to finish a tulip of it.
We shared this at Beachwood BBQ and everyone seemed to have liked it. I even gave some to one of the line chefs and he loved it. In all, this is one of my favorite beers of all time. Thanks Bell's for brewing such a masterpiece and thank rallison for driving the Younger growler down from Santa Rosa and BrewbakerE and Merritt for filling it. It took a lot to get this. 1,640 charactersLongBeachHopHead, Feb 28, 2009

4.42/5  rDev -1.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Bell's Bourbon Barrel Aged Expedition/Double Cream Stout Blend, 10% abv, on tap at Capital Ale House, downtown location, Richmond, VA, on January 26th, 2009 at Black Moonday.
Appearance: Arrives a thick-looking bastard of a brew in a 10 oz. cervoise, a practically black, oily body though with flourishes of ... something ... around the edges, not quite garnet, but not quite brown either. The head is relatively fast-fading head, though at 10% abv and barrel aged, what do you expect? A faint sprawl of sheen and thin tan foam of lace is all that's left after it's gone. To be honest, there's not much going on here, but I've learned that brews that don't always look great don't look great for a reason.
Aroma: Maple syrup absolutely dominates, backed up by a strong, heavily oaky bourbon note, spicy with a slight prickle. It's very, very sweet smelling, heavily roasted, with lots of notes approaching pure caramel and/or toffee.
Taste: The melding of notes here lends an overwhelming butterscotch-esque note here, sweet and buttery, though not cloying or "bad" by any stretch of the imagination. Just had to get that out of the way, as it's the dominant tasting note here. The rest - a faintly chocolate-like spike, a spicy, estery, woody bourbon lick, fainter hints of char and vanilla, stronger overtones of maple syrup and caramel - all surge and bubble underneath this layer in a wonderful orgy of flavors. This is one big, bold-tasting brew.
Mouthfeel: Thick but big bubbled, that sort of "frozen in time" feel, crisp but sticky. Bubbles are big, but it's oh-so-foamy and creamy given the thickness and how well it holds together.
Drinkability: Well there 'ya have it. Very, very glad I got the chance to try this one. It's a huge, flavorful, over the top brew - and what do you expect from a melding and barrel aging of two of Bell's other biggest, over the top brews? - that manages to hit most of the right notes. The sweetness may not be to some's liking, the high abv% to others, but it did wonders for me - I'd be glad to have it again. 2,057 charactersCrellMoset, Jan 29, 2009

Smell is mildly boozy and sweet. Lots of vanilla and caramel. 
Taste is wonderfully complex. There's slight bourbon, lush caramel, vanilla, and a bit of chocolate and coffee as it warms. The Double Cream Stout comes through very well and is not overpowerred by the Expedition. There gets to be a bit of alcohol burn as it warms up too. Not a lot of carbonation. 
It definitely needed to warm up. I could drink quite a bit of this and wish Bells would bottle it. 643 characterskirok1999, Jan 24, 2009

A- Dark brown, almost on the verge of being black. Very little to no head. There was an off-white, cream colored ring that left some lacing as the beer was consumed.
S- Huge notes of bourbon infiltrate the nose. Reminded me of Bourbon County Stout. In the background, there was faint hints of vanilla.
T- Wow, this was quite a pleasant surprise. After the strong aroma, I thought I was going to be dealing with a bourbon onslaught. However, the bourbon was well balanced in comparison to the other ingredients, allowing for a smoother, mellow taste. Rich notes of chocolate, vanilla, molasses and bourbon all mix together for a perfect combination. 
M- This was my favorite part of the beer and what distinguished it from many similar bourbon barrel aged RIS I have had before. The double cream stout really comes into effect in this one. It had a creamy texture unparalleled to none. Quite a wonderful addition to a big, complex RIS.
D- The creamy texture and well-balanced bourbon flavors made this go down like water. I drank this until the keg went dry. 
Overall, this is a fantastic blend, one that I will probably never get to try again. The creamy texture really put this beer over the top in my mind. If this beer ever crosses your path, try it. Don't hesitate. 1,366 charactersrhinos00, Jan 24, 2009
4.25/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Had this one on tap at Comet's Hopnosis Event on 12/06. Took detailed on notes while drinking. Big thanks go out to Beangiver for many things - especially hosting this event - this was the whole reason I went!
No surprise on the appearance... Pours a super viscous, black - much like an oil spill into my tulip glass. Thick, creamy ½ inch espresso colored head which doesn't retain long, leaving an attractive ring around the edge of my glass. I let this one sit, as it was served too cold - warmed with me hands for about 10 minutes before trying...
The nose brings an immediate blast of the bourbon barrel aging. I get the expected vanilla flavor, followed by black cherries and figs on the front of the whiff followed by coffee grinds and a touch of milky creaminess. After sniffing and trying to express what's going on, it all seems wrapped up in a delicious alcohol/whiskey blanket. The nose is rich with aromas and complex - smells phenomenal.
WOW! This shit is amazing tasting. The barrel aging really takes the forefront on this one - vanilla all over the place. I'm actually surprised how much the barrel aging dominates the flavor, it's rather heard to get past it to detect the RIS and double cream atrributes... After trying to dissecting the flavor more, I get cherry, heavily roasted malts and coffee flavors. Finishes wet with a lightly floral tang, likely due to the hops from the Expedition side of this stout. Aftertaste is has a lingering vanilla finish. Full bodied and full flavored brew.
Mouthfeel is thick, wet and velvety with ample carbonation. Nice, a meal in itself. 1,599 charactersbeachbum1975, Dec 09, 2008

Poured a dark black color with a very small sized off white head. 
Aromas of bourbon, vanilla, wood, caramel, smoke, dark fruits, and roast. Very complex and I was getting something different every time I took a whiff. 
Tastes of vanilla, caramel, bourbon, lightly vinous, chocolate, and roast. Creamy and smooth body. 
I was I had a whole growler of this one!

4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Appearance: Arrived with a two and a half finger, creamy tan head. It's a very dark brown color, nearly black. No light creeping through. Retention and lacing were excellent.
Smell: Very complex. Bourbon aroma is readily apparent and blends extremely well with roasted and chocolate malts. Dark fruit and cherry are present in addition to a light coffee flavor. Excellent smelling beer.
Taste: Just as complex and fascinating. Roasted and chocolate malts are sweet and smooth. The creamy, lactose element of this beer really contributes to its smooth nature. Bourbon flavor is excellent and really elevates this beer to another level. Hints of dark fruit, cherry, and even vanilla add depth and complexity. Alcohol is slighty noticeable, but hardly offensive.
Mouthfeel/Drinkability: It's thick and certainly a sipping beer. One to savor. Carbonation is excellent. ABV is ostensibly high, but it's sooo smooth and drinkable. It's anyone's best guess as to how strong it really is. Drinkability is obviously limited somewhat, but not much. This truly is a special beer. I can only hope I encounter it again someday. 1,117 charactersprototypic, Mar 08, 2008
4.92/5  rDev +9.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from the tap at Birreria Paradiso into a very generous snifter, Happy Hour price $4. LOL I would have paid... well never mind. The liquid was dark too black had a cool looking one finger mocha head with a bit of lace. 
The smell was just oh so good, big bourbon on that great Bell's stout. Lots of coffee and chocolate noted dancing with the vanilla and alcohol, truly a master piece.
The taste followed the aroma, lots of bourbon, mild vanilla working with all the great flavors of the cream stout.
The mouthfeel was good to very good thick and creamy but the carbonation could have been a bit better to make the body just right.
The drinkability was A1A, man did I enjoy this brew. This is a must try beer. Thanks Larry! Prosit und Zum Wohl. MK 757 charactersMuenchenerKindl, Feb 01, 2008
4.4/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Tasted at the Kerstbier Fest at the Capital Ale House
Appearance: Arrives at the bar with an obsidian color and a tan head that spots the glass with lace
Smell: Bourbon, cream and dark fruit, primarily dates
Taste: Figs and dates dominate the opening flavor profile with dark chocolate and bourbon flavors arriving by mid-palate; after the swallow, the creamy flavor also plays a role along with a surprising hint of licorice
Mouthfeel: Medium to heavy body with moderate carbonation and some warmth
Drinkability: Wonderful balance between the fruit and the chocolate, the cream and the bourbon 599 charactersbrentk56, Jan 03, 2008
4.65/5  rDev +3.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Featured on tap at the Indiana Brewer's Guild Festival in Indianapolis. Many thanks to Bell's for making this excellent beer available this year.
Pours black with a slightly dark head that lasts. Has big, bold whisky bourbon in the nose, along with a honey-like malt sweetness - very nice. Silky on the palate, with caramel, oak, whisky, alcohol, coffee, and chocolate all interplaying with nice complexity. Seductive, delicious, and a real treat. 
Very thankful to have had the opportunity to sample ths one, and I made several trips for refills. Given the chance, you will too - highly recommend. 604 charactersmarksto, Jul 22, 2007
4.64/5  rDev +3.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to egajdzis for this...
Appears a near black with dark brown edges. The small tan cap fades into a little film and mild collar. Spotty streaks of lacing is left around the glass.
Smell is of butter cream, lactose, bourbon, oak, vanilla, caramel, cocoa, dark chocolate...pretty intense, complex, and enticing.
Taste is of the mentioned aromas with a "smores" like taste (I see egajdzis took author rights for my original thoughts), along with creamy caramel standing out.
Mouthfeel is sweet up front, smooth, full of bourbon and cocoa. Delicious stuff. This is what I had hoped KBS was going to be. 613 charactersweeare138, Jul 19, 2007
4.87/5  rDev +8.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5First off, let me say my thanks to Larry Bell for making this gem, and thanks to The Party Town for making this available for growler fills.
That being said, wow, what a treat! Im a huge expedition fan, so this beer is what Im all about. Pours a dark brown with a slight head that recedes quickly after pouring. This is possibly one of the best noses Ive ever had come from a beer. I spent quite a bit of time sniffing this one. Smell is velvety bourbon, with notes of chocolate and espresso coffee. The taste is incredible. Think bourbon barrel aged Expedition with a very creamy and silky finish due to the Double Cream. This is the perfect combination, everything is working incredbily together. If bottled this would rival and give Kentucky Breakfast a run for its money. Very happy that I had the chance to enjoy this, but very sad as well, because the chances of coming across this rare gem again is small. 919 charactersFtownThrowDown, Jun 23, 2007
4.77/5  rDev +6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bought at Party Town in Florence Kentucky. Thanks Party Town!!!
A very nice looking beer and not sure why I'm not givinig it a 5 out of 5. Black in color with a small tan head that fades quickly. Very still and mysterious. 
Quite possibly the best nose I've witnessed on a beer. Charred bourbony oak aromas with toasty vanilla tones. Roasted burnt chocolate malts, mollasses, and raisin with a large lactose aroma on the finish. Black fruits of currant, black cherry, and hints of pepper. Somewhat sweet and very enticing.
Again hard not to give a perfect score for taste. Just the slightest imperfection in the mid palate keeps this from coming to fruition. This beer is hugely complex with intense roasted chocolate malts. Marshmallow flavors with a thick creamy lactose induced mouthfeel and mid palate. Charred flavors with a tingly carbonation with creamy, silky smooth textures. Vanilla and caramel meld well with the layered dark fruit flavors. Hints of licorice in the flavor and sweet toasted oak. Bourbon flavors show through and really integrate nicely with the roasty flavors. Alcohol shows through somewhat but isn't overwhelming. A beer I could honestly drink the rest of my life and never get tired of. 1,226 charactersmcallister, Jun 17, 2007
