3.99/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4This was such a highly rated beer, with a previous lottery system, and I was excited to have finally gotten it. I liked it but was a bit disappointed. Look was dark and clear. Smell was pretty weak in comparison to the other strong citra-dominant beers that are out there now. The taste was a lot more balanced between the citra tropical juiciness and the sharper piney bitterness. Was expecting the citra to be more prominent. Mouthfeel was like any other regular IPA. Not bad, but not good. Overall, it was a good beer, but did not live up to my expectations, especially since there are so many newly-popular hazy citra bombs out there now. Worth having, but won't make the tough effort to have again. 703 charactersraspy22, Jan 25, 2017

Brings the malt backbone that is characteristic of West Coast IPAs, imparting additional caramel sweetness.  Overall very solid, but for me at least, I prefer the newer trend of hazy, juicy IPAs coming out of places in New England, from Tired Hands, and, for example, from Monkish on the left coast. 355 charactersBsquirrelbrewer, Dec 30, 2016

4.5/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.522 oz. bottle poured into a Founders snifter. Bottled on date on the case 11/11/16.
Pours a cloudy pale gold color with a one-inch white head which dissipates into a fine lacing.
The nose is all citra hops with a big bouquet of pineapple, mango, grapefruit, and orange peel. No real malt presence at all here. It doesn't bring the all-out assault of hops that some DIPAs do, but there is plenty of depth and nuance. 
Taste is more of the same - tons of grapefruit and tropical fruit up front. Bittering hops hit soon after and linger through the finish. Very minimal hints of bready malt and a bit of yeast on the finish, but other than that this is all hops. Really well balanced flavor throughout.
Mouthfeel is medium to light=bodied, dry and crisp on the palate. Doesn't get bogged down by heavy malts at all the way many high abv DIPAs do. About as easy to drink as a DIPA can be.
Phenomenally well done beer and arguably one of the best examples of a west-coast style DIPA out there. 993 charactersemyers, Dec 05, 2016

A: Pillowy white head that holds on forever over a deep golden slightly cloudy beer. A little chill haze but filtered. 
S: Wonderful balance of light malt and hops. The citra really shines here; a little ethanol is hidden by big citrus.
T: At first it seems like a lot of other West Coasters...a little ethanol, lovely malt balance but big and surprisingly resinous. I was not expecting how dank it is given the name. More lemon rind with a bit of stonefruit at the beginning that yields to more pine that sticks around for days. Kind of a perfect finish.
M: Light for how much flavor is packed in here; not thin at all but so balanced...carbonation is way in the background and lets the sticky lupulin come through. 
O: So stoked to finally try this legend and I'm not disappointed. Like many folks my tastes have changed a lot in the last year or two with the prevalence of North East IPAs, but this one will stand the test of time no matter what the fad. Easy to drink and packed with all the flavors you could want from an IPA. 1,076 charactersRockjocknroll, Dec 04, 2016

Pours a golden straw color with a thick foamy white head, the head takes its time to settle and lacing clings all over the glass.  Ever so slight haze.
The aroma is bright fresh hoppy citrus, noticeable from the bottle before the pour.  Grapefruit and orange zest, slight spicy lemon and a faint tropical fruit aroma.  The malt is noticeable as well with a bit of caramel sweetness.
Taste is bright citrus hops with a bit of earthy resins.  Bitter, but nicely balanced by an ample malt backing.  Slight tropical fruit and pine also find their way into the mix.
Medium body, smooth, dry bitterness lingers.  Moderate carbonation.
Overall a great all around DIPA.  Classic flavors with amped up citrus aroma and taste. 770 charactersjhavs, Nov 23, 2016

The aroma is amazing with oranges and mangoes with a brightness reminiscent of lemon. There is detectable sweetness and a nice pine in there as well.

This is a fantastic beer. 416 charactersFriedSlug, Nov 18, 2016

4.43/5  rDev -2.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Reviewed from notes. On-tap at the brewery, served in a pint glass.
Brilliantly clear apricot body topped by faint magnolia foam. Fine lacing; below average retention.
Pungent hop notes - very citrus forward as you would expect - largely grapefruit with hints of satsuma mandarin as well. Any tropical or floral notes are restrained at best. Solid aroma.
The base beer is perfectly crafted to showcase the hops - a sweet palate entry quickly gives way to citrus. Moderate but pure and lasting bitterness leads into a medium-dry finish. Hints of candied ginger and Meyer lemon zest as the beer warms slightly. 
Well carbonated, and while the alcohol adds some heft to the body, the ABV is frighteningly well disguised, making this one of the most drinkable double-IPAs around.
Surprisingly simple, but expressive - just about faultless. 840 charactersaugustgarage, Jun 30, 2016

I realize thats all the rage on the other coast, but sorry, I find that to be maybe not a flaw, but certainly something that would prevent a 'perfect' appearance score if you will.    Now, that is about the only "flaw" we will speak of during the review of this beer.
The aroma was one of the first to really kick that citra aroma up a notch into your nose.  This was kind of the standard bearer for citra smells, all those citrus and tropical bouquets.  
Its not just citrus notes though, there is some woody pine flavors in the taste/mouthfeel that supplement the plentiful fruit notes.  Definitely a soft touch though bitterness wise, this isn't one of those 100ibu bitter bombs with little flavor and lots of crystal malt, oh no.  
Excellent 1st tier world class ipa if you ask me. 888 charactersrodbeermunch, Apr 06, 2016

3.95/5  rDev -13.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4L - Hazy golden orange with a little transparency. Two fingers of slightly off-white head.
S - Overly ripe peach and mango. Sweet malts which border on sugary.
T - classic West Coasr garlic and onion with the aforementioned sweet malts. A wet hop bitterness with dirty, earthy dankness with a small amount of the peach and mango from the aroma. The finish has some doughy and bready malts which aren't ideal for the end.
F - Full-bodied with moments of being syrupy. No alcohol presence. Not exactly easy to slug down with sweet notes and (at some times) a resinous feel.
O - Maybe I'm spoiled by New England DIPAs, but I think the reputation preceded Kern River Citra on this one. While it's a classic example of a big boy West Coast DIPA, that's just not how I prefer my DIPAs these days. It is most comparable to a Stone RuinTen, but I would prefer that over this. 871 charactersThrewRedButter, Mar 30, 2016

A: Pours slightly hazy golden orange with a frothy off white head that settles to a thin layer and leaves some very nice lacing.
S: Tropical fruit, passion fruit and mango, backed with citrus, lots of orange, a little grapefruit, and some caramel sweetness.
T: Juicy, citrus, orange and grapefruit, tropical fruit, passion fruit and mango, biscuity malt backbone, and light caramel sweetness.
M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, dangerously drinkable.

Really nice DIPA.  Not anything like I was expecting for a Citra hopped IPA.  Very malty and creamy, which is right up my alley.  The balance of the citra and amarillo hops is extremely unique and perfectly executed.  Glad I was finally able to try this one after seeking it out for over a year.  Usually breweries are accused of trying to execute a "west coast" ipa, but this more of a west coast brewery making a more east coast ipa type.  Love the malty balance with the hops. 544 charactersrabbott2, Mar 04, 2016

I was able to purchase 6 bottles because I won the lottery. Check out my trip to the brewery!!

4.72/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Bomber into an IPA glass at ~fridge temp.
Look: dark yellow with a really nice-looking 1cm foam head; good lacing.
Smell: lemongrass, lemon wedges, lemon rind, lemon pith... you get the idea.
Taste: whoa. Initial flavor is almost like chocolate covered cherries or something. Dark, rich, and sweet, without being too sweet. Citrus follows, but not bright or tangy; almost like a lemon crumb bar. Finish is lingering confectioners sugar, strawberry, lilac.
Feel: full side of medium, with great rounded carb and slightly dry.
Overall: I pretty much never give 5s, but the taste on this deserves it. It's got so much going on, but every flavor remains distinct and contributes to the whole. This is just ridiculously good. 725 charactersneurobot01, Mar 02, 2016

A lot of highly rated DIPAs are packed with as much flavor as possible but this one is more delicate and well balanced.  There are a still a ton of tropical fruit flavors and even more dankness but it's controlled.  I could easily drink 5 of these and not have a complete palate blow out.  The mouthfeel is also exceptional, very full and creamy.  Overall, this is a surprisingly easy drinking beer full of wonderful classic citra hop flavors and an incredible mouthfeel. 576 charactersBreweryRun, Nov 28, 2015

5/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had at least 5 pints of this beer last weekend at KRBC but I am currently reviewing this while sipping on the ONLY BOTTLE I was able to score. 
Appearance: This beer is a pretty golden orange and there is a distinct, classic KRBC Citra haze and cloudiness. It's a very cool and savory looking ale. Looks vibrant, juicy and bright. The head is small and eggshell colored.
Aroma: It's basically like the juice / remains that are leftover from a bomb ass fruit salad; strawberry, peach, orange and extra sweet grapefruit. It's explodes with juicy juicy trpoical fruits of all varieties. It's like smelling an orange and tangerine popsicle. Also, after repeatedly smelling the beer the aroma is quite reminiscent of fresh Pliny the Elder but substantially, and I mean a lot more, pleasant. 
Taste: It's an eloquent mix of peach and orange marmalade, balanced as tits. This thing is bursting with flavor but I definitely wouldn't consider this IPA one-noted. There is a very slight biscuity and white bread thing going on that is barely detectable but only if you really try and find it. The malts are just a thin table / vessel for the hop oils and flavors to shine and excel on. I also notice a minimal herbal / minty hop sensation which makes this a special beast unlike the majority of CA IPA's. This beer does not possess the familiar Cannabis / Dank flavors many of the new age CA IPA's contain. Surprisingly, I also taste very minimal pine action as well. As the beer warms up a bit this beer is quite reminiscent of those orange or lemon hard candies you get at upscale restaurants. Fruity juice / bubblicious essence in the middle of the mouth and back end of the palate. 
Mouthfeel: Carbonation is surprisingly refreshing and lively but definitely not to the point of excess. I think Im sensing the bubbles a bit more from the bottle than from on draft. Citra is not the smoothest beer in the world compared to many of the newest contenders in the style but it still feels quit right since this beer does not need to be overly smooth. This beer on the other hand is extremely drinkable yet begs you to analyze its complexity with every sip. That my friends, is my new definition of a balanced and well rounded brew.
Overral: FREAKING FANTASTIC. This beer is undoubtedly made with so much careful attention to detail. CITRA double IPA is beautifully crafted and I wholeheartedly understand why people drive from such ridiculous distances to attain it. Nonetheless, there isn't a doubt in my mind that everyone who travels here leaves pleasantly surprised. The experience of this beer also includes the charming, beautiful town of Kernville which is focused around the Kern River and this magnificent brewery and eatery. 2,730 charactersluisitoelmatador88, Nov 20, 2015

*Don't make the mistake of drinking this too cold. Let it warm a bit and the flavor will really open up!
Appearance - Hazy golden orange hue.
Smell - Citrus fruits and slight dankness.
Taste - The front of the palate is citrus and pine. As it passes over the middle of your mouth citrus tropical fruits become apparent. Very nice DIPA!
Mouthfeel - Nice pillowy feel. Creamy. Low attenuation. Medium carbonation. Very nice.
Overall - I traded an arm and a leg to procure this bottle and now having finished it I feel that everything I had to give up was worth it. Check another one off the list!

(A)- Pours an apricot orange color. Some good white froth and lacing
(S)- Big citrus of orange and pineapple. Slight dryness and pine but with a subtle sweetness behind it too
(T)- Candied pineapple and grapefruit-like citrus meets a piney yet sweet honey and orange profile. Some very subtle peach notes on the finish
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. Slightly dry, but a great citrus profile that is balanced so well with some bittnerness. What makes it special is it is not overly sweet
(O)- Honored to finally try this one. Superb citrus and body to it without being too bitter or sweet. Easily one of the top DIPAs I have ever had 679 characterssweemzander, Sep 10, 2015

This DIPA makes it all worth it, though.
This beer is phenomenal, the fruity hoppy aroma is present, but not overpowering, the taste is a perfect representation of what Citra hops are capable of, light pine with the perfect mix of hoppy citrus notes! 
Wow was this tasty!

Full Pint - multiples & from bottles later on
FINALLY….I is a Citra Lottery Winner!
A:  Citra pours a deep caramel orange color with a full on haze job across the body.   Smallish lid of ivory white holds for a few moments before settling out to a crown.  Random splash and swaths of stick hit the glass on the drink down. 
S:  A concentrated blast of citrus greets the nose with of handfuls of gooseberry and lemon grass.  I get some sugary wafts of malt there but not much other character.  Fine by me I can draw this one in all day.  Super pungent and pronounced with the Citra’s which is everything you want when you can get your hands on this brew.  Very nicely done and the triple or quadruple dry hop job they do on this bad boy is affirmed.  
T:  Flavor is an intensely bitter Citra bomb! Straight up and not shy here at all.  I am in hop heaven.  Gum scrubbing good.  A gigantic grapefruit and orange fruit twist with gooseberry that really stands out.  Kind of heavier on the malt with a honey like sweetness and lower carb to this it really accentuates the resinous factor.  Such a long lasting pucker to this one.  Awesomely good shit! 
M:  On tap they seem to offer this at a bit lower level of carbonation.  It is a very different brew really.  Sits quite a bit heavier on the palate and really lets those hop resins do a number.  Super bitter bite with that lasting pucker and a dry resinous finish.  Bottles definitely have more bubble action to them and less impact on the tongue I would say.  
D:  A massive charge of Citra goodness.  Really awesome brew and a Top DIPA for me no doubt.  I will say this is very different on tap and I wasn’t as big a fan with my bottles.  Still great but that much fresher draught with less carb to conceal away all those lovely hop oils.  Worthy of hunting down at least once in your time on planet beer. 1,906 charactersNugganooch, May 01, 2015

Yes, there are a lot of maybe better new-comers to the DIPA market, but this is still a fantastic beer! 346 charactersReady4aHeady, Mar 08, 2015

4.74/5  rDev +3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Got a bomber of this brew from a trade. Big thanks for that! Love those DIPA's. Let's see how this measures up!
Appearance: Pours a light-golden, not so pale coloring. Frothy, white head of about an inch thick and provides impressive lacing all the way down. Big thumbs up that gives this a perfect 5
Smell: Sweet honey, Explosive hop aromas are strongly noticed in the first few checks of the aroma. Pineapple, Lemon, almost lime-like and passion fruit are totally breaking through. Another check also reveals some agave-like syrup. However, light.
Taste: First few sips reveal a hop-explosion. Pineapple, pine, grapefruit and lemon zest all come together to bring forth a palate overload. Some bitterness, but it all comes to perfect balance. Some light, malt sweetness also comes into play, more on the back burner. Some orange or naval zest comes into play. Finishes about the same, all the way through. Perfect hop balance.
Feel: Medium body, buttery finish. Delicious and everything comes to balance in it's own perfect way. Medium carbonation. Very crisp.
Overall: Coming into this brew, I was excited and ready and actually prepared this at the perfect serving temperature, and boy was it worth it! Instantly, my palate was pushed to the limit and up against the wall for hoppiness explosion. From start to finish, this brew did not disappoint. Everything was in balance and together. Next time I come across this, I will dive on it and would recommend to anyone in their right mind! Cheers! 1,504 charactersDMXLOX22, Feb 28, 2015

Thanks Tony!
Poured a honey, orange, hazy color with 2-to-3 fingers of khaki-white, rocky head. A few light bubble streams coming up from the bottom of the glass. Good layered, foamy, spiderweb lacing on the sides of the glass. Average retention. (Sight - 4.00)
Wow. First whiff reminded me of an Alpine IPA, specifically Bad Boy or Duet. Got mango, tropical, pineapple, Citra, floral, Amarillo, light resin, grapefruit pulp, nectarine, passion fruit, wet pine, sugary caramel and red grapefruit. Delicious. (Smell - 4.75)
Taste wasn’t as potent as the smell, which would be hard to live up to anyway. Got toned down tropical, mango, pineapple, grapefruit pulp, bitter nectarine rind, Citra, some resin, caramel, peach, apricot, slight Juicy Fruit gum, light passion fruit, juice orange, floral and Amarillo. (Taste - 4.25)
Medium body. Creamy texture. Lively carbonation. Long, juicy, bitter finish. (Feel - 4.25)
This was really, really good. However, I’ve got yesterday’s Hopslam as the wee favorite between the two. Glad I got to try this though. (Overall - 4.25)

The flavor starts off with mango and papaya. It moves through some dry grassiness. The maltiness stands up to the hip punch nicely. Superb mouthfeel.
There is also a bit of unadulterated bitterness that detracts slightly from the experience.
This is a great DIPA, but didn't stand up to the considerable hype. I don't think there's any major faults here, but the goal posts are constantly moving as craft beer ups its game ever faster.
I think some newer entrants -- like Heavy Mettle, The Crusher and Locust Reign -- have set a new standard. 650 charactersjjdc, Feb 13, 2015

Beautiful golden orange colored ale with small amount of white head that quickly went away. It has a bouquet of citrus pine. A bit of a gripping bitterness but overall stays smooth. Flavor follows with a bright, crisp citrus, resinous note. You can feel the amount of hops used to make this beer. As the beer warms I start to notice some more pineapple and tropical aroma and in the taste. Overall a great use of 2 of my favorite hops, and something you should try to get once. But from my experience I feel I can find something similar that is much easier to get. And I understand that this is "2 months old" at my time of drinking it. Still a great beer, get over yourself. If a beer is considered ruined if not drank in the first week it's not a great beer. 781 charactersjakewatt135, Jan 12, 2015

The hype around this beer is insane. This bottle is a month old, so I will try to keep that in consideration.
It looks great. Beautiful golden-orange color with a head that disappears as fast as looking at Grannies with Trannys.
Aroma explodes with Citra and Amarillo hops characteristics. Candied mango, pineapple and orange are the cliche characteristics of a beer hopped to shit with 'tropical fruit hops.' There is a nice resinous backbone that keep this from being 'perfumey.' HINTS of garlic are present, but only due to the insane amounts of hops used in this beer. Alcohol comes out slightly the more the beer warms, but only slightly. 
Flavor is nice and balanced in terms of sweet fruit and bitter hops. Hops bite when you take that first sip, but fade to open a presence of herbaceous and tropical fruit notes mid-palate with the finish being long and pleasant. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied without being syrupy. Minimal carbonation is present but just enough to help accentuate the hops and other characteristics. 
Overall I was very impressed that this beer was still as good as it was after a month. It isn't 'legendary' as it might have been at 1-2 weeks, but it was still one of the better double IPAs I have had. A great experience and I'm really glad I got to FINNALY tick it off my list. 1,412 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Dec 13, 2014

Huge tropical fruit on the nose to start with. Pouring into Spigelau IPA glass, Citra is a hazy sunset orange. Stunning color in the glass. The taste is more subdued than than the aroma, but not in detractory manner. Lots of fruit flavors and a noticeable maltiness give it a nice balanced taste. I don't notice any bitterness. I am really thrilled to have gotten my hands on such a fine beer and hope to try it again in the future. 505 charactersNorthtexan, Dec 13, 2014

*Shared this at a very small tasting I had at 4th Avenue Pub in the Park Slope area of Brooklyn.  Happy Birthday Lohman!!
Pours a hazy golden in color w/ a 1/2 finger of white head that leaves little to no lacing on the glass.  Aromas of Mandarin orange, mango, pineapple, cat piss, and breadiness.  The flavor was of  big citrus and pineapple up front, giving way to light grapefruit, and closes w/ ever so mild resinous bitterness.  Medium bodied and finishes dry.  You could pretty much drink this beer all night long, but that would never happen because it is so difficult to acquire.
Overall, this beer is the truth and the best DIPA I have had from the West Coast, even over Pliny, The Elder that is.  Now in my all-time top 5.  Currently standing in fourth only behind in this order:  Sosus, Double Sunshine, and Dinner.  Of course, Heady Topper is 5th. 947 charactersmikeyv35, Sep 12, 2014

4.7/5  rDev +3.1%Aroma: Pine, Grapefruit, Lemon zest, orange, and Mango, Absolutely superb nose, the citra hops are outstanding in the nose from this beer! 5/5
Appearance: Hazy ambient orange that glows in the glass, nothing else to say but it looks amazing! 5/5
Taste: Pretty let down here, the nose is so strong and vibrant, but the flavor profile is really muted. Probably because of the excessive dry hopping. It tastes almost like a light session beer, not something you would expect from an 8% DIPA. Even though it tastes very muted it is still full of flavor, Pine, Orange, Lemon zest, grapefruit, and Mango, with a perfect amount of bitterness. This beer would be so much better if the hops packed a bigger punch instead of being so muted on the flavor profile, even though muted it tastes pretty good. 4/5
Palate: Very light and crisp, smooth, leaves your mouth a little dry on the finish, hits like a session IPA and I think it is superb for this beer! 5/5
Overall: This is a great beer, but it is so much better on tap but bottled it is still really good. The biggest thing is the muted flavor profile. Still really damn good though 4.5/5 1,136 charactersKnowYourCraft, Aug 10, 2014

Poured into a tulip glass at FWIBF. Pretty sure this is a fresh batch, but I was too pleased with glee that this was in my hand that I forgot to ask how old.
Looks solid, and standard to all memorable DIPAs and regular IPAs I've gone through in my life. Cloudy, with a sunset orange amber hue that is pleasing to the eye yet very simplistic with its homebrew-like appearance. The head is fluffy and foamy, and leaves behind some nice lacing as it dissipates. Doesn't appear too viscous, but it's definitely a little sticky from the looks of it. Pleasant and juicy looking.
Smells juicy as well! This is perhaps the highlight of this beer - amazingly vivid notes of stone fruit, citrus, and tropical varieties clash together, but in a somewhat graceful and glowing manner. This is ALL about the Citra here, but of some of the Amarillo adds some fun flavors to it, ranging from peaches, apricot, melon, pineapple, guava, and, of course, grapefruit, orange peel, and pine. Just like any excellent DIPA, the beauty is in the bright display of fresh fruit, and not so much with the measure of dankness. This lives up to that, without a doubt. Smells far less bitter than perhaps its IBUs would indicate, and this is nothing but fantastic.
The flavor is not nearly as graceful and bright as the aroma, but it is nevertheless delicious and deserves all the credit where credit is due. Big notes of grapefruit, pine, peaches, and pineapple dominate the palate, with a crisp toffee and caramel malt profile following soon after. Ends with more stone fruit notes, as well as a dried citrus peel flavor that nicely cleanses the palate and leaves the sweet malt notes lingering as well as a floral, earthy characteristic. The feel of this beer is also an enormous highlight for me - not only is it crisp and refreshing, but it's also delightfully airy and ripe as any great freshly squeezed juice tends to be. Good acidity, fruit sweetness, as well as a malty crispness that makes this wonderfully addictive and approachable. Yummy stuff, and definitely up there with the greats.
This was delicious, and I really wish there were a better way to get access to this other than these beer festivals or the lottery system (for bottles) that they implemented at the brewery last year. If this were easy to find, I'd definitely make this a regular in my fridge due to its enormous drinkable character. It's a shame that great beers across the country such as this one are difficult to get. I feel honored to have tried it, and I hope I cross paths with it again one of these days. 2,692 charactersmagictacosinus, Jun 02, 2014

It's a conundrum. I have had Heady Topper, fresh Pliny the Elder, and a three month old 22 of Kern Citra Double IPA. I like the beers in this order HT, PtE, then Citra. These are all world class brews. It depends on preference, and what you grew up drinking.
A - Deep, dark, rich orange. Sticky carbonation.
S - Sweet mango, grapefruit, pineapple, and citrus.
T - World-class. Rich. Not as complex as Heady and not as clean at PtE.
M - Dense, quality carbonation.
O - Up there with HT and PtE.
For me, a top three contender for best DIPA. 567 charactersmabermud, May 06, 2014

Pour from bottle into chilled tulip glass. Appearance is beautiful deep and murky amber/orange. Thick & fluffy one-inch white head dissipated gradually, leaving abundant and uniform sticky lacing throughout. Lots of continuous minuscule bubbles for duration, all around a thin white collar. The nose is a citrusy mango pineapple, with a hint of pine and papaya/banana scent. On the palate, a subtle malt lends balance to bitey hops with a taste profile similar to the nose. Indeed, one of the more striking aspects of this brew is the utter balance of citrus hops and subtle malt, with the alcohol well hidden. Mouthfeel is better than average, with good but not overwhelming carbonation.
Overall, a very fine DIPA and one I hope to have the pleasure of trying again some day. Eager to visit Kern River and sample other offerings from what I understand is a fantastic venue. Thanks and cheers to David Frank for the experience! 1,029 charactersJohnParadee, Mar 31, 2014

The aroma is pungent and juicy of tropical and citrus fruits, lots and lots of orange and grapefruit peel. A certain lemon and grapefruit zest and spritziness in the aroma. A big sugary sweetness in there as well. 
The flavor follows with a powdery pink grapefruit candy, dried grapefruit and orange peel, tons of sweet dried tropical fruits. A big pineapple juice bitterness. 
The beer has a wonderful medium mouthfeel with a fluffy white bread malt in the middle. There’s a sweetness throughout that comes through from beers like Double Jack and Lagunitas Sucks, instead of that white breadiness from VT hoppy brews. 
The beer is medium plus bitterness on the finish along with tons of drying. The finish has floral, spicy and herbal bitterness along with tons of fresh grapefruit peel and pith. 
This reminds me of an Alpine beer and definitely does a reasonable job standing up against the best from Vermont, although my preference is clearly in the light bready malt than the big sweetness this beer contains. 1,160 charactersdar482, Mar 21, 2014

Poured from a 22oz bottle, no #freshbeer info.
Pours a completely hazy orange body. A healthy and bubbly head is strong and holds up well. Huge aroma of sweet mangoes, fresh pineapple, heady and awesome. Flavor has pineapple at the forefront with juicy mango following right behind, has a biscuity malt finish. Taste is less intense than the aroma but drinks like a freshly squeezed glass of hoppy fruit juice. So very good! 461 characterspapat444, Mar 19, 2014

A: What a beautiful beer! Golden, sunburst orange, gigantic frothy cream-colored head. Within 1 minute, the head has reduced to a bubbly coating, resting gently on the remainder of the beer. Leaving spiderwebbed, sticky-looking lacing all the way to the end.
S: Gadzooks! So bright, so fresh, I can only imagine what the brewhouse smelled of as this was being made. A subtle grain base features layer upon layer of slightly sweet, floral, fruity hops. I spent a good several minutes inhaling deeply, certainly in no rush to stop!
T/M: Ohhh, so this is what heaven tastes like, glad I now know. Slight bit of toasted sweetness up front, but still almost raw in nature. And then kablammo! Hops after hops after hops...on a tropical island and if hops grew on palm trees. Oh, doesn't make sense? Well after all the mango, peach, and especially pineapple that coats the tongue, it will. Tight carbonation produces an extremely creamy drinking experience. This would KILL on a nitro tap. Perfect in every way.
O: Alright, so here's a good example of a beer living up to its hype and then some. 'Nuff said. Get you some. 1,248 charactersmarkgugs, Mar 16, 2014

App- Clear caramel-amber body, with a nice 2-finger white head with good retention, not much lacing. Fairly typical of a DIPA.
Smell- Pineapple, a bit of grapefruit and lemon. Good malt backbone consisting of caramel and brown sugar. 
Flavour- Grapefruit with a hint of pineapple, caramel and toffee. Solid, even very good. The citra hops aren't bursting through the seams here. Not complex, not juicy, but certainly bitter.
Mouthfeel- Medium bodied, good carbonation, probably the best feature behind this beer. Fairly bitter, but not particularly resinous and it doesn't stick for a long time. Nice, palate drying finish.
Overall- This is a good Citra hopped DIPA. Technically, it's not single-hop Citra per the label. But King Sue, which is a single hop citra DIPA, wipes the floor, ceiling and all 4 walls with this beer. To me, this beer's popularity is borne at least partially from west-coast hype and scarcity. Don't get me wrong, this is a good beer and I enjoyed it, but given what west coast traders are asking for this, I'd very much rather pay the asking price for Abner or Double Sunshine. As a side note for my west coast friends, you should spend the time you'd chase KRBC Citra on finding Citra Showers the next time Noble brews it. That is a very similar quality citra beer that reaches distribution. 1,490 charactersStevedore, Mar 12, 2014

4.91/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A - Cloudy pale-ish yellow amber. Pours with a nice finger head, which dissipates fairly quickly to a thin foam layer. Nothing special.
S - I could smell the citrusy hoppy goodness as soon as the cap popped off the bottle. Don't even need to put your nose in the glass to smell all the flavors. Delicious grapefruit and tangerine dominate with a bit of dankness and some other citrusy fruit smell. For me the best smelling IPA I've ever had by a decent margin, as I prefer the tropical fruit smells over piney or dank smells.
T - The grapefruit and tangerine from the smell hits first balanced with a perfect amount of hop bitterness and hop oil on the finish. Tastes vibrant, if that makes any sense. Delicious. 
M - Smooth start with a dry tingly finish. I've had smoother IPAs (e.g., Abrasive) but I kind of like the change as it moves through across the tongue.
O - My personal favorite IPA, it's as if it's constructed to my personal preferences. I've had it several times, and at one point or another side by side with heady, elder, double sunshine , and abrasive and it's always been my favorite (though those other are also terrific). 1,146 charactersWolberjs, Mar 06, 2014

Appearance - Pours a slightly hazy, somewhat dull orange body with a decent sized, 2 finger head that reduces very slowly and leaves thick, foamy lacing. 
Smell - Nothing hugely pronounced or overwhelming.. I really like a blast of tropical aromas from a west coast IPA of this caliber, instead I have to strain to get slight notes of pine, citrus, some tropical mango and pineapple. 
Taste - Upfront I get subtle piney flavors and semisweet malt, followed by a tropical kick of lemon-citrus, mango, and a resinous bitterness that sticks on the tongue for a while. 
M - Easy going down, medium carbonation and body. 
Did I enjoy Citra DIPA? Absolutely. Does it hold up to some of the other world-class DIPAs I've tried? Not really. I was going to do a side-by-side of this and Heady Topper, but it wasn't necessary because I knew which one would win. My advice is: if you're looking to try some of the best west coast style DIPAs on the planet, try some of the easier to acquire ones (Pliny, Heady, enjoy by, etc). Once you've tried those, seek this out. 1,133 charactersgcamparone, Mar 06, 2014

A - Pours a beautiful sunset amber color, quite hazy, but not to the point of opaqueness. A dense 3 finger bright white head sits atop the brew with excellent retention. When it finally does fade to a cap, it leaves generous swaths of creamy lace.
S - Massive lemon pith and pineapple jump out immediately in the smell (typical of a Citra hopped beer I'm finding), with mango, peach, and grapefruit rind not far behind. A bit of herbal pine and some slight dank resin also make an appearance, but take a backseat to the fruits. Maybe a hint of a sweet biscuit malt bill. 
T - Um, wow. Lots of sweet nectarines, orange and mango in the front, before being pushed aside by heavy pineapple, peach, papaya, lemon pith, with the faint sweet bread malt backbone (barely) propping it up. Finishes with a fantastic blend of herbaceous pine, slight oily resin, grapefruit rind bitterness and some stone fruit sweetness. Just really amazing stuff here. 
M - Just as good as it tastes, the mouthfeel is super creamy, slightly oily with a medium body and dry, moderately bitter finish with lingering sweetness. Drinks like an 8% DIPA should.
O - I don't want this bottle to end. This is just world class stuff through and through. Would take it over something like Pliny any day, although HT still reigns as DIPA champ in my book. Nevertheless, this bottle is just packed with juicy, drippy hops from start to finish, with an incredible mouthfeel to back it up. I'll be trading for more of this. 1,555 characterscjoc83, Mar 04, 2014

4.69/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a big, fluffy white head. Brew is cloudy and deep orange, deeply translucent, with gold and amber highlights and hints of red. Head retention is excellent, and lacing is sticky and thick.
Huge citrus and tropical fruit aroma (think: Enjoy By). Ruby red grapefruit and tangerine; apricots; peaches; mangos. Floral with a bit of honey. Subtle biscuity malt in the background. Absolutely superb nose.
Flavor is drier and earthier than the nose. First, a hint of citrus peel; slightly resinous hops. Then, the fruit really kicks in mid-palate: juicier citrus and tropical fruit. Final third of the hop flavors returns a mix of resin, pine, and tropical fruit, with a lasting (but pleasant) citrus peel aftertaste.
Overall flavor is surprisingly balanced and even subtle; it's not over the top, especially when compared to the aroma. Amarillo is more dominant than the Citra, IMO; it's more balanaced overall, and I don't get any dank flavors. Malt backbone is virtually nonexistent as a flavor, yet there's enough there that the hop flavors don't come across as unbalanced.
Nice, medium mouthfeel, perfect and lively in the mouth (not DIPA syrup). Minimum sting, absolutely no alcohol presence. Juicy throughout, but a fairly dry finish. Excellent.
This beer isn't really perfect in many respects, but it's damn close across the board. The only thing that I think couldn't be improved is the appearance; it just looks great. The aroma is fantastic. The taste and mouthfeel are superb, but perhaps imperfect for my particular tastes; they're certainly not flawed in any way.
A very drinkable beer; IMO, a slightly better, less citrus peel on the lasting aftertaste would bump it up yet another notch. Really a fantastic DIPA that you should thank the stars if you can get your hands on it.
Thanks to JayORear for this gift! 1,831 charactersRoguer, Mar 02, 2014

S: Bit citrusy grapefruit, guava, and stone fruit aromas. Really a clean aroma... fantastic and loud hop presence. I can see this being my favorite part about this beer... it's really quite nice.
T/M: Medium mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. A very clean beer. Mild malt and carbonation lead into candy malt sweetness reminiscent of the malt profile of Zombie Dust. Mid-sip is lightly bitter and full of juicy fruits and the finish is mild, giving way to another wave of stone fruit and pineapple.
O: Really a great beer. Very glad I got to try it, but probably not something I'll go through the trouble of trying again, although I'd happily do it given another opportunity. This really drinks like a big cousin to fresh Zombie Dust with the same almost cotton candy sweetness from the malts showing up in both brews. 969 charactersjdhowe, Feb 28, 2014

A- Murky orange hue golden. Thin head, retention leads to minimal lacing. 
S- Some citrus and floral bouquet, but not as much as I expected. Minimal hops. 
T- Very thick, medium citrus and floral. Citra hop was not as dynamic as I thought it would be. Like it is in Pseudo Sue. 
M- 5 on the M. Amazing mouthfeel. Thick and creamy. Nuts for an IPA. Minimal carb, this tastes like a winter IPA
O- Very good, but my personal preference goes to other IPA's. I will send my other one to someone who will appreciate it more. 563 charactersgueuzedreg, Feb 28, 2014

Mother of God! Maximum tropical aroma, fresh mangoes, pineapple and loads of citrus even some watermelon in there. Very floral and powerful aroma. 
Malts are balancing with some graham cracker sweetness but then makes way for the hops. Juicy fruit hop regimen bursts of sweet orange and pink citrus, mangoes, sweet pineapple and mild passionfruit, bracing pine in the finish. Bitterness is really mild and drying.
Medium body with average carbonation, ideal really. Alcohol presence is minimized nicely, drying feel that strangely brings out a piney aftertaste that really wasn't present in the beer until the finish. 
Citra is everything I expected and more. The aroma is perfect and the tropical flavors coming out with such intensity in the taste is something most IPAs/DIPAs, try as they might, are unable to accomplish. 1,031 charactersrawfish, Feb 25, 2014

5/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5The one, the only! Being from Bakersfield, I feel so very priviledged to be so close to the origin of this sweet hop nectar! I've been told Citra is best tasted and judged on tap, so that is what I shall do for my review. Had this on tap today (2/23/14) at the source at KRBC. Poured into a standard pint glass.
Appearance - Pours a gorgeous golden orange color with a distinct cloud to it. It looks just as a proper Double IPA should.
Aroma - Unmatched. Just unmatched. Super big tropical fruits here: pineapple, mangos, sweet grapefruit. Every bit of citrusy aroma has been pulled out of the hops and makes you think you are smelling fresh squeezed tropical juice.
Taste - Exceeds the aroma. Big punch of bitterness right up front like that first bite of a morning bowl of grapefruit with hops sprinkled on top! The middle just opens up and builds upon the big tropical notes from the aroma. Sticky pineapple juice and grapefruit juice with a touch of mango. All the bitter citrus fruits you can think of come through and finish with a thorough coating of the mouth with hoppiness. You can taste with every mouthful just how well crafted and balanced the hops and malt are.
Overall - This is (to me) the pinnacle of how to perfectly marry floral and citrusy hops and a strong malt back into a perfect double IPA. The hype is real folks. This is the best DIPA I could ever ask to taste and probably will taste in my life. If you can get lucky enough to win in a future lottery for bottles, trade for, or make the trip up to KRBC to have this beer, it will not and can not disappoint! 1,588 charactersbnelson997, Feb 24, 2014

3.93/5  rDev -13.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a Kern River shaker pint (currently their only style of glassware available). This was one attractive beer: cloudy apricot-orange color with an inch or so of thick, foamy, white head that retained strongly, coating the glass with lacing. Nice aroma of citrus zest and underripe pineapple, for a fresh bottle, it wasn't really exploding with aroma as I had hoped, but it was still nice. The taste was good, nothing mind-blowing, pretty much average on the scale of IPAs or DIPAs. Good burst of hops, more bitter than fresh and juicy, citrus rind, underripe pineapple, herbal notes, grassy notes, bready malt base. Good, but nothing special or unique really. Smooth mouthfeel for a double, with just about no alcohol burn at all, though a little graininess lingered in the aftertaste. With all the hype this beer gets, I really expected something different, but it was really just a basic IPA, and offered nothing more than a typical local option. Still good, of course, just wackily overrated. 1,004 charactersRifugium, Nov 18, 2013

Cloudy apricot hue, 1 finger of frothy bone colored head, nice retention and splotchy lacing all up in the tulip.
As soon as you pop the cap, you know Citra means business: tons of ripe juicy tropical fruit including mango, nectarine, tangerine. The aroma is an assault on the nostrils in the best possible way.
Taste is exploding with tropical fruit amongst a fresh pretzel dough backdrop, and a touch of clean alcohol in the mix. Slight nick for the booze level, but not a detractor.
Mouthfeel is tremendous, carbonation surprisingly brisk but not overdone, lingering bitterness keeps reminding you of its' greatness.
Kern Citra and Alpine Bad Boy both represent to me the very best of the top notch California IIPAs, and notably, some of the rarest in the country. Citra goes toe to toe with the best small batch Vermont craft brew offerings, and I feel fortunate to have gotten the opportunity to have sampled a fresh bottle. Highly recommended if you can get your hands on this one, this is beautiful stuff. 1,085 charactersHendry, Nov 12, 2013

A fat head of cottony foam that will not fall down. Don't bother to wait. Leaves spectacular cotton candy lace. There are plenty of bubbles rising to the surface. The nose is simply terrific. Tropical fruits. Pineapple, mango, Grapefruit, orange and lemon citrus, candied fruit peel. A sweet floral and a succulent hop sweetness. The malt promises some sweetness but doesn't smell heavy or sugary. Taste is splendid. Grapefruit comes to the front of the palate bringing a hop punch of juicy fruit flavors with it. The body of the beer is soft and while amply carbonated it's supple and smooth. The malt teases you with a bit of flaky biscuit that is not too sweet. 
This beer is simply the lightest DIPA I have ever had. The malt is vibrant in and of itself and the flaky biscuit quality has it's sweetness in the bread and not from sugar. The hops are graceful and abundant but not oily or resiny or even too piney. The fruits were simply stated in their own right. As many as there were I could name them all that's how well done they are. Grapefruit is an engaging taste and this one lets all the other exotic fruits stand behind it's grapefruit. Not too much pith but just enough to accent a dazzling little bitter that steals the show from any sugary sweetness you think you are about to taste. You can believe the hype about this one. It's straight forward and well turned out. A pleasure to drink ! 1,479 charactersutopiajane, Nov 09, 2013

4.79/5  rDev +5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A- Pours a moderately hazy orange/gold with a massive, billowing white head that retains well and leaves lots of sticky lacing.
S- Huge pungent tropical fruit and citrus notes come cascading out of the glass! A massive punch of pineapple, followed by passion fruit, mango, mandarin orange, and a bit of bitter grapefruit zest. A touch of pale and caramel malt to round this out, but this is all about the hops as advertised!
T- The flavor features the passion fruit first and foremost, which is very different from other Citra hopped DIPAs. Perhaps the Amarillo brings that? Grapefruit surprisingly plays a strong secondary role, with some of the mandarin orange as well. A bit of pineapple and mango come through as it warms. Some biscuity malt backbone holds this together.
M- The mouthfeel is medium to thick for this style, with ample carbonation.
O- Overall this is a fantastic beer, and a great/unique representation of the style! 940 charactersSadMachine, Nov 08, 2013
4.37/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Smells like hoo boy... I opened it up and my alcoholic cat start meowing from across the room, even though it hadn't even been poured. She's not allowed anymore, though. But, seriously I wasn't exaggerating even a little there; the aroma is super intense, and super excellent. 
Tastes like a big, fruity citra bomb up front, followed up by syrupy DIPA malt and then a somewhat dull yeast finish that's saved by lingering nodes of apricot and peach. So, basically it starts out like Zombie Dust only more intense (which is amazing), and then it finishes like an above-average DIPA (which is good but disappointing). 
Excellent aroma and nice, smooth body, but overall it doesn't hold a candle to the best Midwest and east coast Citras. 736 charactersmynie, Nov 08, 2013

S - Fresh citrus and pine jump out, followed by a light honey and resin.
T - Incredibly balanced and smooth. Up there with Heady Topper, Pliny The Younger. The malts are just perfect allowing the hops to remain in front without being over the top.
M - a good amount of carbonation, more than your typical DIPA. Medium bodied.
O - One of the best IPAs you can find. No doubt about it. 443 charactersSirBentham, Nov 06, 2013

S - Lots of fresh pine and citrus. I know this was freshly bottled and the fragrance shows. 
T - There is no IPA that drinks this smoothly. The hop and malt balance is incredible, and still manages to keep the hops right up front where they belong. Lots of pine and sweet citrus notes. 
M - Lots of body, almost feels rich when it hits your tongue. Very hearty for an IPA! Well balanced carbonation.
O - My favorite beer of all time. Sooo happy that I won the Citra lottery this year (2013) and was able to score a 6 pack. Well worth the 10 hour drive! 766 charactersThePaleRider, Nov 04, 2013

Appearance: Pours a very nearly opaque deep amber/brown and leaves a finger of white head which falls steadily to a layer atop the beer, leaving some nice lacing on the glass.
Smell: A nice balance of hops and malts (plenty of hops though!). Pine, resin, light honey, citrus rinds, some mango.
Taste: Really matches the smell well. Resin, light pine, honey and mango. Plenty of malts as well. Very well balanced flavors, with a quite smooth finish. 
Mouth-feel: Moderate carbonation with a nice medium, creamy body, Matches the style very well.
Overall: This is a very nice, well balanced DIPA. Very smooth and easy drinking but with lots of flavor. A well crafted brew. 755 charactersResuin, Nov 02, 2013

4.54/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A: Pours orange with a very slight golden hue to it, some murkiness to it, hard to see through it, leaves a nice bubbly head that went quickly, very slight lacing on the glass, looks wonderful in IMO
S: Loads of sweet citrus! Getting a lot of orange, some lemon zest, little bit of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, and pine at the end, this is definitely a hop lovers dream smell to an IPA! It almost smells like it's juice! It smells so good there is almost no way of fulling describing it, you just have to smell it for yourself. Definitely gets a 5 for smell!
T: To be honest I'm a little disappointed here. Judging by the smell you're expecting to get slammed with hops, but that's not the case (for me at least). The citrus flavors seem to be mingled together, no real transitioning happens except for the standard piney hop finish, you can still pick out the flavors but I am finding it quite difficult to do. Not disappointed with the citrus flavors combining and the piney finish, it is still really good, what I am disappointed in is the flavors to me seem like it is almost watered down, or rather really light, almost like it's an APA, SN PA has a stronger hop bite to it and that's really what is letting me down here, but that being said the flavor you get is still really good, just needs a stronger hop bite IMO
M: This category is executed perfectly, extremely light, crisp, and refreshing, especially for an 8% DIPA! Seriously feels like you can session this beer no problem. There is a slight oily feel to it and the beer finishes quickly not leaving any lingering going on, which I find makes IPA's very refreshing
O: This is truly a fantastic beer and I can see why it is getting a lot of praise, it definitely isn't the best DIPA I've ever had but for sure in my top 5. This beer is definitely a beer for summertime with how refreshing it is. If you can somehow get your hands on it to try it one time I would do it, it's unique and a bit different from your standard DIPA's that most breweries make.

On tap at the KRBC Brew Pub and from lottery won bottle 10/26/13
Served in a pint glass
A: This beer pours a light orange/amber with a small 1 finger head.
S: Mango dominates the aroma. there is no alcohol in the smell.
T: Non-distinct tropical fruit flavors dominate the initial flavor profile. On the back end there is a dank resinous dry finish. This beer paired very well with the buffalo chicken sandwich served in the brewpub (highly recommended).This is a good DIPA beer.
M: The beer has a clean crisp mouthfeel and the finish is bitter crisp. 
O: This beer is really good. The overall flavor is closer to Heady (drier) than Pliny (malty). Kinda over-hyped but a must try if available. The brewpub is a great place to visit with great food and staff. It is so worth the trip. Recommended. 818 charactersPsyko, Oct 27, 2013

A: Wheat-colored and hazy.
S: Really great, but maybe not as fresh as could've been hoped? Huge fruit and unmistakable Citra hops.
T: This is my dream beer. Rich, flavorful, and full of pine and passion fruit. An astringent endtaste of lingering grapefruit.
M: Robust and lightly carbonated.
O: If this were the only beer in the world, I would be happy. I returned to the Kern River tent multiple times this day. 509 charactersAgentMunky, Aug 15, 2013

A - Pours a hazy, golden amber with a short white head. The head leaves lacing all along the glass the entire time. 
S - The is no doubt that there are citra hops in this brew. The aroma is intense. 
T - The best part of this beer is the taste, it is so balanced. You are expecting the hops to be too intense but they are offset perfectly by the malt. 
M - A medium bodied beer with a nice amount of carbonation. 
O - This is what a DIPA should be. Nothing overwhelms you. Just wish it was more readily available. 573 charactersaquazr1, Aug 01, 2013

Both times served from tap in a pint and in 12 oz tulip. The appearance is murky with a slight green-yellow color. The smell and taste is amazing. Citrusy pineapple and mango flavors last from the sniff to the swallow. The mouthfeel is the most amazing part of it, 8% and unfiltered gives it the perfect consistency. It's juicy! Each swallow only makes you crave more. My favorite IIPA. HF Double Galaxy and Heady Topper are a close second and thrid. 527 charactersBigGreenMonster, Apr 12, 2013

It's one of the best DIPA's I've ever had. I feel like my ratings above might be too tough on it and if you get the chance to try this one, do it. Absolutely outstanding!

A: Cloudy orange body with a frothy white head. Mediocre retention and lacing. Ok.

Best single hopped beer I have ever had. 288 charactershankthetank97, Mar 03, 2013

4.3/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25A - Hazy copper, near white head leaves fast. Some spotty lace.
S - Still prety cold, so smell is somewhat faint. Citrus notes and malt come in pretty heavy, though.
T - When they said it is a close as you can come to chewing on a hop vine, they weren't kidding. Big time citrus, a little tropical fruit, almost a little spicy feel, and of course lots of sweet malt.
M - Medium to full body, good carb, nice even balance.
D - It's a pretty darned good beer. 461 characterssrandycarter, Mar 01, 2013

Poured into a TH glass.
A - Hazy with a wonderful orange color with a perfect head. This is what an IPA should look like.
S - The aroma of hops from the bottle gets you excited to taste this beer. The citrus combines with the aroma of the hops to make you want to smell this over and over again.
T - For a DIPA this beer has very little bitterness to it. A sweetness fills your mouth that ends with a hop explosion. For me this is the style of DIPA that I crave for.
M - Full bodied. Very creamy and smooth drinking.
O - This is a great DIPA and one I wish was made more often and easier to find. A Top 5, absolutely. It is right there with the best IPAs I've ever had - Heady, Zombie, Abrassive, PtE. 773 charactersbaybum, Mar 01, 2013

A - Hazy orange with a nice white head. Very tight bubbles disappear rather quickly leaving a couple larger ones to wander the surface. Good, thick stuff.
S - Whoa. The aroma jumps from the bottle upon opening. Pineapple and mango craziness. Amarillo hops and fresh squeezed orange juice. Perhaps the least amount of grapefruit I've ever smelled in a DIPA. Beautiful.
T - Well my first sip tells me that this beer has excellent balance. It's sweet, and follows the nose up front, but then the flavor falls off in the middle. At the tail end of the swallow the fruit and bitterness creep back in for an enjoyable finish. Good, but not as exciting as the nose.
M - Full bodied without being overly sticky. Quite creamy and very smooth going down.
O - Superbly easy drinking. Didn't quite live up to the hype--with a bold name like 'Citra' I had been expecting (and hoping for) a lot more flavor. Don't get me wrong, what is offered is absolutely balanced and delicious. 1,004 charactersdlello2, Feb 22, 2013

The mouthfeel is smooth, very creamy feel to it along with some light carbonation. Overall this is very good, I would drink lots of this beer. Very pleased with how this beer was.

4.82/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Big thanks to karink for this one - a huge one from my wanted list finally gets crossed off. Pours a deep copper color near the top that cascades through a gradient, finishing at a shade of amber near the bottom. Hazy and cloudy everywhere but the very edges, topped off with a thick fingered, foamy white head that leaves behind some huge pieces of chunky lace. This beer is simply beautiful. Maybe I'm swooning a bit too much because this was such a huge want on my list, but this is spot on for a DIPA... Looks good enough to drink.
The aroma on this beer is simply one of the best in the business. This is how DIPAs should smell. An orgy of fruit plows through your nostrils like a hobo rummaging through a deli; intense bouts of pineapple, mango, guava, grapefruit, citrus, apricot, peach, tangerine... Just name a goddamn fruit and you can probably pick it out of the aroma here. So much fruit, it's insane to think a profile like this comes from the use of only TWO hops (Citra and Armarillo, though most of it is probably from the Citra). 
The hop aromas are raw and vibrant also; piney, resinous, oily, floral, and pungently juicy. A light onion-like aroma adds to the complexity as well. Despite the massive hop bomb, the malt backbone does not go unnoticed... It provides a strong and sweet bready aroma alongside the hops, like buttered crackers and lightly toasted buttered bread. This aroma is simply sublime, in every sense of the word.
Couldn't have been more excited to bring this one to my lips after smelling it... the malt underbody gets laid out right from the start; it begins with a highly drinkable malty sweetness, again, in the form of buttery biscuits, lighty toasted, hand-in-hand with a mild onion and salty flavor. It doesn't get too comfortable on your palate, however, because the hop bum-rush quickly asserts itself - heavy, heavy citrus peel, pineapple, mangos, grapefruits, tangerines, and honeydew. Just an insane collage of fruits that bounce of the sides of the mouth like crazy. 
A piney bitterness washes over everything about halfway through, followed by a decrescendo of floral, herbal, and oily resins. The aftertaste dies out with this bitterness that couples with a light malt sweetness and a heap of bittersweet citrus flavors. 8% ABV goes completely under the radar, this beer is drinkable as shit. Medium bodied with somewhat high carbonation, ever-so-slightly sticky on the palate.
This was one of my biggest wants (thanks again to karink for the hook-up) and I am so glad that it not only lived up to the hype, but it surpassed my expectations by quite a bit. So goddamn tasty, aromatic, and drinkable. Everything a DIPA could hope to be. If you're a lover of citrusy based D/IPAs, do yourself a solid and get your hands on this beer. All hail the motherfuckin' Citra hop, baby! 2,833 characterstectactoe, Feb 11, 2013

4.93/5  rDev +8.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5Bottle poured into a Hill Farmstead stem.
Pour: A hazy, deep orange body that has a nice radiance to it. Two fingers of cream colored head form, and leaves a thick sticky lacing. Head hangs around for a while. Yup, this looks great.
Smell: As I poured the glass, I already got big wafts of grapefruit and mango. That's a good sign. An insane amount of grapefruit, tangerine, mango, and a nice resin burst out of the glass. Some light breadyness tries to come through, but this is all about the hops.
Taste: Grapefruit explosion. Literally, this tastes like grapefruit juice soaked with citra hops. Lots of citrus, mango, and tangerine. A definite pine, and the typical white pepper that citra often displays. Some bready sweetness, but only enough to calm the hops down slightly. Finishes with a lingering grapefruit bitterness.
Mouthfeel: Just the right amount of bitterness. A medium body, that leans on the side of heavier rather than light. Very drinkable, but not at the level of say, Society and Solitude #5.
Overall: While I personally enjoy Society and Solitude #5 more than this, I would say this is the perfect Double IPA regarding the standards of the style, simply because of the sheer size of everything about it's profile. Whereas S&S5 was pure juice, this exhibits all the best qualities of a DIPA. I will definitely want this again. 1,353 characterscfrances33, Feb 09, 2013

Bottle came from a trade with HoppySuds (in person in CA) and I shared this 22oz brew with my cousin Mark in a tasting held at my new house in Benton Park. This was one of the few (besides D4) that we finished the whole bottle during the tasting. There was no markings on the bottle of any bottling date. 
The appearance was made up of a big, long lasting 1 and 1/2 finger head that was very frothy with bubbles. Had a deep orange/copper colored body with slight hazing. Left great lacing behind. 
In the aroma, tons of fruit, hops, and mango are all thrown hard. Very great and appropriate for this Double hopped up IPA.
Flavor? Big Hopped (American variety), Fruity, and has a Medium-High bitterness level. Not too much complexity.
The mouthfeel starts with a medium to high body is well pronounced with hop. Medium carbonation and finishes with TONS of citra, hence the name.
Cheers to this one! Not sure I'd throw it onto one of the top 10 beers of popular category but it was damn good. Would like to see another bottle of this in my future. Go for it! 1,270 charactersDCon, Oct 29, 2012

M- Medium-light body, very enjoyable as I expected something at 8% to be quite heavy. Light carbonation.
D- A great beer, but the ratings seem quite influenced by hype. I'd gladly have another, it's on the order of a good homebrew IPA. 663 charactersgpogo, Oct 09, 2012

4.57/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Orange brown opaque pour with small but dense white foam. Aroma is a blast of tropical fruits, lots of pinneaples, mango and oranges. Also some of the distinctive cat pee and wet grass from Citra hops. Taste is also very fruity, some resin with definite bitterness without being over the top. Could have a little more carbonation. The perfect example of the fruity IIPA. 370 charactersLuk13, Sep 30, 2012

4.53/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a slightly hazed golden orange color with a massive soapy white head leaving tons of sticky white lacing along the glass..
The aromas begin amazingly fruity and hoppy, no surprise, with lots of blood orange, tangerine, pineapple and grapefruit. As it warms there is a light touch of sweet honey maltiness and maybe a hint of pine in there as well.
The tastes begin with a light bready/honey sweet pale matinees immediately met by a lot of hop fruitiness. Same hop flavors as the aroma with pineapple, tangerine, blood orange and some juicy mango that I didn't get in the aroma. Medium bitterness at first, with some residual sweetness, and then lingering hops.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation. The finish is a perfect balance of lingering moderate hop bitterness and juicy hop flavors. Dangerously drinkable, no alcohol detection what so ever except you can obvious tell with the thicker mouthfeel.
Overall I can say no wrong about this beer. It is a beautiful showcase of juicy hop flavors, not too bitter and resiny (or resiny at all for that matter). Great showcase of Citra and Amarillo citrusy hops in all their glory. I would have loved to have this like a week old as opposed to a month or so to really appreciate the hop showcase but this is just fine by me. 1,299 charactersclaspada, Sep 27, 2012

22oz bottle into a snifter
no born on date, acquired in a trade, presumably from the latest release
A big thanks goes out to Bonez05404 for sending this one over in a trade.
A:  Pours a slightly hazy golden amber with just under 1 fingers width of sea foam white colored head, which dissipates down fairly quickly to a thin film.  Leaves a fair amount of streaky, spotted lacing.  
S: Big citrus hop aromas, grapefruit, pineapple, and most notably orange.  A fair amount of dank, resinous pine.  A swirl of the snifter brings out more tropical fruits and some sweet malt aromas.     A touch of booze as well. Excellent. 
T: Somewhat muted up front with most of the flavors coming out in the backend.  Pine, orange rind, a good degree of bitterness, raw sugar sweetness. A hint of booze.  Not nearly the citrus characters on the taste as the nose implied, but more sugary sweetness.  Honestly could definitely be more hop heavy in my book.  Tasty, but somewhat disappointing.  
M/D:  Smooth, carbonation on the low end, but appropriate, medium bodied.  Drinkability is high, although its a touch boozy for a DIPA thats only 8%. Real nice mouthfeel though.  
O: Very good, but in my opinion nothing spectacular, and certainly not top 10 overall for all styles as the rating shows (although I say the same thing about Pliny).  I had high expectations that this would join my personal "big two" of Heady and Hopslam, but it falls way short of those expectations. Dont get me wrong, its quite an enjoyable beer, but to me its not worth the hype.  Maybe a case of limited availability equaling overrated?   1,635 characterszac16125, Sep 19, 2012

a - `deep murky orange brown with a massive off white chunky foamy ipa head. massive milk shake like chunks of lacing cling to the glass as the head goes away but the head never seems to really leave this beer. can't see light through this beer...kind of looks like some ripe tropical fruit in a glass. swirling the glass brings it all back to life.
s - OH MY! OH MY OH MY! mangos and grapefruits and magically delicious. pineapples. fresh and i mean FRESH ripe fruit. really just stunning. i'm literally drooling awaiting my first sip.
t - big and bold hop flavors. really something from another planet. lots of fresh ripe fruit. unreal flavor. grapefruit, pineapple, mango...tropical fruit hops.
m - full bodied and a bit chewy. perfect bitterness on the finish.
o - overall, pretty epic. is it the best double ipa out there? quite possibly, very reminiscent of heady topper. i'd need to have it in a side-by-side show down, but this one isn't readily available for my consumption needs. really juicy and simply an outrageous double ipa. my glass is emptying way too quick. what a treat! my wife was pretty blown away by it also...and she was equally bummed when i revealed to her the truth that this isn't one to get used to. thanks again, mike...i really appreciate this bottle. who knew (well i guess with 290 reviews...at least 290 people knew). 1,811 characterscosmicevan, Sep 10, 2012

bomber poured into tulip glass.
At long last, I get to try this EPIC beer! 
Appearance: golden bodied beer with 2 fingers of white head. spotty lacing. 
Smell: big juicy oranges. grapefruits and pine take a back seat to this nose of unrelenting oranges. really nice nose that you can smell while you are pouring the beer. 
Taste: moderate bitterness. Lots of citrus flavors. Touch of grapefruit very similiar to the nose. Nice pine notes as the supporting cast. Fresh, juicy, & green tasting hops. Tropical fruits with a touch of pineapple. 
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Well hidden ABV; drinks very easily. 
Overall: This DIPA does not quite live the hype it gets. Lawsons double sunshine is easily better and not as hard to get either. Orangey hops and its pretty drinkable are both positive attributes that I do enjoy about this DIPA. 969 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Sep 08, 2012

Huge citrus/grapefruit aroma! Stray pine in there.
Hops overpower malt, no doubt about it. Great citrusy hop bite at the end of sip, pithy orange. Super drinkable at 8%abv
Smooth mouthfeel, lower end of carbonation.
One of the best DIPAs out that. Having said that, it's almost too over the top with the amount of bitterness it brings to the table. Definitely worth seeking out! Thanks ArchEnemyBrew!! 510 charactersDuff27, Sep 08, 2012

The beer pours a golden amber color with good head retention and lacing. The nose on this bad boy is flat out fantastic, as I get considerable mango, canned peach, orange citrus and a boatload of pine. The flavor profile replicates the nose pretty closely, but isn't quite as intense. I pick up more pine and dry orange citrus on the palate, in a medium bodied to full bodied flavor package. The finish is long and bitter, though the bitterness is not over the top. Everything seemed well preportioned in this excellent, easy to drink DIPA, and I can see why it's so highly regarded. Excellent beer. 707 charactersJohn_M, Sep 05, 2012

S - Not as strong as I was hoping. However, what is there smells fantastic. It's just not one of those beers that you pop the cap on and the surrounding area immediately smells of hops. Definitely smell the Citra and Amarillo. Nice and fruity, definitely all about the hops like it says on the bottle. Nice and juicy.
T - Follows the smell well. Light caramel or some semi-sweet malt backbone to play off the juicy hops and accentuate them nicely. I really was hoping for more of a fruit juicy hop bomb. After having Zombie Dust, I was hoping this would be like that on steroids, but I really didn't find the taste much more hoppy. It almost just seemed like a heavier maltier version of ZD with an Amarillo kick.
M - Really nice. Coats the mouth. No alcohol presence. Impressively easy to drink. You can tell it is a well crafted beer.
O - Very impressive, but not a top 10 beer. If this was more of a hop bomb I'd love it. The sweet malt and juicy fruit hop profile is right up my alley, but I just don't think it really stands out or gives you a serious hop kick. A beer like Heady Topper or Abner would be my go to compared to this all the time. I really think the east coast (specifically rural Vermont, for some reason) is catching up to the world class west coast IPAs. Definitely seek this out, but it's not worth trading crazy things that you see in the ISO:FT forum. Trade for some Alpine or some Heady Topper before you trade away your cellar for this. 1,627 charactersnrs207, Sep 02, 2012

M: Light mouthfeel, perfect carbonation. Highly drinkable - almost in a bad way. I wish I could drink this all night.

Appearance: Pours a cloudy amber with an orangish hue. There is a half finger of off white head that leaves a thin layer on top of the pour.
Smell: Now we're talking. Juicy citrus hops with some tropical fruit notes. A touch of sweetness and some pine as well.
Taste: Just like the smell, full of juicy citrus peel hops. I'm getting some tropical fruit and some pine needles from the hops. Just a touch of malt sweetness, enough to balance things out, but the hops definitely do their thing. The finish is bitter with a hint of spice.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with fluffy carbonation and a somewhat dry finish.
Overall: This is a fantastic IPA. I was so glad to get to try it, and it was extremely fresh too. I would jump at the chance to get more. 844 charactersoline73, Aug 25, 2012

T - Just like the nose. Hopes, pine, citrus, malt all balanced together. Slight bitterness at the end.

O - All I can say is Wow! I have now had all the big three DIPAS (Pliny, Heady Topper & Citra).

Knowing how good this beer is I will definitely be trying to get more in the future. 822 charactersSkiBum22, May 17, 2012

A: Pours a golden straw/yellow that is slightly hazy. There is a pure white head that settles quickly along the top of the beer. There is a bit of lacing left as it drinks, but nothing out of the ordinary.
S: The nose is mild lemony citrus, and tropical fruits. It smells like a Caribbean farmers market. Very little malt, and no huge pine note to speak of.
T: The flavors in this beer are really nice. It has a crisp citrus bite right up front, but it transitions into delicious tropical notes (mango, pineapple, and guava). The finish is smooth and sweet. Very pleasant.
M: Medium to light bodied beer. It's crisp and refreshing. The flavors linger for a bit, and when they fade, this beer begs you to take another sip.
O: This beer is really well done. I don't think it deserves all of the hype and insane accolades that it's been given, but it's a solid beer. It's a great refreshing beer, and it stands with some of the better DIPAs, but it didn't completely blow me away. 1,044 characterstrxxpaxxs, May 08, 2012

A: Pours a transparent, golden honey color with a big fluffy white head that sticks around for a while. Some moderate lacing.
S: Tons of fresh citrus fruits, ripe grapefruit, mango, pineapple. This is all about bright, happy hops.
T: Of course it is very hoppy, but in such a great way. More of the ripe, juicy citrus fruits dazzle. There is almost no malt to this one, but it works out quite well.
M: Extremely smooth and medium-bodied, this drinks much closer to an excellent IPA than a double. Carbonation is nice and prickly. There is some light alcohol heat at the end, which surprised me.
O: Having reached triple digits in IPA ticks, I feel comfortable picking out the really excellent ones. This is one of those for me, primarily because it was just so hop dominant and yet somehow still balanced. I could easily drink 2 bombers in a row. 933 charactersdoucmehu, May 05, 2012

Today marks the last day of class in my law school career. I needed to celebrate with something special. Thank you Steven for sending me this one!
Score: 91
This bottle is from the March 23, 2012 release. Served in a Half Acre tulip and enjoyed on 05/02/12. Per Steven, this was stored in a fridge with set to a low/mid-30's temperature to help preserve its freshness.
Appearance: Pours a real nice golden orange color with two-plus fingers of foamy off-white head that slowly settles into a thin layer atop the glass. Very dense looking, and on the opaque side of translucent. Average lacing, good retention. 4/5
Smell: Lots of fresh tropical citrus in the nose. Pineapple, grapefruit, peach, mango, hoppy orange, lemon zest, and sweet-and-sour lemonade. Piney hops and fresh grass clipping. Incredible DIPA aroma. 4.5/5
Taste: You can tell the hops have fallen off a bit in the beer, but it still tastes good. Sweet tropical citrus upfront, counterbalanced by grassiness on back end. Upfront is zesty sweet-and-sour lemon, candied grapefruit, bitter orange rind, and pineapple juice. The back half is plenty juicy citrus as well, and mildly bitter on the linger with orange flavor to boot. The flavor profile is very similar to Heady Topper and Ghandi Bot, just "duller" and lacking any real bitter bite. 4/5
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and on the higher end of carbonation. Juicy mouthfeel. 4/5
Overall: A solid, but nothing spectacular DIPA. I have had fresher batches since the original review, and although the nose is always great, the taste lacks the punch I prefer in an IPA.
Recommendation: Worth drinking, but overhyped.
Cost: $8 for a 22 oz bottle. 1,757 charactersjegross2, May 03, 2012

S Hits u in the face from far even. Hypnotized. Wish there was a cologne this smell. Floral. Fruity. Hops are super active in the nose. Pineapple tropical smell
M amazing. So well balanced it's ridiculous. U can taste every thing in the same second. There is no stairstepping. Everything hits you right away and it is spectacular. Fruity pinapple hops light bitterness fading very quickly. Fruity not over sweet flavor lingers last. Very pleasing. The hops bite at just the right time. Subjective I'm sure. Just really like this dipa. Every thing seems to mesh so well. The fruity balance of the hops and sugar content all seem to compliment the amount of malt. 
O I've had this beer too many times and when it's not available I wonder if I was just in a good mood and overrated it. Yet every time we get it I love every second I spend. My favorite dipa for sure and I compare everything to it. Sorry if this is too ass kissy. It's just that good for me. I quote. I want to make ice blocks out of it and skate on it and then melt it in summer and drink it. Ok too far. I can say the first time I tried i felt like eh it's just another dipa no big deal but more tastings and comparing really do this beer justice 1,279 charactersBrodybeer, May 02, 2012

M: Perfect carbonation level along with a solid but clean malt profile that allows the hops to do their thing.

A - Extremely attractive pour. Typical for the style, but this one has a fantastic pure white head that sticks around for a while. Lacing is absolutely outstanding. Slightly hazy yellow/orange hue. 
S - Awesome fruit notes. Big pineapple, grapefruit, mango and orange. All hops in the aroma. 
T - I wish more accessible DIPA's tasted like this! Huge fruity hop notes. This beer needs to warm some to get the full bouquet of flavors. Big sweet pineapple and citrus. Mango all over the place. Towards the end the bread malts come through, but the bottle is correct, this beer is all about the hops. Total fruit-hop bomb, and I LOVE it. 
M - Outstanding job done in this department. Perfectly carbonated and has the consistency of a carbonated cask brew, if that makes any sense. Creamy, smooth and absolutely awesome. 
O - Extremely glad that I was able to source this bottle finally. For comparison, think of a day old batch of a less sweet Founders Double Trouble & Lagunitas Sucks. Fantastic beer. Shame I probably won't ever have it again. 1,112 charactersDevilsCups, Apr 23, 2012

M: medium body with medium to heavy carbonation make this beautiful and crisp, but it doesn't lack body. After a morning of working outside, it's exactly what I wanted. 
O: beautiful DIPA with no ill effects from the hops. All the bitterness and smell and flavor are there, but none of the extra cat pee, onion, or garlic that can be present.

4.45/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Pours a massive white head with heavy lacing and froth on the top of the glass. The body of this is very light, perhaps a little lighter than most DIPA's that I see, but it does look appealing.
S: Heavy Citrus, guava, pineapple and mango. Heavy pine scent followed by a decent malt aroma.
T: A heavily caramelized malt presence followed closely by heavy pine flavors. As I let it linger for a bit, I picked up the heavy mango and citrus flavors. Most of the flavors in here are very well balanced and smooth. There may be a bit of an astringent aftertaste that is slightly earthy. This is probably my only off flavor in here, but otherwise this is a very nice DIPA. 
M: Light to medium body for a DIPA. There are the caramelized flavors of a longer boil time in here, but not a huge caramel flavor presence. This is mostly pale malt flavor in body and could be a little heavier, but very enjoyable as it is.
O: I can definitely enjoy this, this is a great IPA. The citrus flavors are definitely there and very enjoyable, roasted sugars peeking their head out as you let it warm up. Recommended 1,100 charactersalpinebryant, Apr 21, 2012

4.75/5  rDev +4.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Updated review. After trying a fresh bottle, I realized my original review was of an older bottle. The hops were much more prevalent. Great flavor, great smell. I now understand the appeal of this beer completely. Overall a great beer that fully lived up to my expectations with the fresh bottle.
---
Original review of the older bottle:
Poured into a Dogfish Head Signature
A - Slightly hazy burnt orange/copper color. A nice white head that lingers for awhile, with a very faint lacing.
S - Lots of citrus going on here. Also some peach smells which was very unexpected.
T - I was a bit disappointed here. I was expecting a lot after talking with some other BAs about this beer. After recently drinking some Pliny, Hopslam, and Heady Topper, it was hard not comparing here. I felt that the hops were a bit muted compared to the others. It is nicely balanced, but I feel like it needed more. Maybe its an older bottle as there is no date on it?
M - Medium body that is smooth going down.
O - I can see the appeal here. There is a lot of potential, and it is a solid beer. I just feel that is didn't quite live up to my expectations. I really wonder how old this bottle was since I didn't purchase it in a store myself. 1,226 characterskif, Apr 18, 2012

grapefruit juice, pineapple juice, OJ, mangos, a bit of sweetened, dried tropical fruit medley. very little bitterness, tons of hop flavor. finishes with just pure tangy mango flavor.
medium body with fluffy carbonation and I swear to god you can feel citrus fruit pulp.
wow. I loved Just Outstanding, and this is one step better. Kern River is definitely one of the premier west coast IPA brewers, just based on my few experiences. 625 characterssilentjay, Apr 16, 2012
4.97/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Dan25D for sharing
A: Hop-hazed gold color with a frothy white cap. Excellent retention
S: You can smell this beer as soon as you open the cap. Massive tropical fruit (mango/pineapple) blasts your face. A touch of resin. Delicate yet sturdy malt background to balance. Perfect
T: Ahhh man, tons of tropical fruit and a light malt backing. Balanced perfectly for a dipa. Kind of similar to sculpin but with aore pungent hop attack 
MF: Smooth and velvety feel to it. Carbonation is low-medium and doesn't ruin the experience like other dipas have a tendency of doing. Alcohol is well hidden throughout
O: I absolutely love this beer. This is the benchmark of dipas in my opinion (move over Pliny) 714 charactersscottyshades, Apr 15, 2012

Poured into my CBS snifter...
A: An effervescent golden orange, practically glows in the glass. Huge, pillowy two finger white head. Settles down to a quarter finger of thick, gobby blobs. Very good lacing.
S: Well hello Citra hops! Like an orange creamsicle. Loads of orange zest, pineapple, and some tangerine. Also hints of caramel malt and quite a bit of candied spice. Love, love, love it.
T: Candied orange, caramel malt, grapefruit rind, pineapple. Starts off with fairly aggressive citrus hops, then the malt seeps in and evens things out. Finish is smooth, but another fresh blast of hop oils keeps things interesting. Most notable is how light this is for a DIPA. Hops are assertive, but more sweet and spicy than overwhelmingly bitter. 
M: This is the only part of the beer that doesn't quite stand up to the rest. Slightly thin and and lacking in complexity. Sweet and hoppy, but perhaps too smooth for its own good, especially for a DIPA.
O: Deserving of the hype. Didn't knock me off my feet right away, but over the entire experience, this greatly impressed me. One of the lightest and smoothest DIPAs I have had the pleasure of drinking. Without a trace of booze at 8.0%, this one is dangerously drinkable. Just a complete showcase for the Citra hop. Really like this. 1,353 characterssiege06nd, Apr 14, 2012

a - Pours a hazy dark orange-yellow color with two fingers of lightly off white head and moderate carbonation evident. Head lasts for two to three minutes and leaves a ton of frothy lacing on the glass.
s - Smells of citra hops, mangos, tropical fruits, fruity malts, light grapefruit, citrus, and pine hops. Really awesome nose; just a ton of citra hops and tropical fruits. Near perfect nose for a DIPA, I love it.
t - Tastes of citra hops, tropical fruits, mangos, peaches, floral hops, fruity malts, grapefruit, lemon, light pine hops. Taste is great as well. A little bit maltier then the nose though still a ton of hops too. Great taste, the nose was just perfect.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation. Some light bitterness but not much considering how hoppy it is. Very nice body.
o - Overall I thought this was an amazing DIPA; probably the best Citra DIPA I've had. The nose is perfect, and the taste is great too. Tons and tons of citra hops and tropical fruits, and not much bitterness in the taste at all. An Awesome beer I really love and would love to have again. Up there with Blind Pig, Heady Topper, and Pliny the Elder as one of the best DIPA's I've had. 1,368 charactersmdfb79, Apr 11, 2012

4.13/5  rDev -9.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5650 mL bottle poured into a pint glass. Thanks to iHEARTbeer247 for this bottle.
Appearance - Deep orange body. Cloudy with a big white head. Great sticky lacing and a nice layer of foam remains on the beer.
Smell - Hoppy. Clearly. Straight citrus hops with a bready malt in the back. It's really nice, but it's not complex like other great IPAs.
Taste - Yes, it's hoppy, but it's just citrus again. It's pretty damn good, but it's just not very interesting. If the other hop flavors were more prevalent, this could be fantastic. Anyway, the malt flavor is bready and just a touch sweet, but it still manages to be quite imposing on the palate. The flavor drops off abruptly at the end to a very slightly bitter finish.
Mouthfeel - It's crisp, but the hop flavor isn't sustained throughout the drink. Hoppy at first and malty in the back. The one-dimensionality of the hop profile makes it incredibly drinkable, but only because I want the hop flavor back.
Overall - Ok, so everything it has is great, but it doesn't rival the best out there. I'd take a Pliny or Heady Topper over this easily. I want the flavor to build, but it doesn't. If this beer wasn't hyped to hell, I'd be singing its praises. 1,205 charactersAlieniloquium, Apr 09, 2012

A: Burnt orange, big couple inches of white foamy head. A good amount of lacing to it as well throughout the drink.
S: Citrus, Orange, Lemon, a burst of tropical fruits. A slight malt/hop smell but its predominantly the citrus.
T: Yum.. Great taste of tropical fruits come through up front and a little of the hopiness on the backbone. Not boozy at all, very smooth.
M: Medium bodied, good amount of carbonation.. Very creamy DIPA - finishes clean and makes you want more.

T: the piney grassy hops were very good and had a good balance between the sweetness from the malts. It did have citrus, caramel, and pineapple flavor accents as well.
M: the brew was mediumin body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, piney grassy hoppy, mild fruity, and bitter bite finish.

A: Pours a perfect hazy orange color with a fluffy pure white head forming on the pour. The retention is out of this world and as the head slowly subsides it leaves huge, sticky sheets of lace behind. 
S: Pineapple flesh, sweet caramel malts, light grass and light lemon grass. Extremely balanced.
T: The taste follows the nose perfectly. Citrus pineapple and orange with a touch of lemon peel. Sweet caramel malts and light bitter hops on the finish.
M: This is the most drinkable DIPA I've ever had. So smooth and balanced. It drinks like water. Nice solid carbonation with a medium to light body.

A - Pours a cloudy golden orange color that looks great on this lovely Spring day. A two finger, slightly off white head settles down to a nice layer of bubbles that hang around until the end. 
S - It smells pretty close to what I expected from a beer named Citra. Almost like you're eating a fruit salad in a forest. A nice layer of pine to hold together the citrus and tropical fruit. The malt is there but the dry hopping really lets this one shine. 
T - Taste definitely follows the nose. Mango, pineapple, orange peel, and pine all glide over the tongue. You know the malt is there, but they did a great job of keeping it in the background and letting the hops take over. Finishes a little dry, slightly bitter. 
M - Medium body, nice carbonation, this is exactly the feel I look for in a DIPA. Each sips leaves you wanting another taste. 
O - I was definitely impressed with this beer, great job KRBC!! I would have include this with the likes of my other favorite DIPAs. I wish it was a little easier to come by.

Review #500
A: Cloudy sunset amber-golden. A careful pour yields a killer three finger off-white head that never really fades. The lacing here is off the charts, just gobs of sticky goodness cling to the walls of the glass. Simply gorgeous.
S: Pure citra delight. It's overflowing with mango, grapefruit and tropical juicy delights. As it warms a bit, the clean malt becomes a bit more evident, yet it's in absolute harmony with the hop oil.
T: Just spectacular. The balance is perfect. The luscious and juicy nature of the citra hops is met with and paired beautifully with the biting nature of the amarillo hop oil. The golden malt is masterfully placed. It runs down the spine of the beer, giving it weight and purpose. I can't state enough just how attuned everything is here.
M: I can't say I've encountered a hop forward beer that feels this thick and rich. It almost has the feel of fresh motor oil. It's creamy and dense, yet at no point does it become too much. Approachable as a $100 bill blowing in the breeze.
O: As the label says, "This beer is all about the hops." Damn right. This may very well be the best hop forward beer, let alone Double IPA I've ever consumed. Everything here is pitch perfect, not a flaw in sight. Worthy of it's cult status, and one I plan on tracking down every time it's released.
My highest recommendation. 1,488 charactersRhettroactive, Apr 03, 2012

Pours a cloudy pale straw color with a decent amount of head with great retention and lacing. Aroma starts and ends with hops. Oily, piney, earthy, woodsy. Very strong. Taste is super hoppy from the get go. Similar to aroma: oily, piney. I don't really get much malt from this, but then again the malt doesn't get in the way either. It does its job in supporting the flavor and mouthfeel of the beer. Maybe a good DIPA's malt should be looked at as good service in a restaurant: it was great if you don't notice it. Mouthfeel is balanced with a dry aftertaste.
This is one I've heard about and looked forward to. Another great beer with hype lives up to its reputation. I wrote several notes at the DIPA Fest and some of them were getting silly. My review ends with "Want in bottle." I think that speaks for itself. Now to make a trek to Kern County for some of this deliciousness. 946 charactersPhilousa, Feb 18, 2012

T - Reflects the nose with loads of ripe fruit (all the ones indicated above). A slight resin/floral flavor is hidden away in the fruit as well. A kick of bitterness toward the finish but it is balanced nicely with the bready malt and sweet fruit.
M - Medium body with above average carbonation. Fairly lively and zesty feel.
D - Loads of hoppy goodness and fruits make this very drinkable. Alcohol is very well hidden. Maybe a little strong on the bitterness but this was a very fresh bottle.

S- Big pungent citrus and tropical fruit aroma. Ripe mango, pineapple, apricot, peach are the front runners followed by some bready malts and a little touch of alcohol. One of the best smelling beers I have had.

From the Thanksgiving 2011 bottling.
Tasted on 12-05-2011.
Poured into a tulip glass from a 22oz bottle.
A – Pours a very nice and cloudy slight golden color almost like peach. The head is huge. About 2 inches tall with some nice white dense bubbles. There is some awesome sticky lacing. It recedes ever so slowly to a nice fluffy mat. Perfection in the look for sure. (5.0)
S – OMG. This is everything I’ve hoped for in a DIPA. Starts off with some juicy and exquisite tangerine, some mango notes and some slight orange peel. Peach is DEFINITELY present. Amazing! There is some delicious tropical fruit sweetness mixed in with the slight citric sweetness of the Citra hops. The background of the nose definitely has some nice toasty, bready biscuit malt notes that just help to bring the hops juice to the forefront. There is some slight hop resin but not enough to call it piney as other more East Coast IPAs. This is definitely from the other coast. (5.0)
T & M – Wow!! This is amazing! First off this has to be up there with the best DIPAS hands down. Starts off with some nice citrus hop notes mixed in with some delicious tropical fruit notes. Flavors of slight grapefruit, some orange as well as apricot and peach are extremely delicious and very well crafted. These sweet tropical flavors mix in so well with the acidic citrus notes and the hop bitterness is at a perfect level and intensity. Not to dry or aggressive but just enough to get this hop-head satisfied. This is truly a gem. Reminds me a lot of FFF Dreadnaught IPA, Bells HopSlam and dare I say PtE. In all honesty this is my favorite DIPA up there with Abrasive from Surly. Beneath that hop deliciousness there is a nice strong malt backbone. There are bread notes as well as some toasty and earthy grain notes beneath the tropical hop flavors. I can’t quit raving about this beer to my GF as she sits here and laughs at me. This is truly a perfectly balanced DIPA. The back end of the beer has some nice dry bitterness and bready aftertaste with some nice final hints of that tropical hop juice. The beers mouthfeel is perfect as well. Very nicely carbonated with just enough refreshing bubbles and a slightly oily yet easy to approach body. (5.0) (5.0)
O – What can I say that hasn’t been said before? This to me could be the Pliny killer. It is delicious and balanced but it is also fraught with flavor and intensity. Perfectly crafted brew. (5.0) 2,462 charactersJoEBoBpr, Jan 19, 2012
4.89/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Ap - Very nice darkish-orange color. Head was thin but high and dropped down to about the width of a pinkie. Carbonated well, good lacing. 
Ar - Incredible. Subtle tones throughout and very fruity but not at all overpowering. I let it open up for a few minutes and smelled it again. I want this scent as my car air-freshener, that's how I'd sum it up. 
T - Off the charts. Sweet at first with bitterness from hops that is almost a bit tart but quickly overtaken again by the hoppy sweetness. Finishes as smooth as any beer I've had and invites another sip. 
M - Body was a just a bit thin for my typical tastes, however, the flavor made up for it by a longshot. The medium body simply makes this one more "drinkable" as I wouldn't restrain myself to just one! 
O - Outstanding. Just one heck of a great beer.

A- The body of the beer is a hazy orange coloration. Thick biege head rides the top of the beer. The head lasted throughout the quick disappearance of this beer. 
S- Just awesome! This beer delivered one of the best hop fruit aromas I have ever experienced. Lots of grapefruit, pineapple, mangoes, papayas and fruit zest combine with resinous pine. Supporting the hops is a mild sweet caramel maltyness.
T- A perfect mirror of the aroma. This beer is all about the hops. In short this beer is fantastic!
M- The body of the beer is medium with moderate carbonation. Not a hint of alcohol in the mouth. 
O- This beer is hop loving in a bottle. Dam near perfect beer drinking experience. 829 charactersnlmartin, Jan 07, 2012

Good carbonation, nice lacing and you can see a little alcohol clinging to the side of the glass.
A - Beautiful tropical fruit like hop aroma. Heavy on pineapple, mango, orange, and peach aromas. Light on the malt, and bready aromas. I can't pick up any alcohol in the aroma.
T - WOW, very nice. Starts out with a subtle malt sweetness that is quickly trumped by an outstanding hop bitterness. The bitterness lingers throughout, but there is also a wonderful candy like sweetness that helps to balance out the bitterness. Refreshing and very drinkable. The finish is dry and you can not detect any alcohol whatsoever. Awesome stuff!

A~ Hazy medium orange/burnt glow color with a two finger off-white head formed and receded to about a half inch with good retention. Excellent lacing the entire pour. 
S~ The Grapefruit and floral are heavy up front. Fresh fruits of all variety along with some pine and sweetness compliment the complex aroma and keep you diving into this sweet nectar. The hops are fresh, wonderful smell. 
T~ Bang! Juicy hops and sweet floral notes are very big. Grapefruit and orange are the dominant the beer throughout, with a hint of a malt afterthought. 
M~ Medium to light. Fresh feeling. 
O~ This is my new favorite Double IPA, I cannot think of a beer with more drinkability. The beer is so good, I found myself having to slow down os I could finish the review. Beer this fresh and floral is what makes me like craft beer. This is a 10 out of 10 in my book! 966 charactersUNCCTDawg, Jan 04, 2012

S - I can't really describe this aroma as nothing short of amazing! Pure ripe citrus rinds: oranges, mango, papaya, pineapple, and grapefruit. Very juicy and overripe tropical fruit at its finest. One of the BEST noses I've experienced in a beer in a very LONG time!!!
T - Surprisingly different than the nose which I expected more of a fruity, sweet bitterness which is dominated by ultra big bitter grapefruit, and light caramel malt underneath. The tongue is met with sweet tropical fruit for a brief moment before the grapefruit comes rolling down the tracks like a giant freight train. The tidal wave calms down towards the end (ever so slightly) and allows the fruit to surface...just barely. Is a little boozy as well.
M - Big medium body with boozy warming.

Aromas of fresh hops, oranges, and mango. In solidarity with the description on the label, pineapple too. Damn, a lot of damn citrus in there - like first *whiffing* an orange then a mango. Refreshing as all heck, though the intensity is lacking somewhat. 
A complex cacophony of sweet oranges, bitter grapefruit, and wonderful baked malts all across the palate. The Citra hops are amazing: just juicy and oily and peachy. The Amarillo is present just enough to blend well with the malts but this is a dessert IPA all the way, with a pairing I cannot for the life of me establish as appropriate. Methinks something to contrast it, as it’s amongst the sweetest I’ve had (barring Bell's Hopslam). 
Mouthfeel is light to medium-bodied, soft on the tongue. 
Overall, bittersweet in the best way possible - Citra’s reputation proceeds itself. Knocking out a bomber solo was no tedious task considering how fresh and fruity it all went down. 
Frankly, this rivals Alpine’s Nelson in terms of complexity, innovation, and satiation. Just outstanding (hmmm, that’s another good one from KRBC). 1,326 charactersjminsc76, Dec 26, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my Stone imperial Glass. Unfiltered, dark, caramely orange, ish ....able. Two finger head settles nicely after a few minutes, leaving sticky sheets of bright white lace.
Smell is really green, leafy, freshly picked, citra hops. The malt bill is also at the forefront. Very sweet smelling beer. I can't wait to imbibe.
Taste...is...well...de...wait for it...lightful. Delightful. Honey soaked hop cone. I believe I used that same description for Abrasive, and although they are not the same, it still is a very good description of Citra. 
Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. Nicely carbonated. The bubbles sort of dance on my tongue. Full bodied, but not cloyingly syrupy. Bright, refreshing, etc.
I have honestly had a really good week of drinking great DIPAs. Heady Topper, Abrasive, Pliny the Elder, to name a few. This beer is right up there with all three of those. I still put Abrasive at the top of my DIPA list, but this would probably have to be a close second. Great beer. Thanks to Tucson25 for sending me this fantastic brew. 1,052 charactersazdback, Dec 26, 2011

A - Poured a hazy medium orange colour with a slight yellow glow around the edges of the glass. Two fingers of thick off-white head formed and receded to about a half inch with good retention. Good lacing. 
S - Huge grapefruit aroma up front. Fresh pineapple and tangerine, peach and mango aromas along with some pine compliment the grapefruit. The hops aromas are so fresh, complex and pungent. A slightly sweet caramel malt backbone is present to provide a bit of balance. 
T - Huge bitterness up front. The big juicy hop aroma from the nose is more subdued in the palate but the flavours are still there and are fresh. Grapefruit, pineapple and orange zeat are the dominant flaovurs along with some pine. The malt bill provides the slightest sweet caramel backbone but there is no question that this is a hop bomb. 
M - Medium body with a nice chew and light carbonation. Sticky hop oils coat the tongue. 
O - A remarkable DIPA, but not the 5/5 I was hoping for. 1,060 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Dec 25, 2011

Very complex aroma. Loads of tropical fruits are present. Mango, papaya pineapple also some citrus, but it also has some subtle floral and pine scents as well.
Flavor follows the nose. This is fantastically complex. Starts out with bright citrus and floral flavors. Finishes bitter, piney and dry like a lot of DIPA's, but there is a unique tropical fruit sweetness lurking beneath the onslaught of pine.
Mouthfeel is moderately creamy with good carbonation levels.
This beer is everything it's cracked up to be. I'd like to try this ZD and PtE side by side to see sometime, but I loved this and the bottle went away much too quickly. 695 charactersjmarsh123, Dec 22, 2011

A: Single fingered head that displayed decent retention and solid lacing. It fades into a thin white film that remains throughout the tasting atop this cloudy unfiltered masterpiece.
S: Mango, papaya, oranges, accompanied by floral and pine notes. Scents are potent and wonderful.
T: Tropical fruits are present, but grapefruit flavors poke through and surprised me due to my inability to detect them in the scent. The strong hop profile is balanced perfectly with candied malts. So well balanced!

4.54/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5I had the opportunity to try this beer at GABF, and much to my dismay, was extremely underwhelmed. This couldn't have been the Citra that everybody has been raving about.. so I decided to chalk it up to a botched batch, server error, oxidation... whatever. A few months later I was able to track down a fresh bottle from my local shop.
Appearance was solid. Standard color with an exceptional, white, lacey head. Smell was hands down the best combination of hop aroma I've experienced in a beer to date. Huge amounts of grapefruit, citrus, pine and resin. Taste followed suit from start to finish. Bitterness was perfectly balanced by an appropriate malt backbone. Finished slightly sweet and dry. 
All hype aside, this is arguably the best IPA I've had thus far. Beautifully balanced and free of flaws from beginning to end. Thoroughly looking forward to trying in the future. 
For those of you who have yet to try this beer, add it to your wants. A fresh bottle is well worth the trade IMHO. 996 characterscrvcac, Dec 19, 2011

Bottle into a snifter.
A: Burnished golden orange with two fingers of white sea foam. Retention is very good and lacing is scattered on the glass.
S: The hops are bright and fresh, imparting notes of peach, mango, orange, tangerine, and grapefruit. It smells absolutely excellent. Passion fruit is pretty strong. Malt is faint and crackery, and there's a restrained floral bouquet.
T: Juicy orange and tangerine blend with peach and a little bit of drier citrus rind notes. Malt is a shadow. This is just bursting with hop flavor. Grapefruit meets mango, mandarin orange, and guava. This is delicious. The beer is moderately bitter and the amount of hop flavor backing it up is comical.
M: Upper light in body with upper medium carbonation. The mouthfeel is dry and sticky.
Overall: Just a pleasure to drink. Amazing. I wish I had a growler of this in front of me. Hah! Think big, I always say! Why not two growlers in front of me? 948 charactersHopHead84, Dec 18, 2011

Pours a hazy dark gold/orange with a finger and a half of foamy white head. The aroma is very strong, a lot of fruits (pineapple, citrus, mango) along with some pine notes. The taste is very much like the great aroma, a lot of tropical fruits and some complimenting malt characteristics. The mouthfeel is medium-light bodied and crisp, an easy drinker for sure, but the lack of bitterness and the fact that it was lacking complexity in the finish was a bit of a letdown.

Pours a murky honey orange with a huge 3 inch puffy tan head that packs down into a dense island of foam. Thick chunks of lace randomly line the glass on the drink down. Smell is incredible with lots of tropical fruit, peach, apricot, mango, and some citrus zest. Taste is of sweet malt, tropical fruit, peach/apricot, and mango. There is a slightly assertive citrus zest hop bitterness that lingers on the palate after each sip. This beer has a lower level of carbonation with a light crispness and a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, this is a fantastic DIPA with the wonderful tropical fruit aromas and flavors I have come to love in hoppy beers. I am very glad I got to try this one as I had absolutely no luck getting a bottle myself. 861 charactersUCLABrewN84, Dec 13, 2011

A: Pours clear, bright golden with two fingers of off white head. Some splotches of lacing and good retention which leaves a thin film throughout the entire pour.
S: Phenomenal citrus (orange, lemon) and tropical (pineapple, mango) aromas. A really unique spritzy lemon or something which gives it a great brightness. Some supporting caramel malt which blends beautifully with the forward hops. Really unique, and one of the best smelling IPAs I've had.
T: Similar, with a little floral pine on mid-palate, again with a sizeable dose of supporting caramel malt and some bitterness on the finish.
M: Medium body and light carbonation which makes it super smooth. Reminds me of their 5th Anniversary in terms of really low carbonation, which leads to better sessionability but only a little crispness.
O: World class. This is a big, juicy van of an DIPA. 907 characterspmarlowe, Dec 12, 2011

N- Huge bitter grapefruit aromas with elements of the rind, pith, and flesh. Juicy citrus accents with soft pineapple and tropical fruit gummy bears underneath. Just a hint of toasted grain way in the back. Floral, herbal fumes start to appear as the beer warms.
T- Clean, sweet toasted grain provides a thick base for the hoppy goodness that ensues. A firm bitterness cuts the sweet malt with notes of herbs, grass, pine resin, and grapefruit rind. Dry biscuity malt emerges from the bitterness, while juicy citrus and tropical fruit keep the mouth watering through the mid palate. The finish is long and fairly dry with lingering grain and a lasting grassy, herbal, piney bitterness that leaves you with fresh hop breath.
M- Medium to full bodied, slightly syrupy and sticky. Moderate carbonation and a semidry finish.
D- Overall, a solid DIPA. I much prefer the bottle version of this to the growler. Always a treat to have, and I look forward to the next batch if I can't get my hands on any more this round. 1,137 charactersKevinBrewer, Dec 09, 2011

Poured into a Bruery snifter.
A - Really nice golden color with an awesome soapy, bright white head on top. Nice lacing as well.
S - smells of delicious garlic, some cat piss, fresh cut grass.... basically it's a bold, bright, fresh citra BOMB! Really nice.
T - as the nose predicted but 50x more intense and delicious. Bitter hops, malty balance, and all the citra you can handle. It's about 10 degrees out right now but it's spring time in this glass. Really awesome. 
M - extremely smooth considering the nice bite this has. Creamy and the perfect amount of body as it goes down.

S- Not overly fragrant which surprised me. I have been opening some nose bombs lately but I walked a couple laps around my kitchen with my nose in it. What aroma there is hits me pleasantly. I smell the warm citra hops. A little honey back, some pineapple.
T- Very, very good. I think the label is misleading. This is not like chewing on a hopvine. There are others out there for that, instead Citra is very balanced. I don't know how fresh mine is, mind you but the flavors are all there. Pineapple, lemon, grapefruit, mango, I think the fact that sweet, sugar forward fruit is detectable is evidence of balance.
M- This is where it stands out. BONE dry. Which is how I like it. Finish is the cleanest I have ever tasted. Nice carbonation.
O- This thing is a legend, I had high expectations and they were met. It wasn't a blow my face off this is the best beer I have ever had reaction. But a damn this is one of the better beers I have had reaction. 1,086 charactersNachojon, Dec 07, 2011

To be honest I was sure this was just going to be another really good DIPA that gets the uber hype so associated with anything made in limited supply that is equally very well made, in my wine world it is the Screaming Eagles, Schraders and SQN'S. To my pleasant surprise this is the Schrader of the craft beer world. The first thing that told me this was special was the nose, huge hoppy, all stinky and sweet, simply amazing. The color is a nice clear golden yellow with a medium head with nice lacing as I drink down. The flavor profile is awesome, sweet tropical fruit, loads of grapefruit,crushed orange peel and a oyster shell mineralality underline the overall package. The mouth feel is unlike any other, tangy carbonation that leaves bone dry and ready for another quaff. I am so glad I finally was able to taste this beer. And I will say it is worth every bit the well deserved hype it gets. 996 charactersOTB, Dec 03, 2011

4.82/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally got my hands on this one, a fresh bottle from the Thanksgiving release. It pours a really fantastic honey straw color, hints of amber, hints of goldenrod with an aggressive 3 fingers of soapy head on top. This guy sports some wicked lacing and a nice layer of soapy head sits atop the entire way down, very impressed at first glance. The smell is overwhelming, an insane amount of dank hops hit the nose, grapefruit, orange zest, pineapple, some bubble gum all play a role, but none crowd the other out and a nice soft grain straw aroma seals the deal, just enough to remind you there IS malt in this. Nice bitter kick of hops on the tongue, earthier than the nose leads on, resinous pine, some sappy flavors, but it doesn't let you forget the citrus, big grapefruit and zesty acidic flavors come to the show, a hint of biscuit, but it's nothing more than the faintest of counterbalances. It really pushes the envelope of hoppiness, Pliny the Elder does a great job of having that mad hoppy thing going for it, but it reigns them in exceptionally well, this reminds me more of Hop Riot in the sense that it's just overwhelmingly hopped, but Citra sets itself apart from all challengers with the perfect balance of flavors and remains quite drinkable. It's got a nice body, a bit soapy from the head, but overall, really nice, not too big and chewy and nowhere near too thing.
Verdict: Breathtaking. I don't even care to have the conversation of Pliny vs Citra vs Heady Topper or anything. I just want to sit down, and drink this bad boy, and let that be it. It's exceptionally crafted, and masterfully balanced, the malt is just enough to keep the hops in check, but they are in full force, and I'm loving it. 1,718 characterskevanb, Dec 02, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +5.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from the bottle (batch released on 11/25/11) into tulip.
Pours an amber/orange/peach color, semi-cloudy with a white dense two finger head which dissipates into a thin layer of foam on the surface. Lacing is sticky and slow to drip. It's not as clear as some other beers but I happen to like that.
Smell is incredible with this beer. Huge citrus notes from sweet valencia orange, light manila mango, to mandarin orange. Faint whiff of alcohol that's predominantly masked by the sweet citrus. What a joy to smell.
The taste is filled with lemon peel, mandarin orange, with a bright and dry bitterness that's somewhat reminiscent of over-steeped green tea. Bright floral notes dance with the citrus. 
Mouthfeel is crisp without being too carbonated. There's no shortage of bubbles but you're not inundated with that harsh finish in the throat that plagues some beers of this type.
I feel like such a homer writing this review because my score suggests it, but I'm truly trying to be objective about this beer. I'm trying to find chinks in the armor, so to speak, but I really can't find any. If i were to find a flaw, it would probably speak more about my taste preferences than the beer itself. I love this beer for what it is, an amazing, peerless citrus bomb. 1,273 charactersgrilledsquid, Dec 01, 2011

A- Copper-orange with a full, one finger, white head that lasted throughout and left a sticky lacing behind. Light penetration was complete.
S- Fruity: citrus, grapefruit, and mango. 
T- Slightly bitter with the full range of the fruits present in the aroma.
M- Medium with ample carbonation.
O- Honestly, I wasn't sure if it would live up to the hype, but it did! The only disappointment I have is that I couldn't get two bottles. 563 charactersUngertaker, Nov 07, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522oz bomber poured into SA glass. No bottle dating.
Honey-orange, clear liquid, one-finger white, fluffy head.
Fine hoppy fragrance of citrus, grapefruit, lemon, mango. Fantastic.
The aroma is true as the first sip reveals a wonderful hop experience. Smooth bitterness full of mango, lemon/lime and grapefruit envelopes the taste buds like a velvet glove. Tingling, fruity hop bitterness lingers. Not bitter, but smooth.
Medium body, nicely carbonated. Nothing to complain about.
This one is a winner throughout. The alcohol is well hidden and the Citra hops explode. These hops are becoming my favorite as they impart such a citrus, fruity flavor, reminding me of growing up in Ft Lauderdale and the abundance of enjoyable fresh tropical fruits in my backyard. 766 charactersCaptCleveland, Oct 30, 2011
4.05/5  rDev -11.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422oz bottle courtesy of oach. Notes from a month ago
A: Slightly burnt orange, fully translucent. 1 finger white head, retained well throughout the glass. Decent thin lacing
S: Definitely loaded with citra hops. Orange and mango burst forth. Accompanied by a light amount of scallion and bread crust
T: Same as the nose. Juicy citrus fruit - oranges, pineapple and mango. Thankfully, there is less scallion in the taste. Somewhat balanced with some lightly toasted bread
M: Medium bodied, slightly bitter. What I particularly enjoyed about this was it didn't your typical IPA "burn" for the palate
D: Glad to have finally tried this one, but can't say it lived up to level people put it at. Would drink again, but doubt I'd trade for it considering what people ask for 773 charactersBrez07, Oct 23, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had on tap at 38 Degrees Ale House in Alhambra, CA, during LA Beer Week.
A: Golden and cloudy with some lacing and pale foam. Good head retention.
S: Massive fruit. Pear, grapefruit, mango, with a backing of piney spruce, sweet malt and alcoholic astringency. 
T: A powerful, robust palette of flavors that closely matches the nose. Mango and grapefruit are front and center, with sweet Citra and Amarillo hops dominating the flavor of the beer. A lingering evergreen aftertaste. Extraordinarily balanced with a toasted malt backing. Unbelievably refreshing and drinkable, with negligible alcoholic heat. 
M: The dense and chewy body is wholly appropriate for how huge this beer is.
O: It's rare that I use this word to describe a beer, but "masterful" is apt. This is the single best DIPA I've ever tasted. It's even smoother and more robust than Pliny the Elder, and it outclasses virtually every American Double I've ever had, including HopSlam or 120 Minute.
I don't know how this bottles, but on draught, it was an absolute pleasure to drink. It's shame that this beer is so rare, otherwise it would be my go-to DIPA. 1,128 characterssugarbrew, Oct 23, 2011

A: Almost clear dark yellow-orange in color. Forms a nice, big, fluffy, barely off-white head that leaves some sheets of lacing on the way down. 
S: Unsurprisingly full of citrus and tropical fruits. Mango and passionfruit dominate, with notes of orange, pineapple, and a little caramel malt. Smells juicy. 
T: Tastes much like the aroma. Starts with a light, juicy sweetness. Then lots of tropical fruit: passionfruit, mango, orange, tangerine, and mango. There is a very mild caramel malt backbone. Finishes with a surprisingly mild bitterness. 
M: Medium body with appropriate carbonation. Smooth, slick, and a little chewy. Bitterness is less than one would expect on a DIPA. 
O: A very good beer. Just packed full of Citra aroma and flavor, this beer needs to warm just a little to be fully appreciated. An appreciated it was. 879 charactersFlorida9, Oct 22, 2011

Poured into a tulip glass from a 22oz bomber
A: pours a nice deep golden color, with about a 1 inch head. Persistent head tightly packed bubble, get bigger toward the middle of the glass
S: Tropical fruits, mango, pineapple, guava, with the citrus fruits such as lemon, lime, orange, grapefruit fighting for the dominant aroma.
T: grapefruit rind, orange peel, pineapple, with very little malt character in the background. the taste is crisp and dry, unlike many double ipas on the market that leave a cloying sweetness in the tast. definetly has a bitter not sweet finish
M: med to light body, with a refreshing dryness. 
as the taste is swished in my mouth it almost dissapears into a cotton candy like mouthfeel. 
O: this beer was definetly worth the wait. it reminds me alot of the profile of alpine ipas, hop profile that smacks you right on the face with a bouquet of citrus and tropical aromas and flavors, without the sweetness and more of the bitter not sweet taste and body. great beer 1,066 charactersxraided81, Oct 07, 2011

Beautiful citrus aroma. Fresh mango, some orange and pine too. Just fresh, juicy, and lush. 
Taste definitely has citrus, but there's more mango sweetness than citrus pungency. Good pine presence. More malt too, as the beer warms. Not as big on hops as many of the great dipas, but it contends with them.

4.8/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Glad to have finally tried a beer that has been on my wish list for so long. This was made possible when Kern River finally decided to bottle this great beer. Pours a hazy gold/copper-orange-amber body. Large, off-white head formed from a sizable stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. Good retention holds the head up for a few minutes before crashing to a nice skim and a well-defined ring. Nice coating of lacing. Aroma picked up some tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, grapefruit and orange dominate up front. A nice resinous quality. Some zesty spice. Tons of hops, but a sizable malt base. Like the nose there are massive doses of hops and malt here in the flavor profile. The hops are pronounced with mango and grapefruit separating themselves from the rest of the citric notes. Creamy, medium body with good rolling carbonation. Resinous and oily. Solid bitterness throughout culminating with a nice aggressive floral bite. 948 charactersCuriousMonk, Oct 02, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Smells mainly of citrus--mango, orange with pine in the background. First smell was very promising. 
One finger head that largely disappeared to islands of light foam with a ring around the glass. Mild lacing.
More malt and pine in the taste but the citrus is still well represented. It certainly has a nice, oily, juicy hop character that makes me want to keep drinking. Though, five minutes after I wrote the last sentence, the malt is more apparent. 
Overall: This is a very good dipa. I immediately compare it to other dipas that I like better, namely Pliny, maybe Hopslam. It falls in line with those beers but is not superior. Worth having but not worth breaking the bank to obtain. 691 charactersBowman2001, Sep 30, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Review from notes. Big thanks to Shane for sharing this bottle with me!
A: Pours a slightly hazy golden color with one finger of white head on top. Has nice retention and leaves behind some nice lacing. 
S: Tons of citrus and tropical fruits. Tons of pineapple, mango, and orange. There is a little bit of caramel malt, but very faint. Not much pine or malt, just straight juicy fruit. Extremely fresh and inviting. 
T: Similar to the aroma in that there is a tropical fruit explosion right away. Lots of citrus, pineapple, mango, tangerine, orange, and some grass. There is a bitterness in the middle that I felt in my jaw, but it has a very smooth finish with very little lingering bitterness. 
M: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Drinks very smooth with a slightly dry finish, but not overly bitter at all. 
O: Incredibly drinkable, there is no sign of the 8% abv whatsoever. The flavors are intense and amazing, and it doesn't have the bitterness that most West Coast DIPAs do. One of the best beers I have had period. 1,033 charactersmdaschaf, Sep 29, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +5.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5From tap to tulip glass
A: Light apricot in color with a chilled haze. Forms a pillowy head, tightly bubbled, leaving little patches of lacing everywhere. Creates a really unique and beautiful cascading effect down the side of the glass
S: Likely where Kern River derived the title, aside from the eponymous hop, the nose carries a huge bouquet of fresh citrus; orange and grapefruit prominent. Vibrant hoppy pine joins the mix backed by honey-sweet malts. 
T: A bit more hop-forward than the nose, fresh piny bitterness jumps out front. The fruity, acetic citrus tones are right there, but they're nearly neutralized by the perfectly balanced malts. Lemon-pepper, orange rind, green tea are noted. Alcohol is nowhere to be found. Finishes as it starts, citrusy, bitter, sweet.
M: Lighter bodied than expected and nicely carbonated. Leaves little residue between each sip
I was a huge fan of Just Outstanding when it came out (probably my favorite "single" IPA) - this raises the bar. Tastes like Pliny the Elder with just a bit more lemon-citrus. I guess there was some legal issue with their label, which is now approved, which held up their production? Whatever the reasons, please make more! 1,200 charactersrand, Sep 28, 2011

Pours light golden copper with an extremely retentive, creamy head. Thick sheets of lacing. Overwhelming, intense aroma of fruit; mango, pineapple, peach and orange fairly sweet, light floral hops and a strong amount of malt present as well. Flavor starts off smooth, sweet and balanced. Pineapple and mango dominate as the citra hop flourishes with a smoother and stronger malt body than expected. Finish is dry, but not excessively bitter with a slightly more floral hop taste. Only knock on this sample is the mouthfeel which is slightly thinner than expected and watery in the finish. Otherwise, exceptional and happy to finally try a proper sample. 852 charactersyourefragile, Sep 24, 2011

4.57/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Finally! I get to try this one! Pours a slightly hazy, golden orange color with a large white head that diminishes quickly. Scent is AMAZING! Extremely hoppy with a ton of citrus aroma and pine. Maybe a bit of tropical fruits as well. Such a pleasant smell. Taste is initially hoppy as hell with lovely grapefruit and orange flavors. A bit of melon and pineapple mixed nicely with hop resin and pine needles. Amazing west coast taste. Mouthfeel is full bodied and well carbonated. A little on the sticky side, but not overdone. Drinkability is very high. Overall, this is a wonderful DIPA that I wish I had more of. The Whole Foods in Valencia only let me purchase one bottle, and I couldn't find anymore anywhere in LA. I would love to do a side by side with some Pliny. 771 charactersDovaliHops, Sep 20, 2011
4.64/5  rDev +1.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Big thanks to splax23 for forwarding on this bottle in a recent trade, jazzed to try another beer from Kern. 22 oz. bottle split with my wife.
Pour is clean, refined, filtered, yellow, orange. But the best part of the pour was popping the cap & getting sludged with the beautiful smell that rolled out of the bottle like a warm front in January. Damn. Brilliant tropical fruit hops in the nose, pineapple & mango rising. One of the best smelling hoppy brews ever. 
If Kern River Citra tasted as good as it smelled it might be sitting at the right hand of God. It doesn't. The heavenly tropics give way to sub-heavenly cut with a heavy dose of citrus. Mango & pineapple again. Hop bitterness flows into the middle after the fruitiness, balancing it nicely. Sparse caramel malt, then the beer is just gone. Unbelievably clean finish with only a faint linger of hops. Wild. Luscious. Could have drunk this bomber by myself, the next one I get I'll hide from my wife (just kidding sweetie!). 
Citra didn't disappoint, this is a top-shelf IIPA. 1,042 charactersmaximum12, Sep 20, 2011
4.09/5  rDev -10.3%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to DarthKostrizer for this timely bottle! 22oz brown glass pry-top. No date.
Pours a little darker than I was expecting. Guess I'm just getting used to the super pale VT IPA's. A warm golden amber with 1.5 inches of off-white head that has great retention.
Nose smells like peaches straight out of the gate...then mango and lovely blood oranges. "Warm" citruses perhaps (as opposed to "sharp"). The suggested pineapple note comes out too. Very tropical.
Palate is clean but not quite crisp. There's a honeysuckle-like malt character underneath all the flavors that carry over from the nose. Mango, papaya and pineapple are all big on the front and mid-palate then things move towards citrus and grassy notes on the finish.
Notes: Well, the color belies this beers tropical intensity. It's never aggressive, but always impressive. A lovely West Coast single varietal DIPA. FFO Hill Farmstead Double Citra or Double Galaxy. 932 charactersSFLpunk, Sep 19, 2011

A - Attractive gold color with a fluffy white 2 finger head. Nice lacing and retention throughout. It certainly looks tasty. 
S - Primarily citrus with a nice dank pine thrown over the top. Mostly a tropical aroma. It is a bit more muted than I would have thought.
T - Citrus, orange, tropical fruits with a bit of pine. Very nice taste. A bit subtle but the balance works very well for drinkability. I could drink this all night.
M - Creamy and full bodied. Standard feel and carbonation for a DIPA.
O - Glad to finally get a chance to try this. I was expecting more from its legendary status. It was a bit more subdued than I would have hoped. Still a very tasty DIPA. I'd love to try it on tap. 774 charactersphingdong, Sep 16, 2011

A - a nice light golden orange with a solid 2 finger pearly white head. Nice, tight nit bubble structure, great retention and significant lacing. Great to look at.
S - mostly orange and peach on the nose. Some light grassy notes, but all citrus and some light colored stone fruits.
T - Tastes quite a lot like I remember just outstanding tasting, but a bit better. More citrus fruits from the hops and less bitterness. This beer is still very bitter. Some brown sugar sweetness comes through with the extra weeks of age, more fresh it was more of a table sugar backbone. I wouldn't put this in the same class as Pliny, but it's still quite good.
M - Mouthfeel is medium to low body with moderate to low carbonation. Not bad, but very average for a DIPA.
O - This is a solid IPA. Doesn't live up nearly to the 5th Anny, but I'll definitely be seeking it out again. 1,008 charactersdmsohyea, Sep 15, 2011
4.45/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to bauermj for sharing this treat.
Pours a light golden orange with one finger of white head that fades quickly. No lacing.
Smell is very good - citrus hops overwhelm the nose, primarily orange. A hint of tropical fruit is in there as well. Crisp and clean, with only a light touch of hop bitterness. There are some bready malts underneath, but citrus hops are more prevalent.
Taste is super juicy and refreshing. Orange citrus with a sweet and exceptionally smooth finish. Hardly any hop bitterness, which is impressive.
Feel is pretty good - medium bodied, but could use a touch more carbinationd.
Overall - delicious, delicious beer. 648 charactersreadbaron, Sep 14, 2011

A- Light hazy orange. 2 finger off-white head with very good lacing that remains on the glass throughout.
S- Citrus bomb! Lots of orange, pineapple, mango with a bit of dank hop aroma.
T- Sweet malts balance out the amazing orange and pineapple that is present throughout. Nice citrus and pine hop bitterness at the finish.
M- Medium bodied and a very smooth/lacto-like creaminess. Finishes very light which makes it very easy to drink.
O- Was not disappointed at all. This is exactly what DIPA's should be. Perfect balance of sweet malts, tons of citrus, and just enough hop bitterness to round the beer out. 677 characterskawilliams81, Sep 14, 2011

A: Slightly hazy golden color with an extremely thin cream colored head. 
S: Huge citrus hops. Mango, grapefruit and a lot of pine. Really intense aroma. About as good as you're going to find smell-wise.
T: Peppery pine hops upfront with some mango and grapefruit juice. Some caramel malts balance the hops out and the beer finishes with a nice hit of hop resin. A really great DIPA. 443 charactersnotchucknorris, Sep 14, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Picked up a bottle from a store that asked to not be named (their request) which I will honor, as I called to reserve a bottle, and they held one for me, a huge treat as a loyal customer, and saved me from having to hunt one down. 
Review from notes
A: Poured from the bomber into a Bruery tulip glass. The beer pours semi clear, with a mild haze, and a billowing, frothy, two inches of head, that slowly faded, depositing a smooth film of creamy lacing. Color is a dull copper, or tangerine orange peel color. 
S: Citrus, mango, pineapple aromas, just as the bottle says to expect. Quite tropical fruit forward, which is very nice. 
T: Medium bitter bite upfront, Citra & Amarillo hop oils, light semi sweetness in the middle, and finishes mildly dry. There is a might malt backbone, and light toast quality in there as well. 
M: Medium carbonation, oily mouth feel, mildly dry.
O: Good, but not my favorite DIPA. For those specific Amarillo and especially Citra hop lovers out there, this is your dream DIPA beer, and those flavors shine, especially in the aroma's. For me, I prefer more of a malt backbone to balance out a DIPA. Great treat to finish the bottle myself, and would certainly not pass up a taste if offered. 1,230 charactersRetsinis, Sep 13, 2011
4.95/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured from a bomber into a newly aquired Lost Abbey stem. (what a way to christen a new glass, with Citra!)Served at 42 degrees. HUGE shoutout to Cisco619 for providing the glass AND the Citra.
I was worried after all the hype and waiting that it wouldn't quite live up to it all. Boy was I wrong!
 Pours a gorgeous clear, amber. Nice fluffy white head that settles down with good lacing all over the glass.
 Smell is of fresh cut tropical fruits and pine.
 At first taste I'm greeted with a 'fresh' bitter taste. Nice grassy and floral taste as it eases down the gullet. This shit is the real deal. As it goes down there is a slight hop burn, like the 'heartburn' feeling one can get from too much hops (is there such a thing as too much hops?? I doubt it) I'm loving every second of this beer.
 While it is swishing in my mouth, it feels almost perfect. If there is any nitpicking to be done....and it really is just nitpicking...it could be just a bit thicker for a DIPA.
 Really, this is probably the best beer I've ever had from a bottle. I can't even imagine how good this must be freshly tapped. I can't help but think to the difference in Pliny from a fresh keg to a fresh bottle. While the bottle is excellent, the tap is magical. I love Pliny, but I think, at least in bottle form, this may take it. You West Coasters really fuckin' know how to rape the hops for all the flavor! I love it!!
Find this. Get this. Drink this. 1,437 charactersDaveHack, Sep 12, 2011

Pours a deep orange/copper color with a pillowy head that retains. Lots of fruits and hops on the nose. Aromas are not as big as some west coast IPA's can be but still enjoyable. Floral notes, citrus fruits, malts and plenty of hops are on the palate. Somewhat boozy but still very good tasting. Medium bodied. Overall this is a great beer but may be somewhat overhyped. I think there are plenty of offerings that are just as good and much more readily available. Still really glad I got to try this. Thanks Scotty! 625 charactersabrand, Sep 12, 2011
4.53/5  rDev -0.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to BdubleEdubleRUN for this thoughtful extra in our most recent trade. You are the man Brett, thanks a ton!
From a bomber into a snifter, this brew appears a gorgeous color of clear orange with a lighter coloring of yellow around the edges. A finger and a half of froth slightly off-white creamy meringue sits atop this brew with awesome powers of retention. As the cap slowly fades, it paints the wall of the glass with a webbing pattern of lace. A light swirl revives a finger of yellowish stained creamy head. Fantastic looking brew here.
The smell of this brew is a fantastic display of fresh hop character. To call this brew just "citra" is an insult. Not only notes of citrus in the nose but lots of tropical aromas emit from the glass smelling minorly like pineapple, pine, orange/lemon zest and a very light amount of catty character. This brew just smells downright juicy with hops. Awesome display of fresh hops in this brew's nose. As it warms up, a light solvent touch of fruited alcohol is noted across the back that tingles the nose.
The taste of this brew is a hop attack of juicy fruited flavored hops. The initial flavoring is that of bitter herbs and rinds, slightly catty with a touch of sulfur mixed with stinky cheese. Once the palate comes accustomed to the hop assault, more fruited flavors of orange rind, pulp, grapefruit, mild pineapple and grass come forward. There is a very faint malt touch in the background which provides an excellent base for the hops to play off of. It hardly provides any sweetness but more of a toasted touch. As the brew warms up, some solvent alcohol comes forward reminding you that this is a DIPA and there is 8% abv hiding underneath the glorious amount of hop character shoved inside this bottle.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. Absolutely a fantastic take on the style and a real treat to enjoy. Straight across the board this was a real pleasure. Nitpicking here I would have liked to seen just a bit more body on this. For as much flavor and aroma it packed, it seemed just a touch thin and watery but man did it come across as one super drinkable brew. I devastated this bomber fairly quickly and was looking for more. Well done Kern River, color me impressed. 2,271 charactersstakem, Sep 11, 2011

Pours a very light pale yellow with almost no head but some tin white lacing. Nose is amazing, pineapple, grapefruit and pine. 
Taste has a light touch of sweet malt, there's a lot, lot of fruity sweet deliciouness. Mouthfeel is lacing, super thin and light. Overall though it's very good. 330 characterskingcrowing, Sep 10, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a slightly hazy golden-copper color with a finger of frothy white head atop. The head fades down slowly leaving behind some nice lacing.
S - Aroma is bursting with lots of citrus hops. Lots of pineapple, orange, and mango here. There is also just enough sweet caramel malt in the background to balance.
T - Starts off with lot of citrus hops with again, lots of pineapple, orange, and mango flavors. There is also some nice bitterness in the background. Through the middle, the hops just keep on building with the bitterness and there is just enough sweet caramel malts to balance. The finish is a mix of citrus hops and bitterness with again a nice balance of caramel malts that linger for quite some time.
M - Medium-plus bodied with moderate carbonation. The beer feels very smooth with some nice dryness from all the hop flavor and bitterness.
D - Very drinkable. The hop flavor is quite strong throughout, but the malt and the body really keep up very nicely to create a strongly hopped, but balanced beer. 1,025 charactersngeunit1, Sep 10, 2011

Pours a slightly hazy copper color with a fluffy 2-finger head that leaves nice lacing.
Aroma is a tropical burst. Mango, pineapple, grapefruit and orange. There's also a nice malty aroma and slight booze in the background, all combining wonderfully.
Taste is seriously delicious and hoppy, but there's a good malt base there too. Tastes like an imperial Two Hearted. Alcohol is definitely present, but it works as an ingredient that adds to the flavor profile.
This one definitely lives up to the hype, and it's in the same league with Pliny or anything I've had from Alpine. If only this beer were available year-round, locally. Feeling very fortunate right now that I got a chance to try this. 841 charactersdraheim, Sep 10, 2011
4.43/5  rDev -2.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Glad to finally try one. Thanks goes out to subpoenadeuces for the trade!
A: Light amber in color with a 1.5 finger white head that has excellent retention and some nice lacing.
S: On the nose I get a lot of tropical fruits such as mango, tangerine, and pineapple. There's a smidgeon of grapefruit, but not much. I don't get any pine or earthiness. Overall a good smelling DIPA, but not all that complex.
T: The taste pretty much follows the nose. There's a lot of sweeter tropical type flavors and only a mild hop bitterness at the finish. While this is a fine variant of the style, I like a tad bit more bitterness in DIPAs, otherwise a phenomenal beer. With a little bigger punch at the finish this would be perfect. This beer reminds me of surly abrasive.
M: I would say this is a perfect feel. Nice aftertaste, appropriate viscosity and carbonation.
O: I very solid beer that I was glad to try. Would love a growler of this sometime. A few steps away from perfection though and probably in the top 6 DIPAs I've had, but not the top 3. 1,044 charactersglazeman, Sep 09, 2011

A: Pours a crystal clear beautiful amber color with lots of tiny bubbles floating form the center. Aggressive pour leads to a fluffy pure white head that takes longer than 2 minutes to slowly fade away to thick, sticky lacing. 
S: Wonderful, beautiful hop aroma full of pineapple, grapefruit, and piney resin. This one feels like I stuck my nose in a bag of freshly picked hops and I love every minute of it. I'm going to savor the smell for a little while, it's perfect.
T: Hop forward with huge grapefruit flavor and hop balanced by a silent but strong malt presence. This is a really wonderfully tasting beer. Right up there with the best DIPAs I've ever had. 
M: Medium bodied, perfectly carbonated. The hop oils really coat the mouth and leave me puckering from hop bitterness and leave me wanting more.
O: This is a phenomenal beer. Really, just a treat. I'm really glad I got more than one of these. I will savor every moment of every one of these. If you are a hop head or a DIPA fan - this has to be on your bucket list. 1,119 characterssuspect, Sep 09, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: Orangey gold, mostly clear with an ever so slight haze. Soft white foam of medium retention.
S: Pure tropical fruit, mangos and whatever else your mind's eye conjures up. But, the point is how pronounced the fruitiness is and how genuinely inviting. Nothing detracts from the scent, not sweetness, not alcohol, nothing is out of balance. While, you know there's some alcohol, it only as a subtle side show.
T: Well the first taste continues the perfect experience. My initial thoughts are the perfect tropical fruit notes in the scent carries over into the taste, and the malt sweetness of the DIPA style is muted. There's mostly a tangy, citrusiness to the aftertaste, very pleasant. Bitterness is non-existant. The mouthfeel is proper, not at all thick and in fact could be a tad fully. 
O: Second best beer I've had this year (first right now is Alpine-Expo Hoppiness). This brew's outstanding fruit profile almost says to put it in the produce section of your local grocery store. More and more brewers are jumping on the Citra hop bandwagon for good reason. Plus, the level of drinkability is off the charts, the taste flavors keep me coming back for more. I am a HUGE fan of Kern River when I can trade for it, and consider mysself lucky to have gotten a taste of Citra. 1,282 characters2BDChicago, Sep 09, 2011
5/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5After drinking 3 bottles of this over a span of a week, I had to review it because it just seemed to get better an better each time.
Nice pour into my glass with good size white head. Beautiful sunset orange color when held up to the light. You can smell this beer from 2 feet away and it smells glorious. Bursting citra hops come at you with a tropical wave of mango and pineapple followed by pungent dank hops. After a few sips it is safe to say that the taste follows the nose very well. First comes the juicy tropical fruits followed by a decent hop bitterness and only a slight sweetness. good sticky lacing follows this beer down the glass. Not very balanced as far as any malt goes, but this is exactly how I like my DIPA's. Nice mouthfeel with good carbonation and good mixture of hop flavor and bitterness. This is a fantastic beer and deserves all of the praise that it gets. 886 charactersRymar9, Sep 07, 2011

4.89/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522 oz bottle poured into a tulip.
A - Pours a very slightly hazy pale orange, with nice-looking foamy 2 finger white head. Retention is great as the head eventually recedes leaving tons of lacing which stays for as long as I’ve been looking at it.
S – I recently brewed an IPA and dry hopped with 3oz of citra; the smell is super distinctive, perhaps the most of any hop variety that I have used to date. Very aromatic orange and grapefruit smells dominate the pine, floral hops which are also present. The freshness of this beer yields an Über hoppy aroma that I cant stop putting my nose into. So wonderfully strong and floral.
T - Taste follows the smell with orange and grapefruit like sweetness, but finishes with a nice piney hoppy bite. Arguably one of the most drinkable beers I have had the pleasure to enjoy. The citrus mango and pineapple are all balanced very well with a perfect amount of malt. Very tasty.
M – Medium bodied with excellent medium carbonation. Sticky mouth feel. This is a very balanced DIPA with slightly higher than average carbonation which I prefer. The ABV is so well masked that I drank the entire bottle with a swiftness like non-other. Supper upset that I didn’t savor this one, rather inhaled it like it was the last thing I would ever get to drink.
O – Overall im really happy I got to enjoy this beer. I had it from growler as well as bottle and think there is no difference whatsoever. This beer definitely lives up to its hype. What really makes this awesome is that its unlike the other west coast IPA offerings. I highly recommend this beer if you can find it. If KRBC is reading this, use your heads and make this available in the Bay Area!!! Oh, and thanks for the awesome beer! 1,740 charactersdubinsky, Sep 07, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle poured into a tulip glass:
A: Pours Golden yellow/orange, hazy, with nearly 2 fingers of white head, tight bubbles, great retention. Leaves lots of lacing.
S: This might be the most citrus-centered beer I've ever had. TONS of tangerine, mango, pineapple, and so on. Plenty of sweet malt that adds to the citrus depth. No alcohol in the nose. WOW.
T: I think I just died and woke up in hop-heaven! As with the nose, this is unlike any hop-forward beer I've ever had. The hop flavor is straight fresh-squeezed tropical fruit smoothie. The depth is amazing. First is moderate wave of pine bitterness with mango and maybe a touch of grapefruit. Quickly what follows is wave after wave of tangerine, mango, and pineapple. There are floral notes hidden in there as well. Moderate amount of sweet caramel malt balances out some of the bitterness while giving the hops a juicy quality. The hops mellow out from the middle to the finish as the citrus fades to the background with the floral notes and pine. Moderately bitter finish that's fairly dry. 
M: Medium to slightly full body, moderate to very slightly high carbonation. Extremely smooth, almost velvety texture that has a good deal of sticky hop resins. It seems like a contradiction, yet somehow it actually works. Alcohol does make a very slight appearance with a warming effect and a very light "burn" up front. Goes down easy.
O: The hype is definitely real here! Easily one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. It's like PtE on steroids. I really don't see any problems here other than maybe the hops fading too fast in the mouth and alcohol a touch more noticeable than the best. It's just a matter of preference/mood whether I want this mellow citrus-forward DIPA or pungent and balanced (hop-wise) bitter bomb. I loved Hill Farmstead Citra DIPA, but this might be better. World class for sure. 1,864 charactersSatchboogie, Sep 07, 2011

Poured from a 22 ounce bottle into a nonic pint glass.
A: A medium to lighter amber orange color with a two finger white fluffy head. Some small glass lacing.
S: Wow, just wow. Huge tropical fruit smells just come wafting out of the glass even before you take a smell. Orange, grapefruit, huge mango and some slight floral notes. Sweetness is picked up just a bit. 
T: What a kick ass beer. The tropical fruits make your mouth tingle with flavors. Mango, orange, tangerine, pink grapefruit mixed with some slight herbal and floral notes. The sweetness is slightly sugary but it just can't come out enough because of the massive hops. Bitterness on the finish turns clean and crisp. What a beer.
M: Meduim, bitter, prickly but clean and crisp. The alcohol is nowhere to be found. 
O: Does this beer deserve the hype? Absolutely. What a great, great beer that I'm so glad they decided to bottle and thus allow us east coast guys to trade for it. This plus fresh Sculpin are the 2 most fruity beers I have ever had.
Overall I need to again thank Ross for trading with me so I got a chance to try this beer. The beauty is I shared my bottle with a fellow beer fan and I still have one more left. Is this worth the hype? You betcha. 1,400 charactersKadonny, Sep 06, 2011

Let that sink in.
Thanks to Brian out west for this brew. 
One more time.
WOW.
Kern Citra Double IPA is exceptional. 
Bronze body, white sustaining head, beautiful white lace all over my Captain Lawrence snifter. Smells like pine, grass, flowers, and citrus pith. It's not a smell I love, but holy crap, the taste is amazing. It's on the sweeter side of double IPA's, but not overdone. 8% alcohol just coats the tongue splendidly. The beer begins with a hop bite, mostly grapefruit, moves to the middle of the palate with a lovely combination of caramel and pale bready malts, features a bit of cereal and honey, and finishes bitter and watery clean. It's very sweet, not too drying, and well-balanced. Insanely drinkable. Lovely medium bodied thickness with good carbonation in the mouth.
WOW.
Let's knock down the appearance because it's hazy, and the smell because I don't love Citra's characterstic aromas. Still, I have trouble knocking this beer for anything else. It's A+, 95+ points, all the way. And they bottled it, and I have it in front of me. Thank you, Kern. Thank you, Brian.
WOW.

A: Gorgeous bright orange, light copper colored body with a small and dense white head. Retention is good and leaves a thin coating across the surface along with some thick bubbles around the edges. Some patches of lace are left behind, too.
S: Freshly peeled citrus fruits with flesh, oils and all. Orange, lemon, pink grapefruit and mango are evident up front. It's literally bursting with amazing hop notes that are all citrusy in nature. It doesn't smell like a bitter hop bomb, either - very balanced and juicy.
T: This is just phenomenal. As with the nose, this is all about the citrus fruits. Orange peels start things off, followed by hints of mango and lemon. The finish and into the linger is nothing but wonderfully juicy pink grapefruit. Fleshy in the finish and very oily and somewhat sticky in the linger. Amazing.
M: Medium-bodied, very balanced carbonation, not over the top yet not understated. Fairly creamy and sticky, finishes perhaps a touch dry but the citrus fruits even this out quickly.
This is, hands down, my favorite beer that falls under any part of the IPA family. It's so well balanced with the hops and bitterness that you're able to enjoy these qualities at the, essentially, perfect proportions. Citrusy, juicy, hoppy, bitter and insanely crafted. It doesn't get much better than this, folks. 1,483 charactersShanePB, Sep 06, 2011

4.79/5  rDev +5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to grilledsquid for this fantastic brew
Pours a cloudy-with fine-yeast, straw/gold, with a finger of off white and big bubbled head. Mountain ranges of lace form along the inner glass. 
The aroma is an example of dry hop artistry and late addition genius unrivaled by any beer I have tried. Neutral sweet carries grapefruit, orange peel, lemon, mango, peach, and subtle hints of herbal bitter in a complex, balanced, and superbly alluring perfume. Stunning.
What a perfection of the range of hop goodness this beer so cleanly and strongly offers! It starts with neutral sweet coming into play with a bit of kick-ass bittering, just a touch, but this is joined by dank weed, citrus pith, mango, sweet orange, lemon. It stays sweet, but never too sweet, not even close, and the bittering really kicks in just at the right time to end the sip with some drying and strong flavors of pine and herbal bitter. As it warms the flavors grow crazy, different undertones appear, some spicy, others fruity, some almost hormonal(in a good way), all contributing to a delicious hop complexity unrivaled by any IIPA I've tried.
The mouthfeel is stupendous. Perfect carbonation, just enough fizz to keep it lively, very smooth and easy to drink while being very viscous, and a clean finish that defines what is needed to keep the mouth locked and loaded for next sip.
We tasted this next to fresh Heady Topper and PTE y'day, and this was the best of all three. Today I am trying it again, and it is even more enjoyable, if such a thing is possible. If you can get this you owe it to yourself to taste it. Magnificent. 1,617 characterscavedave, Sep 05, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Prufrock for providing this beer in trade. 
Nice creamy off white head forms atop a very bright brass colored beer with very good clarity. Just a couple bubbles lazily making their way to the top of the glass. Nice retention. Interesting in that there isn’t a ton of lacing, but what sticks does so in thick clumps that, hang on for dear life.
Thick aroma that hangs in your nostrils. Bright Fresh perfume. Some sharp citrus and a touch of green.
This is one of those beers where I think I may be sucking on the hop comes. (not a terrible thing to me) Just as the initial hop blast begins to subside, you get a smack of sweetness and fruit. Melon and mango primarily for me. A touch of pepper perhaps. The more I drink it, it seems like there may be some honey like notes in here. Starbucks sells a small bag of dried mango and this really reminds me of that. You get a slight warming effect late in the flavor from the abv. Not hot, just letting you know that you shouldn’t mess with it.
Carbonation was a touch light. Body was medium and it was a touch oily and slick on your tongue.
I think this is a perfect beer where I express that I prefer single IPA’s to doubles. This is clearly a very good beer and one that all hop heads should try. Of course, I would happily trade for another bottle and drink it again. But, there’s just a touch too much in it for me. A hint of the ABV and a hint of sweetness that I would prefer dialed back. 
Still a very well built beer. Thanks Dan for making this available to me. 1,536 charactersReagan1984, Sep 05, 2011

Pours a clear copper/ golden color with a large fluffy white head. As the head fades, it leaves lots of lacing on the glass.
The smell is definitely Citra, pineapple, orange, tropical fruit with a nice bready malt backbone.
The taste is hops forward. Pineapple, orange, mango, and other tropical fruits are followed by a maltier backbone than expected. The finish is on the dry side with some lingering pine bitterness. I was expecting more tropical flavor and a little lighter malt backbone, but this is still very nice.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with moderate carbonation. I would like slightly more carbonation,but this could be due to the fact that it was a growler shipped from California.
Overall, this is a very nice beer, but I expected more. It is not as spectacular as the hype would suggest. 858 charactersrmalinowski4, Sep 05, 2011

A- Pours a hazy copper with a fluffy two finger head which leaves a few lines of lacing.
S- Ripe oranges, mangos, peaches, pineapple, apricots and a bit of biscuit malt. I just love the smell of citra hops.
T- Juicy tropical and citrus hops including orange, mango, peach, pineapple, apricot, grapefruit and lemon as well as some biscuit malt. 
M- Medium carbonation and medium body with a sticky mouthfeel. No bitterness or sign of the 8%. I could have consumed this growler by myself, it was so drinkable. 
O- A great IPA, and another amazing one from Kern. Not sure if this is as good as Zombie Dust IMO, but I would be a very happy man to have this available to me on a consistent basis. Thanks again Brian! 845 charactersiadler, Sep 05, 2011
4.62/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at Kern Brewing Company
Color: A nice vibrant amber orange shines through the glass. Pretty clear beer. A one finger head sits at top of the beer and of the off white shade. This beer leaves behind a good amount of lacing all the way down the glass.
Nose: Sublime! Extremely floral and filled with explosive citrus smells. Orange, peach, and pineapple shine through. The citra hop provides a wonderful aroma and the amarillo hop provides the slight bitterness and extra citrus punch. Smells heavenly. 
Palate: Refreshing and quite complex for DIPA. The beer sticks to your mouth, but as it swims on the tongue you get all these wonderful fruit flavors and gentle hop bitterness and fresh pine textures. The drinkability of this beer is amazing and the carbonation is just perfect for this brew. The Abv is no where to be found.
Finish: A bit sticky and bitter, but extremely smooth and drinkable. The hops have a huge presence here and the citrus fades to the background, but that is not a bad thing. A gentle sweetness shines through here giving Citra another level of complexity. Probably the best DIPA I have ever had to date.

S- I can smell citra hops from across the room. Sweet, tangy citrus - a lot of orange, but multidimensional as well.
T- Good hop presence with a somewhat surprising amount of bitterness. Not harsh by any means, but less citrus sweetness than I'd expect. Dare I say it feels a touch small for a DIPA...delicious
M- Easy on the palate. Well done.

Really nice clear dark golden with a 3 finger frothy white head. Fantastic lace and retention. 
Lots of citrus-- grapefruit, pineapple, little orange, and a touch of dry pine. Almost no malt. The taste follows suit and holds a nice bitterness. Really nice medium body, plenty of carbonation. 
Overall-- this is a nice beer, but not worth the hype. If this were a local, I'm sure I'd drink it when it got released... But the hype around this beer is much higher than the flavor deserves. 575 charactersAleWatcher, Sep 04, 2011

i affectionately call this beer sugar booger, because when you sniff it the dankness and tropical wafts just cling to your nostrils and feel like heaven
the taste is so streamlined with just a ghostly hint of malt accompanying the midly bitter finish
this one's all about the citra, a truly aromatic and juicy hop with tangerine and mango and ganja dankness, and it's this singularity of focus that puts it above pliny (which it beat in a blind line-up i was part of, yes, they were the same age)
after this week it'll probably start declining, so drink up me hearties yo ho 658 charactersBankhead, Sep 04, 2011

Pours clear and golden with a moderate alabaster head that formed in cascades atop the amber mass. The head is more bubbly than creamy with medium retention and good lacing.
 The aroma is all over the hop spectrum: from fruity to dank to spice. Reminds me of my local Abrasive at times. As it gets warm the sweetness comes through: hard to say whether it's exclusively from malts or there's some contribution from the alcohol. I think it's fairly standard for a DIPA and nothing exceptional, especially because it's all over the place and not showcasing a particular hop character.
 Mildly sweet, hints of fruit, quite crisp as opposed to creamy-viscous, with moderately bittering finish. Everything about the profile of this beer seems "moderate", or shall I say ordinary?
 As remarked, mouthfeel is crisp and clean on a lighter-than-your-usual-DIPA body; and I like the mouthfeel on this one.
Overall, ok. I can't taste the hype :/ 1,048 characterstewaris, Sep 04, 2011
4.34/5  rDev -4.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a tulip.
Right off the bat, the aroma of this beer was incredible. There was juicy mango and ripe pineapple scents, and it had a pleasant floral character that was accented by some malt sweetness. Just thoroughly delightful.
The appearance was top notch as well. The creamy white head crowning the cloudy, golden amber body left behind solid lacing.
Now the flavor was kind of a let down after my eyes and olfactory senses were so pleased. It felt very one dimensional to me relative to its aroma. Sure there was tropical fruit flavors from the Citra hops, but it felt watered down in a way. I picked up citrus flavor and a honey biscuit sweetness to the end. Flavorful, but not bursting with flavor like the aroma led me to believe.
The mouth-feel was silky smooth, and slightly tongue prickling. Somewhat on the thin bodied side with a medium/low level of carbonation. A little more body would have been my preference, but this beer was nothing if not highly drinkable. I literally wanted to sip this beer again after every sip. Which is great, but I like a finish that lasts a little longer.
Overall the amazing nose and stellar lacing set my expectations for the taste a little too high. Nonetheless a solid offering that doesn't warrant an A+ rating but is most certainly the best Citra hop offering I have had to date. 1,341 charactersTheJollyHop, Sep 04, 2011
4.57/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to McDiddyPop for the share, and for setting up a very enjoyable mini-tasting. Citra pours a slightly hazed orange-copper hue, and is capped with a nice off-white head, leaving small lace deposits as the glass is upended. The nose is, unsurprisingly, heavily citric, and is backed by a nice sugary sweetness with no aromatic suggestion of caramel (a plus in my book.) Notes of candied tangerine, lemon zest, sweet pink grapefruit and a hint of Saturn (donut) peach are found in both the olfactory as well as the gustatory. The malt (and mouthfeel) is, again, on the lighter side for a DIPA, which is just how I like it; it has a very nice sugar cookie-like tastiness which is quite complementary to the hop profile. The hop component, by the way, is unquestionably nice, but is neither vibrant nor complex enough to be on the world-class level of, say, fresh Pliny or Double Trouble. Nevertheless, it is a delicious and delectable brew, and is every bit as good as its smaller sibling, the aptly dubbed 'Just Outstanding'. 1,033 charactersktrillionaire, Sep 03, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to glazeman for dropping this long-sought-after whale off at my house prior to the beginning of a 3 month stint without tasting sessions. Been waiting a long time for this one.
Appearance is a lovely four finger head that leaves a trail of sticky legs with an orange/red body. Smell is amazing - one of the best I've ever smelled for a DIPA. I get harsh Christmas tree piney hops throughout with some citrus goodness in the middle. Taste is even better - a creamy orange/tangerine/mango citrus throughout with a harsh piney hops in the finish, almost the opposite of the smell. Also really sweet malts throughout that complement the hops to perfection. The hops are so fresh and juicy. Really outstanding. 
This one was something special, and sadly, is something that I probably won't get to try again. One of the best DIPAs, if not THE best DIPA, I've ever had. Wait - the best. There. Thanks, buddy. 915 charactersairohead2001, Sep 03, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Fresh bottle as an extra from pastradul! Thanks buddy!
Pour: bright straw yellow, slightly golden with an opaque orange hue. Very carbonated, bright white head dinishes into a soapy ring around the glass' edge.
Nose: Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, strong piney resin. This is a blast of tropical fruit goodness with a great piney zing. This smells better than any IIPA I've had, outside of Abrasive.
Taste: The taste is insane. All the above tropical fruits coming in sweet with a middle consisting of very strong, resinous citrus (cite duh) hops and a great caramel malted backbone. Sort of dry on the end with a great piney lingering taste.
Mouthfeel: Well carbonated, slightly dry and a perfect Inbetween of oily and watery.
Overall: This IIPA is so amazing. I could drink it in lightning speed if I had a never ending supply. It's SO good. 847 characterswaltersrj, Sep 02, 2011

Appearance: Slightly hazy golden yellow with a finger of off white head that settles to a thin ring around the beer after a few moments.
Smell: The bottle wasn't lying about this one. Sweet grapefruit, tangerine, mango and pineapple mixed with a great hoppy/dank aroma. Reminds me of sweaty socks (but in a good way).
Taste: Sweet mango, pineapple and tangerine, bitey grapefruit. Nice bitterness from the hops mixed with just the perfect amount of malty sweetness (very faint, but there).
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and somewhat sticky.
Overall: This has probably one of the best aromas of any DIPA that I've ever had and the taste does not disappoint. This deserves the hype it gets in my opinion. Would love to try this on draft. 821 charactersAxic10, Sep 02, 2011

Shared amongst friends, I pour my portion into a Darkness snifter.
Bright orange pour. Colorbook like. My nieces would run wild on the walls with that color crayon. Two full fingers of off white head. Smell is deep citrus. Sweet of course. It's not pungent or aggressive just sweet. My first impression of my sip is how undercarbonated it is. It's not omg awful, it just isn't there. Taste is semi sweet tropical citrus that cuts to a dry finish. Hmmmm. (Scratches head) This has been done much better by others. 
Sure the beer was good. Great? No. I don't see what all the fuss is about, Albeit, I'm glad I tried it and had the overall experience. If I'm on the West Coast i'd much rather reach Expo Hopiness, and Knuckle Sandwhich. East Coast, Hill Farmstead. Kern can't hold a candle to any of those. Competition is closed boys and girls. 932 charactersTheDudeRules, Sep 01, 2011

O: Overall a great DIPA that does deserves to be up their with the best. However, I still feel that the current DIPA craze is all a bunch of hype.

Citra pours a largely clear orange, with just a little haze to it and some solid tangerine highlights shining through. The cream colored head tops out at over three fingers in height and has some fantastic head retention. The head is fairly sticky, but the lacing is just shy of perfection. It's interesting to compare the nose with this beer, which also used Amarillo hops, with the all Citra Hill Farmstead Double Citra that I had earlier this evening. They're certainly similar, but the Amarillo takes the edge off the citric and acidic fruit aspect of the Citra hops, resulting in a more rounded, fruity aroma (though those other attributes are also present). I just wish it had a little more oomph to it. There's a bit of caramel to be found in each sip, enough to differentiate it from a beer as bone dry as Ruination or PtE, but it's still fairly hop forward for the style. Mid palate bitterness is definitely present, but on the refined side. The Citra hops are a bit more dominant in the flavor than on the nose, as far as grapefruit and pineapple notes go. There's still some mango, and even peach present, but not as much so as in the aroma. The body is spot on, on the light/dry side while not letting the hops run 100% rampant. Carbonation is just as good, bubbly and exciting and really letting the hoppy flavors pop on my palate. Kern River's Citra is a very good DIPA, and I think it may be suffering a bit from having to follow a couple phenomenal hop forward beers from Hill Farmstead. I'll surely be cracking my second bottle soon, and this may be a rare case where I revisit and revise my scores. 1,693 charactersaxeman9182, Aug 30, 2011

this is the legendary Citra, it poured a nice pale amberish color with a solid frothy 2 finger head, there is lots of lacing left around the glass. the nose is intoxicating and you can smell it from the first crack of the bottle. this beer is a take the west coast version of zombie dust from the smell. the flavors on my tongue remind me again of the dust but a little more grassy, not bad but slightly grassy. the mouthfeel is good not too much carbonation but its definitely enough, with the dry end of the taste that makes you want another sip. overall this is a good beer no doubt, dont know if it deserve the hype its got but its a good beer. drinkability is very high i could see tons of these bottles getting polished off in no time. thanks kern river 791 characterskaips1, Aug 30, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5First off, this beer was enjoyed at an EPIC stout tasting (KtG, BT, BA Speedway, DL, Jackie O's BA DA, etc...) and this was probably the best beer we had that night. It's just outrageously delicious.
A: Hazy dark citrus orange in color with a nice white bubbly head that fades to a nice layer of foam on the surface. The color makes me want to bathe in it. So beautiful 4.5
S: This stuff should be sold to beer geeks as a sexual pheromone. The aroma on this is just outrageous! First pop of the cap and the waft of tropical/exotic fruits and hops hits your nose immediately. This is a full on aromatic assault of citrus, mangoes, peaches, grapefruit, pineapple and some resinous hoppy citrus hops. Holy shit this stuff smells like sex in a bottle. 5
T&M : Not surprisingly, the flavor follows the nose almost to a tee. A full on mouthgasm of hoppy citrus flavors, mangoes, peaches, pineapple, orange, and enough malt backbone to perfectly compliment everything. The malt backbone almost has a honey like quality but in no way is sweet like honey. Beautiful. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, yet crisp and amazingly refreshing. This is highly, HIGHLY drinkable. This beer is liquid art. 5 / 4.5
O: I don't even know what to say. I think the brewer stumbled upon one of the greatest DIPA recipes known to man. Everything about this is damn near perfect in every way. I can't recommend this highly enough. It's definitely in my top 5 as of right now. 1,446 charactersjulian, Aug 29, 2011

I thought I might never give a perfect score to a DIPA in the appearance category but Citra looks impeccable. Deep straw yellow, leaning towards orange, in color. It is neither hazy nor cloudy, gorgeous. A big nice fluffy nice bright white head rises from the pour, about 2 1/2 inches, and holds on for a good while eventually fading leaving some pretty nice lacing. 
Smell is strong, grapefruit and big cirta hop aromas, with good tropical notes as well. The taste pack a huge bitter punch, one of the biggest I've had actually. Huge grapefruit flavors are prevalent again, with a bit of a mango finish. The mouthfeel is interesting: medium carbonation and light to medium bodied it's quite enjoyable. I thought I didn't like this much carbonation in DIPAs but it works so well for this beer as it is the most drinkable beer I've had of the style.
Citra is excellent, I could literally drink it everyday, but I prefer the more complex taste of Kern River's 5th anniversary beer, but they are both world class DIPAs. 1,095 charactersLSUPT, Aug 28, 2011

S: Really clean citric qualities dominate the nose. Orange or tangerine quickly come to mind. Lots of bitterness from the nose as well. Malt is not making a strong showing.
T/M: Juicy citric notes also dominate in taste, also with a touch of that dank potty flavor Im always looking for in DIPAs. In contrast, bitterness is toned way down. Drinks much lighter than I expected, reminds me of Gandhi Bot in that manner. Finish is almost watery.
O: A top tier IPA, certainly a must try. In a way, I appreciate how lightly this drinks, especially at 8%. A slightly thicker body in the finish could have helped fortify this brew a bit more. 686 characterszoolzoo, Aug 27, 2011

O- I really hate how hyped this beer was, and yet I understand it. It combines the best of west coast IPAs and, all in all, surpasses what other breweries do so well.

Big fluffy white cap of head that sticks all over the sides of the glass. Big, inviting, juicy tropical hops in the nose, balanced slightly with a touch of malt sweetness. This is clearly not one of those dry hop bomb DIPAs - instead the nose brings you right in. Really, really nice. Taste is citric, tame hop bitterness. Tropical (not as crazy tropical as Jai Alai, though), juicy, with a reasonable amount of malt balance. Clearly more juicy hop flavor that bitterness, which is pretty low key and appears mostly in the finish. Not dry by any means, but the malt sweetness and body is medium relative to some sweet and heavy DIPAs. This is exactly the way I prefer my hoppy beers. I do feel like this might be better on tap and clearly freshness will be very important. Still really nice with big, juicy, tropical hop flavor. I could drink this constantly. Another great beer from what seems to be a place that makes some good ones. 1,010 charactersseeswo, Aug 27, 2011

Citrus and more citrus on the palate. Medium dry. 3/4 of the way to super bitter. The finish lingers drying out my tongue. The mouthfeel is very creamy, I wish there was a bit more prickling my tongue. Holy crap I love this beer. 492 charactersWestValleyIPA, Aug 26, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 522oz bottle with no bottled on or freshness date, poured into Hair of the Dog tulip, reviewed on 8/25/11.
A: Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with off-white head that leaves nice lacing around glass.
S: The nose is phenomenal, so much fresh fruit, pineapple, grapefruit, and fresh mangoes. Could smell all the fruity hops as soon as I cracked the bottle. Hints of malt and alcohol, but barely detectable beneath all of the delicious hops.
T: Not nearly as hoppy as the nose but still quite hop forward. An assortment of both tropical and citrus hop flavors that mingle so well together that they are hard to separate from one another. A nice malt backbone to bring some balance to the moderate hop bitterness. Only a touch of alcohol on the finish.
M: Really smooth medium body with low-moderate carbonation, somewhat resinous feel and a semi-dry finish.
O: Excellent DIPA, really delicious and extremely high drinkability. The hop profile is near perfect. I really wish that this was available year round! 1,014 charactersAzurescens, Aug 26, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +7.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a crystal clear amber with a nice white head (historically when only on tap it was cloudy orange with some particulates; clarity is as a result, I'm told in a change in brewing procedures for bottling). 
Nose is as good as it gets. Huge assertive sweet fresh pineapple. 
Mouthfeel is rich and creamy and very inviting. The balance is wonderful.
Flavors are just about perfect. Front palate is rich fresh honey that developes to green pepper, celery, salt, green herbs and finishes with a big grapefruit skin oil bitter character. 
This beer deserves the hype and, for me, is the best Double IPA on the market, in my opinion, an opinion held since I first tasted it at the brewery and brought home several growlers.
(Truthfully, years past on tap only have been slightly better only because they have been a bit all around "brighter" which I like.) However, this new bottling is quite good and deserves the hype. 
Drink fast - this is not one to hold. 962 charactersGRG1313, Aug 26, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a shaker pint. Pours a pretty clear golden amber color. Very nice and thick white head. Super sticky lacing.
Aroma is nice. Super citric and a bit piny. Juicy hop aroma with a bit of malt. Has that semi mildue aroma that some hoppy beers get though. Not too bad.
Taste is awesome. One of the best IPA's I've had. Nice maltiness with a super juicy citrus hoppyness. Very tasty.
Mouthfeel is extremely drinkable. Smooth and medium to low carb.
Overall super tasty. Wish I had more. Going to have to hit up the store by me who is suppose to get it tomorrow. 570 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Aug 25, 2011

A - Pours a golden amber with a two finger off white. There is a good amount of head retention to be had here, and the lacing is excellent...
S - Citra hops blast you in the face from first whiff. Oranges, tangerines, grapefruit, mango, and peaches. Scent is very inviting...
T - As with the smell Citra is prominate, and it's delicious. Tangerines, grapefruit, oranges, mango, and some sweet malt. Ends on smooth bitter note with some; you guessed it, Citra...
M - Medium bodied. Carbonation is spot on here. Not to much or to little. Prickles the tongue, but doesn't overwhelm. Finishes dry...
O - Probably one of the, if not the best DIPA I have had the chance to experience. Kern River comes through with a world class brew here. Definitely lives up to the hype...
Cheers... 851 characterscomfortablynumb1, Aug 25, 2011

pours a slightly hazy golden copper with a nice inch plus of fluffy white head. nice lacing and retention.
lots of booze and bitterness with a faint hint of malt. not very complex on the nose. bits of citrus, mainly tangerine.
tropical fruit, with mango, pineapple, and tangerine coming to mind. lots of citra bitterness. grapefruit in the finish. malt body is there but the hops really take center stage. 
great body. perfect mild to moderate carbonation. a bit chewy with a hint of resin on the teeth.
this is good but overhyped. glad i waited until this was bottled. nice 8% ABV for a DIPA, i would buy this again easily. however at the end of the day, i prefer the regular "just outstanding". 733 charactershooliganlife, Aug 25, 2011

Bottle to Tulip
22oz
No date on bottle, but released on Friday, drank Monday. Pretty damn fresh
Thanks to BA Richbeer for picking one up for me.
App- Wonderful bright orange with some yellow streaks radiating out with a big puffy pillow top two finger head. Falls gracefully with a ton of cling and lace. Huge lacing on this one. 
Smell- Huge amounts of fruit on the nose. Just a ton of bright vibrant fruits. Orange, pineapple, tangerine. Light and floral and balanced. Everything I've wanted my DIPA to be.
Taste- For a DIPA this is a very light beer. It was balanced by the floral hops and juicy citrus and had only a small bitter note. The juicy citrus melds everything together to create a such tasty beer. I can se why the rush to get a bottle.
Mouth- Medium bodied and bordering on a bit light to me. A paired medium carbonation with a floral fruit and a slight bitter residual flavor.
Drink- Well 5th Anniversary DIPA was good even with 2 months of fade to it and it was a bit bigger and more bitter. This was better. The best DIPA I have had. 1,076 charactersFosterJM, Aug 23, 2011

Thanks to Alucard4, DarthKostrizer, and MrVonzipper for sharing this!
Dark, clear amber. Thick, off-white, soapy head. Regular lacing down the glass.
Pungent and tropical aromas galore: pineapple, orange, and mango aromas from the hops are explosive as well as floral highlights. There's a touch of bready caramel and some slight pine--but this is certainly a showcase of hops. Wow! 
The flavor is again filled with pungent tropical flavors: mango, orange, and some pineapple. There's a touch of pine, sticky marijuana, and just a hint of bready, cracker and caramel malts. Delicious!
Exceptionally full yet disappearing mouthfeel. Incredibly drinkable.
One of the best DIPAs around. 739 charactersehammond1, Aug 23, 2011

A- Pours an orange gold color with a half finger white head that dissipates to a ring leaving some lacing on the glass.
S- The nose of this beer is fantastic, so much citrus, orange's, tangerine's, with a hint of sweetness.
T- The flavors of this beer really pronounce themselves throughout the beer as it warms, really picking up flavors of kumquats and other tart citrus flavors, a slight pine resin and a little heat in the finish.
M- Fairly medium body with a lingering hop bite, somewhat lightly carbed and wouldn't mind a tad more.
O- Hard to avoid the hype behind this beer and I won't say it lives up to it but I also won't say that it doesn't. Its without a doubt an awesome DIPA, that I wish was more available. My wife is hooked on it and ranks it in her top 5 favorites. 838 charactersBdubleEdubleRUN, Aug 23, 2011

Got a hold of a three of these bottles from two different stores in the Kern River Citra Craze of 8/19/2011.
From 22 OZ Bomber into a tulip glass.
Appearance: Beautiful orange color with a minimal haze. The head was white and fluffy. Lacing was great. 
Aroma: Hops and more hops. This beer smells of fresh cut peaches, pineapple, and mango, It’s wonderful!
Mouthfeel: Great carbonation with a medium body feel.
Taste: Insanely hoppy but not bitter! Tthe drinkability is amazing. 
Overall: Worth the hype! I heard about this beer not long ago so I was lucky to get a hold of it while it lasted. 622 charactersChanChan, Aug 22, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I have been trying to get my hands on Citra for some time and I finally copped a bottle down the from my house.
Pours a very nice very clear amber hue with a fluffy off white head that had some great hang time. Definitely left some nice lacing on the glass the entire drink.
Aromas are just jumping out of the glass like crazy. There are piney notes, big tropical fruit like mango and pineapple and some citrus aromas as well. I have to say its perfect.
Taste again I have to say perfect. I have not had a more easyh to drink DIPA that packs this much flavor. Hops are in your face but not off-putting at all. Sweet upfront with bitterness all the way to the dry crisp end. There is nothing I don't like here.
Drinkability is perfect. Crisp and refreshing with full flavor, it's a win all the way. I need to get more of this while I can. 841 characterssnpub540, Aug 22, 2011
4.33/5  rDev -5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Split a bomber with Walows. Been dying to try this for ages but our Kern River fishing trip/beer journey has yet to pan out...
I popped the cap and the aroma instantly jumped out of the bottle... Smelled incredible. (Ditto on the pineapple express. Good call!) The color is gorgeous as well, a deep gold and crystal clear.
But the taste disappointed a bit. Don't get me wrong, it's a tasty beer, but I suppose with such high expectations it's only natural to be let down, just a little. The drinkability is incredibly high... I don't like the bit of glycerin in the mouthfeel, but otherwise the alcohol is very, very well-hidden.
Overall, it's a great beer. 660 characterslisomiso, Aug 22, 2011

Nice crystal clear amber color with a very nice off white frothy head with excellent retention and little lacing. 
Wow!! As the growler top is popped the amazing fresh hops are prolific. You can smell this amazing explosive nose just holding the beer away from your head. Wonderful floral and light citrus notes. A slight sweetness. Also kind of smells like really good weed. (pineapple express would be the perfect name for this)
Flavor is amazing as well. Excellent balance and transition from hop forward to a nice light mild malt sweetness. 
Light bodied, very fresh and crisp. Nice carbonation. 
Overall IMO this beer, for the style deserves no less than a 5. Hands down the best IPA I've ever had. Crushes PtE!! Amazing nose, flavor and balance and so easy to drink it's crazy. Simply a perfect DIPA. 891 charactersMrVonzipper, Aug 22, 2011

4.87/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5First and foremost - a big thank you to Kyle the brewer for finally bottling this and making it a little more accessible for people to try what I consider my favorite overall beer I have ever had. 
Appearance: This is one area where I think it is slightly different. The beer is a little more clear coming out of the bottle vs. a growler. A beautiful orange pretty clear with a white head that disappears pretty quick.
Smell: I love the way this beer smells. Its all tropical--pineapple,mango,peach,tangerines, and mandarin oranges. Has a little orange zest in the smell as well-- real strong on all tropical citrus notes. No real malt in the smell just pure hop bliss.
Taste: This is the most easy drinking double IPA you will ever have. When i first had this beer a year ago and change my initial thought was its decently bitter but now after having it numerous times I can say there is a nice malt backing to it to balance out all of those hops. In the front of the taste I get alot of oranges and tangerines followed by some slight pineapple on the finish. Definitely has some bitterness but it does seem pretty well balanced with a slight malt after taste. Pretty dry beer to me so it goes down really easy and quick for me. I could and have polished off a growler in a little over a hr and could not believe it was gone that quick. A easy drinker for me.
Mouthfeel: A little less carbonation than the draft version. It still has a nice mouthfeel but slightly less carbonation none the less.
Overall: I can't wait to get up to Kern for the next time Citra is available. Get a hold of me Kyle and I will just buy you a extra fermenter to keep this thing year around. I can't tell you how much I appreciate this beer. Wish it was closer to me. I have had so many of the IPA's and doubles and all the top tier one's and I can say this really lives up to the hype easily. I could pick this out of a line up blind folded with ease. Nothing compares. Keep up the great work Kyle. Can't to have some more of the 5th Anniversary beer this fall. Keep the great IPA's coming Kyle and I will keep drinking them. 2,110 charactersRampage1, Aug 22, 2011

A-Pours clear light amber with an inch of fluffy off white head.
S-I can smell this from across the room. Intense citra hop fruit explosion! Purees strawberries, bittersweet citrus skins, mango...making me drool.
T/M-Soft and full bodired, with light, supportive carbonation. Initial tropical fruit hop flavors recede into tasty marijuana earthiness. The finish is dry, with light mouth coating tannic earthy hoppiness.
O-Not sure how much this lives up to the insane hype surrounding it, but it is one of the better Citra-centric beers I've had. Uses the aromatic properties of the hop to its full potential. 642 charactersDaveHS, Aug 21, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a light gold. Actually kind of surprisingly light for a DIPA. The beer has a nice foamy head that sticks around. The aroma is pungent and hoppy. Tons of hops, no noticeable malt on the nose. The hops are citrusy and floral, there is some pineapple on the nose and just a hint of pine. The taste is pure hops but there is noticeable sweetness on the palette. This is actually less hop forward than I was expecting. The balance is good, not too sweet with a nice refreshing burst of hops. 
The more I drink this down the more I love the hops. A nice, pleasant bitterness and a hop aroma that smells like what beer perfume would smell like it it were an awesome idea instead of a horrible one. I'd get this again, if only I could! 734 charactersaknight, Aug 21, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +6.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bomber split with my brother a day after the release.
Pours a glowing copper orange that is slightly see-through. You see very little carbonation climbing to the top. A nice 2 finger head is formed atop. Extremely tight bubbles that last for quite some time. Thin lacing is left behind, but there's a lot of it.
Smell is intoxicating. I love how simple this beer is. Just loaded to the brim with Citra hops. Nice tropical notes, but just ultra ripe Citra. You can smell it from a good 2 feet away. Absolutely incredible. 
Taste follows the outstanding smell. Full of juicy tropical fruits followed by the even juicier Citra hops. I usually like complexities, but this is so one dimensional and I am absolutely blown away by it.
Mouthfeel is on the heavier side. Low carbonation with a creamy mouthfeel. Very nice.
When I had this on tap at the release I liked it, but didn't love it. Sitting down with the bottle though I am now a complete believer of the hype. This will be a hard DIPA to top, but I look forward to trying to find one that does. Well done KRBC. 1,067 charactersDearthVader, Aug 21, 2011

A - Orange-yellow-amber colored beer with a forthy white head that has really nice retention. Some good, sticky lace on the sides.
S - Citra, the hops we all crave now. Great tropical fruit, almost jammy, not any real bitterness, at least the resiny kind that you get from lots of DIPAs. Smells very nice, quite light.
T - Taste is really good, but really, this is almost all citra hops, not getting much of a malt backbone here at all. Almost juice like in its taste, with tropical citrus hops being the only thing I'm getting. Good stuff, but I want a bit more fuller flavor.
M - Medium bodied, good carbonation, quite smooth.
O - Really great beer, easy to get down, probably a great DIPA to introduce people to if they need to try DIPAs. Not my favorite by a long shot, as I like them to get slightly more bitter and have a little more malt backbone, but this is a great beer nontheless. 938 charactersAgentZero, Jul 14, 2011

Malty brown sugar and candied lemon hops on the nose with a piney accent. Flavor is lemon zest with a light pale malt note. I appreciate the hop focus without a syrupy malt profile but it also is allowing a soapy astringent note to come through. Solid bitterness but not really up to DIPA standards. A good beer but I'm not buying the hype here. 441 charactersillidurit, May 16, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5From notes 4/9/2010 - Had this on tap at O'Brien's in San Diego. It was cloudy, no chance of seeing through, the keg had just been tapped so that might've had to do with it... but the color was a nice burnt orange and the head was fairly meager. My rating for the appearance is on what I think it would be had it not been "O'Brienified." Their pours often do a bit of injustice to the beers appearance. The smell profile was very similar to blind pig but even more potent. Very citrusy. The flavor was similar as well but carried an even bigger mango presence than Blind Pig normally does. I perceived this as a fairly well attenuated beer, not a syrupy sweet mess. Very enjoyable. 681 charactersMiScusi, May 11, 2011

A: Hazy orange color. The pour dropped a finger or so of pure white head that faded to a thin rim and left little lace.
A: The aroma is that of sweet pineapple, pine tar, and citrus. I actually get a little butter in the nose, which I hope is not a sign of off flavors.
T: The taste follows the nose, with notes of more pineapple, orange, and pine sap. The biscuit and caramel malt balance this well. I was afraid of this from the nose, but there is a distinct diacetyl taste. The buttery notes are not pleasant. If not for this, I believe this would be a good beer.
M: Creamy for a dipa. Medium to full body, light on the carbonation.
O: I was expecting an A+ brew, I got an B brew. Not bad, if it weren't for the diacetyl, I guess I got a bad batch. This is definately not on par with the world class brews such as Hopslam, in my opinon. I hope to get to try this again, and am chalking this review up to a bad batch.

Pours a hazy amber with a finger or so of off white head which quickly laces away. Smells of pine tar pungency and wafts of orange oil, a little sweet pineapple on the finish and surprisingly.. a little alcohol glides through just at the very end. Taste follows the nose but more diminutive. Hop bitterness comes in on the finish and maintains a bitter aftertaste on the back of the palate. Medium bodied and mouth coating. leaves an oily slickness on the palate, light carbonation..

4.74/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Been hearing good things about the citra, and now I have a growler to share thanks to Marisatheyounger, your the woman.
Burnt orange all around, the color is glowing with mostly orange maybe a shade of amber mixed with touches of slight copper. Pouring this, I get a inch of thickish white foam that stays and somewhat sticks. Pokadot lacing and some stripes around the glass.
This sure smells like citrus. Once all is said and done this smells like a superfecta of citrus with just the tiniest backing of malt to back that up. I get a shitload of papaya. Tropics, pineapple, mango etc. You guys and gals know the deal, west coast hoppy delight!!
Yep, Citra delivers in a big way without being huge, ya dig. It's like a overload in a small compartment. A big blast of that raw tropic treatment, mango, papaya, the works really. I get alot of squeezed orange with zest. Fruity than slighty malty without all that east coast overdo. Malt done right, not in your face, but there, to even the playing field. You just have to try it, to understand.
I am really digging the feel on this CITRA. It finishes so clean that going for another gulp afterwards is totally doable. Not the most bitter DIPA out there, in fact the bitter does not last into the aftertaste. One of the cleanest and smooth finishes I have ever had in a double, no fooling, no bias as well.. Body is a step above medium with adaquate carb based on look and feel.
Well, all in all, CITRA DIPA is a winner and deserves the acolades. The finish delivers not to mention the start, and well the whole damn thing rocks IMO. I could drink a whole growler of this if the time was right. I dont think I can say that with PTE or the like, this is just simple drinking with a BANG!!! 1,741 charactersBARFLYB, Mar 27, 2011

A: Great hazy peach orange with a fluffy cap of white foam on top.

T: Super resiny, oily hops with a bit of skunk weed thrown in for good measure
M: Refreshing and sticky...leaves you BEGGING for another sip
O: One of the best double ipas I've had and absolutely the best expression of all that CITRA can offer the brewer. Fantastic. 460 charactersfrancisweizen, Mar 27, 2011

A pint off the growler thanks onix1arg and a sweet gal who traded it to him. Damn what a pull. 
A- a stiff pour yields a good finger or so of off white head that holds for a bit before slowly settling to leave some nice creamy lace on the glass and a solid skin on top. Hazy sunset orange in color with a lovely glow to it. 
S- well the name don't lie. This bad boy smells like citrus. Oranges, grapefruits, tangerines, then the tropics kick in and you get some sweet mango and a touch of pineapple. Malts are there but only come off with a light sweetness that blends into the super fruity hops. 
T- opens up with an abundance of fresh juicy citrus hops that bring the whole damn cornucopia with it. Loads of oranges, super sweet ruby red grapefruits, tangerines. Its a landslide of citrus fruits, like five alive but good. Mangos, papaya, and pineapples show their head as well and really round out a spectacular hop profile. Malts play fifth fiddle if you get my drift, but do an expert job of bringing just that right amount of lightly bready sweetness to the hops, it boosts them to the next level and balances them out at the same time. Amazingly clean finish with a nice hoppy linger that I won't soon forget. 
M- a hop or two above medium in body and a smooth slightly creamy carb that kills it on each sip. 
O- wow wow we wow! This is a breathtaking beer. This just went down on me then I went down on it and everyone is very pleased with the out come. I am impressed with it drinkablity and how clean of a finish it has. Yo for real big ups to my boy b and the lovely lady who hooked him up with this brew. I don't know your name but I thank you very much. 1,692 charactersoglmcdgl, Mar 27, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -4.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to mrbubbler
Poured a slightly hazed copper brew with a huge thick white head that didn't want to die.
Smell is monstrous, sweet tropical fruits and a thick caramel note followed with a bitter dankness. 
Taste was bitter pine that was an odd sweetness, the nose is evident in the taste just over powered by that dankness 
Mouthfeel is kind of thin especially for a iipa but with it been so its actually not a chore to put back bunches of It and is actually a bit creamy.
Drinkability suffers from the resin after taste thats a bit harsh and hangs around forever
While still very good I think the hype may have hurt my expectations on this
Letting the beer warm up a bit cut the over powering dankness a bit and helped it overall 736 characterssliverX, Mar 13, 2011

A - Pours deep amber orange with a small half finger tall white head, dissipating down to almost nothing, leaving light lacing down the glass.
S - HUGE citric hop punch up front that never really fades from the limelight. Some caramel malt and tropical fruits offer as much balance as they can but it is really all about the hops.
T - Still plenty of citric hops up front; just not as much as the nose; giving way slowly to a mix of light caramel malt and fresh tropical fruits. Finish is quite bitter but it doesn't last for very long. I really like this one. It is not too over the top like others, it is quite refreshing actually. Glad I finally got to try it.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderate carbonation. Nice crisp feel with a good amount of lingering hop bitterness in the finish.
D - Dangerously high. I finally get to try this one on for size. I really enjoyed the Hill Farmstead Citra but I think the Kern River was a bit more well rounded. I hope to have this again someday, preferably on-tap! 1,144 charactersorangesol, Mar 08, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Growler courtesy of Ultraman9000 - thanks, Martin!
Pours a hazy burnt orange color with a two finger off-white head. Head retention is great, as is lacing. The aroma is awesome - tons of tropical fruit with pineapple and mango really shining through. Lighter caramel malt notes underly the tropical fruit hops. The taste is much the same, with lots of tropical fruit hoppiness dominating the flavor profile. The is just enough caramel malt sweetness to add some depth to the taste beyond the hops. The bitterness is pretty high, but the alcohol is very well-hidden. Extremely easy to drink - three of us had no problem finishing the growler in not much time. Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation, the finish is pretty dry and bitter with a hint of alcohol warming.
Really phenomenal stuff overall. I'd put it right behind the Plinys and pretty close to Dreadnaught and Abrasive in my personal DIPA pecking order. 917 charactersWeisGuy, Mar 06, 2011
3.92/5  rDev -14%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A growler.
A: Citra is a darker, autumnal with leafy, tobacco brown colors. Enough lighter hues lend to the yellow-brown leaves in fall aspect. A small head.
S: The citra nose is intoxicating, sweet with orange. Underneath the hops, caramel malts provide a surprising degree of balance.
T: The citra, as pleasant as the nose is, doesn't quite last. Hoppiness is present, a recurring theme. Citrusy orange flavors are rich and lush, well-balanced against the caramel biscuit malts. Citra starts out well but gets lost amongst the bolder double IPA flavors.
M: The mouthfeel is crisp upfront, hoppier and varied in the finish. The citra nose is great.
D: A good beer, plenty flavorful with the citra leading the charge. 722 charactersakorsak, Mar 06, 2011

A - Pours murky, hazy orange with nice white head. Head drops down to thin white layer on top.
S - Lots of fruity aroma goodness in this one. Big hop notes in the nose. Nice malty background round it out but don't take away from the fruit.
T - Like the nose, the flavor doesn't disappoint. Big fruit flavor in this, grapefruit mostly tasted. Some piney hop flavor mixed in the middle. Malts hold up the fruit, hop flavors well but are not noticed much. A little bitter at the end, but big juicy fruit flavors all the way until the end.
M - Lighter to Medium body with moderate carbonation. Slight bitter, resin coating mouthfeel. The flavor doesn't stay as long as you want it to. 
D - Very, very drinkable beer. After a glass or two of most DIPA's I'm done. This is something I could keep drinking very easily. Heard great things about this beer, and it surpassed my expectations. Thanks again Marisa for the hook up on this! 1,021 charactersHosP, Mar 04, 2011
4.12/5  rDev -9.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A good friend acquired this in a trade and generously shared it at a low-key tasting. Thanks Jonathan!
The beer pours a dark gold. I can't think of another DIPA that pours this dark actually. It was almost the color and density of apple cider with all the cloudiness. A good sized white foam cap formed showing the carbonation had lasted the transcontinental voyage.
The smell is very nice with some toffee sweetness backing up a major dose of super tropical fruity hops. It is so tropical that it reminds me of candied mango. 
The taste has a nice smooth sweet, toffee-ish base. Over the top, we get tons of citric hop flavor. This isn't really a complex beer, just sweet base and citra hops. I generally prefer a few layers of hops but I don't get that in this beer. The finish has a medium-low bitterness: IMO, it is too low.
The mouthfeel is smooth with a medium body.
Drinkability-wise, I think this is a very nice beer. The low bitterness makes it accessible but doesn't really move my taste buds to NEED another sip. 
I love the Citra hop and this beer is a very good hommage to it. 1,096 charactersahalloin, Mar 02, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Ultraman9000 for the trade for this growler. I have to echo starrdogg (who was at my tasting) that I expected the beer to be one of the best DIPAs ever, and it fell short of that, but still was a very nice beer. 
A: Beautiful look. Hazy, darker than normal orange and brown mix with amazing lacing and ring of foamy head. Good start.
S: Dank hops (weed, a good thing) which is great. Citrus, grapefruit, mango tropical fruit, and sugary sweet richness. Pine hops are there too with some taffy candy like smells too, and a little straw that dries it out.
T: Great taste, but not bursting with flavor as I thought. The dank, citrus hops are there nicely (but not juicy) and balanced with biscuit malt. slightly bitter back of the tongue and lemon rind to boot, and a little lactose like sweetness up front with a nice savory malt base. Grapefruit lingers long after the liquid goes down. Would love a little more biting hops to push the rating up on this as well as a little more complexity overall. I'd almost give this a 4, but really it still is great. 
M: Very dry and not as bitter as I'd like. Pretty nice carbonation and silkiness over the tongue. 
D: Good stuff, but not outstanding. This beer is over hyped for sure. Does not stand up to the likes of growlers or even bottles of other big IPAs like Dreadnaught, Hopslam, Abrasive, Exponential Hoppinness, Pliny, Heady Topper, among others. I'm a hop man though, and this beer deserves an A, though maybe its a low one. 1,490 charactersDreadnaught33, Mar 01, 2011
4.28/5  rDev -6.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Dreadnaught33 for sharing a growler of this one last night. It's one I've been looking forward to for a long, long time.
Right off the bat I was ridiculously excited when it was clear that there was still a ton of carbonation when we cracked open the growler. It poured a cloudy orangey-brown color with a decent amount of head, perhaps the perfect look for a DIPA. The smell was full of intense dank hops and tropical fruit notes, fantastic!
Unfortunately the taste came up a bit short. And that's not to say that this is a bad beer by any stretch, but for a beer so hyped, I thought the flavor was a bit one-dimensional. The dank hops really carried through from the smell into the flavor well, but I thought it wasn't nearly as fruity as I expected, nor did it have much sweetness at all. It wasn't very bitter at all, just fresh hops all the way. The hop flavor was great, but I expected more.
The beer was medium-bodied, not too syrupy or carbonated, but it was one of the driest DIPAs I've ever had. It was very drinkable and smooth, definitely one I could put down a few of.
Overall, this was a very good beer, but with the rating it has on this site, I expected it to be one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, and it came up a bit short. I would definitely drink it again if given the chance, but I'm not sure I'd ever go through what it takes to get a growler of it to get more. 1,403 charactersstarrdogg, Feb 28, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Thanks to Austin for the opportunity. Growler shipped to and enjoyed with friends in Las Vegas the past weekend. Wasn't sure if I'd have the opportunity to try this and certainly didn't expect to be walking through the MGM Grand drinking this from a wine glass and returning to the room multiple times to sample this growler. 
Growler emits a strong burst of air upon opening. Hooray. Pours a hazy medium orange with a thin white cover, sporadic bubbles, and plenty of stringy, clinging lace. 
The smell is fantastic: massive tropical fruits, pineapple, banana, and mango. Smell wafts across the room to greet those eager gathered drinkers. I spent in inordinate amount of time with ye old proboscis tentatively perched on the precipice of this beauty.
Tropical fruits present just slightly more diminished that the nose. Bright hop burst transitions into a long and bitter finish, akin to licking a pine cone. Very nice, but not to the ridiculous standards set by the nose. This is by far the DRIEST double i have ever had.
This is an absolute palate rapist. All saliva evaporates as the bracing bitterness envelops the taste buds. If this beer leaned a bit more on the tropical noted and a bit less on the bitterness, this would be a dream. It is a very, very good beer, but in my opinion is not as good as Boy King. Additionally, the carbonation here seems misplaced and just a bit off. A bump would help carry this to a higher mark in the mouthfeel.
Overall, this is quite nice and I am very thankful for the opportunity at a growler. However, the dryness needs some dialing down and the carbonation a tune up to make this truly great. 1,644 charactersBarrytheBear, Feb 27, 2011
4.94/5  rDev +8.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to jpaco47 for sharing this!
Poured into a tulip. Hazy orange color with a two finger topping of white foam. The head recedes leaving a white coaster and great lacing. The nose is overwhelming floral and citrus. Probably the best smelling beer I've encountered. Taste is huge citrus notes backed by a sugar cookie malt profile. The beer is perfectly balanced. Hoppy bitterness and sweet malt push back and forth and the winner is my tastebuds. PTY is the only other beer I've had that tops this level of balance in a DIPA. Incredible! Feel is smooth and creamy. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation for the style. No trace of the advertised ABV is noticeable: this is an incredibly balanced and tasty DIPA from Kern River. I would keep it in my regular lineup if I were closer. I will be making the drve to kern county in the future to enjoy this one. 870 charactersSideswipe, Feb 27, 2011
4.15/5  rDev -9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Solomon420 for the hookup! 
Poured into a Hill Farmstead tasting glass. Forms a nice white head on top of an unfiltered orange body. Leaves a good amount of lacing.
Citra hops dominate the nose, followed by caramel malts and an array of fresh citrus fruits. Tangerine, orange, peach and just a touch of grapefruit. Probably one of the heaviest fruit forward DIPAs I've had. Fruity hop nectar aroma.
The taste is filled with citrus laced hop. Caramel and candied sugar. Slightly more malty than I was expecting, but still does a good job of focusing on the hops. Slightly meaty with a little bit of grassiness. Hops are accentuated on the finish.
Mouthfeel is filled with a nice level of hop crispness. Body has a strong malt backbone, but is still hop forward. The ABV is unnoticeable and there is a nice level of bitterness throughout.
Drinkability is good. I would have no problem putting back a pint or two of this brew. Definitely a quality DIPA. Maybe a little bit hyped, but then again, I haven't had this fresh from the tap. A great DIPA overall and worth seeking out. I'm probably just spoiled since I have Ephraim nearby. 1,145 characterssisuspeed, Feb 26, 2011
4.3/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A growler of the new batch (from February 10, 2011, I think) courtesy of mrbubbler. Thanks! Opened on February 25, 2011.
I expected this to be the color of the sun. Instead, it's flame orange meets sinopia (reddish-brown/ochre) bodied with a nice full finger head that leaves long vertical lines of lacing down the glass. The second pour yields a fantastically thick, jiggling (like jello) head. 
Straight citrus, at first, with candied fruit and grapefruit. As it opens, tropical fruit notes are birthed from the glass. Tangerine, apricot, mango, some candied sugar. 
Taste is a diminished self of the nose. Candied orange, citrus, and sugar cookie, with just the smallest hint of grapefruit bitterness on the finish. Tangerine joins the party. It isn't as worthy-of-thirteen-lines-spelling-out-citrus as I anticipated, and I wonder if this batch just isn't as up-to-snuff as some previous ones or if my expectations were too high. That being said, the flavor profile plays to my weaknesses, and I'm rather smitten with it.
Medium-bodied and unbearably smooth and drinkable. It isn't the thickest, stickiest DIPA I've had, but the dryness on the mid-to-late palate leaves me wanting more. Some lingering bitterness on the finish.
Just an exceptional DIPA and narrowly-tailored to my proclivities to boot. I'm surprised the taste isn't more citrus and tropical fruit forward given its reputation, but it's easy to enjoy nonetheless and a lower score would misrepresent its quality. 1,486 charactersVerecund, Feb 26, 2011

T: The taste follows the smell. Lots of mango, grapefruit, and pineapple. Tons of fruit although just slightly sweet. The bitterness is there but rather subtle. The malt is also quite present throughout. A hint of alcohol in the finish. 
M: Full bodied, slightly viscous, average carbonation. 
D: A delicious DIPA. The Citra hop is true to it's name, lots of citrus and other fruits. 630 characterswilljschmidt, Feb 23, 2011

Pours a beautiful hazy orange color with a great head and excellent retention. Also has great lacing.
Nose is very fruity. It has a tropical fruit, orange, and citrus smell that is just great.
Tastes much like the nose. Great fuity citrusy flavors all the way through. The bitterness hits you after a second and lingers for awhile. 
Great carbonation level the beer seems a bit watery at first.
Drinkability is great. At only 8% I could have a couple pints and not be drunk. Just want to keep drinking this one. Wish I had it available around here.

4.29/5  rDev -5.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at Beer Revolution for Kern River day during SF Beer Week.
A: Served a hazy citrus gold with little head or lacing. 
S: Super sweet, fruity, and slightly dank with huge notes of grapefruit and citrus. I could smell the fruit coming from the glass almost a table length away.
T: Super juicy, just like the nose, with a super citra citrus taste. Grapefruit is predominant, but there are notes of tobacco in the finish. The aftertaste is almost leafy or tea-like and very bitter. The flavors are overall tingly and bitter.
M: Medium bodied, tingly carbonation, and no alcohol warmth. 
D: Super fresh tasting but pretty darn bitter, not that it's a bad thing. I was pretty impressed, but it could use some polishing on the back end. It's not the best, but it's highly drinkable and I wish I could get more of it more often. 827 charactersscottfrie, Feb 17, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5On tap poured into a tulip pint glass. Beer pours a cloudy and hazy golden yellow with a finger of pure white foamy head. Head dissipated quickly to the surface, leaving a bit of lacing. Some carbonation is visible through the hazy beer, but I'm pretty excited for the haze as that means a bit of dry hopping for this style. 
Before I could order my own glass, my neighbor two persons away from me had gotten a pour and I could smell the fresh grapefruit from his glass. A ton of fresh grapefruit coming from this beer, like if you took a pound of grapefruit and just crushed them on your face. Juicy and fragrant grapefruit peel, pith, juice, the entire thing. A bit of pine needle bitterness is also detected, but this is a grapefruit bomb mostly. 
Taking a sip, definitely taste the grapefruit, like if you took a bite through an unpeeled, juicy one and started chewing. Very fresh tasting grapefruit citrus, some wet pine needles mid tongue with just a hint of light biscuit malts, finishing bone dry on the tongue. Grapefruit pith lingers for a long time on your tongue, and really forces you to just drink more Citra beer, and ruining any other beers you may want to try unless you rinse your mouth out. 
A very good beer, but the lingering mouth dryness took away a little from the experience. Would definitely drink again, if it was the only beer I plan on drinking for a while, since the alcohol is completely hidden. 1,429 charactersnataku00, Feb 14, 2011
4.44/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Somehow I forgot to review this beer. Got it more than a few months back from Solomon420. Thanks D!
A - Very good, very light golden orange - pretty decent head retention
S - The most unique citrus nose of any DIPA I've ever encountered. Upfront dried fruit basket and grapefruit blast to the senses. Smells like juice. Pungent fragrant aroma. I can pick out the Citra hops, that for sure.
T - This is fruit juice in a glass. You almost forget it's beer. Grapefruit, tropical citrus, Hawaiian Punch with a bit of pine and earthiness and a almost absent malt backbone or malt profile at all to speak of. Bitter dry, crisp finish. No booze detected.
M - I like my DIPAs a bit more resinous in mouthfeel but I'm not complaining. The only flaw I found with this beer was it's lack of finish. A lot of pungent, juicy hop flavors upfront but not so much in the finish. Light mouthfeel for 8% which is impressive. 
D - Like I said, it's like fruit juice in a glass, it's hard to believe this is still a beer. Way too easy going down. No problem polishing off the entire growler to my greedy self with this one.
Final Thoughts - Very unique brew on the DIPA style. A must try for any hophead. For all the hype behind it, expectations were met. It did not exceed them nor did it fall below them. Very, very good beer. 1,315 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Jan 29, 2011

Pours light golden orange with a small white cap, good retention and lacing. Smells of citra hops and straw, very grassy with some bright citrus fruit, slightly malty and very balanced. Taste is grassy and bitter, pale malts but not sweet, some orange and tropical fruit hops in the finish. Medium bodied with a medium light carbonation. A very drinkable IPA. Not my favorite of the night, but this is the one I went back for more of. Very subtle flavors for the style, an excellent DIPA. 591 charactersnkersten, Jan 12, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +6.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Poured from 22oz brown bomber into a Duvel tulip. Sticker states "Hand bottled Jan. 2, 2011" on bottle neck. Able to try this brew only due to the exceptional generosity of Solomon420.
A: Hazy tangerine-peach with short, 1-finger off-white head with short retention and some formations of lace down the glass. 
S: The aroma of this beer is perceptible at least 3 feet away, if not further. It is easily one of the best aromas in beer. Massive amounts of citrus fruit waft away with grapefruit, mandarin orange, and lemon all in the mix. Tropical fruit including mango and passionfruit also make an appearance, with floral, blossom flavors there too. Pine and resin are strong, but an unmistakable component of herbaceous, onion-like aroma also hits the nostrils pretty hard. This brew doesn't fashion much of a pale malt aroma, but who cares, it hits all of the big hops check-offs: citrus, herb, floral, resin, and pine. 
T: The flavor is excellent and brings all of the hops goodness on the aroma in all the right places with emphasis on the pleasant flavors like grapefruit, orange, floral, and pine resion, and reduces the less desirable flavors like the herbal, onion flavors. This one goes right where OB Gubna went wrong. While the hops flavor doesn't bludgeon you, you submit to the wonderous array of hops flavors available in this brew. The pale maltiness plays a bigger role than you know by keeping the bitterness to a tolerable level. Alcohol is nonexistent in the flavor.
M: The carbonation is low-medium with a light tackiness and good coating quality.
D: A superb DIPA with hops complexity unlike any other. I tried Pliny the Elder this week (again, courtesy of Solomon420), and I have to say, I enjoyed this one a little more. Citra DIPA really exemplifies the West Coast DIPA to me, even better than PtE -- citrus and pine with flashes or raw herbal and floral hoppiness. 1,894 charactersargock, Jan 11, 2011

M - Nice and smooth. Crisp and refreshing. Pretty carbonated and a bit thicker. Nice.
D - Way too easy for 8%. I'm really happy to have had the opportunity to try this elusive brew. I'm really glad to drink this beer but I'm thinking that it would be just a bit better on-tap. Thanks again, Scott! Merry Christmas! 945 charactersjoshuaseresse, Dec 26, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -3.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to bu11zeye for sharing this growler. 
The beer pours a golden color with a white head. The aroma definitely screams Double IPA. I get a lot of resiny hops, but there is also quite a bit of orange citrus mixed in. I don't get much, if any malt in the aroma. 
The flavor is a hop explosion. The first hops that I get are resiny and piney, but then the fruit comes in. I get a ton of different fruit flavors. Among them are pineapples, oranges and mangos. I also get some biscuit malt mixed in to keep the bitterness at a low to medium level. 
Medium mouthfeel and medium carbonation. 
Excellent. 605 charactersMora2000, Dec 20, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 42010 release poured on-tap at the brewery in Kernville into a pint glass. The beer has a bright yello/gold color to it, with no head. The beer has a citrus accent to the pine and hops smells of their regular IPA. On tasting, you get a very instant flavor of grapefruit, with the hops and floral flavors of their flagship IPA underneath for balance. There is a bit of a sour and bitter aftertaste, but again remains balanced. Despite the finish, the beer is still pretty easy to drink. Decent brew.
EDIT: Original scoring from above review was A:4, S:4, T:4, M:3.5, D:3.5 for a total score of B+/3.9. The current grade of my review is based on the review below of this year's release.
Tasted again, during the release weekend 2011, the beer was poured on-tap at Kern River Brewing Company into a pint glass. The beer is a hazy, bright orange-gold coloring with a thin film of head. Heavy nose of orange and lemon zest, hops, and basil. Heavy hops flavor all over the tongue, bitter and slightly sour. Citrus sweet flavors balance well, and don't overpower. The beer is smooth and robust in mouth, with heavy hop aftertaste. The finish is dry, and puckers the mouth, begging for a follow-up drink. Very enjoyable and pleasant to drink, it is delicious! 1,252 charactersGarthDanielson, Dec 20, 2010
4.5/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I saw Naja's Place posting on facebook that they got Citra in on tap, so I made it over there to get me some before it all ran out. 
The appearance is orangey-golden. Looks freaking delicious. The head is nice but quickly dies off, as is usual with most (D)IPAs. The smell is absolutely heavenly. Whereas sometimes Pliny smells like a pine tree, Citra has more of a --well-- citrusy aroma...and more flowery. It's definitely more complex.
Taste is amazing. The taste matches the smell: citrusy and flowery. The nice thing is the mouthfeel and drinkability. Mouthfeel is very light and easy to drink. I could easily have had another one of these.
In the DIPA land where Pliny is king, Citra is #2 and a near worthy contender. Even though their both DIPAs, they have subtle differences that really make them stand apart. It'd be interesting to taste the two side by side in a blind taste test. I'm glad to have experienced this and would not hesitate to buy it again. Cheers! 976 charactersUnknownKoger, Dec 15, 2010

Perfectly balanced taste between the malt and citra hops. Citrus notes blow at you followed by the dryness but that's expected of this style. Nice head retention and very very drinkable. Am glad to have been able to sample this fine beer. 318 characterspword9d8, Dec 14, 2010
4/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Re-review off a growler on 12/11/10. This is much more bitter and less aromatic than previous batches. Still good, but much less drinkable, and the scores have been adjusted. I understand batch variation happens, but this is a pretty big swing. 
Main changes: 
S: Huge dropoff in aromatics. Citrus is still present, but it's less pungent, with more 'straight' citrus and less tropical variety. 
T: As in the nose, less tropical focus. Still more tangerine, pineapple, apricot than the nose would suggest. But it is heavily grapefruit dominated, and the bittering hops have been played up more. 
M: More of a lingering bitterness than previous batches. 
D: I drank a couple of glasses, but my enthusiasm waned after the first one. It was mostly enjoyment of the memory than the beer. 
Dial in your recipes, KRBC. This is not your best batch.

Original review (A+ / 4.8) 
Chilled growler into a glass. Generously shared by chswimmer. Thanks, Craig. 
It should be noted that the first time Craig shared this, I voluntarily skipped the tasting. I wasn't convinced by the hype, even as I received numerous annoying texts over the night telling me how awesome it was. 
A: Pours a cloudy orange body, with 3 fingers of light cream head. To say this thing is still well-carbed is an understatement. I'm only deducting points for the lack of clarity here, but I don't genuinely feel that's a serious detriment to the beer. 
S: CCC

Grapefruit, pineapple, tangerine, apricot, perfume. I see someone scribbled "fuckin' beautiful" on my notes -- probably largadeer. I agree. 
T: Dry, incredibly clean citrus flavors. It reminds me of the pops I'd make out of frozen orange juice as a kid, with overtones of grapefruit, pineapple, tangerines, apricot, mango, and some sugar cookie sweetness. This is one of the fruitiest IPAs I have ever had, and in 3 glasses of it all I could focus on was the wonderful melange of citrus. 
M: Medium bodied. It's not viscous. Dry and smooth, just incredibly silky. I'm really blown away. It's a little unsatisfying by lacking viscosity, but I also don't need a heavy beer all the time. 
D: This beer is amazing. I am not prone to giving high scores, and for a while I was considering violating my own standards and giving this all 5s. If it weren't for the cloudy appearance, this would be an across-the-board perfect beer. Its affordable price is just a plus. I'd drink the s*** out of this thing if I lived locally. Seek this out. 2,504 charactersArbitrator, Dec 13, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I could smell the Citra all the way in Orange County as a keg was tapped at 38 Degrees in Alhambra. Served in a large snifter, on to the beer:
You can call this faded orange colored beer magnificent, and it's not just about the lovely white rings the foam leaves sticking to the glass. It is about how the Citra hops are skillfully used in this beer. The nose demonstates this with massive fresh citrus and tropical aromas, like passionfruit, pineapple, mango, and orange. Simply vibrant and alive. 
There's little to frown about in the taste unless you're looking for just a tiny more intensity from those little green flowers. It's balanced, but showcases the Citra hops. Sweeter citrus and tropical fruits are highlights in this reel, and if that doesn't make it, the oily mouthfeel and buried 8% ABV, along with the pleasant aftertaste of sweet grapefruit and a snap of resin will. Extremely easy to drink and enjoyable too; forget the fancy glassware, throw this in a one liter mug. 
I have seen the future, and you can catch a glimpse of the future in this beer. One could argue that this is "futuristic Pliny". Funny what playing with different hop breeds and creating a new one can do. Whoever said genetically modifying crops is bad doesn't understand how biology works, let alone had a taste of this nectar. 1,320 charactersDoubleJ, Dec 05, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a freshly opened growler -- bottled 4 days ago -- into a tulip. Thanks to marisatheyounger for sending it.
Appearance: Citra pours a pleasant orange tangerine color, a bit hazy with a fluffy white head that levels off at 3cm that retains nicely and leaves a ton of lacing all over the glass. 
Smell: A ton of citra hops, very nice. Peach, apricot, mango, passion fruit, grapefruit, and orange blossoms as well. 
Taste: The malt up front provides a bit of sweetness and really just lets the hops shine through. As the aroma would suggest, there is a ton of juicy citrus here. Passion fruit, mango, grapefruit, with some floral notes as well. Finishes lightly bitter.
Mouthfeel: That wonderful well-crafted creamy IPA feel. Fuller than medium carbonation, juicy, a bit sticky at the end, all wrapped in a medium body.
Drinkability: I feel really fortunate that I was able to try this one out. Great, straight forward flavor, a bucket of hops, and a great feel make this one I would like to have more often. 1,021 charactersKickInTheChalice, Dec 05, 2010

A: Pours a lightly hazy orange with a medium full white head. Soapy, thick lace, good head retention.
S: Tropical fruit and citrus salad. Mango, lemons, orange, a delight.
T: Lemon and mandarin orange heavy, mango, pineapple. For me like a Sculpin on steroids, very tasty. Noticable malt profile for a West Coast DIPA, comes in at the end, but the flavour and enjoyment is all about the hops.
M: Firm, big mouthfeel, full-bodied, upfront carbonation. Dripping with hop resin.
D: A fantastic beer, with the hype, I expected this to be a 5 flavourwise, it's not that good, but it was definitely worth the $6 pint. 684 charactersHalcyondays, Dec 05, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +8.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Jose for getting this to me. I love the tropical fruit like hoppiness I got from other Citra hopped beers I've had so I've really been looking forward to this one. Opened up the growler to share with my Fiance as we put up the Christmas tree. 
Poured from a growler into my Southern Tier tulip. It poured kind of a murky, pale orange color in the glass. It started out with a big, active, frothy, white head to it and lasted pretty well into drinking it. The head eventually retreated to the edges of the glass, where it left some fantastic, thick lacing on the sides. Pretty much a perfect looking DIPA, I can't think of anything more I could ask of it.
The aroma has the biggest tropical and fruity hop profile to it I've ever encountered. Lots of pineapple, mango, orange and peach really shine through. It has a bit of a tropical punch like flavor coming through. Awesome aroma, I love it.
The taste follows the aroma with lots opf tropical and fruity flavors. more of the peachy, pineapple, orange and mango are present throughout the flavor. Midway I get more of a green, herbal like, fresh hoppiness to it as well. It leans a bit on the sweet side but finishes wit ha slight bitterness. The sweetness really works well for it too and compliments the citra hop nicely. Just a touch of alcohol comes through in the finish. Fantastic tasting beer.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied and carbonation is moderate and a bit sharp. Drinkability for me is excellent. I love tropical fruit like hoppiness in beers and this one shows it off perfectly. This is probably my new favorite hoppy beer. Loved every part of it and I can only hope something similar to this comes to my market soon. I think this might be a new highest scoring beer for me, and it's definitely a new favorite. It was pretty much perfect in all categories for the style and my taste. 1,867 charactersbillab914, Dec 03, 2010

On tap at Downtown Johnny Browns. Pours a cloudy orange color with big white head. The lacing is insane.
AROMA: 
Huge mango and passion fruit smells more like juice than beer

Orange and sugar cookies to start, then candied orange peel, the tropical flavors to finish.

4.72/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Pours a hazy deep orange with a fairly small head, but some pretty wicked sticky lacing is left when I swirl the brew around in my glass.
Aroma is naturally all citrus and some piney hops. I am getting a lot of pineapple and grapefruit in particular, and there is some resin there to back it up. This is definitely one of the top couple best beers I have ever smelled.
Taste is similar with sweet citrus fruits and a solid dose of piney resin bitterness that really doesn't set up until the finish. Hints of sweet malts are in the background for support, but the hops clearly steal the show.
Medium in body with a pretty sticky texture and just the right amount of prickly carbonation dances across my tongue with each sip. It's a good thing I don't live anywhere near Kern River, I'd be living there while this is on tap. 825 characters321jeff, Nov 20, 2010

I think it was Monday or Tuesday last week when I got a BM from the always generous ramnuts simply titled "Citra". In the BM he went onto explain that he had a growler headed his way from arbitrator and wanted to share it! So a big thanks goes out to ramnuts for giving me the chance to try this improbable want and thanks to arbitrator for directing some of this CA rarity up here to North West. 
The pour is yellow gold in body with a fluffy ecru head that recedes to a nice complete cap. The copious lacing looks nice. A perfect score is due!
Sweet-sweet honey tangelos sums up this aroma nicely! Pineapple comes through as well. This smells so freaking good I just hope the taste comes close. 
The first sip is just glorious. The taste really is every bit as good as the smell. Bitter lemon, navel zest, and grapefruit meat are all the fantastic flavors. Citrus comes through in spades and can't get ANY better. 
Thinner than expected and a highly carbonated mouthfeel. This leaves a lightly sticky residue on my lips and finishes clean. Why can't more DIPA's finish this crisp? 
My notes are pretty simple on the matter of drinkability. "Super drinkable!" That's all I got. 'Nuff said, end of story, best beer EVER! 1,287 charactershopsbreath, Nov 17, 2010

Pours a hazy orange with a brilliantly forming two finger off white head with great retention and lacing. gorgeous pour. The smell is absurd. It is seriously like heaven. I have given 5's before for aroma. I have never smelled anything like this. Grapefruit, peach, lemon, orange, passion fruit, pineapple, pine, and pure deliciousness. I want to smell this all day long. Seriously.
Taste is great as well. Orange, Peach, grapefruit, lemon, and a touch of pineapple, alcohol is barely noticeable. Not much pine, which is surprising coming from the left coast. The citrus here is seriously outrageous. It tastes like a grapefruit and a tangerine had wild porn star sex and created the most fabulous love baby ever. With a brew like this, docking points in any attribute is simply nitpicking. This could very well be my favorite beer. I'd say this and Alpine Nelson are neck-in-neck. Wildly good. 961 charactersHURTemHIZZY, Nov 15, 2010

A - pours a hazy orange amber with a pillowy white head that recedes but never goes away. my pint glass is covered in webbing.

T - Carbonated oily grapefruit juice. It's fresh and full of sweet fruit courtesy of it's namesake hop. Did I say fresh hops yet? I &lt;3 you citra.
M/D - Even this growler after only a few hours in the fridge has great body and carbonation. I will have no problem killing this growler sans a pint for my roommate. The overall balance of fruit hops to light malt with a very well masked abv makes this one of my favorite DIPAs. 680 charactersxpimptastikx, Nov 11, 2010

A: Served with a .5 finger foamy and frothy white head with great retention. Beer is a cloudy grapefruit. Lacing is thick and ruler-like and with great legs from level to level. Good stick too. 
S: Nose is intensly aromatic citrus and cascade hops. Pine in the back with big, bold, grapefruit and citrus in the front. Cane sugar sweetness rounds out a wonderful aroma. 
T: Opens rather sweet. Detectable pineapple, grapefruit, and citrus. Piney hop character in the back serves as a great level of balance towards the middle. Resiny hop bitterness at the end but well complemented by the fruit that moves into the back. Finish is resiny hop character that sticks in the aftertaste. 
M: Medium bodied and moderately carbonated. Very smooth, balanced, and creamy overall. Goes down very easily. The abv is fantastically hidden. Finish is messy with an aftertaste that lingers. 
D: This beer is the real deal, hype and all. The best DIPA that I've had to date by a good margin. Incredible balance and flavor separation and unbelievably drinkable. Seek it out, trade for it, whatever you have to do, get it. Absolutely fantastic! 1,187 charactersSpeedwayJim, Nov 11, 2010

12oz. pour into a tulip.
Appearance: Cloudy orange-banana body with a sticky, white crown. Thin streams of carbonation can be seen rising along the edges. Tons of lacing! While I'm not a big fan of the opaque body, this looks great otherwise.
Smell: Big-time orange and tangerine, followed by a touch of pine. Very sweet and citrus-y. Gorgeous display of Citra hops!
Taste: Orange, lemon, and tangerine once again dominate. Herbal and dry pine components are also detectable. Deliciously fruity and sweet without a whole lot of bitterness. Beautiful!
Mouthfeel: Medium-bodied, moderately carbonated, and very balanced. Bitterness is low, especially for a west coast double IPA, but not surprising given the exclusive Citra hop bill. Very smooth.
Drinkability: While I'm not a huge fan of Citra hops, I can't imagine a beer that displays the attributes of Citra hops better. Delightfully sweet and citrus-y all the way through. Props to the guys at Kern River. This is impressive! 1,194 charactersThreeWiseMen, Nov 07, 2010

I had a few glasses of this beer and was just blown away. I really didn't expect it to live up to the hype, but I was happily wrong on that score. It has easily the best Citra flavor in the 10 or so Citra IPAs I've tried so far. It was all very bright floral and tangerine notes. The beer is quite well made. Just enough light malt sweetness to carry the hops. Finishes mildly dry and refreshing. Little to no harshly bitter notes, just tons of incredible hops. The hop flavors seem fresh and interesting. There's practically none of the blandly bitter notes that drown out all of the delicacy in so many other (D)IPAs. Mouthfeel was light and fairly smooth for all of the hops. No booze presence. The beer looks good - a bright, hazy yellow-orange body with a good white head. This is a very easy beer to like and makes me want to make the long drive down to Kernville. 943 characterspopery, Sep 08, 2010

64oz growler poured into Chimay chalice.
A- Pours a nice apricot that has a good amount of haze to it. Minimal head but leaves a little bit of soapy lacing on the side of the glass.
S- Big bursts of hops, pine and citrus. Lots of tropical fruit. One of the more aromatic DIPA's I have run across. A little bit of a grassy note on the back end.
T- A lot of citrus and pineapple. A nice bitterness and a little bit of grass. A touch of sweetness comes in at the end and maybe even a little bit of honey to round it out.
M- Medium bodied with a very nice hop bite. Good carbonation and just a tad dry on the finish. Hop oil just coats the tongue.
D- The flavor never gets overpowering. This is a top notch DIPA. Great flavors and not too heavy makes this one great beer. 839 charactersWisconsinality, Aug 24, 2010

Pours a murky golden color with spotty lacing left behind by a huge, fluffy mountain of head.
Aroma is very floral, with notes of orange zest, white grapes, and straw
The flavor starts off with odd but pleasant notes of butterscotch up front with an earthy hop profile. Not very high on bitterness and the hops aren't very "bright," this one is well balanced by a sweet caramel maltiness
The body feels nice and heavy with low carbonation. Great.
Overall this is a clean tasting and well balanced DIPA that is easy to drink. The flavor is actually the weakest aspect of the beer and obviously that is the most important, but it is still very solid overall. 681 charactersalcstradamus, Aug 19, 2010

A-Pours a very hazy, unfiltered orange. It has some great golden highlights when held to the light. The appearance in a lot of ways is more akin to a hefe than a DIPA. It has a one finger off white head that retreats to a nice bubbly layer. Leaves streaks of lace up and down the glass.
S-Just incredible in the aroma department. It reeks of fresh citrus hops. It is super citrusy with lots of mango, orange, and candied fruit coming out in every sip. 
T-Like the nose, lots of juicy fruit comes through but it is not as dominant as it is in the nose. It has touches of biscuity malt in the middle. Not a trace of sweet caramel can be found in this one. It is not a bitter bomb as compared to so many in this style. I found some glasses to be at a 4 and some to be at a 4.5. If a 4.25 existed I would assign it that score.
M-Creamy and smooth. It has a lighter carbonation level that worked fine. 
D-The alcohol is not detectable. This is scary in the drinkability category. The growler did not make it more than a few hours in my fridge.
Another great WC DIPA. It falls in the upper echelon of great smelling beers. The taste isn't as strong as the nose, but in the end it is still a great beer that is worth seeking out. 1,307 charactersmjl21, Aug 17, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks for billshmeinke for sending a growler my way. I waited a few days after receiving it to split with a buddy, so I was a little concerned about the carbonation. However, pouring this into a Delirium Tremens snifter left a nice fluffy two-finger head. Holding it up to a light reveals a dark orange, almost brown, appearance. A few swirls leaves spidery lacing around the edges of the snifter. The aroma is something to behold...it was immediately noticeable after the pour and both the caramel from the malts and pleasant piney/orange citrus hops took center stage. Taste closely follows the aroma, with a near-perfect balance of the the caramelly malt backbone and those wonderful Citra hops...just right amount of bitterness, not overpowering. The mouthfeel is also about near-perfect for a DIPA....not too syrupy, just nice medium-bodied, smooth, and creamy DIPA. I don't know if I would rate this ahead of Pliny, Dreadnaught, and a few others, but it is one highly-drinkable brew and if available, I'd have a constant supply in the fridge....we polished off that growler a little quicker than I thought we would...it just goes down so smooth, with just enough hop bitterness to make you want another swig. Nice job Kern River!! 1,237 charactersNCBeerFan, Aug 15, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to PeaceLoveBeer for the try. Growler shared with some awesome BAs last night.
Hazy amberish pour
Smell is a huge hop blast. Piney bitterness pretty much dominates the smell. You can smell it from across the table immediately upon opening. I really enjoy that smell.
Taste is quite nice. A huge hop blast up front, nice biscuity malt in the middle that is not sweet at all, and hugely bitter aftertaste. The hops are mostly bitter piney and a touch of grapefruit.
A West Coast hop bomb? sort of. It certainly does have a huge hop blast up front and a biting bitter finish but in the middle there is a nice malt presence that is (thank goodness) not too sweet. Very dry biting finish that lingers for a long time. 723 charactersbrewdan, Aug 14, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5The illustrious Citra DIPA is finally here. I've been drooling over this for quite some time, and now I finally get a shot thanks to the awesome trader Solomon420.
A: Still got some nice carbonation, as the head rises up to about a finger and a half on a beautiful pour. THe head fades somewhat slowly, like it's teasing me as a pillow, which happens to be what it looks like, all pillowy there in it's glass. It also leaves a decent lacing on the sides as the pillow dissolves. The beer is a super hazy orange nectar color.
N: I could smell it on the pour, as expected. The aroma is loaded with hops, as expected. Lots of fresh hops, both dry and wet it seems, like they couldn't figure out how awesome this beer should be, so they threw both in. It has lots of musty fresh wet hops, a little resin, lots of pine, the citrus just dances around with more orange peel and even a little grapefruit, as well as even some spicy hops. The musty fresh resinous wet hops really overpower most of it. Oh yeah, and I get a hint of sweet malts there too.
T: Aaaannndddd... ooh yeah, the fresh hops dance around the palate, again loaded with fresh musty and somewhat resinous wet hops. Pretty spicy in the hop profile as well, with lots of pine and citrus hops. Again with the orange peel and light grapefruit, and some tropical flavors. Most of this is overpowered by the resinous musty hops though. Some chewy malts are present, but barely. They add a touch of sweetness and some nice body. THe slightest touch of a booze taste also there. It's pretty bitter overall, but not overwhelming. Some juiciness to the flavor as well, give it a drinkable somewhat refreshing taste.
M: Medium to slightly heavier body, a nice firm body, with still decent carbonation. A little oily as well from the hop oils.
F: Finishes even more bitter, but still not menacingly cringing bitterness. The lingering hop flavors include spicy hops, some musty hop profile but much less than before, a little citrus and pine, with a little fresh hop oils that seem to coat the tongue even. Mostly dry at this point, but a touch of sweetness there. It doesn't overpower with dryness either, which I was expecting the bitterness and dryness to just bombard each other, but low and behold they didn't. All that and the alcohol is practically not there. I think I get a very slight hint as it warms, but overall for 8% drinks really well.
So, an amazing DIPA as expected. It doesn't have the best hop flavors IMHO, a little too much on the musty resinous flavors and less on the pine and citrus, but a great tasting beer. But with what is lacking in hop flavors, it more than makes up for in balance and core design. The hops and light malty sweetness balance really well, nothing outsteps its bounds (except the musty resinous hop flavor just a bit), the dryness and bitterness don't overpower together, a nice juicy fruity flavors, just so drinkable and delicious. Due to the fresh wet hops and oils, resin, etc, this really has to be drunk fresh as expected and as always stated. Thanks a ton Damian! 3,069 charactersjlindros, Aug 14, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to PeaceLoveBear for this one!
A-pours a dirty murky brown liquid with dark orange edges with a fair amount of dirty white head that leaves a ton of lacing.
S-the nose has this buttery dough with caramel malt base up front, same as the just outstanding IPA, tons of hops take ever, lots of bitter pine, citrus hops galore, big in the nose.
T-the taste has a very light doughy flavor, notes of caramel, syrupy pine, tons of citrus in the back, grapefruit mostly, moderate bitterness that is quite pleasant and doesn't linger or sting the back of the tongue.
M-medium bodied, a little syrupy, creamy up front with lots of carbonation giving it a somewhat grainy feel in the back.
D-this has a big balance of malt and hop, the citrus comes in nicely and the bitterness is moderate. not as huge as I thought this was going to be nor as hoppy. the balance was very nice and I actually really enjoy this buttery dough flavor their IPA's have had. Very solid IPA, not Pliny but darn good! 997 characterscpetrone84, Aug 12, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +4.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Growler received in trade with mrbubbler. I've been lucky getting some of my larger wants lately and this is one of the biggest - big thanks for the opportunity to try this one. Poured into a Duvel tulip.
A - Pours a yeasty hazed slightly dirty golden tinted orange. A finger of white foam briefly lingers before falling to a thick, tight bubbled collar with uneven islands on the surface. Nice sticky lacing down the sides of the glass.
S - Smells just like a freshly peeled grapefruit. Really can't think of anything else to say about this. The citrus is just huge - not at all complex, but I do love a good glass of grapefruit juice, so this is all good with me.
T - As expected from the aroma, grapefruit is high in intensity and right in your face. Flavor definitely has a bit more complexity than the aroma. Sitting beside the grapefruit is some nice pine...thick and resiny. Pineapple, some sweaty peaches and tropical fruits are in here too and complement the huge citrus component. Bitterness is medium to high but the wonderful citrus seems to mask its intensity a bit to give a well rounded (not balanced tho) flavor. Malt is hardly to not at all detectable. This is a hop lover's fantasy beer.
M - A bit on the lighter side of medium bodied, which is a bit of a surprise, but not an unpleasant one. Carbonation is medium which seems just about right...a touch prickly on the tip of the tongue but settles to a light tingle with a touch of creaminess. Very resiny and a bit sticky feeling.
D - This truly is a great west coast variety DIPA. The alcohol is really totally unnoticeable, even at 8.0%...it is hidden really well...kinda scary. Tons and tons of citrus and pine flavors...enough to satisfy any hop lover. Ample bitterness although not in a palate busting way. This is definitely a beer that needs to be enjoyed fresh. The hops really shine here...it would be a shame to let a beer like this fade with any age on it. Definitely a winner - I'd easily call this one of the best out there. 2,012 charactersportia99, Aug 12, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a snifter. 
4.0 A: Hazy dark orange color. Two fingers of thick, creamy off-white head. Good retention and plenty of spotty lacing.
5.0 S: Big hop explosion like a fresh Hopslam, but without the malty backbone. Absolutely tons and tons of orange, apricot, candied mango, grapefruit and a host of other tropical fruits. Slightly yeasty, and you can tell the malts are there, but they get lost in the wonderful hops. 
4.5 T: Again, the hops deliver. Grapefruit and pine take over in the taste. Moderate, but soft bitterness. Lots of orange, peach, and tropical fruit. Yeasty again, but barely noticeable compared to the other flavors. Malts give a touch of sweetness to balance and not much else.
5.0 M: Heavier medium body, not the shitty watery like many west coast IPAs. This is just how I like my DIPAs. Wonderfully creamy and a bit chewy.
5.0 D: I wasn't sure if this would live up to the hype, but I was pleasantly surprised. This is definitely an elite DIPA. I just wish it was a bit easier for me to get. No flaws and lots of great qualities. 1,065 charactersDavoleBomb, Aug 10, 2010
4.8/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: The pour is a slightly hazed golden orange color with a massive white head and tons of white lacing.
S: The nose is amazingly fruity and hoppy. Lots of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, and mango. Maybe just a hint of pine in there too.
T: A good bitterness, but not quite as intense as something like Pliny or Ruination. But it works almost perfectly with the intense fruity nature of the beer. Same "fruit salad" flavors noted in the nose.
M: The body is medium with plenty of carbonation and a moderate bitterness on the finish.
D: My earlier serving of this beer was good, but nowhere near as impressive as this one. A fantastic Double IPA and a nice showing of the Citra hop. 687 characterswomencantsail, Aug 08, 2010
4.35/5  rDev -4.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bought from the brewery and brought to my house. Consumed with friends this past Tuesday. Poured into a snifter glass.
A - Hazy orange color with a finger width of pillowy head. There is lots of lacing, and a nice ring settles to the top of the beer as I drink it.
S - Orange, pineapple, citrus, guava. All of the tropical fruits are covered. There's a tiny bit of sweetness and just a touch of pine on the finish. As the beer opens up, just a bit of boozy/peppery smell comes out too.
T - Lots of citrus hops with a touch of pine. Definitely hope forward with the pine lingering. It follows the nose very well. And just like the smell, as the beer opens, it becomes a tad bit peppery, and just a slight boozy finish.
M - A rather light mouthfeel, which is different for a DIPA. There is ample carbonation, maybe a tad too much. My tongue is lift a bit prickly.
D - Uhhhmmm, yeah. This is definitely drinkable. Not the best DIPA I've ever had, but solid, and I'd never pass on it. 985 charactersKaiser81, Aug 07, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to kbm for the growler. As always, Kevin es el hombre grande!
Copper pour with a fluffy, 2 finger head. Pretty hazy and cloudy.
Citrus and floral hops in the nose. Picking up pineapple, lemon and grapefruit. Smells really really nice. 
The taste is a slight letdown from the smell but still very pleasant. There's a biscuit-like breadiness that I didn't pick up earlier. I'm grabbing some mango, tangerine and possibly papaya as well. While bitter... it doesn't go overboard, which is a little disappointing. Finishes mostly dry and grainy. 
Medium-body with good carbonation. This is a very drinkable DIPA but not in the same class as Pliny, Boy King or even Double Daisy Cutter. There just isn't enough hops in here for me to go ape over this. Still, it hides that 8% tremendously well and I'm thankful for the opportunity. 836 charactersrudylaw, Aug 07, 2010

A- Pours hazy, golden orange in color. A billowing white head that has great retention. Nice sticky lacing left behind.
A- Lots of tropical fruity goodness. Tangerine and grapefruit dominates. There is also a hint of pineapple in the mix. The hops are nice and pungent. 
T- Again, lots of tropical fruits. The oranges, tangerines, and grapefruit shine. The bitterness isn't nearly as in your face as I was expecting, but I'm not knocking it. The malts are definitely in the distance here, but I do get a slight hint of them on the backside. 
M- On the thinner side of medium. A nice dry semi-bitter finish. Nicely carbonated.
D- I would drink this for all of eternity. 773 charactersurwithdave, Aug 03, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +6.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a nonic.
Body of this beer is a hazy golden/orange color. One finger slightly off white head. Dies down to a cap of foam on top with nice lacing.
Beautiful bouquet of tropical fruits. It smells like pineapples, mango, tangerine, orange rind and grapefruits. Smells amazing.
The taste follows smell. Tons of oranges, pineapples, mango and grapefruits. Some spice, and a tobacco like bitterness. Flavors lean more towards grapefruit and orange rind bitterness than pineapple, mango, and orange sweetness the more you drink of this intensely hopped brew. There is also some subtle buttery diacetyl in there. Simply awesome!
Full bodied, well carbonated creamy carbonation, a nice hop bite and resin bitterness cleaning out the back end.
Easily better than Pliny the Elder, and a contender with Pliny the Younger for the best Imperial IPA I have ever had. 868 charactersbillshmeinke, Aug 02, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5So...I got a couple of 500ml bottles, filled today, the same day the Growler was opened, from tkunkel, as he was passing through Casper ( he BMd me asking if I wanted some of this beer called Citra. He saw it on my Wants List.) Hehe....thanks, Tom!. He didn't WANT anything in return but I gave him a bottle of something anyway....
I drank the first bottle with no intention of reviewing it. Now on to the second bottle:
A gorgeous cloudy dark orange colour, small but decent head of foam, and even some lacing. Kind of reminds me of a cask ale in appearance. Yep. Me likes.
The smell grabs my nose immediately. Loads of fruits well represented and actually very varied and hard for me to name but I'll do my best: Apricots, grapefruit, oranges, peach...could be more and man, the nose is strong and powerful and OH so inviting.
First sip, sort of, and the numerous fruits in the smell are ALL there! Beyond that, it has a dry hopped kind of bitterness that adds a welcome punch. Not much malt here but by golly, with all the fruitiness and dry hop type of bitterness, you'd *think* this would be a real palate destroyer but...it bloody well isn't! Remarkable.
The body is fairly light for the style and the carbonation is on the lower side as well. Not what *should* add up to a great mouthfeel but it is suiting me well enough and it's going to get a good score. Can't argue with what the mouth tells me. ;^)
Drinkability? This tasty son of a gun is hiding the abv like no other! No warming, no sign of it in the smell or taste. Man! This is one dangerously drinkable DIPA. From Kern River. Whom I've had beers from before and they all tickled me pink. Add Citra DIPA to *that* list as in, this is one of THE best beers in the US today! 
Another super thanks again to Tom!! 1,782 charactersBitterbill, Jul 20, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance: Best part of the beer, nice cloud/haze to a honey-straw-golden pour. Perfect white head which leaves some good craggy peaks, although not much lacing down the glass.
Smell: Second best part of the beer, rich grapefruit, oranges, pineapple, and mango. Very fresh and moist. Maybe the best part.
Taste: Here is where we run into trouble, this is a little behind pliny the younger and further behind Boy King. A good bit of the problem I think stems from the mouthfeel (more later). Its got the elements of the nose, the grapefruit, pineapple, orange, mango, etc; but not in abundance as I had hoped. Also doesn't have that great hop (not malt) sweetness that the top dogs do. Not as hoppy as I had hoped either.
Mouthfeel: A bit thinner than I had hoped, which affects the taste as well. Good carbonation.
Drinkability: Probably higher on the DIPA side due to lack of intensity, but I am not sure that is a good thing. Very good, but not best of show (or even really in the running). 997 characterscraytonic, Jul 10, 2010

64oz growler into my Newport Storm pint glass. 
A- Hazy orange. Nice head, esp. from a cross-country growler. Lacing is sticky and just a few shades off-white. Second pout gets a nice 2-finger head. Good lacing rings.
S- Oranges! Smells like an Orangina. Some grapefruit, something vaguely peppery... Unique. 
T- Follows the nose. Citra hops taste like... citrus. Heavy grapefruit, tangerine, clementine. Some white grape in there too. Bit of pine resin and some lasting bitterness. Fruity but not overly sweet. Almost get the tartness from the fruit out of these hops... very flavorful. 
M- All hops, not much malt. Good carbonation (surprisingly good considering the voyage of this growler) and superb mouthfeel. 
D- Growler? Done. As good as PtY? I don't think so... but it's damn close, and if I had them side-by-side I might be singing a different tune. It's that close... A great DIPA. Surely going to become Kern's most requested. Glad I got to try this. 
Now that I look at this.. seems this and PtE are the same ABV. This is something I'd take over PtE any day. 1,121 charactersShogoKawada, Jul 09, 2010

A - Pours a hazy golden/copper color, white head, lots of bubbles here and there, good lacing/retention, nice cap on top. A really nice looking DIPA we have here.
S - Hops, dankness, floral notes, light citrus zest. Lots of stuff going on here, but overall, a lot of hops and citrus. Not as overwhelming and in-your-face as I was expecting, which I like. It's subtle yet you know it's all there...so good.
T - Similar to the nose. Dank hops, floral notes, lemon/lime zest, grapefruit. Not too powerful, just right. This is a monster, but very well done. Really enjoying the hops and citrus...nice! Citrus/bitter finish.
M - Medium bodied, sticky on the palate, decently dry finish and very crisp and clean.
D - So so good, worthy of it's rank on here. I didn't think this one was going to be so good, but I was wrong. I drank several glasses out of the growler...probably a large majority of it. I want more! 1,037 charactersSean9689, Jul 06, 2010

A: Cloudy orangish yellow with a white fluffy head. 
S: Bursting at the seams with citrus fruits. I could smell this baby all the way from the bartenders hand. The malt mingles nicely with the hop profile. I can already tell citra is going to be amazing.
T: Wow, I have to place citra second to 09 pty . Tangerines, mangos, and oranges engulf my tounge with a very nice balancing sweet malt. The flavor profile starts off with orange fruits, melds into a nice unobtrusive malt, then fades without an abrasive hop bite. I'm confounded because I've never had a dipa this ridiculously refreshing with authentic fruit flavors. Most of the time, ipa's/dipa's have notes of fruit which I assumed was the limit of percievable fruit flavors. Alcohol is nonexistent. 
M/D: A nice juicy moderately thick feel with light carbonation. Since the bitterness is perfectly balanced with malts and the orange fruits are f'n delicious, I could drink citra all day long.
I'm glad I made the trip and would defintely like to sample the next batches of citra. Pty is brewed once a year while citra is brewed every few months. Highly recommend trading for a growler. 1,179 charactersjobcrackerbah, Jun 30, 2010
4.59/5  rDev +0.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I guess if #500 was righteous, so should review #501. . . Had on tap Saturday night at the brewery. Was amazed how much it looked like a hefe, all the suspended yeast and massive carbonation left me w/ said impression. Prior versions like I had at the Bistro seemed more orange, less hazy. Aroma was phenomenal, I think I've come to realize that citra hops are my fave aroma wise.
Taste, very good, would like to see it tame down in abother week or so (but I finished off my growler yesterday, so much for that), meaning the yeast to settle and the carbonation to die down, I thought the carbonation especially muted in a small way, the citra hop taste, the large amounts of pine in the nose from fully resonating on the tongue. Couldn't pick up the mouthfeel characteristics as good. 
Great price on these. $4 a pint. $22 a growler. 835 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jun 28, 2010

 I've had both the previous bathces, and I really enjoyed both, but this one was easily my favorite. 
 I could try and name off all the pleasent aromas and flavors that everyone else has been describing but I think I'll go a different way. 
 Just outstanding is easily one of my favorite ipas. I would order it all day long but when Citra is on tap I have to go Citra. 
 It looks more like a pale ale then an ipa. 
 Aroma brings me back to two points in my life, 23 years ago standing in my grandmother's garden and driving through the orange fields of Bakersfield in early spring. 
 The most disappointing part of the taste is the point at which it fades from your palette, which takes quite a bit of time to occur. 
 For the style the drinkability is scary good, I could end up sitting at the brewery drinking for hours, thus pissing the wife off of course then sleeping on the couch. Thank ____ for growlers.

4.73/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Reviewed from detailed notes. I had a lot to say about this incredible beer, but only typed a few sentences down.
A decent froth of white head settles firmly over unfiltered hues of orange and golden. A bit of spidery lacing clings to the glass for the first half of the session. The aromas are seriously juicy, with a great zing of different citrus profiles. Though in the aroma, I can't yet discern the specific fruits, the flavors tell it all. These citra hops deliver immense flavors of grapefruit, passionfruit, and lightly bitter orange zest, seemingly from the sweetest oranges available. The alcohol is there but only if you sit and chew for a while, which is hard to do because the beer is so drinkable. By which I mean, on a hot day, there is nothing better than a medium-bodied, crisply carbonated, and super flavorful DIPA. The drive up to Kernville is worth it for this one. I'm looking forward to the next release! 929 characterswashburnkid, Jun 21, 2010
4.57/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to Joe for sharing this growler!
Pours a bright hazy golden yellow with a small soapy white head that shows good retention and a bit of lacing.
The aroma is full of juicy sweet citrus fruits - oranges and pineapples. Maybe a bit of floral pine but it's mostly the citrus hops. There is a light crisp pale malt presence as well.
The taste is more of the same with the massive juicy citrus hops dominating from the start. There's a solid bready malt backbone which gives way to a bitterness in the end, partly from citrus but also from a bit of resinous pine hops.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with good carbonation. Extremely crisp with a slightly dry finish.
This is a great DIPA and has a ton of flavor but is insanely drinkable. Glad to have the opportunity to try this one. 795 charactersgford217, Jun 20, 2010

Pouring a mildly hazy copper, this beer is capped with a ridiculously thick and dense off-white head with exceptional retention and lacing. The color is a little darker than I'd like, but hot damn, this one looks beautiful! 
The nose is a tropical fruit salad and exceptionally so. Mango, papaya, pineapple and passion fruit are all present and by the gobful. A light sweetness is present with some sugar and caramel, but that just enhances the fruity character of this beer. There's a moderate bitterness as well, very lemon zest in character with some grapefruit as well. Fantastic stuff. 
Opening sour with a wonderful barnyard funk, this is everything I expect this beer to be. Oh wait, wrong beer. Opening with a fantastic hop character, this one is loaded up front with flavor hops with mango, papaya, some pineapple and a moderate citrus character, akin to tangerines that are almost completely ripe. With a moderate and clean bitterness, this beer is just outstanding. The bitterness has lemon peel and grapefruit characteristics and is very clean and smooth (but not as good as the Nelson I drank last night). The malt character I thought I'd picked up on the nose is mostly absent, there's just a touch caramel sweetness, tying all the components together. Medium-light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is fantastic on the palate. While not a resin monster that some big DIPAs tend to be, this one is gentle and soothing on the palate with a great finish with great balance between bitterness and hop flavor. I would like a touch more bitterness. Exceptionally drinkable, this is a top notch DIPA that I am going to have to track down again, and often. 1,755 charactersDefenCorps, Jun 03, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Huge, huge thanks to Solomon420 for getting me out a "growler" of this.
A: Pours a beautiful slightly-hazed apricot color with a very nice 
white head and plenty of lacing.
S: Incredible. Absolutely floored by the fruit presence here. Immense aroma of peach, apricot, and a bit of mango. Other tropical fruits as well. At this point, the Citra hops can do no wrong.
T: Not quite as good as the nose, but still extremely delicious. The fruit just pops; there is some bitterness in the background, but not really too much. Similarly, no real malt presence. This is just pure hop flavor and aroma.
M: Medium body with good carbonation and quite smooth.
D: Immensely drinkable, especially for the style. The 8.0%abv does not come through at all. It's simply plenty of delicious hop flavor with a slightly bitter edge to it. While this might not be nearly as bitter as other West Coast beers of the same style, the flavor is just unbeatable; I don't care what the style is. 973 charactersThorpe429, Jun 02, 2010

A: Pours a hazy golden orange with a one-finger white, foamy head.
S: Perhaps one of the fruitiest DIPAs I've ever had, and I mean that in a very good way. This has the most peach and apricot aroma in any beer that doesn't have the actual fruit in the beer. There is also a lot of pineapple, grapefruit, and orange.
T: Wow! The taste is incredible. There is a HUGE amount of peach and orange in the flavor, followed by lemon, pineapple, passion fruit, and mango. The amount of tropical fruits as well as as citrus in this flavor is astonishing.
M: Very creamy mouthfeel - medium bodied and finishes dry with a lingering citrus bitterness.
D: Goes down nice and smooth, each sip making me thirst for more.
Overall this is one incredible DIPA, and one of the best I've ever had. And considering that the beer I'm reviewing came from a week old hand bottle, I'm completely floored. I can't wait for more breweries to use Citra hops, because it is now my favorite for IPAs. If you are reading this review and have access to this beer, please trade with me! 1,135 charactersbmanning, Jun 01, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Reviewing from notes. Enjoyed with a few beer advocate buds. Very fresh growler courtesy of chswimmer's mountainous driving skills. Thanks Craig!
The body is quite dark orange and cloudy. It has some beautiful apricot like colors. Decent head from an easy pour, okay retention and good lacing. Bright white head.
Fantastic aromas of grapefruit juice and all kinds of other citrus. You almost don't want to drink it because it's so nice to smell. 
A lot of complexity in that citrus flavor, well rounded. There's a nice sweetness from the bready malts too, and hints of caramel. There's really not much bitterness coming across in the beer, just lots of vibrant juicy hop flavor. I also get some grassy/hay flavors too.
The mouthfeel is a little bit on the dry side which is kind of confusing since the flavor is so juicy. A tad grainy but it's not detracting too much. It's also a little on the thin side. On the plus side, this all works out to make it pretty refreshing.
So so easy to drink. Nice and refreshing, great flavor, almost hard to imagine this is a double IPA since it's just so vibrant and easy going. No alcohol heat at all here. I feel like I could drink the entire growler myself over the course of a few hours in one sitting. 1,248 charactersBubba83, May 31, 2010

Pours a bright glowing orange. Big frothy white head. Beautiful look, and pretty big head for a DIPA. 
Amazing, just amazing aroma. This is something very special. Tons of incredible pink, juicy grapefruit, apricots and tangerines, fresh sliced oranges, pineapple, mangoes,, passion fruit and ... maybe a whiff of fresh pine, but the citrus character is unbelievable. Just incredibly fresh hop bouquet, along with Dreadnaught and Pliny the Younger, best aromas from any member of the IPA family tree I can recall.
Taste is every bit as good, if not better. Incredible biting hop freshness, simply unreal. Juicy oranges and tangerines predominant, but tons of grapefruit, mangoes, pineapple and a host of exotic fruits ... just an amazing brew. Maybe a whisper of malt. Just the barest whisper. 
Very good fluffy mouthfeel. 
Only regret, difficult work schedule and anticipated growler expiration made it impossible to share this with anyone but the missus, who didn't really like it. 
MUST HAVE MORE. One of the finest beers I have ever had. 1,184 charactersOverlord, May 28, 2010

Fairly new and unheard of brewery, but they hit a home run with this one. I ended up blow off the other brews a stay with this yummy brew. It is the best drinking DIPA I have ever had. It starts with a bright citrus hop that dances on your tongue. Its ends anything but bitter, just a fresh hop flavor that lingers. 393 characters2ndloveofmylife, May 27, 2010
4.38/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Growler shared by Joe - much obliged!
Pours a hazy golden-copper color with a one-finger off-white head. The head recedes into a thin layer on top leaving thick lacing.
Smells of pale malts with hints of darker caramel malts and large amounts of citrus and soft tropical fruit hops. 
Tastes very good. Pale malt flavors kick things off with hints of breadiness. Joining in shortly thereafter are robust amounts of citrus and tropical fruit hop flavors. The flavors are very well balanced and carry through to a mildly bitter ending, leaving hints of citrus hop flavors lingering on the palate.
Mouthfeel is also very good. It's got a very nice thickness with grainy carbonation.
Drinkability is, again, very good. I finished my glass very quickly and could easily have a few more.
Overall there's nothing singularly exceptional about this beer, rather the exceptional thing is the way all of the flavors work together. A very nice beer and well worth a shot. 964 charactersglid02, May 27, 2010
3.28/5  rDev -28.1%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3 | feel: 4 |  overall: 3Big thanks to dgb3 for generously sending this growler my way. I've had the Citra Hop exactly one time from a homebrewed IPA and it was bomb.com. Drank from my Surly AHA Rally pint glass.
Appearance- Pours a burnt sort of orange with a light bit of chill haze and a perfect one finger creamy off-white head. A decent cap and collar remains along with plenty of thick rich lacing.
Smell- Not as pungent as you'd expect from a big DIPA but it is somewhat fruity. Some papaya, peach and apricot all join the fruit party but I'd just like it to be more intense. The malt is very noticeable as well as there is a bit of a biscuit/caramel malt tinge. Definitely not the typical west coast IPA type smell. Not bad by any means, just not as interesting as I was expecting.
Taste- Hmmm... interesting. Very malty and lightly sweet with a bit of a orange marmalade like thing going on. Maybe some grapefruit and papaya but nothing in the realm of really fruity or citrusy. I get a touch of pine every now and again as well. The malt could be the dominate characteristic in this beer though as some toffee/caramel is evident right from the get go. A grainy sort of toast is present as well. The 8% is hidden extremely well though. I wouldn't guess this beer was over 4-5%.
Mouthfeel- Nice full body with a soft biting carbonation. Probably the best part of the beer.
Drinkability- If I was to take a drink of this beer (not knowing what it was) and was told to guess what it was, NO WAY I'd say a Double IPA. Maybe I'm just too used to the big brash hoppy IPA's but for some reason this beer just didn't do it for me. I had big hopes too considering how good Kern River's Just Outstanding IPA was and how good the homebrewed Citra IPA was that I had. Oh well, can't love every beer but it was still great to try. Thanks much Dan! 1,819 charactersyounger35, May 25, 2010

White 1/4" fluffy head...quite a super looking glass of ale. Unbelievable dank aroma on this one- subtle pine, white pepper, spearmint, peach with big tropical fruit notes. Very soft and delicate up front then the mango and peach start shining. A hint of bitter navel orange rind, finishing dry with a long lasting hop flavor. Not much malt detected, which I don't mind with an IPA like this. Very, very nice CA DIPA! 515 charactersRustyDiamond, May 25, 2010

A: Dark copper-orange-amber body. Large, off-white head formed from a sizable stream of carbonation from the bottom of the glass. Good retention holds the head up for a few minutes before crashing to a nice skim and a well-defined ring. Nice coating of lacing, not sheets, but significant coverage.
S: Tropical fruits like mango, pineapple, grapefruit and orange dominate up front. A nice resinous quality. Freshly baked biscuits and bread. Some zesty spice. I also was getting a hint of caramelized brown sugar. Very interesting. Tons of hops, but a sizable malt base.
T: Like the nose there are massive doses of hops and malt here in the flavor profile. The hops are pronounced with mango and grapefruit separating themselves from the rest of the citric notes. Lots of sweet, freshly baked baked goods. 
M: Creamy, medium body with good rolling carbonation. Resinous and oily. Solid bitterness throughout culminating with a nice aggressive bite. 
D: All around interesting and enjoyable dIPA. Combines the freshness of west coast style dIPAs with the sweet bakery like malt of big, east coast IPAs. 1,157 characterscallmemickey, May 24, 2010

Poured into Weyerbacher tulip.
Pours about a finger of off-white head. Fades to a thick ring, but leaves a ton of sticky lace walls. I am talking about lacing all the way with each sip I take. Color is a hazy burnt copper orange. Fairly dark for the style.
Aroma: Holy sweet fruits!!! Tons of fruit flavors with this dipa. Mangoes, pineapples, grapefruit citrus, and oranges. This is a massive fruit and citrus blast. Pure awesomeness. The fruit is backed up with a big malt backbone which is actually pleasant with this beer. Has a nice pine hop profile to it. I am diggin' this a lot. I really don't think it gets any better than this.
Taste: Again, a massive amount of fruit flavors. Mangoes stick out a lot with grapefruit, pineapple, and orange backing it up. Lots of pine hops, but some floral hops seem to show through a bit. The malts are definitely here, but in a good way. The malts add a level of sweetness to this beer. They seem to be of caramel/bready flavored and really work perfectly with this beer. I am having a hard time finding anything wrong with this one. 
Mouthfeel: Creamy, chewy, and hardly bitter at all. Medium to full bodied for the style with a perfect amount of carbonation. The bitterness shows a little more in the aftertaste. The beer ends a little dry with lots of hops and fruit. 
Overall... Wow! I am blown away by this beer. This is up there for the best of the best DIPA imo. The level of fruit is amazing. The malts that show are perfect. No booze shows through at all. This beast is very drinkable. I have an entire growler for myself and I have a feeling I will be able to finish it easily tonight. This beer is very drinkable and everything I want in a dipa. So much citrus and fruit flavors. I just can't get over this one. I can see why this beer is all they hype right now. If dipas are your thing, you gotta try this one. One of the best out there. 1,967 charactersmothman, May 23, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Big props to Jose for hooking me up here.
Pours a hazy dark honey gold with hints of orange. About two fingers of head rises, good sign with a growler, but it fades pretty quickly, Light lacing.
The aroma is kind of light but its nice. Good balance of light sweet citrus on the front with a pronounced but mellow hoppiness. The hops are present throughout, light pine.
The taste is super malty for an ipa, grapefruit, pineapple, light hop finish, a little pine on the very end.
The feel is ok, easy drinker.
Overall, this is interesting, tasty and easy to drink. However, not much of an ipa let alone a double ipa. Doesn't have a ton of hops, so that's a little of a let down. If it was just a bit more hoppy to balance out the malt it would be awesome. 758 charactersjrallen34, May 22, 2010
4.3/5  rDev -5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.564 oz growler into several glasses. Thanks go to Deuane for hooking us up with this growler of hoppy goodness from CA. 
Pours a slightly hazed copper, with a finger of rich bright-white head. Very nice looking full flare-up on this, which drenches the sides of the glass with heavy lacing. The aroma has a big hoppy bouquet on it, full of floral hops, spice, pine cones, a bit of herbal dankness, and a ton of DEEP tropical fruit character. There is some stiff toasted graininess behind all of those hops but most of the sweetness here is mostly coming from all of that juicy citrus character. 
Those same hops blast off in the taste, being rich with spice, lighter resins, and citrus. A combo of tropical sweetness (mango & pineapple) and more bitter offerings (grapefruit) really gives the profile a biting and tangy fruitiness. The malt backbone gives comes off as more of a toasted grainy presence, offering up some balance but not necessarily a whole lot of sweetness. Just enough to really let those hops come to the forefront and shine. Very bitter and gritty finish on this, with spice and grapefruit especially lingering hard on the tongue. The mouthfeel is medium to fuller bodied, large and sharp feeling creaminess to this that fills the palate up with flavor. There is some gentle warmth to the body but that 8% ABV is really fantastically hidden here. 
You know, this was a VERY good DIPA, just dripping with hop flavor and possessing a ridiculously drinkable body for the size of it. This just lacked a certain bright feeling "pop" to the flavors that I could tell should have been there but had probably diminished some after a cross country journey. I could believe that this on draft or in a freshly filled growler would definitely get this up into World Class status. This is still very much recommended checking out. 1,839 charactersKegatron, May 13, 2010
4/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Deuane for sharing this growler with the members of Team D(r)INK on 5/1/10.
A - Emerged from its vessel as a hazy golden orange-colored liquid with a hint of carbonation and firm, bubbly white head that transformed into an abundance of sticky lace around the glass.
S - Nose is quite citrus-forward as expected, but with more depth than I had originally anticipated. A hint of catbox is present, as well as mild pine and resinous notes. Aroma is somewhat pungent and a bit lacking, but not crazy for a DIPA.
T - Heaps of bitter citrus hops with a hint of catbox quality in the middle. Overall, this packs a seriously aggressive hop bite with plenty of citrus fruit and some resin and pine for good measure. There is also an oily perfumy character present. Finishes with a sweet, grainy malt character and some residual spiciness in the finish. 
M - Texture is quite oily and softly carbonated overall, with perhaps a subtle prickle on the tongue. Finishes with assertive hop bitterness on the palate.
D - Complex for a DIPA, especially considering this was brewed with a single hop variety. While there is an abundance of citrus hops, there is definitely more happening beneath the surface. 1,205 charactersffejherb, May 10, 2010

Poured into a tasting glass, it had a peachy orange tone and a fluffy cap of lasting foam. Pleasantly hazed and unfiltered. Drippy arcs of lacing form inside the glass as its sipped. Good retention, with a lasting skim across the surface. 
Complex ultra-fruity citrus aroma, orange, grapefruit, and more... mangoes even?! Dank and resiny, i'm really digging the Citra on showcase in here. 
Hands down the most exact resemblance to grapefruit juice i've ever experienced in a beer. Almost identical to a glass of fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice. Wow. Pure unadulterated grapefruit citrus bomb. Subtle hop bitterness comes across too, leafy and green. Soft supple feel, light even carb, not quite approaching syrupy. This stuff was awesome. Thanks Alex for turning me on to Kern River... this gives Pliny a run for it's money, no doubt. 939 charactersemerge077, Apr 28, 2010

4.43/5  rDev -2.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Jose for sending me this one from the heart of Sequoia National Forest. Shared with the Chicago crowd, served in a Hopleaf tulip glass.
A - Pours with two-plus fingers of off-white foam that slowly dissipates to a chunky cap and leaves plenty of splotchy lacing. The body is a hazy, nearly opaque, golden peach color - I can just barely see my fingers through the glass. If the body glowed a bit more this would have been perfect.
S - Smells like a ton of hops! Is this really a single-hop DIPA, because it smells like there are bunch of things in here? Lots of fresh oranges, citrus rinds, notes of pine and dank earthiness, maybe a touch of chive in the periphery. The malt bill adds only the slightest bit of sugary support. When it's warm there's the slightest hint of alcohol.
T - The taste is nearly as good, with lots of juicy sugary citrus. It's still incredibly hop-forward but some of the complexity and depth has been smoothed out. Still, it's hands down quite delicious. The bitterness is surprisingly well-attenuated for the style - it's like that guy who makes a brief appearance at the party, but then cuts out long before it ends. I could actually have stood for a little more fierceness in this area. It's not quite at 4.5 level for me, but I bumped up some other areas a notch to compensate for the lower score here.
M - Nice enamel coating resins. Medium-thick body with more than a sufficient amount of heftiness. Low, softer carbonation, and a light dry finish. Very good, but not game-changing.
D - Once I opened this, I immediately regretted sharing it - I probably could have had it on my own (and then been falling-down drunk). This is up there with the most excellent Breakwater Maverick's for best DIPA of 2010, and was a little better than the fresh Dreadnaught we opened immediately afterward. Highly recommended. 1,861 charactersMasterSki, Apr 23, 2010

This beer pours a cloudy golden liquid with a nice pocked up sticky layer of off white head.
The nose is soapy, dank, and cheesy with tons of grapefruit and other citrus. 
The Taste follows with blasts of dank, soapy hops. Some mellow sweet malts are poking through, but the hops are killing it here. This is a serious grapefruit bomb. Tasty stuff!
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with a decent level of carbonation.
A damn tasty DIPA for sure. Thanks again to Alex for bringing this over to Joe's. 546 charactersbeertooth, Apr 23, 2010

A: Very hazy yellow/orange with an excellent, thick head and awesome retention and lacing.
S: As soon as the growler opened, the hop aromas began arousing my palate. A gargantuan aroma, and probably the most robust scents I have found in a DIPA. Enticing grapefruit and mango. Go citra hops!
T: Delicious. It doesn't taste quite as amazing as it smells, but it's pretty tasty nonetheless. This beer is hops, hops, hops. What a fabulous blend of citrus flavors. Forget balance, give me an insanely hopped, delicious, refreshing, well crafted DIPA. Kern has delivered.
M: Very pleasant bitter finish. Very nice.
D: A fine brew I look forward to having again. It's easy to throw back a few pints of Citra DIPA. Highly recommended. 785 charactersHuhzubendah, Apr 20, 2010
4.62/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Managed to grab a growler of this through a recent trade. Thanks. Beer is yellow and light in color but completely hazy. Carbonation is moderate which is good since its a growler. There is a lot of lacing on the glass from the white head of small to medium bubbles. Looks nice.
From the first moment I started pouring this beer, the aroma knocked me down. Seriously, it is one of the best smelling beers I have ever smelled. Complex fruit salad of peaches and pineapple and mango. Its the citra hops that give it such a floral and complex aroma, I'm now thinking about making a line of air fresheners that use citra hops. Amazing.
Like most west coast IPAs this is not a malt bomb. It is relatively light on the tongue, lots of carbonation stimulates the midpalate and focuses your attention on the fruitish flavors of this beer. It doesn't start out too bitter but it gets you there pretty quickly. Bitterness definitely grows over the course of the beer, no aftertaste though, just lingers. Drinkability is high, not as high as a few other DIPAs but its up there. Its a great example and experiment in the potential hops have on the overall character of a beer. I would recommend this in a heartbeat and would definitely have it again. 1,239 charactersdrabmuh, Apr 19, 2010

A: A very nice golden orange that is slightly cloudy. Lots of carbonation rises from the bottom of the glass and the head it just less than an inch thick of tightly packed slightly off white foam. It retains very well and leaves very nice lacing
S: Damn this is fruity. A huge citrusy pineapple, mango, papaya, some lemon, tangerine, peach, apricot and then a bit of bitter grapefruit as well. There is also a nice sweetness that just faintly comes through. I am blown away by all of the fruitiness with this one
T: Wow, bursting lemon citrus to start followed by the peach and apricot found in the nose. It is like drinking a tropical fruit salad with the freshest and juiciest fruit imaginable. The papaya note comes through a bit more in the end and it finishes with even more citrus!! This is exactly what I want in my DIPAs!!!
M: There is a slight roughness to the feel, and some heat is noticable, but the body is good.
D: Can you say perma-want! Taste wise I would and could drink this all day everyday. Hopefully i will have the chance to get another growler of this one in the near future because this is one bad ass DIPA 1,264 charactersmikey711, Apr 13, 2010

Craig was nice enough to share this beer, but then he and others at the tasting were absolutely horrified when I revealed that I thought this beer was...wait for it...really good. As in, really good, not the most incredible liquid ever produced in the history of the world. They attempted to rip up my notes and torture me to the point where I changed my score to an A+, but I resisted.
Pours hazy golden with a nice one-finger off-white head and good retention.
Really citrusy hop aroma - grapefruit and orange - with sweet malt and some vegetable notes.
Flavor is orange and grapefruit, some veggies and resinous hops. Just a little malt character.
Nice palate, a real wrecker. Medium-full body.
Pretty good overall, drinkable. Thanks, Craig! This was really good. Like A- good. Better than probably 90% of DIPAs. 849 charactersnickd717, Apr 13, 2010

The pour was superb. So damn cloudy and thick looking, the consistency of very pulpy grapefruit juice but with a more amber tone to it. Big head of white rises up but fades after a few minutes coating the entire glass with sticky white webbing that never does fade away, this is going to be a beast. Each whiff of the aroma is like heaven. I swear I did not think somethin could smell this ripe in fresh, it was divine. Rich and sweet oranges, hints of mango and passion fruit. Soo fresh it was absurd. I have never smelled anything like this before. It was just perfect. Even warming just seemed to bring it out more, rich decadent citrus aromas packed with a candy like sweetness that had me in tears literally, super soft and delicate flavor just really had me on the ground. I cold not have envisioned this coming across any fuller or better, it was just unreal. Orange slices just grip the palate and refuse to let go as the deep and fresh resin like flavor. Each sip was like gold, smooth, mellow and suprisingly well balanced, I am in awe of this beer. Each sip was better then the one before. Manoes and ripe grapefruit now coming through, papaya and star fruit, just everything that you could imagine as being sweet, citrusy and fresh was thrown in here without regard. This is what I want, every day, all day. 8 perfect my ass as you drink it like water. Three pints down in an hour as I sit on the deck and relax. Never had I had a big beer be soo drinkable.
Overall I am speechless. This is what it is all about. Do not stop, go get this, I am at a loss. 1,775 charactersmikesgroove, Apr 12, 2010

T: Pure hoppiness, overloaded with citrus zest. Beer is completely hop dominated with almost no perceptible malt backbone. Love it!

Orange-amber body, hazy and nearly opaque, topped by two fingers of dense frothy foam that slowly settles to a small but lasting cap.
The aroma is unadulterated citrus fruit: lemon zest, orange peel, pineapple. There's also a touch of resiny pine and peach. There's no malt to speak of, but the hop aroma is massive and wonderful. As it warms I pick up more tropical fruit.
The hops are similarly huge on the palate, dominated by lemon, orange and tangerine citrus flavors. There's little malt to speak of, it's dry and crackery, barely providing a foundation for the big hop character. Tropical fruit in the finish with a clean but lingering resiny bitterness. This beer was a big surprise for me, absolutely delicious stuff. 766 characterslargadeer, Apr 10, 2010
4.49/5  rDev -1.5%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5Very excited to see this on-tap at the Goat. I have been wanting to try a citra-only IPA/DIPA. The fact that it's a Kern brew is just the icing on the cake.
Appearance- A very cloudy gold. Almost an apple cider color. An inch of very thick, soapy head. It laces beautifully. 
Smell- Just awesome. One of the best smelling beers I can remember. Those citra hops really bring it on the nose. Tons of tropical fruits. Mango, apricot, tangerine. A hint of pot-like dank. Tons of pineapple. Just great stuff.
Taste- Follows the nose. There is a ton of tropical fruit. It's grapefruit as fuck. It's downright tart. However, it gets a little muddled. Just so much fruit going on. The finish is somewhat herbal and a little off-putting. More resin than I would prefer. 
Mouthfeel- It's just too creamy for my tastes. It's pretty thick. Don't always love the unfiltered.
Drinkability- Excellent. I had one and really wanted another. No hint of the 8%. 
This is a very good beer. I am very excited about citra, and hop to see it appearing in all sorts of IPAs soon. I love the tropical fruits. Just a giant grapefruit bomb, and I do LOVE grapefruit. 1,145 characterscallmescraps, Apr 10, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Citra Hop DIPA from Kern River is hands down the best DIPA I have ever had!!! It is quite possibly the best beer I have ever had. Had 3 pints on tap at the Surly Goat last night and was in hophead grapefruit heaven! Easy drinking, supper dry eight percenter that finishes like a glass of grapefruit juice without a hint sweetness. It blows my mind that it can have such a heavy existence of grapefruit notes without even a trace of being cloyingly sweet. Citra DIPA achieves perfect balance without sacrificing the overwhelming hop forward presence of Citra hops. Mouthfeeling and drinkability add to the experience and draw you back for at least seconds and thirds as each pint reveals greater depth and enhances the experience of having the perfect beer. If Just Outstanding is just outstanding (and it is) than Citra DIPA is Just F***ing Amazing! 849 charactersHopHeadLouie, Apr 07, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +5.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Damian for hand bottling two 500ml bottles (even printing nice labels) and sending my way in a trade. Tasted exactly one week after coming from the tap. Poured into a toulip glass.
A: Pours a nice orange-light amber color with a little haze. Even with a tap-&gt;growler-&gt;bottle transfer, the beer still poured with a nice one-inch off-white head that was thick and hung around.
S: Even with a quick sniff from the bottle, this smelled great. Huge grapefruit flavors dominate. Wow! Dig a little deeper, mango, a little pineapple, and even some piney resin smells come through. Malt? Nah. The smell is all about the hops. This is the best aroma of any IPA/DIPA outside of PtE/Y.
T: The taste doesn't disappoint either. The citrus flavors continue to dominate with hints of tropical flavors in the background. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango, grapefruit, lemon, apricot, grapefruit. They just keep going. There's just enough malt backbone to balance (okay, maybe not balance, but support) the hop flavors. 
M: Decent carbonation for the situation. Medium mouthfeel. No alcohol heat or sweetness that show up in some 8% DIPAs. Super easy to drink.
D: Wow. Excellent. I had to rate this down a little just so I could give it an A+ if I ever have it on tap. Just picked up a fresh bottle of PtE and will compare it side-by-side shortly. 1,345 charactersoregonskibum, Apr 07, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +2.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5On tap at the goat.
Fruity and rich hoppy aroma, amazingly powerful aroma, damn this is fruity.
Super clowdy, giant poofy white head, tons of retention and lacing.
Flavor is nice bitterness, fruity!! A little bit of backend malt for balnce, leaves nice bitterness in the mouth.
Very drinkable, fruity and tasty, hmmm time for another. 338 charactersSShelly, Apr 06, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had this on tap at Toronado (SD) and had to seek out a growler. Thanks Damian (Solomon420)!
A: Pours from growler with a substantial white frothy head. The color is a deep cloudy burnt orange color, really opaque.
S: The first crack of the growler releases a crazy citrusy fruit and hop aroma. One of the best smelling beers I've had.
T: Like the aroma I get a lot of sweet fruits like grapefruit and mango, followed by an extremely fresh hop bitterness. I can taste the Amarillo hop characteristics and am guessing the fruity hop flavors are coming from the Citra, as I've never had them before.
M: Great amount of carbonation, and the viscosity just adds to the flavors.
D: The drinkability is amazing. I know people always say this but I honestly blew through my first glass way too quick. It was gone in about 20 minutes, without even a hint of the 8% abv.
Please Kern River find a way to bottle this stuff! I would love to be able to get a bomber of Citra, the perfect fruity and refreshing DIPA for summer. 1,018 charactersPlinyTheYoungest, Apr 01, 2010
4.92/5  rDev +7.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Solomon420 for a growler of this when it first came out.
Pours hazy orange with an off white head. 
The smell is exceptional. Mango, pineapple, pine, grapefruit, oranges, hop resin, apricots. No alcohol or malt to speak of, which is what I want in my DIPA. 
Taste follows suit with tons of tropical fruit, pine, resin, and soe apricot. Just the right amount of bitterness that isn't overwhelming. 
Really nice and dry. Extremely easy to drink for a DIPA. 
Just an exceptional IIPA. I had this a couple weeks after a Pliny the Younger growler and this wins out easily. 582 charactersthickerfreakness, Mar 28, 2010
5/5  rDev +9.6%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I think my scores for ASTMD speak for themselves. I had this on tap at Toronado's in San Diego... Poured beautifully into a glass with a little bit of head. The color/appearance was spectacular. It smelled wonderful as it tasted just as good. 
It is probably one of my top 5... maybe top 3 beers. I recommend more breweries jump in and start using citra hops in their beers. I'm sure there will be a bevy of new beers coming out in the near future using citra hops and I can't wait!! Until that happens, Kern River has it spot on. 
Cheers to Kern River! 555 charactersitsromy, Mar 06, 2010
