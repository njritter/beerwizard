This was not at all what I expected, completely surprised me and the nose was really something to behold.  Bottle date 2015 on this one, need a fresh bottle to see what all this time did to it. A lot of bread, grapes, grass, wine and hop bitterness in both nose and taste. The wine barrels seemingly diminish whatever profound tartness wants to come out and punch you in the jaw. I'll drink this again and again and again.  This is a beer I'd like to drink every weekday on warm summer nights....for one must know how to make use of their stupidity as much as of their fire.  JUICY! 666 charactersDankacheese, May 03, 2017

Nose is spicy with a lot of citrus pith and a hint of tartness.  Hill Farmstead signature house character is definitely there.
Taste follows with a super citrusy hop type profile and a little grass and dried citrus peel on the finish.  Completely dry and finishes swift.  Extremely drinkable.

Pour is like carbonated apple juice, little to no head.
Smell is wine and not too funky funk. But funk fo sho.
Taste... after hovering over this glass with my nose for a good two minutes... awesome. Big wine, solid funk, and both of those carry through with smooth finish I would name "RR Supplication light" (intended as the highest compliment!)
Feel is where Juicy really earns it's name. Huge flavor and funkiness present.
Really awesome. My first HF offering, and did not disappoint in any way. 602 charactersnuggetlover, Feb 25, 2017

S - pungent straw and lemon. Definitely got some funk. Some tartness and a pointy, sharp vinous punch. Much darker than your traditional saisons. 
T - more of the nose, with an even sharper flavor. Is there some booze in this? Tart and astringent lemon and hay. Twangy orange citrus. Deeply earthy, fruity flavors and a mixture of red and white wine. Raspberries and other medium hue fruits. Kalamata olives in the finish and a slight citric acidity that might be booze, might be hops, might be yeast? 
F - ultra smooth and creamy, especially for a saison. Rich, low carb, embodies its name perfectly. 
O - juicy, not so much in flavor, but definitely in texture, flavor profile, and everything else. 824 charactersagreenman19, Feb 22, 2017

A: Pours light orange tinted gold, very good clarity thin film of fine, bright white head with excellent retention. 
S: Heavy barnyard character, fairly rich Vienna-like toast and slightly sweet malt and light citrus hops. Mild Sauvignon Blanc-like wine and candied gooseberry which suggest Nelson hops. 
T: Moderate citrus, fairly intense earth/dirt with light astringency, finishing with a bit of white wine, but also moderate bitterness and more earth. Slightly mouthwatering but no tartness per se.  A little austere for my taste. 
M: Medium-light body and carbonation with slight creaminess. 
O: Beautiful nose, much of which seems to be the hops and/or wine barrel. The bitterness and aggressive brett combine to make this a bit too dry without sufficient presence for my taste. 845 characterspmarlowe, Feb 17, 2017

love the appearance of this bottle - pour is a slightly hazy golden orange color with a bright white head that decorates the glass. 
strong aromas of funky brett, lemongrass, hay, barnyard, horse blanket, citrus peel, slightly tart, touch of peppery spice, garlic, apples, hint of oak. 
palate is tart apples, orange peel, lemon, beautiful funkyness, vinous notes, garlic, onion, peppery hops, oak, crackery malt
mouthfeel is crisp and this beer finishes slightly dry, light-medium bodied with a fluffy & creamy texture that accentuates the beautiful flavor profile. 
overall this beer was refreshingly tart and extremely enjoyable and while this is not my go to style, its easily a standout in my mind... absolutely perfect! 763 charactersHyptochrons, Jan 15, 2017

4.49/5  rDev -0.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy amber color with a half-finger of off-white head. The head settles into a halo, leaving some lacing as it dissipates. 
The aroma is bright, tart, and complex. Sour apples, grapes and lemon rind up front. Grassy and quite hoppy. Back end is full of vanilla oak and caramel notes, as well as plenty of doughy yeast. 
The flavor follows the nose. Tart and citrusy on the front end, hoppy and vegetal in the middle. Finishes very doughy and yeasty, with plenty of vanilla, caramel, and some slight funk. 
The body is medium-light, with moderate carbonation. Goes down smooth and very creamy. Lightly crisp and fairly dry. Faint lingering acidity. 
Overall, a fantastic farmstead ale that is extremely flavorful and complex. It's a perfect balance of sweet, hoppy, and tart, with just enough funk to remind you what kind of beer you are enjoying. 858 charactersScaryEd, Jan 12, 2017

Pours a beautiful deep amber with great clarity and one finger of bubbly head.
Aromas of white wine, oak and lots of yeast abound.
Flavors are incredible. So much wine flavor, so much wood, great tartness. Deep, round flavor.
Mouthfeel was excellent and kept drawing me back for another sip.
Possibly the best wild ale I've ever had. 430 charactersBoldRulerVT, Dec 16, 2016

4.35/5  rDev -3.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Big thanks to Curt for sharing this with us. The brew pours a clear golden with white cap that holds well. The aroma is a pleasant mix of vinous and lemony lactic character and mild vegetal hop mix. The taste carries forth everything listed in the nose - lemony lactic aspect mingled with soft vinous appeal and a hint of caramel/vanilla oakiness. This is light in body with modest carbonation. Overall a very easy drinking and enjoyable brew that I would certainly like to drink again but the cost of admission and rarity/hype likely put this one out of reasonable reach. 572 charactersstakem, Jul 11, 2016

Smelled the bottle when uncapped and the initial aroma was ugly vegetal, cabbage-y funk. Strange.
Then the pour. Really opened up. Hugely aromatic beer - melon first, then gooseberries, NZ sauvignon blanc, spicy cedar, tropical fruits, new world hops all over the place.
Flavor was bright and citrusy, heavy on white wine barrels and hops - not bitter, just aromatic. Hard to tell where the hops end and wine barrels begin. Masterfully done.
Loved this beer. Big and complex and beautiful. Way to go, Shaun. 535 charactersPDXAmbassador, Mar 20, 2016

T: Burst of peach, Meyer lemon, and mango is met by a delicate tartness
F: Light and pillowy mouthfeel with a lactic coating on the finish
O: As malleable a saison as I've ever encountered, Juicy takes on aspects of a tart wild ale, rustic farmhouse ale, and juicy DIPA in a very clean and well orchestrated flavor profile. While I've been nothing but impressed with HF's offerings, Juicy truly separates itself in my perspective. This was a novel beer in many regards to my palate and one I thoroughly enjoyed. While it certainly lives up to its namesake, the soft tartness and delicate mouthfeel only serve to enhance the experience. Nicely done. 865 charactersFireman_RK, Mar 01, 2016

Something almost like peach candy on the very back end with a punch of oak. M: Light, with nice carb. Very similar to the rest of HF saisons, but maybe a little softer, not real dryness as with some other the others, the oak dryness is there, but it's lessened by the juicy flavors. O: This beer is great. It's not the best one from Hill that I've had, but it's amazing. It's like a Tree House juice bomb with Hill funk. Solid brew 660 charactersAMCimpi, Feb 18, 2016

Smell: Holy hell, my mouth is watering. Beautiful buggy smell with a touch of citrus and white wine. Acid, fruity hops, beautiful farmhouse. Delicate but strong and bold. It's not overpowering at all, but it's a rush to the senses.
Taste:  Surprising amount of citrus and dryness, oak, and a bit of tropical fruity hops. Acidic for sure, a bit of lacto, dry chardonnay, a touch of yogurt.
Feel: Medium carbonation, lighter end of medium mouthfeel, drying from the wine and oak. Leaves you wanting more, which makes sense. 693 charactersSpinaltapped, Feb 16, 2016

4.55/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5This beer has been rated and reviewed endlessly so I will only note a few surprises. I came into this not having read reviews, only knowing it had a somewhat legendary status. From what I'd heard, I expected more hops, a lighter beer, more pure fruitiness. What I got was something less extreme, less one dimensional, better to my tastes. There is a ton of oak. That was surprise one. Big oaky notes. Buttery. No vanilla or tannic elements, just woodiness. Love it. Surprise two was the body; this has heft, girth, thickness for a wine ba wild ale / saison. Carbonation is a bit muted but that just enhances it's heft. The name juicy didn't conjure that for me. The darkness of the beer was surprise three; had the auburn tones that one might expect of a biere de garde (without the abundant head). Acidity is mild, perfect for the richer body. 
This is less a summation and more an observation of facets. A beer I would love to drink over and over again. Sadly, probably not gonna happen. 990 charactersKurmaraja, Feb 05, 2016

Smell is fruity, apple, funk, citrus, grapefruit. The oak barrels also come through strongly on the nose. Taste profile reflects much of the same, oak is pretty balanced with the fruit flavors. Slight hop bitterness as well. Drinks extremely smoothly, with a dry crisp feeling left on the palate. Great stuff. 435 characterscostanzo_mike, Jan 30, 2016

Oak and dry white grapes. Slightly hidden behind is a nice hop character. Clean elegant hops lead a tart white wine. Finishes with a sweet malty straw farmhouse. My favorite part of the taste. Super smooth with a light, tart carbonation. Leaves the palate refreshed. 364 charactersHootie159, Jan 30, 2016

4.46/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5A- Pours a hazy, orange/amber/rust color in the glass. A small to medium sized head forms and retains fairly well. Lacing is adequate. The overall pour is surprisingly dark.
S- The first impression of the scent in the nose is of light to moderate, lactic tartness. It almost smells like a sweettart at first impression. The middle of the smell is where the name of the beer is realized, with a good dose of juicy, and still tart, light graininess. After the smell there is a touch of lingering oak dryness and fruity, citrus juiciness.
T- This beer hits the tongue in a light burst of mild tartness right off the bat. Again, just like in the scent, I get just a hint of sweettart on the tongue, with a mildly sweet and lightly tart fruit flavor. In the middle of the drink, the flavor dries out a good bit and moves toward a slight hint of hops. That brief moment of mild hops bitterness balances the flavor before it reverts right back to light sour and fruit flavors. The end of the drink is fairly juicy, as the name would suggest, and the dry, oak flavor ramps up as the beer fades off of the palate.
M- On the palate, this one drinks just like the rest of the HF saisons, light and fluffy with a moderate to high level of carbonation. This beer is very easy to drink and drinks kind of like a juice.
Overall, this is a really solid brew. The flavor arc of tart, to juicy, to dry is a very complete and delicious cycle that also includes just a touch of hops. I was very surprised by the color of the pour and the new cap liner, but the actual substance of the beer was pretty good. 1,590 charactersboilermakerbrew, Jan 29, 2016

4.38/5  rDev -2.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25L - This is a very pretty beer. Pours a brick red/orange. Pure white head. Retention is very nice, some lacing remains. People have mentioned a 'cloudy' or 'hazy' beer, but mine is perfectly clear and can see straight through with no haze. 
S - Slight barnyard funk, citrus - lemon rind, grapefruit, Sauvignon Blanc. 
T - Tart. Slight sour puckering but is restrained. Lemon sour. Citrus. 
M - Softer mouthfeel. Slight carb tickling. Extremely dry finish.
O - A very good beer, but I feel like it is missing something. Maybe more sour/tart? Worth trying for sure, but will definitely let the other bottles sit to develop and revisit eventually. 648 characterszoober911, Jan 28, 2016
4.49/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5375ml bottle. Batch 2, bottled 10/10/2015. Served in a Hill Farmstead stemmed glass 1/26/2016.
Pours a medium copper body, slight golden hue, two finger white head with the perfect amount of retention, appropriate amount of lacing for the style. It's a nice looking beer. Smells of orange rind, musty oak, mild white grape, lemon, a bit of vinegar, cereal. It smells fairly musty and acetic at first, but as it warms up, the orange rind component definitely comes out a bit more, which definitely brings the descriptor "juicy" to mind. Very nice! Flavour is a combination of grape must, orange flesh, chardonnay, mild cereal grain, minerals, with a mild lemon peel bitterness and light oak astringency on the backend. Mouthfeel is phenomenal, with a medium body, good carbonation, a slight slickness to it that coats your mouth in that orange flesh flavour before giving way to a bit of lemon bitterness. It's particularly dry. It's definitely best served at cellar temperature. Anyway, this is very tasty with a nice 'juicy' aroma and a fairly complex hoppy and funky flavour profile. As a hoppy saison without fruit additions, there probably isn't much out there that's better than this. 1,190 charactersStevedore, Jan 27, 2016

Juicy was a beer I'd been looking forward to for a long time since I missed out on the opportunity to try the first batch.  Honestly, overall I was fairly disappointed with it.  Maybe my expectations were too high for it, but it didn't come close to my hopes or what I felt like I should be getting after trading for it.  We opened a Vera Mae earlier in the night which I much preferred to Juicy.  Further, I don't think this compares to some of the other saisons/wilds that Shaun makes. 546 charactersHookemHoos, Jan 21, 2016

The beer pours a copper orange color, light amber, very hazy and cloudy, with an off white head, good retention and great lace. The aroma is fantastic, huge melon hops, bright citrus, tropical fruit, mild funk, chardonnay grapes, cereal grains, lemon zest and soft oak. Even from the nose, Juicy is the most appropriate term to describe this beer. The flavors are fantastic, again, "juicy" is the best word, huge melon forward hops, citrus, funk, tropical pineapple, white wine, chewy oak, light pine, wildflower, doughy cereal grains and mineral water. The bitterness is completely absent allowing for a pungent hop flavor with nice funky wine barrel and a great saison base to work in harmony. The mouthfeel is fantastic, thick, coating, creamy, juicy, lively, full bodied with a dry but not unpleasant finish.
Verdict: A stunner from Hill Farmstead. Almost a styleless wonder of a beer, insanely juicy but with delightful funk and wine influences. Balanced to perfection, I'd wager this is a beer best consumed fresh to sufficiently enjoy all that the New Zealand hops have to offer. 1,214 characterskevanb, Jan 19, 2016

Has a very familiar Hill Farmstead saison aroma filled with funk and a 'chlorine.'  Taste does not follow the nose -- Orange and fruit, sweet candy, tropical with a funk and oak.  Some carbonation on the tongue.  This is a very tasty, tropical, and flavorful sour.  Seems like it could be appreciated by just about anyone as it does a lot of things right, and nothing over-the-top.  The hype is real.  Hoping to try another one of these from the cellar after a year or so. 532 charactersanteatr23, Jan 16, 2016

Pours a clear Amber body with a small white head that reduces slowly to leave some retention and spotty lacing.
Aromas are funky and oaky, wet oak, musty basement, white wine, tart citrus, grapefruit zest. On the tongue is oaky, funky tart fruits and citrus, lemon zest, white wine, light hoppyness on the finish. Mouthfeel is smooth, refreshing with low carbonation and medium light body.

A: Pours an amber copper in color, small fizzy head, darker than I expected.

T: Extremely well balanced - oak and barrel, punchy tropical fruit and citrus, light white wine, slightly acidic. 
M: Crisp and clean, super drinkable.

S: Wine barrels and tropical fruit. 
T+F: The first half of this bottle pour is funky, earthy, bitter, and heavy on the wine barrels. The second half of the pour is juicy and frothy, exploding with fruit and wine characteristics, tailing off with doses of salt and faint hops. 
O: A Top 5 Hill Farmstead bottle. Batch 2 is basically a better tasting CD11. Keep in mind, though, that if you are going to be sharing this bottle, you will want to pour slowly and evenly into glasses, as the bottom half of the bottle is the true star of the show. 671 charactersrodmanfor3, Jan 10, 2016

Consumed 5/21/14 with my buddy an hour before his wedding. Thanks again jstillwell!
A: Hazy dark copper body topped with a creamy one finger head that persists for a long time. As per usual from HF, the beer is absolutely glowing.
S: Dear God... Can literally smell this across the room. Tons of fruit upfront including mango, pineapple, and zesty orange. Tart white wine and bretty funk take up the back end of the aroma. One of the best aromas I've ever encountered from a beer.
T: Tart citrus followed by acidic white wine grapes. Brett has clearly taken over at this stage, and gives off notes of musty tropical fruit. Grainy malt rounds everything out. Not as mind blowing as the nose, but extremely balanced.
M: Medium bodied and airy mouthfeel. Typical superb HF mouthfeel. What does Shaun Hill do to his water?!
O: An amazing beer that I only wish I could have tried fresh when the hops were still a factor. Hopefully I can now that's it's been rebrewed. An extremely appropriate beer to be sharing with friends before such an important event. 1,077 charactersMore_betterness, Aug 08, 2014

Appearance - Hazy orange. A little hazy and murky looking. Nice white head. Gushed a little.
Smell - Citrusy. White wine. Bright and acidic. Hoppy orange with some lemony aromas.
Taste - Very bright orange citrus. Acidic white wine. Grainy malts. White wine lingers past the citrus flavors, but the hops come through to provide some bitterness in the back.
Mouthfeel - Crisp. Dare I say refreshing. Well carbonated.
Overall - Extremely impressive. This review is from the first time I had this beer, which was pretty fresh. I was surprised to find this review after years. It does lose its punch and unique hop flavors after a while, but it remains a good beer. 724 charactersAlieniloquium, Jun 16, 2014

It slowly gurgles out of the bottle after opening, needs to settle for a second before we open it. It's alive!
Pours a dark peach color, with a one inch head, and small little dots of lacing.
Just an incredible fresh fruit touch in the aroma- melon, orange, pineapple, lemon, some white wine.
The taste is similar, but the funk has clearly taken over the proceedings at this age. Fruity, slightly chalky Brett flavors abound, some barnyard funk, light acidity, melon, orange, pineapple, lemon, white wine acidity. A little bit of hop presence is tasted near the end, of the zesty, citrusy variety. Lingering acidity.
Medium bodied, juicy but crisp mouthfeel. For all the flavors, this is quite drinkable.
One of the most interesting and well-crafted beers I've ever had. Shaun Hill is a genius. 857 charactersGreesyFizeek, Apr 05, 2014

Score: 95
November 2012 vintage bottle served in a Darkness chalice and enjoyed on 03/19/14. Review is from iPhone notes.
Appearance: Pours a nice murky orange color with a finger of off-white head that settles to a thick ring around the glass and splotchy, wispy coating. Amazing lacing and retention; crazy cling. 4.75/5
Smell: Apricot, grapefruit, grapes, a touch of barnyard funk and sweet malt. Really nice tropical juiciness, wine character and young-ish saison aroma mix. Warms up to a little bit of lacto and PDO comes out of the woodwork into the mix. 4.5/5
Taste: Bready malt and white wine, following by grapefruit/stone fruit and a little tannic acidity. Straw-like flavor and tropical juiciness in the finish, lingering with just a kiss of funk. Really nice flavors here, blending gracefully. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel: Light-plus bodied, good carbonation. Juicy mouthfeel with a dry finish. Nice earthiness with a good light tartness. 4.5/5
Overall: Many have said this beer aged is a shell of its former fresh self, but I found it to be delicious aged nearly a year and a half regardless of how much better it may or may not have been fresh. Relative to Dry Hopped L'Brett D'Or, as aged, my palate prefers Juicy. With ample tropical juiciness, a nice wine character and a dry finish, this beer offers lots of complexity. Drink 'em now fellas.
Cost: $8 for a 375 ml bottle. 1,551 charactersjegross2, Mar 20, 2014

Poured into a HF white-logo fest glass (rarwale). Cloudy orange-amber color, with a small, puffy, white head that retained well and laced the glass nicely. Delectable aroma, oaky, white wine, grassy, light citrus and mild funk. Lots of citrusy tang in the taste, assertive but delicate hop bitterness, white grapes and a nicely defined barrel character, with a slight sour twinge, crisp tropical fruit notes, mild grassy funk, pulpy and juicy (harhar) orange and lemon lingering into the aftertaste. Very light and toasty malts. Medium body, clean and crisp mouthfeel. Complexity through the roof. I would have called this "juicy" even if it wasn't the actual name of the beer. 706 charactersRifugium, Mar 12, 2014

Pours a clouded orange with a thin white skim. Looks very enticing when backlit.
Smells is predominantly saison-y....green pear, loads of pepper, funky, and yeast with only a faint hint of tart. It's nice but subtle, if not a tad muted. 
Tastes much different than it smells. The front end is a wonderful tangerine-grapefruit blast that coats the tongue and lingers on the lips for a good long while. When the beer hits the back of the tongue it transitions into a very dry and sandpaper finish with a light sulfur fade. 
Such an interesting beer with a very noticeable transition from front to back. The juiciness sticks to your lips and front of the tongue while the dry finish just hangs on the back of the palate. Like no beer I've ever tasted. 
Another beer I feel very fortunate to have tried and am appreciative of the opportunity. 926 charactersBarrytheBear, Feb 23, 2014

Nose is fruity, light hints of brett and some peppery yeasty notes with some malt lingering in. Lots of mango and tropical fruit. Taste is sweet and fairly bright. Brett is underneath but a hint disorganized. Lots of mango and pineapple. Tropical fruits with the Brett and notes of muddled malt trough the finish.

4.69/5  rDev +4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75375ml Bottle split between some great BA friends. Been waiting to open this one for a while.
A: Lighter than expected - a tinge of cloudy orange. A gusher but was to be expected from a HF wild ale.
S: Amazing, I think only Flora has a better nose. Wine and fruit and hops. Lemon/tangerine/dry white wine. Can smell a bit of funk seeping through the citrus. Some nice hop aroma at the end.
T: Brett on the tongue. Citrus and a moderate bitterness through the middle. Wine-soaked tangerines and a slight hint of grapefruit through the finish. Complex and delicious. Hard not to gulp the entire bottle down. 
M: Moderate. Not as thin as the color suggested. Nicely carbed (could have been the year in the bottle that did it)
O: Cliche to say - I didn't think this could live up to the hype - but it did. The tasting group was blown away by this one, and I can't wait to snag another now that it's been rebrewed. 
If you have the ammo, definitely trade for this one. My 2nd favorite HF beer of all time, behind the mighty Flora. 1,030 charactersCrookdrain, Jan 30, 2014

4.62/5  rDev +2.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.75375ml split with Morningthief. Served in a wine glass.
Appearance: Cloudy orange. Gushed when served slightly cold, but didn't lose much. Decent lacing.
Smell: I hate to sound like an asshole, but the aroma transported me to some sort of ocean of citrus. So full that it's not like a "note" or "smells like grapefruit," but "bustling citrus market located on a boat in some sort of verdant pond in the rainforest." Brett funk underneath the grapefruit and lime. Just amazing.
Taste: Almost as good as the aroma. Harsh bitterness that usually ruins pale beers like this, but balances with the firm brett and big hits of citrus. Lives up to its name; like magic fruit and wild yeast juice. 
No confusing this with Russian River or Cantillon. Not minerally. Sour but smoothed over completely by big hop and yeast flavor--it's the picture of balance (like most Hill Farmstead beers) save for overreaching in a good way with the citrus flavors.
Definite winner. Worth seeking out if you chase interesting beers.
Mouthfeel: Very good. Not world class, but doesn't get in the way, and it is indeed nice and juicy.
Overall: Another fine, fine beer from Hill Farmstead. Especially interesting for the way it balances high bitterness; this exact bitterness has ruined other sours and BSPAs for me (as stated in several reviews, actually), but here it's a perfect element. Great stuff. 1,381 charactersPahn, Dec 20, 2013

M - Thick body with a light creaminess to it. Finish is slightly dry
O - Call this a poor man's Mimosa. It is a really good sour that gets a ton of flavors from the Mimosa barrels which gives it a lot citrus to go with its tartness and blue cheese funk 614 charactersjeonseh, Jul 18, 2013

A-Upon opening, this one is a bit of a gusher. Nothing bad, but if I hadn't started pouring the beer would have gone all over the table. It pours dark copper verging on red with effervescent carbonation running throughout the beer. It is very cloudy from some yeast sediment that got kicked up from the gushing bottle. A two inch fluffy white head falls a little over the first minute, but remains on top of the beer throughout the entire glass. Some yeast sediment settles at the bottom of the glass.
S- Lactic acidity as well as brett is apparent on the nose. Grapefruit and citrus is also there, although I can't tell if it is from the hops or bugs. There is a very interesting barnyard/musty note as well, most likely from the brett. 
T- Up front is some phenolic brett, although right away the flavor is dominated by a grapefruit juice like flavor that immediately dries everything out. There is a tiny bitter note on the end, although with the complexities in this beer, it is easy to miss. 
M- It starts out extremely effervescent, with high carbonation, but not over the top. There is medium body that sits right where I want it for a beer like this- not too over the top, but still apparent enough. After you swallow, your mouth is immediately dried out, and without another sip will remain that way for quite a while! This beer encourages you to keep drinking it. 
O- Incredibly complex beer from start to finish. I was expecting more hop flavors, but It seemed like the bugs have really taken over on the flavor front of things, making for a very interesting wild ale. The only real fault I see with this beer is that I don't have another to age out and see how it develops over time. 1,754 charactersjustforrazors, Jun 23, 2013

Served from bottle into a Mikkeller flute. Poured a dark hazy yellow-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount slowly. Maintained phenomenal lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, orange, fruit, sour, funk, earth, and wood. The flavor was comprised of sweet malt, fruit, fruit hop, wood, funk, earth, subtle sour, and orange zest. It had a light feel on the palate with high carbonation. Overall this was pretty good brew. I had heard lots of really good things about this one as it has quite a bit of hype going along with it. I am usually fairly skeptical when it comes to hyped beers, so this one wasn’t any different. Granted what I found was actually quite good and had a fairly good balance to it. This kept my palate refreshed and interested throughout the glass. I really wish that this one came in a larger format bottle so a larger pour could be enjoyed, but that is the nature of the beast I suppose. Definitely worth your time trying at least once if you get the chance, but I wouldn’t trade my soul to do so in my honest opinion. 1,190 charactersthagr81us, Jun 16, 2013

Appearance. Pours a rich, hazy, peachy orange with a finger of off white head that leaves some clouds and pretty lace behind on the sides of the glass.
Smell. Just awesome. Mangoes and papaya, sweet citrus flesh and melon, a bit of peaches and pineapple with a sweet and lightly peppery saison yeast and woody white wine. Oh man...
Taste. Fresh squeezed yellow grapefruit juice, dry woody white wine, orange zest and grassy hops, and some tropical fruits with a slight trace of savory herbs. There's some bitterness in the form of grass and yellow grapefruit rinds in the fairly dry finish. Something reminiscent of brett as well, in a lighter, more earthy way. 
Mouthfeel. Medium body, below medium fine and fairly smooth carbonation.
Overall. These guys really know their shit. Just an amazing brew with a very fitting name. Here's hoping that many many brewers try to follow suit with the type of saisons being put out by this place. I would buy this by the case on a weekly basis if I could ...which makes me ask why the hell can't I??? Thanks again Franklinn, awesome of you to hook me up! 1,174 charactersRutager, Mar 06, 2013

A - Pours an apricot orange with a slight off-white head
S - A balance of white wine, citrus and grass. The wine faded more into the citrus side as it warmed ,very enjoyable
T - So much going on between the wine characteristics transitioning into the citrus with a funk added in. All of the flavors play off each other very well. What I want from a more "rustic" HF offering. I think the dried grass portion adds a lot to the finish
M - Smooth with a fair amount of carbonation
O - The layers are amazing and keep going. I was pleased how the beer changed over the 30 minutes of drinking with different profiles emerging. I would have liked more citrus but this is being picky. This was my first HF barrel offering and can't wait to try many more. 792 characterslangchops, Feb 18, 2013

Nose is a lot of wine barrel and brett, some tart citrus character (mandarin oranges?) too. More wine and brett than hops though.
Taste is also big on wine, lots of dry grape skin, tart and a bit of bretty funk but this is more dry than acidic. Pretty bitter, some grapefruit and orange from the hops.
This is a great beer for sure, but maybe not quite what it's hyped up to be. This was the rarest of the HF saisons/sours we opened last night but IMO not the best one.

Acquired via trade
Thanks, mkabull!
This one does gush upon opening! Be warned!
Burnt apricot or peach flesh in color with a quickly forming, creamy off-white head of very small bubbles. Nice retention and this leaves messy lacing. Very pretty saison.
Definite citrus in the aroma, along with a concentrated, rotting fruit character (in a good way!), a mild to moderate funk character, and a bit of a champagne or white wine character that's tough to describe but definitely adds to the overall enjoyment and complexity of the aroma.
The flavor follows suit, though the flavor is more balanced than the aroma, as the (rotting, strong) citrus character is tamed down nicely by the complex, earthy funk, and champagne/white wine flavors. Some brick flavor as well, which adds nicely. This is delightful.
Medium bodied with high carbonation.
A lovely, enjoyable saison from Hill Farmstead. Shocking! 917 charactersehammond1, Feb 14, 2013

A~ glowing orange hazy amber, with minimal smooth head.

T~ straight pineapples up front with the mouthfeel of pineapple juice kind of like 5GR without the booze. nice funk, peppery saison, and amazing bitterness from the hops on the finish,
M~ smooth with perfect carbonation in my opinion. a lot like the texture of pineapple juice.

Slow gusher as I pop the cap. Nothing big, but have a glass at the ready. Pour yields a deep peach-colored brew with a nice two-finger white head. Good retention and plenty of lacing as it goes down. Thin cap throughout.
The initial nose provides a good dose of honeydew alongside tropical fruit. Mild funk and white-wine character in the background. Touch of citrus rind and very light straw.
Flavor is incredible. Absolutely fantastic. Notes of melon and white wine overlay a very light acidity. Just a touch of oak in the background as well as some mild underlying Brett. 
Body is light with a mild underlying bitterness. Acidity is quite light and is more along the lines of a mild citrus character rather than straight lactic acid. There's a touch of creaminess in the background. Perhaps not creamy, but just a bit of wheat character. 
Overall, on the level with the best Hill Farmstead beers. Phenomenal, to say the least. Can we officially name Hill Farmstead the best brewery in the world? 1,082 charactersThorpe429, Jan 25, 2013

Moderate pour yields a 1/2 inch head that is gone in a few minutes with a thin ring to the end. Fairly clear and bright, light amber body. Nose of citrus, oak, slight straw/hay, and even slighter champagne vinegar. Taste follows with pink grapefruit and a very nice champagne-like dryness. Nice mouth feel with a nice, dry finish of yellow grapefruit. Overall, yes; I could drink this for days on end! 437 charactersbobv, Jan 22, 2013

Don't delay - she's a little of a slow and steady gusher. A hazed peach body and a thick creamy white head with sticky retention. Aromas of musty yeast, melon, and distant citrus. The flavor profile improves off the nose - featuring melon, grapefruit, yeast, white pepper, orange, brett. The wine barrel is light - really not much wood but a bit of a tannic finish. Expectations are naturally sky high for Hill Farmstead, so this was a little underwhelming but still a really nice saison. 554 charactersdirtylou, Jan 13, 2013

Memories of The PJs doesn't help my initial perception of this bottle... Anyway, this stuff pours a hazy amber-gold topped by a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises grapefruit peel, light mango, light leek, light-ish fruity Brett, light banana peel, and a twinge of buttery caramel. The taste holds notes of tart grapefruit zest, sour white grapes (a white wine varietal I can't pin down), light earthy greens, mandarin orange, and lemon zest. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a dry, lightly sticky finish. Overall, a very nice beer, one that sees a keen marriage of base, extra hops, and barrel. Good times. 683 charactersTMoney2591, Jan 07, 2013

4.32/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle shared by Ryan. Served in a Russian River tulip.
A - White foam settles to a thin cap, thick collar, and splotchy lacework. Murky, peach flesh-colored body.
S - An intriguing mixture of white wine, zesty ctirus hops, mildly tropical funkiness, light grass and herbs, sweet malts, and a hint of oak.
T - The taste loses some of the hop complexity, and fills out the palate with more vinous and sweet malty flavors, along with mild tropical brett flavors. Some of the earthy and herbal qualities persist, and there's again a light oak presence. Closer to a 4.25 here, do I dinged the drinkability a bit.
M - Medium body, appropriately juicy texture, and a soft but sufficient moderate carbonation level. No alcohol presence, and a lightly tannic and dry finish.
D - Another well-executed beer from Hill Farmstead. It didn't blow my mind, but the marriage of hops and yeast is finely wrought and the beer is eminently drinkable at 7.4%. I kind of liked things better when I didn't have to fight for 2oz of Shaun's beers at a tasting. Better than CD #3, and roughly on par with CD #1. 1,092 charactersMasterSki, Dec 30, 2012

375ml bottle into Hill Farmstead stemware. Thanks! Look out, this is a slow gusher.
A: Dark golden orange and hazy with a finger of mousse-like foam that rapidly recedes, leaving scattered lacing. 
S: The aroma brings to mind mineral, wet leather, grass, and musty barnyard characteristics. The hops impart lemon, orange, white grape, and melon. A peppery spiciness pervades the olfactory, blending nicely with citrus zest. Tangerine is pronounced. There's a light woody quality.
T: Up front tartness segues into a pleasant midpalate pixie stix sweetness. This tantalizing sweet-tart sensation persists. Fruit abounds, reminiscent of orange, grapefruit, and lemon. Lightly peppery with leather, grass, earth, oak, and brackish notes. There's a low level of bitterness throughout. The finish is mildly tannic with lingering notes of leather, lemongrass, and tangerine.
M: Medium body with lower medium carbonation. The carbonation is interesting in that it was high initially but it seemed to quickly disappear. The mouthfeel is dry, sticky, and tannic.
Overall: The combination of New Zealand hops and Saison makes for a unique and refreshing beer. I wish this 375ml bottle would double in size. 1,212 charactersHopHead84, Dec 27, 2012

A- A beautiful warm orangey amber color. Pours with a nice foamy white head and plenty of lacing. Pretty crisp and clean.
S- A strong smell of funky bret, tangerine, and peachy fruity smells. Wow!
T- the initial flavor is very funky and bretty , it quickly transitions to more of a peppery saison flavor. The aftertaste is nice fruity hops with touches of orange and lemon rind. Definitely a baby mimosa of sorts.
M- as always from Hill Farmstead it is spot on.
O- the diversity in flavor is just incredible. If you love funky bretty beers, this should be a must have. The citrus and hops just compliment each other extremely well. 662 charactersGfunk720, Dec 27, 2012

Milky white top, classic HF milky and tight bubbles make the pour and cap. Always leaves a nice 2-3mm puck. Body color is a dull peach orange, and opaque quite hazy.
Bouquet hits hot and sharp. Big brett funk, mixing with large aromatic peaches and fruit. Mellows out with a nice to aptly described heat and tropical juicy fruit action. Lots of pineapple, and yellow tropic sensations. More of a punch tropic than an actual beer, just that hint of classic big funk brings you back. Smells amazing. A few drops spill on my hands, and my fingers smell like liquid bread, just incredible.
What an impressive palate. Fruit punch action, and tropical pineapple abounds. Huge juice finish with large peppery sensing spice. Bread and toasty sourdough explode in the aftertaste all over. A good controlled burst of heat, but nothing boozy. Incredibly.. truly.. juicy palate, mouth coating and full, but light and not thick. Lemon, pineapples, peaches oh my.. throw in some farmhouse big bold goodness and it's mouthwatering.
I am not one for tropical notes, I am even less one of a fan for pineapple flavors, but this is just unreal. Borderline blurring drink. Great saison, great Hill Farmstead stuff. Stupidly drinkable... MORE! 1,311 characterssmakawhat, Dec 18, 2012

The aroma is loaded with tangerine citrus. In addition, notes of brett and tropical fruit are also present.
Each sip of this medium bodied beer is soft, a little watery with mild carbonation. The flavor is tart with orange and tangerine citrus. Some grapes appear in the middle along with a touch of tropical fruit. It finishes a little salty (? maybe it's just me). Once gone the tart flavor and tangerine citrus lingers on the palate.
This is an easy drinking beer with lots of aroma and flavor. An interesting combination of tartness and citrus hops. 702 charactersWanderingFool, Dec 16, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Two 375ml bottles opened at once and split three ways, purchased at the brewery 2-3 weeks ago. Poured into HF stemmed glass. Slight gusher when opened, nothing too bad though.
A- Pours a slightly organish brownish red that is slightly translucent with a bit of haze. About a finger's worth of head that fades pretty fast to a fairly bubbly, but mostly flat surface that leaves some clingy lacing. On close inspection of one of the bottles there is some definite small white sedimentation specs floating around (similar to what you would find from a poured Heady Topper). Overall an interesting appearance, a little bit darker then expected but has a nice glow.
S- Funky, citrusy, tart, earthy aromas of citrus hops, sour lemons, grapefruit, chardonnay, limes, bretty funk, and a light presence of what some people might refer to as wet-horse blanket or sweaty gym clothes. As it settles for awhile the funk fades a little bit and more earthy tones come out. Fairly aromatic and reminds me a little bit of a hoppy/citrusy Beatification that is slightly less funky.
T- Hops balance nicely with the sour/funk aspects of the beer to provide tastes of sour lemons, grapefruit, some melons, a hint of lime, some light bretty funkiness, sour finish with a slight presence of citric acid. Lingering aftertastes of sour lemons and a bit of brett. A little less funky but a bit more sour then the nose. As it settles for awhile sourness dies a little bit and a little bit more earthy brett comes out.
M- Medium bodied, juicy with a dry finish, fairly minimal carbonation but leaves a tingly sensation that makes it feel more carbonated then it actually is, fairly high drinkability.
O- This was a very interesting, complex saison. It was definitely funkier then I was expecting but it balanced nicely with the citrus hops presence which lended a little bit of a Juicy quality as you would expect from the name. There was definitely a hint of Mimosa in this that provided a little bit lemon. I would definitely recommend trying this beer out especially if you like beers with a little bit more funk to them. It'll be interesting to see how this one ages. 2,148 charactersjaasen64, Dec 14, 2012

375ml bottle poured into (what else) a Hill Farmstead balloon glass.
Appearance: Well-chilled bottle gushes up very slightly on open, though not as bad as the rumors. Color is somewhere between a dirty gold and a dark orange. Head is surprisingly thin, though I poured it tenderly after the bit of gushing. Great lacing.
Smell: Grapefruit and a strong brett-y funk dancing together in my nose. Hops are there, and prominent for the style, but take a backseat. If I strain I can get the oak.
Taste: Tastes like it smells. The grapefruit and brett have found their perfect match. Citrus flavored hops on the backend are potent, but the lingering aftertaste is brett. Oaky, earthy, barnyard/hay, and fruit. Not sour at all, just funky, and a slight tart from the wine.
Drinkability: Really high. I only have one bottle, but I would buy this by the 6-pack if I could. 
Mouthfeel: Moderate to high carb, medium body, a bit sticky on the back.
Overall: I'm not really sure what this beer is. Part saison, part Belgian IPA, part wild ale, but all good. It's very unique, and like most everything HF does, it's awesome. But, I feel Juicy only falls somewhere around average for HF. Chase after it if you are a brett fiend, but otherwise you could do just as well with their other saisons. 1,367 characterscbeer88, Dec 14, 2012

Pours a light, thin white ring of carbonation. Beer is clear bronze. Spotty lace with decent stick. Not great for the style. 
Nose is passion fruit, citrus, pineapple, and other tropical fruit with cane sugar sweetness. Really good!
Opens yeasty. Citrus, passion fruit, light tartness balanced by a mild, yeast and hop bitterness. Big tropical fruit notes throughout make this one almost IIPA like but with a saison-y spicy finish. Interesting. 
Light bodied with ample carbonation. Spritzy in the mouth and crisp and quenching going down. Dry finish with a dry aftertaste. Very good. 
Pretty good overall and just like mimosa, very aptly named. However, also like mimosa, I wouldn't rank this among the best saison's HF makes. Flavor profile is interesting but this just doesn't stand out to me. I'm glad I got to try it but I wouldn't go through the trouble of seeking this out myself. 994 charactersSpeedwayJim, Dec 09, 2012

Note: you really gotta let this baby warm up to let it shine.
A: Beautiful shade of vibrant golden orange. Largest head I've ever seen in a beer. Fizzy, foamy, bubbly, bright white. One of the longest lasting heads, as well. Never really goes away with great retention and lace. This deserves more than a 5.
S: Very complex. Bursts of ripe, sour fruit. Fizzy, chalky, densely sweet sugar. Funk and wood. Some citrus and the NZ hops if you grt deep. Give it a stir and the aromas explode again. I found my nose buried in this for minutes at a time. A pleasure for the senses. I've honestly never spent more time smelling a beer in my life. Again, higher than a 5.
T: Oh yeah, I get to drink this beer, too! Everything in the nose but fruitier, hoppier, a bit funkier and very dry.
M: Perfect carbonation, very dry and fruity, but a bit chalky and cloying. It's going to be hard to enjoy other beers of this style after this near perfection.
O: I'd say it's more of an American Wild than a Saison. Worth the hype but that's easy for me to say because I was able to easily acquire a bottle. I was expecting it to change my life and it didn't, but it definitely blew my mind. Fantastic beer. 1,249 charactersGatch, Dec 08, 2012

Lots of funk in the nose. Some citrus fruits combine with brett to form the aroma backbone. Can't really smell any wine barrel.
Very fruity and funky taste as well. I get some white wine components that were absent in the aroma. Good grape and orange notes along with brett and a few spices. Very smooth throughout as no one component overpowers. Not very sour at all, just funky.
Medium to light bodied with medium carbonation. A little bit slick and oily and goes down smooth.
Very well made beer, but not worth giving up an arm and a leg so thanks to chippo for the great trade. For Hill Farmstead frame of reference, I enjoyed this more than Mimosa, but still not anywhere as good as b3 Flora. 808 charactersjmarsh123, Dec 06, 2012

A: different throughout dark almost brown toward the top with some dark golden honey color toward the bottom with a white fluffy head. It is quite cloudy and almost completely opaque 
S: you can really smell that barnyard funk from the yeast it is quite pungent there is lots of citrus smell as well mostly oranges. There is also clear hints of oak and white wine scents to round out the smell.
T: it tastes juicy with citrus and orange flavor really coming through with a sweet taste with that has the funky wine barrel taste. It is not really sour, rather there is a more fruity taste very drinkable. It is perhaps the best example of a beligan yeasty wild aged in wine barrels that I have tried.
M: clean crisp with light carbonation very easy to drink a little but oily but basically perfect for a wild ale 
O: great tasting wild ale with a phenomenal mouthfeel only downside is the lack of smell and weird coloring but other then that its a really high quality offering from hfs. Yet again they know what they are doing doing drink it if you can. 1,083 charactersPinknuggets, Dec 05, 2012

Cloudy, hazy, gold with a huge fluffy head. Others have reported a gusher, this bottle did no such thing. phew.
There is a nice mustiness to it. There is also a fruitiness I just can't quite place. There is some funky scent in there, a band aid plastic...it all works well together, I'm not a professional at this so my descriptors may be off, but trust me...it works.
There is a lot going on here. Hops start out and a milky, tart finish follows. Again, it's hard for me to describe, but it works.
Rather creamy and well..Juicy. It's kind of like a saison on hop steroids. Feels oh so smooth in the mouth with just a touch of dryness as I swallow.
Really a fantastic beer stretching the boundaries of saison and wild ale. Really an awesome beer. I think I may have enjoyed CD 5 a touch more...but, Shaun is fucking killing it! 868 charactersDaveHack, Dec 01, 2012

Poured into new belgian globe from 350 bottle, be careful, mine was a gusher.
a- poured a beautiful hazy golden peach, about a half inch of clean white head. I haven't seen a beer quite this color before. Nice lacing as well.
s- lots of citrus on the nose, lots of brett tartness but without the plastic or band aid smells some people associate with brett. Some hops come through as well, but the brett makes my mouth water, so on with the show...
t- first sip, holy cow, reminds me of biting into a fresh grapefruit. Lots of bright citrus tartness with the hops balancing things out well. I can't decide if I should sip and savor this or chug this right now! Amazing flavors, I can't get enough. 
m- silky smooth mouthfeel, the head adds a velvet like feel to the tart flavors. Exactly what I expected.

The smell is a deep brett funk with a small hint of tartness.
The initial taste is huge brett, slightly bitter.
It finishes like taking a huge bite out of a Florida orange on a hot summer day at the beach with the best of friends.

Pours a hazy and dull golden amber with a thin off white head. Acidic aroma of lemon and wine with some leafy tropical hops and grass.

Notes of Mimosa's citrus flavor are present but tempered in a welcomed way.

Beer pours a very hazy golden-orange with a big white head. Gusher alert - this started pouring out of the bottle immediately. Smell is a fantastic blend of wine barrel, brett and hops. It reminds me a lot of E. in a good way. Flavor follows the nose as all the same elements are present in wonderful balance. The wine barrel and brett hit you first, but it's got a great citrus character that emerges halfway through followed by a fairly bitter, orange-rindy hoppy finish. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied and mouth-coating, really quite nice. Overall this is a really well-done, complex saison that's one of Hill Farmstead's best. I'd say it's right up there with CD1 and E. It kinda comes off like a junior version of Mimosa that incorporates all of its elements even better. Well done Shaun! 836 charactersstarrdogg, Nov 30, 2012
4.57/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 512oz bottle purchased at the brewery and poured / gushed into a gulden drak tulip glass.
Appearance: Pours between russet and a cloudy dirty copper penny with a 1.5 finger white crown that shows some retention and lace. 
Smell: Mainly band aid and plastic (reduced quite a bit when the beer warmed up more) from the brett that comes off like a milder version of the smell that crushed stink bugs make with some tropical fruit notes (apricot, mango, tangerine, and grapefruit) from the hops. As the beer warms the stink bug juice transforms magically into a light funk level of brett. I'd give this one a 4.25 if I could so I'm rounding up a bit.
Taste: More enjoyable than the nose in my opinion. The yeast character is much more prominent and is very well integrated with the malt and hops. In addition to a light funk up front, that oh so lovely brett derived lemon note appears in the finish too. The hops definitely play a bit more of a supporting role in this beer than I expected them to. I get some white wine character similar to Nelson Sauvin in the hop profile as well, but I believe that is coming from the mimosa barrel used, since I believe it was a white wine barrel that also housed some citrus (orange rind). 
Mouthfeel: Light side of medium bodied with medium carbonation comprised of very soft billowy bubbles. Not as dry as I expected and that might actually be a good thing.
Overall: I would drink this beer constantly if I had the opportunity. What a lovely hoppy wild saison. The flavors are so well layered and compliment each other fantastically. Truly gestalt in nature. Kudos to Hill Farmstead for making such a progressive and delicious beer! The hops combined with the brett is what makes this one truly special so consuming it fresh is a big factor in having the experience I've outlined. 1,822 characterskoopa, Nov 27, 2012
5/5  rDev +10.9%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is simply a beautiful beer, top to bottom. It is easily one of my top beers, if not my top beer. 
It was a gusher, so be prepared with a glass. The half ounce of beer spilled on the bar was truly tragic.
This beer is listed as "0 ICUs", which means there is no "citrus zest" added to the beer. That's surprising, as the first thing you notice in the aroma is citrus fruit everywhere. The taste follows, with a barrage of oranges, apricots, and peaches. It continues and builds along with a lurking bitterness from the New Zealand hops. Towards the back end, an explosion of multi-layered Brettanomyces sensation starts, reminiscent of Orval. It finishes with a combination of that Orval-esque Brett flavor and orange citrus. It's aged in Mimosa barrels, which had 500 ICUs if I remember correctly, so the fruit flavors that I was lucky enough to taste in Mimosa are certainly present in Shaun Hill's "mini-Mimosa" here in Juicy.
Don't take any of this to mean that the beer is one-note citrus. It's not. Between the sufficient amount of hops to keep a lurking bitterness, the intricate flavoring of Brettanomyces in the back end, and the citrus flavor, it combines to make a truly world-class and wonderful beer. Everyone was absolutely blown away by this beer. It'd be on my short "desert island" list for sure. 1,320 charactersFranch, Nov 26, 2012

Pour: Deep, hazy blood orange. Body is nearly radient with color. A really nice two finger, off white head forms. The head hangs around for a little while, eventually leaving lots of sticky lacing, and a film. 
Smell: Funk to start which is then overpowered by a wealth of juicy grapefruits and mangos. Some lemon zest. A deep must throughout the nose. Some white wine and oak at the end.
Taste: Up front is a HUGE burst of grapefruit, passion fruit, grape must, and mangos. A really clean funk accompanies along with a refreshing tartness. The wine barrel presence is quite evident throughout, and provides a distinct oakeyness. A slight bitterness comes out at the end in the form of citrus juice, along with a slightly bready sweetness. The finish is dry with oak.
Mouthfeel: Well, the feel is... juicy. Clean tartness that is not puckering, but very refreshing. Medium bodied. The dry finish is incredibly refreshing. This beer is a sipper, simply because there is SO much going on in taste.
Overall: This is the new best beer I've ever had. I'm not sure this even needs age, because I don't see how it can improve. Perfection. 1,202 characterscfrances33, Nov 25, 2012

Great stuff. Best HF (or any) saison I have tried so far. As others have noted it was a gusher, have a glass ready 441 characterss1ckboy, Nov 24, 2012

4.95/5  rDev +9.8%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Happy Thanksgiving! 375ml bottle 8 days after release poured into HF stemware. Gushes out so be ready with your glass upon opening.
A: Burnt sunset orange - it looks Juicy! More than an finger of off white foam dissipating to half a finger or so that remains. Nice chunks of lacing even early on. Cloudy, opaqueness with bits of yeast and other barrel buddies settling to bottom. Tiny bubbles frolic.
S: Funky and bright. Citrus/lemon zest aromas of the NZ (riwaka?) hops. Musty but invogorating as opposed to dank. Orange! Perhaps it's Mimosa lineage coming through? Either way it's fantastic.
T: Tart, but not sour per se. Strong citrus flavors. Slight peachiness? A blast of yeast and brett appear mid palate and meld well with the creeping bitterness. A lot going on here, but somehow Shaun and Co. have managed to optimize and it comes off flawlessly. Delicious.
M: Refreshingly, zesty, light at first. Slight creaminess weaving with some dryness as the finish approaches. Upon swallowing your mouth and mind want another sip! Never becomes heavy, cloying or overbearing.
O: Saison? American Wild Ale? I'd say some where in between and encompassing the best of both worlds. What can I say that hasn't been said of HF. I'm so happy I live in New England. I haven't had Ann, but I probably prefer this over Mimosa. If you get the chance to drink Juicy do it--early and often! 1,383 charactersjraras, Nov 22, 2012

4.92/5  rDev +9.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My favorite of Shaun's saisons/wilds yet. A fantastic mix of Belgian saison and an American wild - It certainly crosses stylistic lines with ease.
Warning!! This is a gusher! I lost about a half an ounce of this liquid gold and after tasting it I was in mourning for the rest of the evening;) 
A bright orange glowing liquid when my snifter is held up to the light. Bubbles are supercharged to begin with before quickly taming down. A thin white head is left on the glass with a slight sticky lace from the preponderance of New Zealand hops used balanced perfectly with lightly roasted malt.
Wow! Holy shit!!! I can't believe that this beer doesn't contain fruit!!! Nose of tangerine, lemon, apricot, peach. Damn!
The taste follows through on the nose with the best aspects of so many great beers present. The best use of Brett since Orval. Fou' Foune juiciness (I swear there must be apricots or peaches in this, the mustiness of Fantome Saison and Consecration's currents and sombiosis all at once! And then the hops just scream citrus!!
Mouthfeel is spritzy with a high level of carbonation,but it dries out nicely and is very more-ish.
Overall this is another masterpiece from Mr. Hill. 1,196 charactersRochefort10nh, Nov 22, 2012
