A: Pours an opaque light golden with two fingers of white pillowy head which slowly deflates leaving streaks of lacing.  Good retention.
S: Green, grassy raw hops dominate the nose, though some of this burns off after a few minutes.  Afterward, there’s a good dose of apricot and floral/grassy notes and a touch of grainy malt.  
T: Light apricot and peach, and fairly strong floral notes, light graininess and wheat, finishing with a soft bitterness and mild sweetness on a longish finish.  
M: Soft, creamy mouthfeel with medium body and medium carbonation.
O: Solid NE IPA, quite drinkable with some bitterness for balance.  The hop character leans more towards floral and grassy, which isn’t quite my cup of tea for this style of beer. 779 characterspmarlowe, Apr 21, 2017

Murky faded orange juice with a modest head, pour was not aggressive.  The smell out of the can was a little more pleasant that out of the glass.  Got a little more of an apricot smell at first but then had hints of onion and sweat.  Found this to have a bit of an ashy flavor, not unpleasant surprisingly enough.  Also some hints of onion in there. Still had a juicy feel and carbonation was spot on.  Definitely a fan of this beer!  Nice balance and distinct flavor. 554 charactersGreyvtrayn, Apr 13, 2017
4.49/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5East coast versus west coast, versus midwest, versus New England... Can't we all just get along? The brewers of Bissel Brothers certainly think so with a slam dunk rather than a swish. Bitter but balanced. Smooth but with a bite. Fruity but dry- Swish does it all.
Very hazy but not quite muddy, the newest New England IPA, the beer of goldenrod hues crowns with a creamy eggshell meringue. Juicy aromas of tropical fruit, citrus fruit and an herbal bouquet tantalize the nose with a tangy succulence of tropical fruit puree. Its succulence sweetness seems of the fresh juices squeezed directly from branch ripe citrus and tropical fruits with a touch of honey, poundcake and caramel added.
As the flavors bloom on the middle palate, its sweetness slowly drifts away and the full fruit forward flavor prevails. Red grapefruit, blood orange, lime and lemon come from the citrus front while mango, papaya, passionfruit, pineapple and kiwi hit the tastebuds with tropics. Trailing with an herbal medley, the firm grassiness of hops bring a bright chive, parsley and hemp taste along with supreme resinous bitterness.
Spicy, bitter and peppery, the ale trails into a malty dry texture and a creamy dryness that binds with fruit tartness to bring the character of sherbet and creamsicle in a lasting succulent aftertaste. Alcohol spice seems of curacao liquor and blend with the citrus hops and bitter herbal nature of hops seamlessly. 1,433 charactersBEERchitect, Apr 12, 2017

4.08/5  rDev -10.1%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4On tap at the King's Head in Portland (Maine) today.
The beer pours a very hazy golden amber color with pretty good head retention and light lacing.  On the nose, the aroma profile is pretty spectacular, as I get considerable tropical fruit, citrus and pine.  This beer smells great.  Given the aroma profile, it was hard not to be a bit disappointed in what I tasted.  This is still a tasty DIPA, but there just wasn't as much flavor as I was expecting, and there was some noticeable heat/bite from the alcohol in this beer.  Otherwise, the flavor profile replicates the nose, with a long, fairly dry, lightly bitter finish.  The alcohol isn't a huge presence on the finish, but even so, especially considering the abv., I was a bit disappointed with this beer's drinkability (the noticeable alcohol clearly detracted from the beer's drinkability).
I sort of wonder if this beer suffers a bit from the hype.  it's a solid DIPA for sure, but considering the excitement and  near hysteria about this beer's release (upcoming in cans), I was expecting something a bit more mind blowing.  Still a very nice DIPA, but IMHO, this beer can't hold a candle to the substance IPA (which is still the best beer I've had from the folks at BB). 1,234 charactersJohn_M, Apr 08, 2017

4.55/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5From a 16oz can, undated but purchased at the brewery when released on 03/23/17. Served in an imperial pint glass.
A profoundly turbid, gloriously ugly glass of beer that looks like dirty grapefruit juice with a one-finger head of creamy, scuzzy froth. Not much in the way of retention, maybe a minute, leaving a moderate ring of suds and a thin sheet of weak lacing. It looks thick enough to stand a spoon up in. 
The nose is all fresh, yeasty white bread, tropical fruit basket and vanilla flowers. I don't need to hold it near my face because I could smell it as soon as the can was half opened.
Taste is soft and juicy, pineapple and melon, orange, mango, kiwi, papaya, guava... yada, yada, yada - emphasis on the sweet, aromatic tropical fruits, less on the citrus, although there is grapefruit and lime lurking there in the background as supporting players - all layered over a solid, substantial, in fact hefty, damp-grain malt body. Dank, weedy and earthy. Finishes surprisingly quickly with just a little bitter melon stuck to the palate and an aromatic fruit basket of hops swirling in the sinuses.
The feel is... I'm getting tired of writing 'juicy' but, anyway, the feel is smooth and juicy, medium-thick and brightly carbonated. Terrifyingly easy to drink.
Overall, like I even need to say it, in the top-tier of NEDIPA's. I waited a long time for this because I never seem to be in Portland at the right time and now it's all I can do not to drink all my cans in one sitting. I'm so excited that I may have peed my pants a little. 1,549 characterspapposilenus, Mar 24, 2017

4.59/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 516 oz can gifted by a friend.  How did I not know about this one!?!
Pours an opaque orange/pineapple juice color with an off-white one finger pillowy head.  Gotta say that the head looks unusually good on this one, though can't say exactly why.  Odd.
Aroma is perfection for the juicy NE IPA style.  Pungent wafts of papaya, guava, orange, grapefruit, maybe a little resinous pine.
Taste follows the aroma, but there is an alcohol taste that blends in up front - this dies down as it mellows but I feel it is out of the average for this style DIPA.  In addition to the fruit flavor (more orange and peach than anything else) there is a bit of cracker coming through.  The aftertaste finally allows the sweet malt to come through.  Very low bitterness overall.
Feel is smooth and creamy on the tongue with a pleasant effervescent tingle throughout.  It almost has a seltzer like quality to it - I like that.
Overall this is a superb variation on the NE IPA.  As a DIPA it can feel a little more alcohol-ish than many of its peer beers in the region.  I happen to enjoy the ones with less alcohol more but that doesn't stop me from rating high for what they intended - which is the quintessential juice bomb.
I see the Bros rated it down - typical of them for this style.  I'd be curious if that 85 rating was based on a comparison to others of the style or just reflects a bias against the style as a whole.  Either way they are way out of whack with the general population here. 1,484 charactersdigboy, Mar 21, 2017
4.46/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours an opaque hazy gold with one and half finger head that reduces to a halo and some film, nice lacing.
Aroma is big on pineapple then there's some peach, orange, and lemongrass. A big punchy and simple fruit aroma.
Taste is also big on pineapple, more dank than the nose suggests, candied orange, orange rind, lemon zest, peach/stone fruit, sweeter up front then light grapefruit bitter and drying. Little yeasty fruit ester character.
Medium body, lighter carbonation, fairly smooth.
A tasty New England style DIPA, one of the most prominent pineapple aroma and taste IPA's I've had. Very fruity from yeast and hops but grounded by a subdued bitterness and fairly clean dry finish. 690 charactersHoppy_Time, Mar 20, 2017

A huge blast of fruit came out of the can instantly upon opening, with aroma being of tropical fruits that I have a hard time identifying. Very similar on the tongue, with addition of a bit of hop bite to add some balance to the sweetness.
The body was thin, and the flavors didn't linger long on the palate. Drinkability was decent, the beer went down easily enough, and was soon gone. In general, I tend not to be a big fan of these American Orange Ales (NE "style" IPA), as I find the thick visuals, lack of body, and quickly disappearing flavors annoying. I realize the brewers probably feel like they accomplished what they set out to do, so the beer gets a higher score than I would have given on my own. A very nice brew, if you're a fan of the style. 971 charactersbeertunes, Mar 19, 2017

This smells ridiculous- a pineapple and tangerine explosion, with damp cut grass, marijuana, pine, candied grapefruit, and mango as well- it just leaps out of the glass.
This is basically everything I want a huge NE-style DIPA to be. It's got an absurd juicy and fruity hop character up front- all of the New England fruit basket is there. Tangerine, pineapple, and mango, mostly, with some light sweet grapefruit as well. This has a wonderfully bitter finish as well, like raw hop bitterness and fresh cut grass,  I love how it's a juice bomb but not completely dominated by that sort of sweetness, candied and muddled, that you sometimes get from the style.
This has a super soft and pillowy mouthfeel, with a good level of carbonation. It's incredibly drinkable, despite the absolute flavor blast this is.
This is up there with the very best in DIPAs in the world. It's a wonderful accomplishment for Bissell Brothers. 1,062 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 05, 2017

I cracked this open - a pineapple factory exploded in my kitchen. Just an incendiary array of hop aromas.  This may be the most aromatic beer I've had.
It looks like a glass of pineapple/grapefruit juice to me, and Mrs O confirmed it when I showed it to her ("That's not a beer - it's a glass of jooooce" she said in her "Norwegian by way of Indiana" Minnesota accent).  It is so thick, it literally swallows light.
The taste is all pineapple and citrus fruits - the Citra/Mosaic/Simcoe hop combo makes for an interesting "citrusy/danky/oniony" flavor profile.  And the sneaky thing is that there's no alcohol presence - at all - when you take a sip (or a gulp), but if you wait a bit between sips, you can feel the alcohol burn.  This is a sneaky dangerous beer.
The feel is all creamy oats - and then the hops slip in and remind you that you're drinking a heavily-hopped DIPA, and you get some spritziness from the hops that really elevate this.
I wish I'd purchased 2 cases of this instead of 2 pints, because it's phenomenal. 1,154 charactersovaltine, Feb 20, 2017

Appearance- Super hazy and looks more like a heavy fruit juice than a beer. About 1 finger of creamy thick white head and tons of lacing. 
Smell- The strong fruit hits as soon as you pop the can. You really get the citrus and mango tones. No smell of malt or alcohol. 
Taste - An interesting mix of fruits more pineapple and grapefruit there but the mango and other citrus blend nicely. Complex taste with no bitterness. Definitely would not have pegged this for a double IPA with 8% ABV. 
Mouthfeel- Really heavy cream texture and kind of dry ending. Next to no carbonation.
Overall- A great NE style DIPA. I wish I had one more 725 charactersKdouble, Feb 04, 2017

4.46/5  rDev -1.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.516oz can served in a snifter glass. Pours a hazy lemon orange body with a one finger thick frothy white head, great retention, lots of rings of lacing. Smell is rich citrus, grapefruit and orange; light zest on top of a mild amount of caramel and minimal sugar sweetness. Awesome. The nose just bursts with aroma, this is what makes a NE IPA what it is, not the haziness. Flavour follows, rich citrus and grapefruit, mild sweetness from the grain, but overall mostly fruit-forward with a nice balance with the dextrin/sugar malt sweetness and the mild resinous bitterness on the backend. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, creamy, appropriately carbonated and just altogether too good to put the glass down for any extended period of time. Very good NE double IPA, one of the best representations of the style. 803 charactersStevedore, Feb 01, 2017

4.89/5  rDev +7.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Canned ten days ago, and I'm excited as hell to review Swish. I've had several cans before, but I've never reviewed it, and never this fresh. I'm letting it warm just slightly after taking out from the fridge, as I do with all quality IPAs. 
Appearance-wise, this may be the best looking of the many dozens of "hazy" IPAs I've tried. You can't really see the particles, like you can with too many other turbid beers (Tired Hands, ahem), but the aggregate effect is one of soft luminescence. I swear, in the right light, it almost glows, like Marsellus Wallace's suitcase. The head is perfectly proportioned and leaves a gorgeous lacing as it dissipates; I get a great deal of satisfaction just watching this beer for a couple of minutes before even drinking it. The aroma is, at first sniff, all orange and pineapple juice, but there's a level of dank, spicy complexity that you don't perceive in prototypical juice bombs like those from Tree House. Something about Swish begs, even dares, you to take a sip to confirm its awesomeness. And awesome it is: I can't think of another beer that zips so fully between bright, lovely fruit notes and dark, bitter stank. Just when you think the hops are tipping over into harshness, they pull back into a gentle, floral caress. Unlike some NE IPAs, it doesn't slide into one-dimensionality as it warms. Instead (to my palette), it gets more complex, even aggressive, as it goes, becoming downright pungent near the end. The best way I can describe its mouthfeel is "zippy," even frantic, as it hits the tongue, but it leaves the palette completely clean within a couple of seconds; it almost feels like you hadn't drunk anything just a moment before. Which, of course, leads to its massive, dangerous drinkability.
I can't remember being this infatuated with a beer since my first Heady. Like Mr. Topper, it's completely unique, basically incomparable to anything else. So why not a perfect score? It's hard for me to explain, but I think it has something to do with the rapid vanishing of both the taste and mouthfeel. In a funny way, it doesn't "stay" with you the way certain beers stay with you. Which, again, could be dangerous, especially at 8%. To sum up, ready access to this beer would probably turn me into an alcoholic. Good thing it's damn hard to obtain. 2,311 charactersJayORear, Jan 25, 2017

4.66/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Canned a week ago, it's got a classic New England look: completely cloudy piss yellow color and a foamy 1-2 finger foamy white head that faded very  very slowly and left really nice spotty lacing and rings as it went down.
Nose starts off a little odd with a mix of weed and smelly armpit, but then thankfully shifts to fresh juicy citrus hops. We've got a mix here of orange juice, guava, lemon, red grapefruit, pineapple, tart green apple, green pear, dank piney hops, fresh floral hops and a bunch of earthy notes. Really complex, juicy and full of tropical fruit.
Wow, tastes great with so many juicy hop flavors that it's an explosion of fruit and fresh hops. Grapefruit, lemon, orange peel, graham cracker, biscuit, dank piney hops, tangerine, Ritz cracker, caramel, mango, faint brown sugar, earthy notes, light peppery spices and dry floral hops. Perfectly balanced and hides the ABV masterfully, it's incredibly easy to drink. If you're not from the Northeast USA then trade for this beer as it's excellent. 1,018 charactersCHickman, Jan 23, 2017

4.78/5  rDev +5.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 5From 16oz can into tulip. Pours a beautiful soft orange lemonade, with a minimal, but nice white head composed of larger than average bubbles. Nice ring remains around the circumference when the head dissipates. 
The aroma of this beer is likely to invoke a smile. It’s a light tropical adventure headed by pineapple with floral hop fragrances. There is no malt in the odor, and it is very refreshing; lofty, pure, and without even a hint of aggression. 
Feel is certainly juicy, though nicely integrated with the sharp micro-bubbles to give it some structure; it foams up a bit on the swallow. 
The taste begins like a fruit juice, predominately pineapple with some citrus flavors. Resolves into a little mango and grapefruit, and then finishes slightly more on the citrus side—grapefruit and lemon is what I get—with a very light bit of lingering malty something. Grapefruit lingers as well. This is a primo NE double and certainly top notch. Juicy, drinkable, and impressive. 987 charactersj_d_b, Jan 20, 2017

4.74/5  rDev +4.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75The beer pours nicely with a bright yellow custard color and white head. The head dissipates quickly with very little lacing.
The smell is heavenly like you just stepped into a citrus grove. There's strong notes of orange juice and lemon zest with hints of grass honey and crystal malt and a subtle pininess.
The flavor is spot on for an IPA with a perfect balance of citrus and bittering hops. Its rounded out by a great grain bill. The malt compliments the hops with caramel and biscuit flavors that follow the hops.
The mouthful had a great balance of body and carbonation. The beer is medium bodied with a smooth initial mouthful followed by just the right CO2 bite.
Overall this has been one of the best NE style IPAs that I've had to date. I would recommend this beer to any IPA lover who has a chance to get it. 822 charactersTheBeerCarl, Dec 21, 2016

Pours hazy light yellow with creamy white head and good lacing, smells like super sticky citrus candy and pine resin, hints of dankness, taste is a blast of tropical fruit, mango and peach nectar followed by crisp and dank pine and citrusy pith, crisp and well carbonated. A dank tropical citrus delight. Yum 346 charactersChipChaight, Nov 26, 2016

A: Beer comes in a hazy, very light gold (almost pushing a dark yellow) color. Pretty much full haze on this one—as I’ve come to expect from BB; almost fully opaque. About a half finger of fluffy white head faded quickly to almost nothing, leaving some decent laces on the glass.
S: Sticky, overripe yellow peach, pineapple, and tangerine. Just a touch of lemon zest. There’s a slight underlying herbaceousness—almost like basil, mint, and spruce tips, but nothing too pungent. I also get some armpit-esque dankness; not as unpleasant as my descriptor would indicate, but it's definitely a note that I get from Mosaic-forward beers. Moderate-plus intensity on the aroma--not explosive, but certainly doesn't require any digging.
T: Up front, I get a big smack of lemon-lime—almost like sweet lime juice with a bit of lemon zest. Flavor quickly transitions onto more tropical flavors, following the nose with notes of overripe peach, pineapple, and maybe a hint of sweet citrus. There’s just a touch of semi-sweet, bready, doughy malt mid-palette and that grassy, dank, green hop matter flavor on the back end. Finish is a really awesome balance of lingering tropical fruit juice, lemon-lime zest, and bitter, musty green grass. For 8%, this one really toes the bitter vs. sweet line quite well.
M: Medium mouthfeel with lively, effervescent carbonation. Not as soft and not as creamy as some of the other ‘top’ NE-style DIPAs, which is probably my biggest knock against this beer. There’s a nice smack of medium-plus, aspirin-like bitterness on the finish—I get that same note on The Substance, but with Swish, that sharp, pointy bitterness is offset by a really smooth sweetness that I imagine is coming from the malt backbone. Not even a hint of alcohol heat.
O: This is a really interesting beer and very different from some of the ‘juice bombs’ coming out of NE. Swish stuffs a huge variety of flavor into a very drinkable package, offering those pungent, sticky tropical fruit notes along with some piney, grassy, bitter herbal flavors on the back end. It’s not a one-note beer, and I really appreciate that aspect of it. It it had a fuller, creamier mouthfeel and a bigger nose, this would be up there with the best of ‘em. 2,298 charactersavas, Nov 20, 2016

3.91/5  rDev -13.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Opaque solid yellow with a moderate foamy white head leaving a little spotty lace.
Smell is pretty dank cannabis, almost to a rubbery plastic level, with pine resin, white pepper, creamy oats, pear, green mango, and guava.
Taste is grassy earthy weed, slightly spicy pine, creamy oats, grapefruit, mango, and pineapple. Swish is not quite as fruity as I expected, as some of their other IPAs really explode with tropical and Asian fruits. I'm surprised due to the status of this one compared to Reciprocal, Substance and Diavoletto. I guess, though, this makes this a more classic, yet explosive fresh, IPA than some of their other brews, which in a way explains its appeal.
Bittersweet, soft, thick to almost chewy, finishing semi-dry. 739 charactersSabtos, Nov 19, 2016

No date
A:
Thick-looking, cloudy, white-gold with puffy white scum head that settles to a tight little film.  Standard NE IPA. (4)
S:
Masticated guava, mango, pineapple, weed and pungent earthiness back it all up.  Clean, stoned fruit salad layers. (4.5)
T:
A wavering flavor between tropical pulp and fermented sap, it comes on pretty sweet and almost immediately darkens up and gets resinous and bitter, both components are still there though with some crackery malt in the background.  (4.5)
M:
Smooth, creamy and soft with a sharp boozy prickle interlaced with the sappiness, gets to be pretty heavy after a while.  (4.5)
O:
Wowee!  Really nice beer.  
Huge and drinkable with lots of fruit in the nose and the forest on the tongue.  It looks par for the course for these types of beer.  Nose is similar too.  Really strong guava and mango come through, pretty clean aroma.  The flavor is a bitter-leaning balance between the aroma and eating a pinecone rolled in kief.  It is a little boozy, but it fits nicely with everything.  Especially if we are assuming that it is a faithful re-creation of the “old, dirty, shitty-tasting, homemade fucking liquor” from TPB ; )  
Really good.  Would jump at the chance to have it again.
Not to beat a dead horse, but you're the man, Jacob!  (4.5) 1,312 charactersTheDoctor, Nov 18, 2016

Nose is citrus - orange, lemon, lime, some tropical notes, and background piney resin
Taste is initially a minor sweet note, and then a wave of citrus - grapefruit, lemon, lime, and a hoppy finish.
Mouthful is medium to light with an initial bite, reminiscent of a sour, that mellows to a creamy character.  The carbonation is average to high.  The finish is dry.
A juicy beer which is very drinkable.  No discernible alcohol.  Nice citrus profile especially if you like grapefruit.  Not too hoppy.  Recommended. 631 charactersSlack, Nov 04, 2016

A: This beer is a pure yellow color, the color of a lemon. It pours with a nice head and leaves plenty of residue when it settles down. 
S: Has a very lemony smell, orange / citrus are also present. 
T: I first time I tasted this beer it was the smoothest beer that I have ever had.  The fact that it is a double IPS is astonishing. There is such a strong citrusy taste that is good every single sip of the beer.  It’s a true juice punch.
F: Goes down smooth and has a nice hoppy warmth that stays in the back of your mouth for a while. 
O: Overall this is definitely one of my favorite beers. Take the trip up to Maine, drink it Fresh, and enjoy. If you can’t get up to Maine, then trade for it 100%, you will not be disappointed. 951 charactersSlylou123, Nov 01, 2016

Light amber and cloudy with one finger of head. I got a lot of stone fruit in the aroma along the lines of peach and apricot. Very smooth in the flavor, with deep fruitiness. There is restraint and balance, rather than in-your-face, bold, citric flavors. Clean finish that shows little sign of the beer's strong ABV. I enjoyed this one much more than The Substance. 377 charactersJacobob10, Jun 27, 2016

4.54/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Nice unfiltered look - color or grapefruit juice. BIG mango/guava/passion fruit nose that exploded out of the can. Tropical taste but finished with a bit of grapefruit and then a nice slight bitter hops bite. Significant carbonation makes for a significantly different mouth feel from Haze or Julius. Bottom line - this is a world class brew. Every New England IPA lover should grab a few. Personal taste, I prefer the Tree House mouth feel, but I definitely want to see this one on my beer fridge again. 504 characters11-52_4hops, Jun 10, 2016

Swish has the best balance of smell, juicy citrusy hoppy taste with just enough bitterness to remind you it's an IPA and the trademark New England hazy OJ look. Love this beer. Perhaps my all time favorite. Thanks BB. 339 charactersangelosk, Jun 04, 2016

Flavor follows the nose, lots of tropical fruit and citrus with a touch of bitterness in the back end. Mouthfeel is nice and juicy but has a little sharpness from the carbonation. Overall this was absolutely delicious. 330 charactersStevem68, May 21, 2016

4.92/5  rDev +8.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75This beer pours a super cloudy golden yellow color with a 2 finger bright white head that fades to 1/4 inch ring around the edge with a microfilm layer across the top. There are sticky chunks of hanging lacing. Smell is citrus, tropical and green dankness. Grapefruit, orange, pithy citrus, mango, pineapple and dankness burst out of the glass. Taste is the same, simply fantastic. Feel is light and juicy, but has a sticky resinous finish. Cannot believe this is 8%. Overall this beer is amazing. Like more resinous, citrus, and slightly more dank version of Alter Ego. Just fantastic. Also has a similar hop profile to Billy Full Stack in my opinion. 652 charactersCNoj012, May 05, 2016

Pours out that super turbid/hazy golden orange Trillium, Tree House, Hoof looking type of DIPA.
Aroma is super juicy and tropical with a nice green, earthy dank note too. Sweet, juicy orange, pineapple, mango, peach, tangerine, grapefruit. 
Taste is also very juicy and tropical, but has a great finishing earthy, herbaceous dank note too that I love. Tons of sweet pineapple juice, mango, peach, orange, grapefruit, orange zest, very dank and sticky on the back. Lots going on here.
Medium bodied with a creamy mouthfeel, lighter bitterness (think single IPA) and NO HINT OF 8%!
Didn't know what to expect and completely blown away! Gotta check out more Bissell Bros stuff! 720 charactersJohnnyMc, May 05, 2016
4.67/5  rDev +2.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Very nice murky orange pour, nice foamy sticky looking head with excellent lacing and retention.
Smell is a juice bomb, nice pungent orange, papaya, mango, melon, creamsicle. Citrus is alive too with lemon zest and orange peel. Has a nice honey and nectarine scent as it warms.
Taste is similar to the juice bomb smell, with more of a hop resin bite. Citrus zest in the middle, nice sweet cracker malt back bone finish. Tropical notes balance all the bitterness very well. Similar to the nose, nice honey profile comes through as it warms.
Mouthfeel is creamy, hop resin costs very well. 590 charactersMateo2699, May 04, 2016

4.14/5  rDev -8.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Murky, hazy, orange pineapple juice pour. Aroma and taste of pineapple, overripe guava, kiwi, ..tropical fruit mixed with acidic fruit. Doesn't have that sorbet, orange, banana, mango, non-acidic-fruit balance to smooth it out and soften it up. Mouthfeel is nice regardless with a pungent coating that ends with some green tea. Punchy hops sock you in the pie hole - imbalanced and aggressive. Looks/feels unstructured in appearance and taste. Would like more of a malt foundation with a stronger bitter finish to help mellow out the hops. As far as hop-forward IPAs go - this is it. 583 charactersManapuaMan, May 01, 2016

4.77/5  rDev +5.1%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a extremely hazy golden yellow color with a deep orange hue. The typical haze for dayz appearance on this NE IPA.
Aroma is saturated with bright, overly ripe fruits and a layer of herbaceous dankness. Tons of bright orange, tangerine, orange pith, pineapple, mango, nectarine, and grapefruit.
Taste brings tons of juicy peach and orange up front, along with a good amount of dankness. This transitions into a more tropical vibe of mango and pineapple with that orange and dankness still hanging around. Finishes with orange pith and peel, a grassy and spicy herbaceous quality, and a touch more pineapple juiciness. The citrus pith and herbal bitterness are there, but is not overpowering. A very soft bready malt is there to keep everything in check.
Medium body. Crisp carbonation and creamy. The hop oils are there, but fairly clean overall.
This is right up there with Tree House and Trillium offerings IMO. Tastes similar to Julius with a dash of mary jane dankness. Insanely good stuff. 1,002 charactersbrewskis, Apr 09, 2016

pours a golden/yellow/orange color with minimal white head.  Smells of mango, pineapple, orange.  -you can smell it as soon as you crack the can.  Taste follows the nose.  Huge amounts of citrusy fruits.  Slightly carbonated and leaves a great lacing all down the glass.  This is a great beer.  Well done BB! 324 characters-Rick, Apr 05, 2016

Appearance - Pours cloudy and pale orange in color with a yellow-tinged, half finger head. Fair retention, breaking down to a mostly barren surface with a thin ring of suds around the edge of the glass. Not much lacing, with a few broken lines and a couple of spots making up what little there is.
Smell - Juicy, with predominant mango and lesser orange and a hint of pineapple. Touches of pine and a faint, underlying bready sweetness.
Taste - Juicy mango and citrus with a fair amount of pineapple zing. Faint spice bite. Malts come through faintly, represented by a generic white bread or crackery sweetness. Finishes much the same; very sweet and juicy, with a only touch of citrus pith bitterness.
Mouthfeel - Close to full-bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth, silky texture, then turns a fairly dry finish with a touch of chalk.
Overall - Great DIPA. A bit too much mango for my palate, but I can understand why people are head over heels for this beer. It's amazingly juicy and nigh crushable. Well worth the 40 minute wait in line.
Update: Let a couple of these mature in the fridge for several weeks. It much smoother as the mango died down and the flavors matured into a more cohesive experience. 1,278 charactersTheSixthRing, Apr 01, 2016

Look: Yellow, Gold, a head that lingers. (10/10)
Smell: Weed, Tropical Fruit, Nutty, Sweetness. (10/10)
Taste: Weed, Tropical fruit, yeast, malt. All the flavors you want in a beer and then some. (10/10)
Feel: Super smooth. A bit acidic as beer should be, alcohol is hidden well. (10/10)
Overall: Drink this from the can if its not fresh at the Brewery. This is the best beer that i've tried in Maine. Period. It's like all of the best beers in one glass. The aftertaste tastes like taking a bong hit, very strong reefer taste. This may the be dankest beer I've had yet, but its also fruity as hell and you can't stop drinking it. Highly recommended, must have more! Pissed they only brew it half of the year. (10/10) 841 characterscurtis6290, Mar 25, 2016

Pours a very hazy bright orange body with a decent one finger white head that reduces fairly quickly to leave a little lacing and a layer of foam. 
Aromas are juicy and potent - very tropical, fruity, citrusy, mango and pineapple, very inviting. Definitely an East Coaster.
The tongue matches the nose but to a lesser extent - still very tasty though, with tons of citrus, grapefruit, tropical fruits, followed by a slight lingering bitterness. Medium carb and pretty creamy / medium body. 
The hype is true, this beer is truly world class. Like a glass full of fresh, fruity hops. 682 charactersgcamparone, Mar 07, 2016

Appearance: About a finger of thin bubbly head that quickly dissipated. Beer is an extremely hazy, pretty much opaque light tangerine color; the quintessential "new-age" NE DIPA.  
Aroma: 
Oh boy. Super juicy and pungent peaches + pineapples. 
Some orange sweetness in there as well (CITRA)
Earthy dankness, very green
Very little malt presence (if any!) 
Taste:
Follows aroma perfectly, peach pineapple juice. Nice zesty bitterness throughout the flavor (again, reminiscent of CITRA). Grassy Dankness on the back (Simcoe). Overall; super hoppy, like drinking a blended hop smoothie, with the hop acidity strongly present.
Feel:
Medium body, well carbonated and moderately spritzy on the palate.
Overall:
Excellent NE Double IPA, rather reminiscent of Trillium Brewing's hop profiles. 826 charactersKellenPsych, Mar 01, 2016

Had a can fresh and held on to the can for 2-3 weeks in the fridge, it actually pours semi-hazy and does not look like a milkshake. Lacing is amazing. Big fresh and zesty citrusy nose, hint of fruity alcohol and grain as well. Mouth feel has some body, mild carbonation. Sufficient hop bitterness for the style. Pithy and rind-like hop flavor throughout. Some graininess, silky and slick. Good flavors but a bit muddled. Worth a try. 462 charactersJason, Feb 24, 2016

(L) The color was cloudy dark golden, almost light brown, with an inch white head that dissipated fairly quickly.
(A) It had a wonderful piney and fruity aroma.
(T) The taste was a mix of tropical fruit and citrus evolving and ending in a grapefruit taste and a pleasant moderate dankness, very well balanced. There was not any hint of the alcohol.
(F) Creamy, juicy, smooth, moderate carbonation, easy drinking yet very tasty. 641 charactersThomas_Wikman, Feb 10, 2016

S - Tropical juices and orange sherbet with some grassy hops.
T - Runs the gamut of New England hop flavors with orange, mango, peach and then throws in dank weed-like hops on the finish. It transitions to something different at every stage and keeps you guessing.
F - Medium and exactly what you want for the style. A little flat and undercarbonated. Not sure if that is how it is supposed to be or if was this particular batch.
O - Swish belongs in the same crowd as other critically acclaimed New England IPA's/DIPA's as it gives you everything you'd expect from the region and has (I think) better drinkability and a smoother ride from start to finish. 705 charactersThrewRedButter, Feb 10, 2016

Don’t be turned off…there’s much more to this beer than the look.  Slight head upon pour which sags.  Minor lacing.
S – Citrus, pineapple, mango notes.  Slight pine, but not as much as the fruit tones.  Same with the malt; very little.
T – Tropical fruits galore – tangerine, grapefruit, mango and pineapple.  The pine comes through next, doesn’t overshadow, but definitely balances the fruits.  Not much bitterness – just a well-balanced finish.  Certainly doesn’t taste like an 8%.
M – Low carbonation, but it works.  Very creamy feeling with a dry finish.
O – Classically great DIPA from BB that’s easy to drink.  Sip after sip, this beer just keeps getting better. 808 charactersmfurlone, Feb 08, 2016

A- Tallboy into a wine glass with a moderately hazy pale yellow body. A frothy white head rises up to right around a finger high with decent retention. The puffy white ring remaining deposits spotty lacing.
S- The aroma is dominated by bright fruity hops but I get the overall sense that it does not really have the depth of hop aromatics as other comparable brews; just feels a bit short lived. Passionfruit (perhaps the most forward I've noticed in an IPA), tangerine, pineapple, mango, oranges and floral hops constitute the smell.
T- Again with the passionfruit. By far the standout flavor of this brew with tangerine, dank ass weed nuggets, oranges (juicy and bitter), mango, clementine, floral, pine, melon and grapefruit hop tones beneath it. The passionfruit zestiness cuts into the tropical aspect and seems to mitigate any nectar feel or juiciness for me. A hint of sweetness, pale cracked two row and yeast bread in the far reaches. Some swigs really are like pure weed, insane.
MF- Medium bodied with a creamy and even chewy texture. Carbonation on the high side with a highly zesty and crisp touch. Finishes with an oily dank bitterness attacking the palate.
For me the highlights of this beer are the passionfruit and resinous dank hops but honestly they might be... gasp... too strong. I feel like a few layers of great hop flavors get washed out and a passionfruit dominance leaves me wanting more of what is lost. A really good DIPA but feels a bit one-note at times. 1,506 characterscbutova, Jan 30, 2016

S: Explodes with citrus and tropical fruitiness. Pineapple, orange, and grapefruit are the highlights. Some dank earthy notes if you really get your nose in there. Not much malt presence behind the fruity assault
T:A bit more balanced but still quite citrus and tropical forward. Starts off with the wave of hoppiness, followed by a hint of bitterness and some earthy maltiness that balances everything out. Finishes with lingering citrus notes
M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth
O: Leans extremely heavy on the hops, but really never gets much more than slightly bitter. Definitely one of the juicer DIPAs out there, and right on par with most top-tier New England (D)IPAs 829 charactersBEERMILER12, Jan 27, 2016

4.45/5  rDev -2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Single tallboy can from last weekend's Portland haul. 
A - Classic murky fruit juice Bissell pour, very pale dull orange color on this one. 2 fingers of white head to start, a thick ring and some remnants of a cap remain by the end. Tiny lace dots left here and there.
S - Tropical blast. Mango, orange creme savers, fruit punch, bowl of froot loops, strawberry?, just a bit of pine resin and malt presence. Kinda ridiculous amount of pure sweet tropicality but that's okay.
T - Still tons of pulpy tropical juice flavor but more danky pine coming through here makes it a bit more well-rounded than the scent. Also more in the way of sugar cookie and biscuit malt, which makes for a particularly delicious finish. 
M - Creamy smooth and kind of a biggish feel, but nothing too out of the ordinary for a 8% DIPA. Carbonation is a bit on the low side, decent bitter kick, a good mix of soft and bitter hop flavors. A touch of alcohol. Average drinkability, it was easy to take my time with a pint to myself.
O - Almost leans towards overly sweet for an IPA, but the tropical fruit flavor coming out of this is really too wondrous to complain about it much. Could use some balance/bittering/mouthfeel tweaks but really quite nice as is. 1,238 charactersChico1985, Jan 22, 2016

It doesn't affect smell or taste though.  Smell is very piney, a bit on the dank side.  Taste is a fruit bomb on the front end, mango, papaya, even a bit of pineapple followed by a nice pine sharpness.  Not overpowering, but there is a slight bitterness, which was great to cut through the citrus.  I really enjoyed this. 424 charactersMLDucky, Jan 20, 2016

Smell comes first on this one as it's the first sense touched. I feel like I'm in Hawaii being served a fruit smoothie with blended hops. Every sniff punches me with dankness, marijuana, and hints of cat piss. One of the most exotic smelling beers I've ever delved into. This should be interesting.
Pours cloudy orange. Looks like mango juice. Excited as hell.
Tastes as predicted. Up front lots of tropical fruit and citrus.... Pineapple to grapefruit. Turns into pine and bitterness on the aftertaste. This is liquid gold. As it warms, a slight taste of alcohol is detected. Otherwise, extremely drinkable for a DIPA. Hops radar is going off as I'm immediately sneezing.
Medium carbonation with a dry finish. 
The exemplary Maine DIPA. Beautiful, unfiltered hop juice with a brown-green sediment containing yeast and hop particulate, ultimately adding to the aroma and flavor profile. If you're a fan of hoppy ales, this is a must try. One of the most satisfying beers I've ever had. The BB are performing magic. Even the burps taste better than most beer. New England has redefined the IPA. I could drink this every day.
94/100
I think "The Bros" are pissed that New England has taken over the hoppy ale scene. 85? Give me a break. 1,260 charactersCommonSense, Jan 09, 2016

The coloration is light orange and magnificent and the taste is both tremendous and unique. Extremely smooth and no trace of the 8%. Hops and a hint of fruit flavor that strikes me a grapefruit. I'd doesn't taste like HT or SOS but I'd put it right up there with them, if not above. Everyone I've shared a can with has been blown away. I'm trying to save a few 4 packs as xmas presents but fear I'll have nothing left to give in 10 days... 561 charactersGraniteState101, Dec 13, 2015

Puréed fruit-hops. I marveled at this strawberry and kiwi aroma that I kept getting. Not sure that I've came across a scent like that and I'm the town bike when it comes to hoppy beers. The flavor also brings forth that awesome, wacky strawberry and kiwi flavor. There is also a ton of peach, nectarine, pineapple and citrus fruits. It finishes with some drying, grainy malt. Not overly bitter. Creamy mouthfeel. Really one hell of a beer. I love Bissell beers but this one was easily the best. I'd put this up against any hoppy beer I have had in recent memory; maybe ever. There is no reason why an 8% beer should drink this easily and willingly. 764 charactersVelvetExtract, Dec 12, 2015

Full review Dec 13, 2015.
A - Light peach juice body with hues of apricot through the center.  Nice retention and lace on a fine white head that pours 2 fingers high.
S - Sweet delicious passion fruit and papaya.  Just a touch of herbal bitters balance out the nose.
T - Outstanding.  Bold bitter cilantro and thyme highlight a brisk tropical frame of dried mango, passion fruit paste and fresh papaya.  Bright wood and pine through the finish.  
M - Smooth medium light frame with nice carbonation.
O - A fantastic example of the tropical side of DIPA's. 606 charactersvfgccp, Dec 10, 2015

S: a muskiness that I don't get in the taste. Peaches. 
T: flavors are amplified by an intense amount of micro carbonation. At first glance I get dark fruits, specifically plums. Peaches, but bitter peaches, almost close to the stone. A white grapefruit diet soda (akin to a more natural European drink, less like cloying artificial Fresca--still leagues away from authentic grapefruit). I get some grapefruit rind here on the finish, which is nice and refreshing and different. Highly acidic. Delicious, but not altogether integrated. 
F: high levels of carb. Fizzles on the tongue like a Razzle Dazzle (TM). Somehow the body on this feels a little light in spite of excessive carbonation. 
O: a delicious brew that called to mind many unique flavor descriptors. This isn't an easy drink however, contrary to many of the other crushable NE IPAs. This doesn't detract from the overall quality of the beer, and honestly is more of a refreshing plus for this brew. However, there is a slightly unbalanced nature to flavor that makes this fall slightly in my estimation. 1,089 charactersNizzleEGizzle, Nov 30, 2015

It has a very light yellow hazy color, but big frothy head with a nice aroma of crisp pine and citrus.  The mouthfeel is light and bitter in the best kindof way.  There is big flavor here of classic New England IPA pine and  grapefruit/orange citrus and this beer goes down smooth.  It feels like you could drink 10 of these and not feel full.  I don't really know the best way to describe this beer except that it's a carnival for your tastebuds but its light weight and bitterness never make you're stomach feel full... Dangerous, if you could only get your hands on more.
This beer has placed itself among the best IPAs in New England.  I consider it easily on par with Heady Topper, Sip of Sunshine, and Julius.(My favorite NE IPAs) It's just that good. 
If you're headed to Maine, there are a number of wonderful beers to be drank, but this just might be the cream of the crop. 947 charactersAmity83, Nov 20, 2015

Pours a coarse, 1.5 finger foamy white head with moderate retention. Beer is a cloudy pale lemon. Lacing is stringy and layered with great stick. Solid though the head and color could use a little work.
Notes of citrus, grapefruit, pine and starfruit. A light spritz with a mellow malt body. Moderately aromatic with a decent fruit presence. 
Opens grapefruit, pine and starfruit. Juicy and resiny in the middle with a touch of grassiness and pulp. Nice malt body complements a tropical fruit hop bitterness. Aggressively balanced towards the end with just a bit of accented tartness. Aftertaste of more tropical fruit. What a juice bomb!
Light to medium bodied with moderate carbonation. Smooth and quenching in the mouth and crisp and aggressive going down. Dry finish with a filmy, lingering aftertaste. Excellent. Super drinkable and the alcohol is barely there.
Very very good and this one gets better and better as it warms, revealing more aspects of a tasty tropical fruit bouquet. Definitely representative of the top east coast IIPAs. 1,078 charactersSpeedwayJim, Nov 17, 2015

4.95/5  rDev +9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5L- Dirty, hazy light orange. Just the way I like 'em.
S- Super tropical and fruity. If possible, it smells well balanced as it doesn't really burn the way some super hoppy, high ABV doubles tend to.
T- Super juicy. Orange and tangerine. A little pine. Hoppy mid palette but it's restrained as it has a nice sweet backbone. The alcohol is extremely well hidden as well.
M- Real nice. Somewhat full, chewy for the style but with the perfect carb and the alcohol is well hidden. Could drink several without issue.
O- Probably my new favorite IIPA. Fresh Heady is hard to beat but this is right there. Just fantastic. 617 charactersZaximus, Oct 31, 2015

Smell is of sticky hop aroma, sweet malts, pineapple and grapefruit citrus.  Taste is a citrus wave, with crisp hops, biscuity malts -- with solid bitterness through.  Some sweetness stands out as the beer warms up.  Still hop forward.  Finishes dry and bitter, with a sweet lacing.  Overall - really great IPA out of Maine.  There's some stiff competition and this beer has to be mentioned when discussing the best. 484 charactersanteatr23, Oct 29, 2015

T.   Totally agreeing with the nose I get tropical fruits,  pine and some nice sweet biscuit malts.   Slight bitterness.  Tasty candy apple aftertaste. 
M.   Not a real heavy DIPA.   4 out of 10 on thickness.   Smooth.  Not a ton of carbonation but just enough.   Finishes pretty clean. 
O.   A very nice DIPA.   Flavor and aroma is great.   Some DIPA's can be a little too heavy but this is really nice.   A top notch DIPA for sure. 656 charactersIPAGeorge, May 03, 2015

Good in its own right but not holding its own against the heavyweights of the Northeast. It is difficult to believe that people line up for this beer. 
Overall, the beer delivers on quality hops and tropical fruit notes but misses on the mouthfeel and leaves a metallic aftertaste. 409 charactersrodmanfor3, Apr 28, 2015
4.35/5  rDev -4.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Had this on 2015-04-27 in Columbia, PA from a fresh 16 oz can.
A - Hazy golden-yellow with a 1.5 finger white head and moderate lace.
S - Orange, grapefruit and pineapple flesh in copious amounts.  Huge tropical aroma.  Moderately dank but not over-the-top.  Little if any malt.  Certainly a nice platform to showcase the hops.
T - Very balanced.  There's some cracker flavor cushioning the fruit and hops.  I can't discern the three types of citrus aromas noted in the smell but they blend together in a most agreeable way; plus some peach that I didn't pick up in the aroma.  There's just a bit of herbal spice and some pepper.  It finishes very dry and balanced with long-lasting but not tongue-numbing bitterness.
M - Medium body and light-medium carbonation.  Pretty resinous and somewhat prickly.
O - This is one fine DIPA.  It's not as bright as Lawson's Double Sunshine; my all time favorite but this rates right up there with the best of the Northeast-style DIPAs. 978 charactersTucquan, Apr 27, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -5.3%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Pours a hazy, orange-juice color with a decent white head. Leaves an OK amount of lacing. 
The aroma is very citrus forward but has a nice balance. I get notes of grapefruit and mango, as well as notes of what I can only describe as dank ass kush. Not what I expect from a top-notch New England DIPA but it's a pleasant aroma nonetheless. 
The taste is very tropical, with notes of tangerine, mango, and even something I can only assume is lime. It's well-balanced as well, as the doughy malt and lingering pine bitterness provide a very nice backbone.
The feel is medium bodied with decent carbonation. Alcohol is non-existent. Nice and creamy with a bitter character lingering after every sip. 
Overall, a very good DIPA. I haven't really been a huge fan of Substance (though it's still solid) but this is a legit New England double IPA. It's creamy, hoppy as hell, and relatively well-balanced. A bit overpriced and perhaps not worth waiting in line for 3 hours for, but still excellent. 994 charactersScaryEd, Apr 24, 2015

Served in a Bissell Brothers stemless wine glass
The beer poured a slightly hazed, light golden amber and was topped by an inch tall, frothy, eggshell colored crown. Solid retention. Spotty droplets of lacing coated the glass.
Fantastic aroma. Super fruity and bright. Tropical fruits dominated. Papaya, guava and pineapple came through strongest. Fairly sweet. There was a dank, weed-like quality as well. Touch of lemon. Grapefruit notes appeared as the beer warmed.
The flavor profile was drastically different from the nose. It too was super hoppy but also remarkably pithy and dry. The hops had an intense catty quality. Loads of white grapefruit. Uber lemony. Fairly grassy. The beer finished with an intensely dry and bitter, lemon rind-like quality. Moderately tart. The pithy, bitter notes lingered long after every sip.
The mouthfeel was surprisingly light for the style. Frothy and fluffy. The liquid contained a super fine, semi-aggressive, almost Champagne-like carbonation. Rather odd and a bit disappointing.
I typically love intensely hoppy double IPAs, but Bissel Bothers's Swish was far too dry and pithy for my palate. Perhaps a bigger mouthfeel and more rounded flavor profile could improve things significantly. 1,283 charactersDamian, Apr 24, 2015

4.49/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516 oz can poured into a bulbed pint glass.  Liquid comes out a nice golden yellow color.  Glows a little brighter when it's held up to the light.  Nice white colored head, mostly small bubbles and it has some decentnlacing to it. 
Smell is really good, jumps out at you right out of the can.  Huge tropical hop aromas immediately.  Orange, mango, and pinnacle kind of come out immediately then there's some floral and resin notes.  Some nice light bready grain notes at the end.
Taste is really, really good.  Delicious flavors of orange, like baked orange bread or pound cake though.  Pinnaple and mango and some fresh juicy tangerine, some tropical flavors with a little bit of citrus peel.  Some nice light gentle grains in there as well.
Mouthfeel is good.  Has a nice heavy medium feel with somewhat of a lingering flavor.  Very nice carbonation level, works great with the beer.  It's well balanced; sweet without being to sweet and hoppy without being a total hop bomb.  Great drinkability and an easy beer to drink.  A beer for anyone to enjoy year round.  Glad to have been able to try it.  Thanks Nick for hooking me up with a couple cans! 1,152 charactersAndyAvalanche, Apr 07, 2015

4.7/5  rDev +3.5%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Half-pint on tap at Hella Good in Portland, Maine. Served in a mason jar.
Appearance: Pours a cloudy orange-gold with a big frothy white head. Lots of lacing on the way down.
Aroma: Big aromatics here. Hops, grapefruit, pine, citrus, lemon and other traditional IPA aromas. The nose lets you know this is going to be something else.
Taste: Holy moly. What a delicious DIPA. Grapefruit is the dominant flavor, and there's also a sort of pleasant cantaloupe note in there, too. Nice malt base to round it out. Alcohol burn is there. Feels like all of its 8 ABV, to me, though others dissent. This is a great, great bigger IPA.
Mouthfeel: That's the other thing, it's perfectly balanced for the palate as well. Medium-bodied, with terrific depth of flavor. Finishes perfect and dry.
Overall: Wake up to the real deal. If you like hoppy IPAs, you owe it to yourself to find this one. A beer that reminds the imbiber why folks throw praise so liberally at great IPAs - and it's worth every one. 994 charactersillpass78, Mar 15, 2015

In fact I thought I was going to drink a beer that would knock me on my ass.  What I had was a very solid DIPA that looked, smelled, and tasted great.  It's not too far behind, but I don't think this beer quite stands up to the elite beers coming out of the Northeast right now.
Edit 3/19/15: yeah same result. Really very good beer but not the monster everyone's raving about IMHO. Smells great, tastes almost as good, but I just don't think it differentiates itself enough from many other New England IPAs 604 charactersJwburns75, Mar 13, 2015

5/5  rDev +10.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I feel like I've given too many fives, so I've been trying to find some fault with beers, but there's honestly nothing I could think of that would improve this beer from where it already is.  
A:  A beautiful cloudy golden orange colored IPA that has become one of my favorite things about the northeastern beers.  I love the juice like appearance this has.  Capped by a nice white foamy head.
S:  Huge aroma that hits you as soon as you crack the can open.  The aroma has ripe fruit like orange, pineapple, mango, but also plenty of pine like resin and earthy dankness.
T:  Reminded me of Heady, though its been a bit since I've had one.  There's a nice clean bitterness upfront, and that quickly gives way to a ton of hop flavor.  Citra, Mosaic, and Simcoe hops are just such an awesome combo.  There's tons of fruit flavor in this beer, and it mostly follows the nose.  Behind all that hop resin is a nice bready malt base.
M:  Similar to other IPAs from this region, the beer finishes dry as an IPA should, but there's a very nice medium bodied mouthfeel to it.  Left nice sticky lacing on the glass.
O:  Like I said, really nothing about this beer to improve on in my opinion, it has everything I love in a Double IPA, and I feel it stands with the best of the style.  Thanks for this, psweendogg! 1,307 charactersBrams17, Mar 10, 2015

Pours hazy deep yellow with a half finger of creamy white head. Aroma of pineapple and mango, deer honey, some pine, lots if citrus fruits and sweet pineapple. Mmm. Flavor follows with sweet pineapple notes, honey, but plenty of bitterness to balance the rich creaminess of the sweet tropical fruit: mango, pineapple, and some citrus peel. Creamy body, medium to medium low carbonation. This is good. 495 charactersBMMillsy, Feb 08, 2015

Taste is on point with smell and is VERY smooth. Not much pine/bitterness. Just fantastic. This may have jumped into my top ten IPA's with just one can! 392 charactershuddyball, Jan 13, 2015

Not as much of the fruit and piny flavors come through as expected, it has a more muted floral scent and flavor. A really good beer that is in sight of the DIPA greats but goes its own way. What it does have over the likes of Heady and Pliny is its evenhanded flavor from start to finish. Could crush a lot of these in a night and be very happy. 408 charactersetmur007, Jan 06, 2015

What can I say- amazing- BB combined my favorite hops, added an solid malt base and canned it so as soon as you pop the top it's like a sensory overload of citra, simcoe, mosaic and Apollo.  I think they use a similar yeast to heady topper(although completely different and I am not inferring that it is trying to be heady because it is not) so the yeast really accentuates the fruit notes, peach, nectarine etc. I don't find it overly bitter, but the taste is like a juicy, fruity, Citrus bomb.  It's like running naked through a simcoe hop field and then jumping in a citra bath and using mosaic soap and Apollo shampoo.  Great job BB. 689 charactersBMFR1811, Jan 03, 2015
