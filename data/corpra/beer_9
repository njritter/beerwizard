4.16/5  rDev -10.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.252017 review:
Dominated by grapefruit and some lemon. Heavy on Simcoe hops with some decent pine, but zero dankness which I loved about Heady Topper the first time I tried it. Dankness = Marijuana "good" skunky aroma/flavor. It's that something extra that isn't noticeable in 99% of IIPAs. 
The peach is absent, which leaves me to believe that either 1) the yeast generation is old, or 2) they switched up the way they used to treat the yeast. The orange flavor used to pop as well and now it's gone.
The ph must be quite low because I sense a decent amount of acidity. Hardness is also very high, which makes the hops pop.
Still a great beer, but Nothing like it was before. There are far better options out there nowadays which will make HT drop at least 10 whole rating spots if an experienced brewer and taster retried it. Reduced each category rating by 0.25. Taste gets a negative 0.50 reduction.
2014 review:
Orange yellow hue, slightly hazy. Appears to be 8 SRM. Thick foamy head with tons of sticky lacing. Carbonation is on the low side.
Smells dank, fruity, peachy, and citrusy. Lots of orange, marijuana and pine.
Tastes way more piney and dank than the aroma fortells. It's richer/juicier/hoppier than Pliny the Elder with a tad more residual sweetness (1.012-1.014 FG). Hop heaven in a can.
Mouthfeel is somewhat creamy and a perfect medium-body, probably more because of the sheer amount of hops and malt used. 1,433 charactersTreb0R, Jul 06, 2017

All I can say is is, that this my favorite beer to date. I started getting into IPA's on a trip to Burlington/Stowe last summer, and since have been on a search for delicious IPA's. This is the best I have had, hands down. Gorgeous, deliciousness, wonderful buzz feeling. I look forward to visiting my friends country house again to indulge! 433 charactersNoahTile, Jul 05, 2017

The appearance in the snifter was a hazy burnt orange color with a ton of floaties surrounding the body. The head was about a finger’s worth of white foaminess. There was some light lacing sticking nicely to the sides of the glass. The smell out of the can and glass was basically the same as it was pure citrus to piney hops that ended up assaulting my nose in a nice bitter/dank sort of way. The taste between the can and the glass was the same as it was pure bittersweetness from the hops. Even as this one warms, the sweetness comes from the hops and not the malts. On the palate, this one sat about a light to medium on the body with a pretty good sessionability about it. The carbonation was sharp due to the style and was much expected. Overall, an absolutely wonderful DIPA to me. 860 charactersLone_Freighter, Jun 08, 2017

Smell: Hops/Pine and Citrus- definitely more pineapple. 
Taste: I get way more sweetness than others can't tell if it's malt or hop. Definely pineapple and earthly grass flavors with piney hops. 
Feel: I feel this is where Heady is great. It's crazy how DIPA can not be so heavy. The mouthfeel is medium and the carb is so dialed in. I wouldn't say it's soft, but it's so agreeable. 
Overall: This is a granddaddy DIPA. Hops and preferences have changed, but this is still elite. 548 charactersmnbuffalo, May 27, 2017

As a west coast hop aficionado, I heard of heady topper, the beast of the east. I waited several years to try this beer. Expecting an aggressive hop bomb, I was disappointed at first; but then the rolling resin hit. Fresh pine off the bat followed by grapefruit smoldering into delicious resin that lingers. The linger is gratuitous, nicely piney and bitter. The malt is excellent but coated richly by hop aroma, whether it is a complement or burried is lost to me. May you decide. 569 charactersBbless, May 26, 2017

4.64/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Beer is a light golden orange color and very hazy. A massive 3 finger head settles down to about one finger after a few minutes, very good head retentention. Aromas of dank pine hit you up front followed by citrus, grapefruit, and esters. The taste is a hop bomb of pine and bitterness with subtle notes of grapefruit. There are also biscuit notes from the malt as the beer warms up. The beer is carbonated very dry giving it a very hop forward character. Overall a world class beer. 483 charactersTheRealMcKai, May 24, 2017

4.94/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5No "canned on" or "enjoy by" date, but the pack was picked up from the brewery about a week ago, so pretty effing fresh, and poured into the only glass available, a narrow cylindrical pint glass at my inn. Pours a suuuper hazy bright golden color with about an inch or so of stable white head and leaves hella lacing all the way down. Smell is just a bit faint but is exactly what I want from a NE IPA. Loads of pine resin and grapefruit zest/juice. Taste is on point. Balanced, but still rather in-your-face dank resinous character, the same citrusy pop but way more juicy and bold on the palate than on the nose. As you swallow, the pine character builds up even more and lingers on the tongue for ages. Medium body with medium carbonation, all adding to the surprisingly balanced character of this beer. Overall, it may deserve all the hype it gets, but there is a reason this is so sought after. This stuff is bangin'! Super hoppy and yet still finds its proper balance, at least as much balance as an IIPA can really have. Feeling lucky to have gotten this. Sidenote- is highly recommend not drinking straight from the can, regardless of what it says. I did half in the can and half in a glass, and dammit, the glass really does a lot for the aroma. Just don't worry about the floaty bits. That's just character. 1,317 charactersweareallfalafel, May 20, 2017

I drank it out of the can as directed so as for color I can only figure it is great in color... to go along with the rest of my review. The taste is superb from the beginning to the end. The choice of hops is top notch with a smooth  mouth feel with several different fruit notes with a great finish. It is a beer to sit, relax, and enjoy, but tough to do. Since you want to keep going back for more mouth euphoria. 622 charactersHellsRanger, May 02, 2017

Poured from the can into a nonic pint glass.
Looks a little hazy orangey-gold color.
Smells of pine hops, orange, and citrus.
Big hop taste, bitter with orange, citrus notes.
This customer really hyped this beer up and he was right.  Too bad it's not available here in Rhode Island.  It was fantastic, but for geographic reasons, I'm still partial to Grey Sail Pour Judgement. 498 charactersSuperRevs96, Apr 08, 2017

We have a saying around here, if there's nothing exciting on tap: "Fine, I'll bitch out and have a Heady." I've had it on draft locally as well as sampled from the old cannery and the new brewery. I've had a year old Heady that was crystal clear and absolutely spectacular. Unless it's poorly kept or somehow oxidized, it never sucks. The recipe has changed over time but the enjoyment never fades! 503 characterskool-aid, Apr 03, 2017

I like Maine beers, I like knee deep beers, i like mosaic hops.  Honestly I was ecstatic when my buddy brought home a plethora of alchemist beers.  Focal banger should be right up my alley but its so over the top i have to blend it but when i do i still enjoy big mosaic hops.  Heady is just foul.  I realize my opinion is an outlier but when I tell you I struggled to finish a can (ipa drinking wife included) Im very serious.  I had it on 2 occasions to cement my feelings on it and they are this beer is soooooooooooooooo overrated I'm in awe of how lousy it was for me, really nothing redeeming to say other than at 8%abv if you can hold your  nose and slam a few of these i guess you'll be in a happy place but i can give you myriad other options to better get you there. 878 charactersZnice21, Mar 27, 2017

Can from Dave.   Poured the "middle third" into a goblet; the rest drank from the can.
LOOK:  from the part i poured in the goblet, the color is golden yellow; small, but lasting head, slightly hazy.
AROMA:  hops, pine, fresh air.
TASTE:  metallic hops, leaves, something hinting on citrus but not quite.  Some tropical fruit in the finish. 
FEEL:   medium body, middling carbonation; but there is a freshness.
There is something about this beer that makes it greater than the sum of its parts (hence I have Overall higher than Taste).  I am not big on IPA's in general, but certain ones I really enjoy.  This is obviously well crafted and I would be honored to have this again.    Enjoyed this much more than Focal Banger.  Strangely (to me), I did enjoy the portion from the can better than the portion I poured.
Looks like can is about 9 months old, so maybe this is stellar when fresh; but it is still very good when a little old.

Served in a tulip glass, directions be damned
This beer pours like pineapple juice and is topped with two inches of fluffy beige head that leaves little lacing on the glass.
In the aroma I get orange, grapefruit and pine.
The taste is all grapefruit and pine. The bitterness builds the more I drink.
Medium mouthfeel
The smell indicated a juicy IPA, while the flavor was quite bitter. This is the third time I have gotten the opportunity to try this beer, and it was the first full can that I consumed. I cannot say that it lives up to the hype. I'll take Hop Juju all day, everyday over this. Some day when I make it to Vermont, I will have some guaranteed fresh and see if that changes my mind. I have no idea how old this can is. It was given to me by a friend over the weekend. I can't believe it's more than 2 or 3 weeks old, but I could be wrong. 868 charactersbuschbeer, Mar 07, 2017

4.61/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Thanks for the trade Ross!  Color is a vibrant yellow-straw with minimal haze....I had to pour a few ounces into a tasting glass despite the command to drink from the can. Didn't pour enough to get any discernible head.  The smell is outrageous with lemon, orange, hop resin...it really is a delightful smell.  The taste is very juicy and it doesn't get washed out by the carbonation or hops. I am getting an orange rind and piney dry finish.  A medium-full body with a soft mouth-feel, again the carbonation is present but not overpowering, this is particularly applicable when consumed from the can.  
Do yourself a favor when you get your hands on Heady Topper and follow the instructions.  Drink it from the can. The look is the least impressive facet of this beer and when consumed outside of the can it does take away from the smell, taste and feel. However, with good reason this is a truly world-class beer.  Anyone saying otherwise is not being objective. Thanks again, Ross. 984 charactersGreyvtrayn, Mar 02, 2017

Picked this up fresh from the Alchemist which is an awesome setup and beautiful brewery. 
Taste is pretty good and refreshing - nothing special, but I suppose it's worth trying if you're an IPA fan. Everytime I go back for a sip I think to myself, OK this is gonna be the amazing Heady Topper that has all the hype. I swish it in my mouth just praying it tastes like heaven. It never comes. Just a muted IPA. This beer has fallen behind the style over the past 10 years.
I will credit Heady and the Alchemist for starting the hazy, lightly bittered IPA but for the hype it gets, pretty disappointing overall. I would take Burlington, Foam, and HF over Heady all day.

4.91/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Look: Poured approx. 1 to 2 oz into tulip glass for look purposes only, the rest drank from the can. Pours a light gold/yellow color. Translucent, and moderately cloudy. Leaves some small and big bubbles with a small amount of white head. Leaves a characteristic lacing around the glass.
Smell:  I want to crawl and live in the can. Immediate burst of tropical hops, I get pineapple, grapefruit, mango, strawberry, peach, and even bubble gum! You can smell that this beer provides of lot of flavor from the hops, but will not be bitter, and will supply a strong malty backbone.
Taste: Taste mimics smell: Immediate tropical burst of hops which include pineapple, grapefruit, mango, and peach. With the taste you get a mild bite of hops with pine and grass which subsides as the beer takes a sweet cracker malt finish. The beer leaves almost no bitter aftertaste which I would expect from a beer of this style. 
Feel: Mild carbonation allows the beer to flow freely across the palate and spread the delicious juicy hops all over the taste buds. Allows the beer to give an almost 'creamy' taste which incorporates to the reasoning this beer is considered the best in the world.
Overall: This is truly a world class beer. The best of the best. 10/10. The one and only beer I would choose if I was deserted on a remote island. Well done Alchemist!

A:  It smells like honey, citrus, and some other fruit I just can't quite put my finger on.
T: Wonderful. Mango. That's what the smell was, just very subtle. It ties it all together. Honestly, again, I am having a hard time dissecting all the flavors, I can only say it blends exceptionally well together.
F: A perfect feel for an IPA. Crisp, good amount of bitterness, decent carbonation, and wonderfully smooth and easy to drink. A slightly velvety feel to it as well.
O: This, being my first time with it, was not what I was expecting. Almost like a stepping stone from the best of what the west coast style had to offer, and into the best of what the NE style offers now. A truly great IPA, and deserves the respect it gets.

Head foams up quickly, peaking at 3 fingers with an aggressive start and conservative finish. Retention on the head is great, lasting even through a half dozen sips. Lacing bubbles around the glass, with great retention. Aroma is steeped in layers of citrus, with notes of orange, lemon zest, and papaya. Biscuit malts bunch up just behind the hops to form an assertive, but refreshingly delicate hoppy aroma. Flavor profile opens with a smooth crescendo of citrus, orange, lemon zest, and biscuit malts. A hoppy start flexes and reshapes itself into a malty finish - with a little resin hop at the end to stick to the palate. Mouth feel is smooth and somewhat filling with a medium thickness. Feel certainly has a presence, but is still light enough to be enjoyed swiftly on a blisteringly hot day. Overall, a sublime IPA with plenty of flavorful body, and presence. The lack of a bitter stinging finish makes this an easy beer to enjoy for folks both new to IPAs and old.

Hazy, unfiltered hay color. Incredible nose of hop-derived tropical and citrus fruit. On the palate, orange, grapefruit, and pineapple flavors carried by an intense hoppy bitterness that nonetheless is balanced by the big flavors. This comes across with little apparently alcohol; could drink all day.
Incredibly clean and crisp with intense yet balanced hoppy bitterness. A nearly perfect DIPA. 423 charactersr_love, Feb 01, 2017

4.69/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured to a tulip glass.
A: The body just a bit hazy, not like the New Englad IPA styles, not terribly juicy but hazy enough to provide some presence in the glass. The head, when poured, had a thickness of 1 finger but after the beer settled, it got very minimal showing yet lots of retention. No lacing.
S: The aroma is more fruity than expected. There's lots of mango and pineapple instead of the regularly expected earthy and resinous aromas. This is really cool for an intro. It smells a lot better coming from the can than when poured into a glass.
T: The taste is incredibly as it has a good fruity profile of almost no citrus but lots of mango and pineapple. After the first sip you finally the earthy and resinous profiles of this beer but they're not that strong. The hoppiness is awesome.
M: The mouthfeel of this beer is actually the thing that caught my 'eye'. It's incredibly smooth, being very very velvety, having an also perfect carbonation. Bitterness is not as high as expected but this beer has at least 4 weeks. Yet, it's just perfect.
O: Overall, it's not my favorite IPA but you can feel the hype on the mouthfeel. It's easily a Top5 though. 1,164 charactersjoaopmgoncalves, Jan 27, 2017
4.61/5  rDev -0.9%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75Ah, heady topper. Had several times but this is my first time writing a review. Ignored the advice on the can, of course, and poured into a tulip.
Nice foamy white head, a little golden tinge to it. Retention is pretty good, and lacing is excellent. Nice little bubbles streaming up from the bottom. Golden orange-yellow and really hazy, though not thickly opaque.
Feathery floral smell with pine and light fruit. Some kind of citrus and other tropical aroma.
This beer is damn smooth, that’s for sure. Juicy, a little thinner than might be expected, but nice mildly sharp presence on the tongue. 
Far from an aggressive beer, there is no strong bitterness or overpowering flavors. Starts fruity, becomes piney, then citrus, finishing with a little malty sweetness aftertaste. Well-rounded, with unobtrusive flavor and great complexity. Very nice.
I had a few cans of this, some from a month ago and one that I forgot about from mid-October. I don’t know which this is, though if it’s the October one, that’s certainly pushing it in terms of freshness, and perhaps that has some impact on the relatively light aroma and slightly thin texture. 1,155 charactersj_d_b, Jan 27, 2017

Balance. Super soft on the palate. Sweet citrus, particularly orange and clementines. Floral and subtle pine.   
Freakin delicous and unfortunately crushable... because I only have one.  
If I had one beer to drink for the rest of my life it would undoubtedly be...... i don't know..... but the fabled Heady would almost certainly come to mind. 
I'm in Jersey so I had to twist a few arms to get my hands on this gem. I guess to get Heady you have to give it.... 573 charactersweakascheese, Jan 23, 2017

I first drank it straight from the can as recommended, ice cold at a restaurant in Burlington. It goes down unbelievably smooth for a Double IPA, and it finishes just as clean. The flavor is filled to the brim with high quality hops. Not my cup of tea, but for the IPA freak, it's worth the trip to cozy Vermont. 413 characters413, Jan 10, 2017

S-one of the most aromatic beers ever, smells like a bag of weed, with strong citrus grapefruit.
T-the first taste of the beer completely blew me away. Had it on tap a Prohibition pig in 2012.  However after having it many times the novelty wears off.
O-I love what Heady started and enjoy one every time I ski in VT.  It is at the top of my list but no longer my favorite. 409 charactersMarkhdougherty, Jan 10, 2017

4.82/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I have been digging NE IPAs since they've been so big lately in SoCal and decided to spend a wad getting this (fresh) out west, it was way worth it. I also ordered Crushed and Focal Banger as part of the haul, but this is the original so he goes first. Poured the first HT into a cold tulip glass without swirling to peep the glory then the second out of the can. The can experience was far better, I actually preferred it colder. Nice light yellow hazy honey color with a finger high head and pretty lacing which coated the glass even after it was gone.
Way worth the hype. I love the murk of CA's attempts at this style but the nice balance of flavors (I picked up more mango and grapefruit cold from the can and then more floral notes as it warmed up in my glass, nothing was overpowering, though), silky mouthfeel and fresh hoppyness trifecta are better than any I have had out there. I think if you prefer one taste over another you'll find a favorite elsewhere but this has everything in perfect moderation.
 Definitely doesn't taste or smell as boozy as an 8 pointer, a fine big beer for day drinking! I am really glad I tried this after years of telling myself I would. If you're on the fence, DO IT. 1,210 charactersfureyous, Jan 05, 2017

The flavor followed the scent with a high bitterness that was balanced well with the smooth sweet malt. Quite a resinous taste/feel on this one. The mouthfeel made this beer stand out. I've only had a few beers that match this mouthfeel on an IPA, almost seems to coat your mouth with smoothness while maintaining a crispness from the carbonation.

My son who goes to school in Vermont brought me a case for Christmas. The best gift I've ever gotten. Truly lives up to the hype.  It is extremely important that you do not let this ale get warm, that will totally funk it ul. 472 charactersjth63, Dec 27, 2016

It smells of bready malt, grass, pine needles, lemon peel, and grapefruit. Wow, what a perfect balance of malt, fruit, and hops.  The first taste is the somewhat sweet, bready malt.  It's no fruit bomb; the citrus is subtle, delicate.  There are touches of tropical sweetness and vanilla, particularly as the glass warms a little.  Then the hops explode, bitter and biting.  The after taste is bitter - in a good way.  This ale it medium-bodied, with pleasant carbonation, and a reasonable 8% ABV that allows for easy drinking.  You can down a couple of these.  Overall, it's an exquisite DIPA and merits its lofty ratings.  I'm glad I was finally able to experience it.  Road trip to Vermont? 979 charactersMacMalt, Dec 24, 2016

4.73/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75While instructed to drink from the can, most of the review (besides the first few smells and sips) was poured into my Pliny the Elder pint glass (ironic, I know). 
The beer pours a hazy, light orange color with 2 fingers of a long-lasting fluffy white head. Clearly unfiltered with some sediment that was originally not included, but I decided to pour in after the first few sips.  Great lacing. 
Aroma is a hybrid between east coast juice and west coast pine/grapefruit. I get tons of pine, grapefruit, pineapple, mango, some papaya, and a generic bright citrus. Some floral hop notes as well. 
Taste is aggressively hopped but not overdone, moderate to high level of bitterness, with just enough malt to ensure it’s not a total hop bomb. Despite the rather high ABV, the beer has just the right amount of carbonation to mimic that of something a few notches lower. No alcohol burn or heat. Grapefruit pith is the shining fruit in this mix. Some grassy hop notes, with some pine. A lot less tropically than I was expecting, but those flavors do begin to surface as the beer warms. I do enjoy this better than Pliny – better carbonation, mouthfeel, and flavor. Again, as the beer warms, much more citrus notes and a bit of peach and apricot are detectable. 
Overall, this is a great beer. In and of itself does it warrant a trip to Vermont to try… I would say no. However, with all of the great beers located within the region, a regional brewery trip would be great. While incredibly hoppy with layers of flavors, it isn’t so much superior that it warrants a plane ride and a couple hundred dollars. That isn’t to say that I did not love this beer, because I absolutely did. I recommend drinking this beer by itself. It gets a 94.5/100. 1,751 charactersDaverCS, Dec 20, 2016

L - bright yellow color, hazy and clear hue. Two finger head with lacing focused towards the top of the glass
S - aroma is slightly muted, but it seems to be a mixture of all sorts of IPA notes. Very pleasant actually
T - super smooth, it's crazy! Grapefruit all the way but no detection of booze or malt at all. Super clean and tasty 
F - super drinkable and clean, like you're drinking a pale ale. 
O - I can see why there's hype but some other breweries can replicate this balance. However, this is granddad of whales and Double IPAs and certainly deserves the pedestal it is on. Bucket list beer for sure, so sad to see it leave my fridge.....Cheers! 764 charactersctylinebeer, Dec 08, 2016

Overall, not my favorite New England Double IPA. My first, Epiphany on tap at the Foundation brewery was eye-opening. The fruity smell, the cloudy unfiltered haze, the balanced crisp but not bitter taste showed me what the hype was about fresh double IPA's. Epiphany is still my standard, but my favorite is now Florens around the other side of 1 Industrial Way--you have to root for the little guy.
Back to Heady Topper, by the time I poured my can and sipped from it too, there wasn't much fruitiness and the pour was clear, not cloudy. The taste was pleasant, balanced and enjoyable, but not like a fresh double at the brewery. I'll stick to my neighborhood and stop chasing something better. 874 charactersLonborgski, Nov 23, 2016

Tropical fruit juice in the middle but finishes with mango.  The back end is a tad too bitter for my tastes but most would enjoy it.  feel is medium bodied.  Overall this is a really good beer that is a tad too bitter for my own tastes. 551 charactersAmguerra305, Nov 19, 2016

Live review. Consumed 32 days after bought in store. No canned date, but I imagine the time between being canned and hitting the shelf was minimal. 
A - Poured fairly vigorously into a snifter glass. Billowy, egg shell colored head with a nice level of retention. Some lacing left behind, but not a ton. The color is right in that typical zone for IPA's with a lean towards the orange hues. Pretty hazy appearance which could be from my strong pour, or suspended hop resins, or both. 
S - Surprisingly not overpowering, but it's certainly pure hops. Nearly like putting your face into a handful of fresh hop cones. Nice bouquet of tropical fruits, also floral, a faint touch of spice, and even fainter biscuity malts. The tropical and floral combo is divine. Pineapple, papaya, mango, grapefruit, lime, sweet candied fruits. The beauty of the aroma is not that it blows you away with strength, but in how it harmoniously comes together. 
T - Big time hop flavor as advertised, but it finds a way to maintain balance, and avoid being one dimensional. Hop profile is quite complex. There's no note that truly outshines another, but it's a symphony of flavors. Tropical flavors are present, like in the nose, as are flavors of sweet candied fruits, pine, grass, freshly crushed black pepper, and a fairly big, pleasant onion-like pungency. Bitterness is moderate and lingers just a bit. Beer steps to another level as it warms. Still enjoying the bottom third of the glass as much as the initial sips. 
M - Mouthfeel might actually be the best aspect of the beer. Drinkability is off the charts. Very hard to keep the glass down for long. Perfect level of effervescence on the tongue. Velvety mouthfeel that just consumes the tongue with hop oils. Overall, a fairly dry finish. Only sign of the 8% ABV is the touch of warmth, but it's not detracting. It works extremely well with everything. 
O - Waited patiently for many years to get a chance to enjoy Heady Topper. It was THE beer I most wanted to try. And thanks to some fortunate circumstances, a great friend, and a little luck, the opportunity finally arrived. I can't really say that the very lofty expectations I had placed on this beer were completely met. It wasn't a total game changer as I had convinced myself it would be. Just getting that part out of the way. But I'm in no way complaining. Seriously, it's a ridiculously damn good beer. Superbly crafted. World class drinkability. Nothing else quite like it. And after reading John Kimmich's message on the back of the can, I think Heady Topper succeeds in what it was set to do, which is taking the consumer on an incredible journey to hop heaven. 2,676 charactersTechTriumph, Nov 19, 2016

4.72/5  rDev +1.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Super excited to try the venerable Heady Topper! I did not drink from the can but I did pour it without rolling the can so as not to disturb the sediment. 
Look: Light golden color with lots of haze. poured out with a finger of head. Nice tight bubble structure.  
Smell: Pine and spruce jumps out of the glass but it definitely has that yeasty "smell of the brewery" thing that really good IPAs have. Some lemongrass in there as well but it is definitely the pine and spruce that stand out.
Taste: Super grapefruity on the front of the palate, nice and pithy. Lemongrass on the palate as well. finishes with a piney refreshing bitterness. Disguises its alcohol content well. 
Mouthfeel: Wonderful medium plus creaminess. Not too heavy. Dries out on the back which helps make this beer super crushable.
Overall(style points): This beer gets all the hype and I can see why. In a world before New England style IPA  were everywhere this must have been mind blowing. In today's world though, the game has moved on. It's still a great beer but it just doesn't blow me away the way I wanted it to. 95.25 points. 1,111 charactersMikeyMcD86, Nov 05, 2016

Poured a hazy yellow (thicker, and hazier than most DIPAs).  Pine and citrus on the nose, though not to the incredible extreme of The Crusher.  Palate is tremendously dank, bitter hops.  Pine is more present than citrus, though both certainly play a role in the palate here.  Solid medium mouthfeel.  An exceptional DIPA, but in the world of extremely good IPAs, this one is not so singular as the hype would imply.  Tremendous?  Of course.  Best in its class?  Sadly not. 587 charactersLAp, Oct 30, 2016

4.34/5  rDev -6.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Appearance: yellow-golden with a white head with good retention that fades to a thin lacing. 
Aroma: a bit of citrus in the hops. Inviting. The nose by itself lets you know this is going to be a good one.
Flavor: yea, I like this one. The hops hit you right in the face, but not overwhelmingly so. Despite the high bitterness, it isn’t “spicy.” The hop flavors fade to a light citrus and saw dust. Piney resin comes to mind. The malt is sweet, but really serves only as the canvas to showcase the hops.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied or just a hair shy. You could drink multiple of these. 
Overall: damn good, but I don’t feel it deserves quite its BA score. I traded Pliny for HT. If offered the choice between the two, I’d opt for the Pliny. 751 charactersPray_For_Mojo, Oct 28, 2016

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I have drank almost everything from #1 to #25 and others on the list. I drive to VT every so often to pick up 2 cases and drive back to MA. Why? Simply said, this is the best beer (DIPA) in America. I also drive to the TH and  drink all their beers too. I have not had Pliney The Younger so I can't comment on that, but it's only in a keg form and can't get the CA to try it. I have had Pliney the Elder though. Heady, as it's affectionately called, when fresh, far exceeds anything in its class. I have had many of the Tree house beers, and they are really good and deserve spots on the list but no IPA or DIPA from TH is as good as Heady. King Julius is close. I have both Heady and TH beers in my frig at all times and enjoy them all. I wont comment on what I taste or how it pours because it's different for most people. Find someone that has fresh heady and trade with them and you will see why a large majority of people think it's the best they ever had. 961 charactersInca64, Oct 26, 2016
4.64/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Can Date: purchased 10/14/16
Palate Contaminants: none
The look is a nice translucent amber with moderate head. The light actually changes colors if I move it to indirect light, never seen that.
I got a great whiff when I cracked open the can. The principal smell is savory fruit. And even though they're savory, they're mostly acidic. I can pick out red grapefruit, pineapple, orange, sweet melon, and cactus fruit. It's also lactic, even trending toward salty. 
The taste canvas is savory malt. The citrus elements are less, with mostly the red grapefruit coming through. The lactic element is stronger, though. There's also a vegetable/herb tilt here, it's one of those beers that might go well with a salad. Actually, it probably goes well with everything. It's very well balanced.
I don't get much bitter until the aftertaste, but it has enough savory and sweet to make it enjoyable. The carbonation is very well integrated. 933 charactersZythophile, Oct 26, 2016

That being said, smell is citrusy and woodsy. Taste is nice balance of malt and hop: starts with a nice pop of fresh pine/woods with a nice bit of tangerine/orange, that fades out and a nice biscuity flavor sits in. Really nice.

Rating this off of the told canned date.  Doesn't hold up well at all if the canned date is 10/8.  Smell and taste of fresh hop aromas was non-existent.  Malty flavor, tasted like an old IPA. 422 charactersBoff101, Oct 22, 2016

I was surprised to see the disclaimer on the can that encouraged one to drink it directly from the can.  I'm actually a fan of that practice.  Overall, this beer is very well-balanced.  It's excellent.  I would drink it again.  I probably wouldn't drive 12 hours to get it though.  Not sure I understand how this is #6 on the all time list.  
The mouthfeel and overall balance are transcendent.  The hop aroma is middle of the road, IMO. IDENTICAL to the hop plant I bought at Meijer superstore and planted by our back door.  The execution was definitely there though. The fresh aroma was preserved perfectly.  I feel I've accomplished something by trying this. 750 charactersmickmanhattan, Oct 21, 2016

Let me tell you, worth the wait and it lives up to all the hype.  I've had a lot of hoppy IPAs, but this is unique and the only way I can describe it is that it is very floral.  You immediately smell the hops, like you took a big handful of the freshest hops and crushed it up in your hands and stuffed your nose in it.  The taste matches it, very floral and bright, but not too bitter in the back.  Smooth finish and makes you crave more.  Guess I'm going to have to head back up to the middle of nowhere Vermont to get some more as soon as it's gone, definitely worth it. 739 charactersCRyan603, Oct 15, 2016

Taste: There is a stupendous complexity, it is full of a number of flavours. Incredible layers of hop with a sweet dank funkiness, orange and grapefruit juices, thinned honey, and fresh grass under it all that make simultaneously sweet and bitter. 
Mouth: An excellent balance of carbonation and a heftier medium body with a delicate resinous quality that compliments it's juiceiness. A little bit of acidity but hardly noticeable, I call it a clean finish as well even though their is a bitterness to it, the palate is in a constant orgasm of sensations to even notice it, and definitely does not feel like an 8% either.
Overall: Superb. I now know what all the fuss is about. And have a great benchmark now to compare future DIPAs to. A magnificent and super palatable brew. I am in awe - and have Greg (@GJKerr) to thank.  Best breakfast ever!
Pairing: Don't. Well not your first one anyways... This is one of those rare occasions where I am left speechless and enjoyed all the complexities of the brew itself that to try and match it to a food the first go around would not be prudent. I may add and edit at some point if I ever get another one of these. But for now I am supremely content with just the beer itself. 1,589 charactersJonCorbett, Oct 14, 2016

Smell - Nice grapefruit and pine citrus notes very sweet and lots of resin.
Taste - Possibly the best IIPA I have ever tasted, for sure the smoothest, very hoppy but not bitter hoppy, nice pine resin and grapefruit flavors. At 8% this thing goes down smooth. I have heard about this but did not think it would taste this good.
Feel - Medium body very smooth for a IIPA, no hint of the 8% alcohol just slightly dry on the finish.
Overall - Wow is all I can say best IIPA I have had, excellent flavor and feel. 590 charactersDragginballs76, Oct 08, 2016

I have been searching for it for a long time, and a friend came through for me.

4.93/5  rDev +6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Honey, lemon juice, cloudy in texture with little visible carbonation.  Topped with 3 fingers of white, foamy head.
Fresh hoppy goodness like opening a bag of hops, or walking by the hops in a brewery, or brewing store.  Amarillo, citrusy, piney and fresh malts all at once.  It has a slight sweetness to it, as well as deep dankness from the hops.  
Oh my.  Rich sweetness, with fresh hops coming in layer upon layer.  So fresh and floral and fruity, but finishing with a solid bitterness on the end.  Amarillo, citrus, pine some layers of perhaps of Saaz.  Hints of barnyard.  Big, fresh, juicy honeydew melon.  Some cantaloupe at times as well.  The sweet and bitter balance out perfectly. Some fish as well, perhaps from the can. Tastes sweeter and more melon like when enjoyed from a glass.
Medium thick, syrupy but resinous body, with moderate, soda like carbonation.  Balance of sweetness and dry hop qualities.
Got this at the New Alchemist Brewery in Stowe, Vermont Sept 28th, 2016.  Drank Sept 30th (1am) in Etobicoke, Toronto.  I had a taste first at the brewery, and in the glass at home it tastes the same.  In the can, its not as sweet or melon like, but intense and fresh, with an unadulterated hop quality.  A sure winner.  No wonder its so highly rated. 1,274 characterspatre_tim, Sep 30, 2016

Try it for yourself, but I thought it tasted much better in a glass, where the wonderful blend of hops opened up. We were in NE for a wedding, and the extra ten hours we drove to partake and purchase were well rewarded. The wait was not bad on Friday, but there was a longer line on Saturday. Sufficient product was available both days. 551 charactersjoeboe2001, Sep 30, 2016

Well, it's my birthday and what better way to celebrate than by having my first Heady. A huge thanks to Jon Hand for setting me up with this.
Poured from a 16oz can into a pint glass. (Sorry , can't bring myself to drink from the can) Very hazy yellow body with a few small floaties. White bubbly head, leaves decent lacing. Good carbonation. Became clearer over the course of my drinking it. 
Aroma is of hops, hops, hops, and citrus fruit. 
Took my time over this one, but the taste on this is really top notch. The citrus, the pineyness, the hoppiness, the ever so faint alcohol burn at the end are as good as it gets. It's a beer that literally makes your mouth water as you're drinking it. 
Mouth is closer to full than medium. Nice hop bite around the edge of the tongue that lingers. 
Overall, have been looking forward to this one for some time, and it did not disappoint. Have 3 other Alchemist beers in the fridge courtesy of Jon, looking forward to getting into those as well. 1,010 charactersMikeWard, Sep 27, 2016

Probably 2+ months old, poured into a tulip glass. Look is a golden-straw color, slightly hazy, well carbonated, with a fluffy white head that holds well and laces gently. Smell is initially fairly subdued, with grapefruit rind and citrus, dank, dank grassiness, light biscuit, sweet tropical fruit, and a little onion. As the beer warms those aromas intensify greatly and wonderfully, especially the sweet tropical fruit and dankness. Taste is honestly more mellowed than I expected. Definitely juicy and fruity and citrusy, but not really uniquely so. But so damn drinkable. Soft bitterness, grassy herbalness, and light biscuit to go along with the citrus and tropical fruitiness. Goes down so damn easy. Feel is fuller than it looks, quite silky and luscious. Really wonderful beer.  The hype would be hard for any beer to live up to, especially one that is intended to be extra-crushable. Certainly will drink it any time I can, and will continue to seek out opportunities for it, but not sure I would say it's the best IIPA I've ever had in a world where many brewers are pushing the sensory envelope. But man I wish I had easier access to it, because this is one you'd love to have on hand at all times. 1,288 charactersAmeriCanadian, Sep 18, 2016

4.86/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16 of can into a tulip glass. 
Appearance is a hazy yellow/light brown with two finger thick head.
Smell is a plethora of hops with peach, biscuit, earthy, herb (thyme), hay, grapefruit, and yeast flavors. There is also a hint of pine and general juicy notes.
Taste also has a ton of hop flavor with peach/mango and earthy hop flavors leading the way. Pine is slightly mlre present the in the aroma. This beer has some lingering bitterness, but I acclimated to it the more I drank.
Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth and soft up front and through the mid palate with a nice crisp finish (medium full in body).
Overall this is an incredible double ipa. Hops are clearly the focus but there is a nice malt backbone that is light in sweetness hiding in the background. The mouthfeel, which is incredibly soft yet effervescent, puts this beer over the top. This is one of the best beers that I have had the pleasure of tasting. 938 charactersthatche2, Sep 16, 2016

O: Fantastic beer. Not sure it is the best out there as hype suggests but pretty damn good for a beer that has been around this long. 463 charactershgw605, Sep 10, 2016

S - Dank hop juice, some grapefruit and lots of pine
T - Tropical juices and then delicious hop oils. Pine needles and a dank finish. Bitterness isn't overly intense and this is sweet at times. Drinking from the can envelopes the entire beer with that dank quality.
F - Perfect. Good carbonation, never syrupy. Drinks lighter than 8%.
O - A nearly perfectly-balanced beer filled with all of those unfiltered goodies and is still drinker-friendly. 497 charactersThrewRedButter, Sep 09, 2016

That being said, I'll probably very rarely drink it unless I happen to be in Vermont and happen to be at some place that actually has it- and that's okay. As good as it is, just drink fresh and local when it comes to IPAs- there are plenty of amazing, or at least very solid ones out there, and all over the place. 498 charactersGeorgiabeer, Sep 03, 2016

4.51/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Just what the world has been waiting for: another Heady review...
From the 16oz can, undated but almost certainly canned the last week of June. Served in an imperial pint/nonic.
The pour is profoundly clouded but not murky - I can see the shadow of my fingers through the glass. The colour is a cheerful sunshiney gold with a creamy two-finger head, decent retention and gobs of sloppy lacing.
Smell is biscuity and earthy, dankly herbal, peach and strawberry, orange juice and balsam.
The taste is clean biscuit, orange juice and fresh-cut balsam upfront. After two months in my fridge the underlying malt character is prominent and drinks as smooth as glass. Grassy herb and oily tropical fruit notes. Finishes with a briefly lingering sappy bitterness.
Feel is medium-bodied, thick and creamy, with ample carbonation.
I've had these Headies refrigerated all summer and, what with one thing and another, I've been drinking them down at the rate of only one or two cans a week. I can now state authoritatively that, despite the can's admonition to 'drink fresh,'  to my taste, they are reaching their peak of excellence at two months old. 1,145 characterspapposilenus, Aug 29, 2016

4.19/5  rDev -9.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25appearance- Golden in color with a slight amber hue, hazy bordering on turbid, and pours a fizzy two inch head.
aroma-  Grapefruit and pine stand out the most with sweeter fruits mixing in there as well (mango, orange, pineapple).
taste- Starts off with sweet hops like citrus, orange, and pineapple.  Towards the middle grapefruit starts to dominate and brings in some acidity and bitterness.  A little bit of a crackery malt that provides a dry finish, but it adds little flavor.\
feel- Medium bodied, medium carbonation, some resinous hops add to to a slick feel, and finishes semi-sweet (not completely clean).
overall- A lot of hype behind this one, and it definitely lives up to it for the most part.  A lot of ipas have grapefruit profiles but this definitely stands out has being one of the most intense grapefruit forward ipas I've had. Only knock on this beer is that I wish it was a little cleaner in the finish. I t has some slick resinous oils and malt sweetness that lingers a bit too long.  While this is a great beer, I wouldn't say its the best beer in the country, and I wouldn't even say its the best DIPA out there.  That being said it is a unique beer of high quality and that's what makes it worth seeking out.  There are very few DIPAs that match the same level of hop intensity that can be found on the shelves. 1,339 charactersCTbrew32, Aug 28, 2016

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was lucky enough to pick up 8 of these on a trip through Vermont.  Gotta give it a perfect 5 because it's the best beer I've ever tasted & now the beer to which I compare all PAs upon tasting.  When you open the can, you get hit with a citrus/pine aroma hop blast even if you're not all that up close that is refreshing all on its own even before tasting.  Then put in a mouthful & let the full hop taste cover your tongue & hit you with citrus/melon/pine/dank flavours before fading to a faint bitterness that is pleasant, unlike many IPAs, so much so that I hesitate to use the word bitterness.  I've had 5 now & switched to drinking from the can as per instructions.  Even though I think it's all in my head, it's tasting even better that way.  My favourite way to savour one of these: Open at around 8C or a few degrees above fridge temperature.  Open outside on a nice hot day & enjoy the aroma & the fantastic flavour of the first few sips.  Then, jiggle it up a bit to let a bit of the carbonation subside & enjoy the increased smoothness & slightly altered flavours for the 2nd half of the can.  Beer heaven! 1,118 charactersJesterr44, Aug 24, 2016

As you open the can you can smell sweet hops, very fruity but then comes the pine. Exactly what you'd expect from such a hyped beer. Took the first few sips from the can and its hard to explain how good this beer is. I will fall into the category of people who may overhype this beer but it was delicious! I feel it taste better when poured into a good IPA glass. I will be making trips to Vermont any chance I get to have this and anything else The Alchemist have to offer. 573 charactersMeyers1023, Aug 22, 2016

L: Pale yellow colored, hazy and turbid but still see-through.  
S: Very malt forward.  Reminds me a lot of a blond ale, very bready, grainy (similar to Eureka! by Treehouse).  Smells sweet.  Surprisingly hops here are more floral and restrained, slight hints of fruit (that of citra), citrus, also some blueberry.
T: Hops come through heavier here.  They are floral, pithy, and have a nice wet plant/cut grass sort of character.  Lots of citrus, get that sweet grapefruit/orange flavor, also some blueberry.  Malts are very prominent, super smooth and provide a repeat of the nose, but it rounds out the hops perfect.  Balance is perfect in this beer.  
F: Frothy, light mouthfeel.  High carbonation.  Insanely drinkable.
O: This beer was not at all what I expected.  Most people praise the sky over the hops in this, but I think the malt is the unsung hero here.  The hops are great though, don't get me wrong.  But what brings this beer to the next level is the balance.  An +8% beer should not be this drinkable. 1,127 charactersedward_boumil, Aug 20, 2016

I'd like to give a special thanks to Jason for this amazing gift. My excitement is mounting, time to crack it open... 
Poured a small amount into a sample snifter for appearance, I will enjoy the rest from the can as instructed.
A: Pours a hazy golden straw color, with a beautiful foamy white head. 
S: Very intense and pleasant hoppy, and fruity aromas immediately bombard the nostrils. Fresh citrus rind, grapefruit, blood orange, mango, and other tropical fruits meld perfectly with a dank herbal hoppyness. I also pick up some slight hints of sweet bread like malts, honey, and even fresh mint. It's pretty incredible how quickly the smell dominates the senses immediately as the can is cracked open, it instantaneously wowed me. This is quite possibly the best aroma I have ever gotten from an IPA especially considering the fact that you get so much of it even when drinking from a can. This is unprecedented for me.
T: Holy f**k! I have been drinking some absolutely savage IPA's lately, but this is on a whole other level. Big Flavors of citrus and tropical fruits blast your taste buds, and follow the mold the aromas lay out for you. Grapefruit, blood orange, apricot, lemon, mango and papaya blend together perfectly with grassy herbal, and resiny pine hop bitterness, and a subtly sweet malt backbone. This is one of the best tastes to have ever graced my tongue. I am beyond impressed, I didn't think it could be this good, damn was I wrong.
M: Full bodied with a nice juicy character. Medium to high amount of bubbly carbonation. Very slight hint of alcohol warmth. Rediculously drinkable with a crisp refreshing finish and pleasant lingering bitterness.
O: Wow! I must say this transcended all of my expectations, and surpassed the hype. I may legitimately shed a tear when I take my last sip. I wish I could get this regularly because I would drink it everyday if I could. I have had probably well over a 1,000 brews and this is one I would easily put in my top 25. It may take the cake as far as IPA's go. Obviously there are still some great ones I have yet to try, but at this moment in time this is my new benchmark IPA. If you ever have the chance to try this DO IT! Truly a nectar of the Gods beer.
Thanks again Jason! 2,443 charactersCannibalgasm, Aug 09, 2016

The aroma is killer: fresh cut grass, grapefruit, hit you immediately and you know you have something really good.  Finishes with a mild bitterness that stays on the tongue but not obtrusively.  You'd never know it's 8% based on taste.
Honestly, similar beers that I would reach for before Heady: Psuedo Sue and Creature Comfort's Automatic - would strongly  suggest Heady fans seek these out. 515 charactersBloodbuzz99, Aug 08, 2016

IMO, it is still an outstanding beer, but in this one can I drank it seemed different - thinner, less of a mouth feel to it along with fainter smell and taste.  I believe the increase in production over the past few years may have something to do with it or possibly it was an off can or even my own taste buds changing.  Still wouldn't pass on a 4-pack though! 468 characterstoca, Aug 02, 2016

Tastes explodes with carbonation bitterness. This dies down and the hop flavors explode, peach, mango and grapefruit. WOW ! ! ! What just happened ?  Another taste and WOW ! ! ! ! ! 
Second Heady, I poured a little in a glass. Cloudy as expected as is unfiltered and fermented with Conan yeast. But still WOW ! ! 
This is the best craft beer I have ever tasted. 460 charactersAmarilloBrewing, Aug 01, 2016

T: Straight hoppy showcase of pine and resin accompanied by light citrus and tropical fruit notes. Hides the ABV well.
F: Light, smooth, with good carbonation. 
O: Overall, a great DIPA. Love the choice of hop blend and the ABV is hidden very well. Very drinkable. Would love to try a fresher can! 605 charactersBeerGuy8315, Jul 24, 2016

Frothy tight white bubbled head, excellent lacing on the glass. With the aroma, I have no other way to explain it other than the perfect array of hops. A certain dankness in the back end, back door with a tropical sweetness of mangos, pinneapple, guava. No maltiness detected. Taste follows the nose well, with a burst of tropical resinous hops, even a funky yeast presence with a burst of piney, palate coating goodness. Pretty much the perfect IPA, nothing gimmicky or typical "NE hazy"-like. It's in its own lane, and deserves every bit of hype. 661 charactersMateo2699, Jul 17, 2016

Haze for days. Smells like a combination of grapefruit, freshly cut grass, and pine. Taste mostly follows the nose. The finish is incredible. The leftover hop flavors that cling to your tongue are delightful without over doing it. 
Heady, at one point, was my favorite beer and was THE beer that pushed me to try other ridiculously hopped beers. There are others I prefer nowadays. However, it is still in my top 10 for sure and I've still yet to have another beer that tastes like Heady. 597 charactersdaudelin2000, Jul 16, 2016

Its been a while since I have actually looked at the color since I drink Heady directly from the can when I can. I live in Florida and Vacation during the summer in Vermont I highly recommend the whole immersive cultural experience of getting Heady Topper fresh by any means possible which may include stalking the beer truck on delivery day, or waiting online at one of the delivery locations in close proximity to their brewery in Waterbury Vermont.  Upon popping open a Heady Topper the smell is intense and Hoppy as is the taste, there is a slight bitterness with your first sip which dissipates quickly leaving your palate yearning for more.   With balanced carbonation the mouth feel is that of pure refreshment. 762 charactersbpasseser, Jul 13, 2016

L: Consumed from the can, per instructions printed extensively on the can, so not much to rate here
S: Wonderfully hoppy aroma, the smell you wish all IPA would have when you open them.
T: Hops, hops, and more hops. Hop bomb doesn't cover the half of it.
F: Nothing exceptional on the mouthfeel, just standard hoppy bitterness and pine mixed with a little fruit.
O: A very good IPA, but far to reliant on massive amounts of hops, rather then making a complex set of flavors. 616 charactersSpamalot, Jul 05, 2016

1 PINT can, no freshness dating (but purchased on 6/6/16 so @ 3 weeks old)
$12.99/4-pk @ Healthy Living Market & Café, South Burlington, VT
This is not my first Heady Topper. I've had it super fresh and I've had it "aged" for a few weeks. I didn't understand the "drink it from the can" thing at first because it was fresh, and too aggressive. As it ages a bit I understand that better. And I have to admit, I don't like it fresh, there's too much vegetal character to it (green pepper, tomato stalk, and very grassy... but also somewhat resinous, and with some spruce). After two weeks it settles a bit, and smooths. However, without freshness dating there's no way to tell what you're getting until you've opened it.
I think what makes it work is that although it is so heavily laden with hops, and what I think of as "spent hop" character (that tobacco-like and muddy-vegetal taste) is that it's also got tropical fruit notes that pop up a bit don't really poke out, they're just threaded throughout the malt (bready, sugary, grainy), as are the rest of the hop notes (pine, pineapple, dank weed, mango, flowers, orange). So many hoppy beers seem like the hops are just resting on top of the malt, but Heady seems thoroughly amalgamated. And when it's got a few weeks on it it becomes quite smooth despite its kind of aggressive nature. 1,371 charactersNeroFiddled, Jun 30, 2016

A: Pours a hazy straw gold with a puffy yellow-tinged white head of tiny bubbles. Thick lacing sticks to the edge of the glass.
S: Heavily citric with major notes of grapefruit and orange. Tons of green hop character, reminiscent of a fresh marijuana bud dankness. Bits of peppermint, earth, and honey underlie.
T: Straight up red grapefruit juice up front followed by a mid-mouth caramel flavor from the malt base. Resinous, earthy freshly cut flowers/grass on the finish along with a lingering honey sweetness.
M: Extremely creamy and softly carbonated, this one just rolls down off the tongue way too easily. Just the slightest touch of alcohol reminds you that you're drinking an 8% beer, but the fullness and medium- bitterness makes Heady ultra drinkable.
O: Fresh is best. I've had Heady a few times before, but drinking a can on the day I picked it up from the brewery makes a big difference. The hops take center stage; the fresh hop aromas really pop out of the glass, and the grapefruit and earth flavors is potent on the mouth. It's a bit sweeter and greener than I like my IPAs, but the unique hop profile, complemented by a thick and creamy mouthfeel, make this a fantastic beer, one very worthy of the hype it continues to draw. 1,321 charactersavas, Jun 20, 2016

I wouldn't drink this before operating machinery, including the lawn mower. Sometimes I drink it after mowing the lawn but it's not a lawnmower beer. I always drink it after my thirst was quenched or I drink it too fast and it creeps up on me.
It's strong and hoppy with a strong and notable backbone. It is surprisingly sweet. The taste lingers. 451 charactersGeeL, Jun 11, 2016

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into a snifter/tulip/wine hybrid glass from a 16.9oz can
A - A beautiful hazy copper sunset, a barely-off-white frothy head and some sugar legs/lacing
S - The hops, malt and yeast smell as fresh as a cooled boil and as crisp as a just carbed conditioned bottle. The yeast funk is awesome -- just wish I could put my NOSE on it... the sugar is awesome, nice booze, lots of live green earth, citrus (sweet and rind), pineapple, sap, the sweetest of sweet malt/grains, smells like the mountain air with island fruits and flowers. 
T - Huge sweet malt/grain, vibrant pine, pineapple (pineapple tastes so fresh) and citrus, some funky (awesome) dank, bitter citrus rinds, sweet citrus and some slight island/tropics hops/flowers/green earth, clean (young soil), fresh crisp water, bread yeast and may taste better than the wine Jesus made.
M - Full bodied, awesome balance, amazing complexity, perfect carbonation, slightly over the top acidity and a joy from start to finish. 
D/O - There are many things in life that are hyped and even over-hyped, this ale is not one of them -- heck, this ale is not to be reckoned with. Flavor, freshness, balance and refreshment. The can says it perfectly as well, "drink from the can", I can't tell the difference, it is that good. 365 days a year in any climate with guano you'll be stoked this is being paired with it. Legendary. 
Final thoughts - The price I am unsure of as this was a gift, the 8% ABV is spectacular and the only con with this beer, I can't buy it in CA. 1,522 characterswhatthehull, Jun 09, 2016

Taste: upfront a big hit of grapefruit bitterness and a big juicy orange juice flavor middle of the mouth a syrupy sweet breath malt taste comes in and balances the initial bitterness out mellow tropical fruit note fnishes with a Floral hop perfume flavor more orange juice some dankness and a grassy sharp pine needle bitterness.
Feel: thick syrupy chewy big bodied beer.
Overall: I love the body on this beer so full and chewy. This beer is crazy it pretty much has everything you would look for in a dipa. Awesome stuff!
Note: I don't know if it's just me but I poured some in a glass and drank some from the can. There almost two different beers it's crazy! Way more citrusy and hoppy out of the can. Better out of the can! 794 charactersMasonz223, Jun 02, 2016

Beautiful yellow hazy beer with medium foam generation for a DIPA. Smell is of pine, sap, resin and marijuana dank. Taste follows the smell but with a citrus note underlying. Aftertaste has this 'grassy/earthy' flavor at the end with nice super smooth and easy drinking finish. 
Great beer.  Comparing to Tree House IPAs/DIPAs, this has a much different initial taste focus (more of a North-West piney taste than typical TH citrus-tropical fruit) but the hazy look and super easy drinking finish is comparable. 555 characterseifster82, May 25, 2016

4.9/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75The look of this beer is very nice, a slightly hazy yellow wheat in color with a full white head. The smell is amazing, fruity, citrus, lemon peel. The taste is even better. Starting with the fruity and citrus flavor and ending with a little more bitter pine flavor. Definitely not overly bitter for my palate and it hangs on the tongue for the perfect finish. Mouth feel is very close to perfection and extremely smooth. Overall this is one of the greatest IPAs out there. It still holds its own against the newer "juicy" style of IPA. It is a must try for any beer lover. 573 charactersDirtyDawg10, May 24, 2016

4.32/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25So I tested this, julius, haze, and SOS at the same time and these were the results (with all being canned within 7 days of each other)
Heady topper was 2nd from the bottom with most people preferring haze followed by julius and SOS last. 
Heady's taste is very well balanced yet it wasn't very extraordinary in any field. In terms of smell, the other's were greater, in terms of taste it was rather muted compared to the rest. It did excel in the after taste as it didn't last too long nor to short (as in SOS). The smell is in the middle of the bunch, but wasn't of particular note. The smoothness was near the top, but overall for whatever reason I would have preferred any of the other more. 
I think I disagree on the malt to hop balance and I don't taste any of the malt and am left with only hops and the taste of the yeast. 833 characterssakayus, May 21, 2016

For a review I guess I need at least a bit of a look....it has a nice yellow haze with a decent head.   Aroma from the can, however, is truly outstanding.  Fresh hops, perfectly balanced betweeb pine and citrus.    Flavor has a nice bite that leans more towards the bitterness end of a hop flavor profile.  Wish there was just a little more malt, but then it would probably be even higher in alcohol.  Mouthfeel a little cloying....and I mean little. But why complain?  This is a great beer, thoroughly enjoyable, and well worth the hype.  So many great IPAs, so little time. 620 characterslongarm, May 18, 2016

Appearance: Pours a glowing, hazy orange with a big white head. Ringed lacing. Great presentation.
Aroma: Citrusy bouquet with lemon, tangerine, grapefruit. Tons of hops.
Taste: Big, fruity, hoppy IPA. Excellent flavor profile. Tangerine seems to lead.
Mouthfeel: Very drinkable, as people tend to say. Great pairing with the sharp cheddar. 
Overall: Great beer. As DIPAs go, it's one of the best. I like MBC's Dinner just a touch more, but am equally excited whenever I can get a hold of either. 687 charactersillpass78, May 17, 2016

Do t get me wrong, it's a tasty beer and not your typical malt forward East Coast IPA but I was left wanting more. More body, more aroma, more hop flavors, he'll even more bitter hops. It all seemed a little muted to me. I'll definately try it again, maybe mine were older or didn't ship well? 330 charactersd3brewing, May 10, 2016

4.67/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.75Drank straight from the 16oz can (no date) at 48°F. Consumed on 05May16.
SMELL: Very strong aromas of mango, guava, papaya, peach, and apricot entangle with strong grapefruit, orange, and tangerine aromas along with subtle piney hop aromas. There are subtle amounts of white bread aromas that leave this with hardly any malt balance, but it remain extremely desirable. 
5 out of 5
TASTE: The palate is immediately nuked by strong flavors of mango, papaya, guava, peach, and apricot. Strong grapefruit, orange, and tangerine flavors quickly follow as the previous fruit flavors grow much stronger.  Mild piney hop and subtle white bread flavors flow in next to simultaneously amplify the hop profile and introduce a malty presence. Mild bitter hop flavors along with a whisper of alcohol finish off the taste theatrical as all previous flavors push on.
4.75 out of 5
NOTE: This was near perfection in a can. Hands down, the best IPA--whether double, Belgian, English, etc.--that I have ever had. The hop profile provided gargantuan waves of fruit that would satisfy any hop head. There was not a significant malt presence, which was perfectly acceptable with this specific brew. The only aspect that I would change to make this beer perfect, in my opinion, would be to have the bitterness more subtle. Although it was not strong, it still managed to somewhat take away from the wonders of the fruity goodness. 1,409 charactersMyotus, May 06, 2016

I poured this and did not drink from the can.  after I let the floaties settle I notice nice hazy light orange with minimal head retention.  nice fresh nose of orange rind and tangerine.  taste follows nose with up front grapefruit and pineapple with some pine floating around somewhere.  mouth is a little thin but does not retract from the beer. the initial taste is  followed by a surprising increase in flavor that creams your palate and works all the way to the end with dry finish.  this beer is phenominal and has tons of flavor from start to finish.   bright citrisy notes are abundant and my mouth puckers as the beer goes down.   im drinking this after doppleganger from treehouse and dopple gets the nod.  heady may not be what I remember it to be but still a world class beer that is worthy of the hype. 932 characterszshaft, Apr 30, 2016
4.84/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Pours a  very murky pale gold in color with a billowing frothy white head that seems to hang on forever. A significant amount of lacing on the glass. Very pleasing to the eye.
Very pine forward on the aroma. Hints of grapefruit and orange seem to support the resinous pine and while more subtle, still seem to be easily distinguishable.
Holy shit snacks. This is amazing. In fact it's so amazing that in my excitement to pour the last half of the can i spilled a good portion of it all over my damn keyboard and desk! One moment while I lap it up........ OK an amazing balance of pine and citrus with each sip. Just a hint of bread. Truthfully I feel like I can pick out a continuous amount of hop profiles that seem to change from each sip. piney and earthy to tropical and floral. Heady is more complex then I expected.
To me personally this is creamy but finishes dry with a low amount of carbonation.
You should have one of these. Seriously. Like.... A lot of these.  Absolutely spectacular. 999 charactersgutbuster, Apr 29, 2016

Drank out of the can but I poured some into a cup to get a better look at the beer. The beer had this medium tone yellow appearance with great retention. Aromas were great with this slightly cooked pine and orange peel with a citrus balance that was really mouth watering. Taste follows the nose with this sharp hoppy flavor mixed with citrus of mostly orange and grapefruit. Excellent carbonation to this beer, which makes it really drinkable. Overall, a really good DIPA. 534 charactersfitzy84, Apr 24, 2016

Taste is initial minor sweetness, followed by grapefruit and lemon, and finishes extremely resinous.
Mouthful is medium and smooth with average carbonation.  Finish lingers awhile.
Another IPA that falls into the purist category (not a negative).  The citrus and Hops are balanced on the nose but more hop forward on the taste.  Mouthful is spot on.  This isn't one for me and reminds me of La Cumbre but may be for you, give it a shot. 558 charactersSlack, Apr 17, 2016
4.7/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Appearance: pours a hazy golden yellow color with a 1" head that falls to a thick surface covering. Mild lace develops during the session.
Smell: orange, grapefruit, lemon zest, fruit sweetness and some floral notes rise from the glass.
Taste: caramel, orange, grapefruit, lemon zest, pear, and a floral bitterness create a superbly balanced beer. Alcohol is not noticeable at all.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied beer. Crisp from start to finish, with a light dryness late.
Overall: took a while for me to get my hands on this, but it was really good and refreshing. Definitely a great beer. 589 charactersGavage, Apr 17, 2016

4.02/5  rDev -13.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Against the wishes of the brewers, this comes out of the can a very light creamy yellow, but then darkens in the glass to a partially opaque yellow orange. The carbo-pillar in the center is still visible, supporting the large foam head well. Heady Topper retains an unbelievably soft, fluffy thin blanket, with spotty fluid lacing throughout.
Aromas of bright lemon, citrus, and the strongest fresh green pine I've experienced in a beer present themselves up front. This is really the first time both citrus and pine combine in this pleasant of a way for me. I'm surprised to not get any cannabic, sticky dankness, but it's a welcome absence, since that's becoming more and more prominent in the beer scene. The fact that they can hit the notes that are there so powerfully without the dank is well done.
There is more orange and grapefruit in flavor, with a very well balanced bitterness and citrus juiciness, all at once. Heady is refreshing, crisp, and dry with some bite and tang. 986 charactersSabtos, Apr 09, 2016

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Heady Topper is a world class IPA. Although the turbidity isn't as strong as Hill Farmstead or Tree House, Heady is somewhat translucent yellow. I smell some oranges, grapefruit, and lemons. The taste has some medium bitterness up front with a slightly tart, lemony note following. The taste hits early on and falls off rather quickly and cleanly for great drinkability for 8% abv. Overall, fabulous beer. Nevertheless, I think Julius surpasses Heady due to its creaminess. 473 charactersTrevor11, Apr 06, 2016

Looks like yellowish everyday IPA in a glass, with a nice foamy head and great lacing.  It looks like a beer is supposed to look.
Smells great.  Citrus and hops, oranges, peels, Grapefruit.  Smells incredible.
Tastes amazing. Once you take a sip you know it was worth the hype.   Incredibly smooth for a DIPA but just enough bite and citrus to stand out.  
Mouth feel is solid...smooth drinking beer with perfect foamy head. 
Overall it right up there with one of my favorite beers.  Definitely worth searching this out if you can.  Glad I had the chance to drink a few. 655 charactersJay_P22, Mar 31, 2016

It pours cloudy with nice head which doesn't linger very long or leave a ton of lacing.  No hop chunks in this can.  Smell is very good but it didn't fully live up to my very high expectations.  Taste is great and easily one of the best DIPAs I've had with the bitterness only coming in hard in the aftertaste.  Crazy drinkable at 8%.  That said, I'm still not sure it lived up to my expectations since I definitely prefer some much easier to get IPAs. 553 charactersDactrius, Mar 31, 2016

Randomly at the J Wakefield Brewery in Miami by the house just doing a flight of some of their delicious offerings when a Heady Topper emerges from the back room. Apparently a friend of a friend dropped some off to the staff and I was lucky enough to snag a nip. Sharp is the word that comes to mind. If this IPA was a person it would be well dressed in an Armani suit. Clean and crisp, sessionable if you can come across enough of them. 8% feels like 4%. Excellente. 491 charactersFrancisSmooth, Mar 30, 2016

I can comfortably say that it's fantastic, and that it by no means lands anywhere in my personal top beers.  Aroma is an orange grove. Flavor is a forest of zesty hops and fluffy citrus. Surprisingly, to me, drinking it from the can is better than pouring into a glass. A world-class beer that might have amazed me more if I had tasted it a long time ago. 462 charactersRothobinide, Mar 25, 2016

I, honestly, think that I was trying to under rate it to off set my inherent bias, but i kept going back for more and more. It is quite unique and delicious. Here goes:
I'm drinking it out of the can, as instructed, but the last one I had, was out of a glass, so I will judge the visual aspect from memory. It was very cloudy, which I really loke, and I remember it had a pretty decent head. The aroma is a little tricky to get from the can, so although it is very nice, I am docking it a bit. Strong citrus juice notes. Tangerine, orange juice, peaches, mango, mild pepper, and quit a faint malt presence. The flavor is delicious as well. Candy orange, fruit juice. There is a mild lingering bitterness that is so subtle that it doesn't bother. It's just there to let you know that your drinking beer. The mouthfeel is really a knockout with this beer. It is thick and creamy, for an ipa, but it still has plenty of that oiliness that I look for in a hoppy beer. Thus truly is a phenomenal beer. Is it worth the hype? Of course not, it is just beer. However, it is fucking good. 1,150 charactersBenwayPHD, Mar 23, 2016

Look is really good, I like them clean, not into the cloudy/hazy stuff that seems the rage atm.   Smell is what I expect from a hoppy beer.  Good clean hop smell that is, not dank (not that dank is bad).  Taste is pretty spot on too. Nice bite, but not to bitter that lingers on the tongue just long enough for you to want more   Everything about this beer screams hops.  This is, imho, a beer that deserves its standing as world class!! Thanks to my buddy that tossed me one of this after his trade!! 580 charactersSDDLSK, Mar 22, 2016

Taste was bitter up front, then into those subtle fruity tones with a dry finish, but it actually improved as it warmed and became very drinkable and enjoyable towards its end. Unfortunately for heady, there are now far better and more accessible Ipa's around (see Finback, LIC and other half).best beer in the world?no chance.

I poured it into a snifter glass contrary to the suggestion to drink it out of the can, I can't imagine why one would not want to try and smell this beer, isn't that one of the major points of a DIPA?
Nice citrus zest on the nose, floral and some spice. Beer is well balanced, juicy and citrus flavor. Very clean. Improved as the beer increased slightly in temp. 
Enjoyed the beer, but do not believe this is a top beer in the world any longer. 663 charactersSebastRain, Mar 12, 2016

4.99/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: Very light and cloudy. Straw colored murky beer with particles floating around.
Aroma: Citrus fruits, primarily grapefruit and orange juice. Tropical elements are certainly here along with fresh pine / hop scents. Very very enjoyable and pleasing smell to this. Not really any bready malts to speak of.
Taste: It's been a little over a month since my last can so this description will not do the brew justice. I remember it being magical yet very confusing. An extremely delicate, soft and gentle beer on the palate but the amazing flavors still awaken all of the taste buds. The finish is a thing of beauty, the bitterness and tropical hop flavors linger and make your mouth water. The aftertaste is the most striking characteristic of this beer, it's hard to think of a beer that makes your palate beg for the next sip so aggressively. Dangerous beer. Doesn't drink like an 8 percenter.
Mouthfeel: soft, velvety, medium-ish body. Creamy hop juice. 
Overall: This is one the best IPA's I have ever consumed. Hope to have it fresher or even on tap some day. 1,073 charactersluisitoelmatador88, Mar 06, 2016

Out of academic interest I poured a small amount into my glass to find that this liquid is cloudy, glowing gold with a small, white foam head. Otherwise, slammed it straight to my face. Heady as shit, big and resinous, though not too big, or abrasively bitter. Huge pine character, ridiculously well balanced. Full bodied with fine carbonation. Big sticky finish, moderate earth. Just outrageous stuff. 493 charactersleighton, Mar 01, 2016

Poured a gorgeous pale cloudy color with a super fluffy tight bubbled head that lasts forever. Reminds me of a Belgium beer.
Smell is similar to a saison. Spicy hops, light sweet malt, lemon, orange and pineapple.
Taste is big hops at the front of the tongue, semi-sweet malt in the middle and a dry bitter finish. The malts become more prominent and sweeter as it warms. I get a slight pepper taste as the hop bitterness builds after each swallow. Quite unique for the style. Hides the 8% ABV really well.
Very smooth and easy to put down. Everything works well here. 
A very well crafted brew. Tasty and approachable. It is worthy of the hype? Maybe, maybe not. In a world of diverse hop profiles and a ton of awesome DIPAs that are readily available, it certainly fits in with the best of them. Stocked that I got my hands on one. 972 charactersChrisMon02, Feb 27, 2016

A: Cloudy straw with plenty of head. Surprisingly pale.
S: A little dry hopping with mostly light yeast, very similar to a hopped saison. Strange vegetal smell.
T: Very odd flavors coming through. There's an almost peppery vegetable odor that reminds me of something unpleasant but interesting. Very light on the citrusy hops, no real pine to speak of. Light overall with some hop bitterness on the back end. 
M: Easy to drink; crisp with small carbonation and a finish that gets longer as you drink. 
O: A very drinkable but weirdly flavored beer that reminds me more of a hoppy saison than an IPA, let alone a DIPA. Very unique but disappointing considering the hype. Won't need to revisit this one. Better the second time around; the first time was a real let down. 
Thanks for hooking it up, Joe! 850 charactersRockjocknroll, Feb 27, 2016

Look: Cloudy yellow with a thin fluffy white head.
Smell: Juicy red grapefruit, pulpy orange, lemon peel, bitter pineapple and unripe mango, papya, yeast, pine needles.
Taste: Sweet upfront. Honey, biscuit, and clover.  Then a huge punch of grapefruit, orange, lemon, pineapple, papaya, and pine cone his the palate.  Finishes fairly clean, but grapefruit and delicate pine coats the mouth and lingers.
Feel: Medium, filling, just carbonated enough, lingering sticky finish.
Overall: Ecstatic to finally be able to try this!  It's so worth the hype! 669 charactersHorseheadsHopHead, Feb 27, 2016

Since then, I've become hyper-critical (but that often stems from boredom).  The feel of the Heady is my favorite part, a creaminess with bite that just reminds you with every taste that you are taking in something of such high quality that you feel almost blasphemous drinking it out of a can.  I'd prefer the look to be a shade darker (but really, who cares), and the taste has just a touch too much bite on the front end to cry 'perfection'.  But perfection is an endless pursuit, and since Heady is probably the best beer I've ever had, it gets a 5 overall.  I love it and hopefully always will. 695 charactersBostonBeerHunter, Feb 25, 2016

Great taste, very smooth and well balanced for a double.  Not an overpowering hop taste at all.  A very drinkable double IPA, though my personal preference gives the nod to Sip of Sunshine. 409 charactersBeerasaurus, Feb 25, 2016

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5All right, got this as a Christmas present from my nephew and I am oh so grateful.
Poured into my 14 oz. pint glass (!!), the beer had a two finger head of fine bubbles atop a hazy, rich yellow body.  Exactly what I wanted to see for the style.
Aroma was mostly of pine hops, with a little bit of sweet floral character.  Some bready notes were underneath.  Overall, nothing was overpowering and it all worked well together.  I have had hop monsters that make your eyes water from the hoppiness... no way I would have guessed 75 IBU.
Taste was awesome.  There was a nice, powerful bitterness that was very well restrained.  Smooth light malt flavors held the hops in check and kept everything very well balanced.  The alcohol was well hidden.  After several swallows, I was better able to characterize the hops as more toward the pine end of the spectrum with some grassiness.
Mouthfeel was perfect.  Smooth and creamy and deceptively easy drinking.  Not overly carbonated with just the right body to support the hops.
Overall this is the best example of the style I have had to date.  Now I really want to try Pliny the Younger and see how they interpret it.  Although I have been to Russian River, they're across the country and I was not there when Younger was available, just had Pliny the Elder. 1,305 charactersconnecticutpoet, Feb 23, 2016

I will say that it is always hard to live up to the hype. I have had many beers in my 5 years of enjoying craft beer (27 currently) and enjoyed many different styles. I was blessed to get a 4 pack of this beer and can easily say it is a top 3 IPA/Double IPA for me. I never like to say this is the best beer I ever had so that is why I will never say that about this beer but it lived up to the hype. This beer has everything I want in an IPA and it has that mouthfeel that many IPAs don't have. This beer is incredible. If you get the honor, TRY TRY TRY! 625 charactersNhens0016, Feb 22, 2016

4.79/5  rDev +3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pours cloudy and bright radiant gold with huge 3-finger head that eventually settles to 1. Sticky and bubbly lacing remains along the top and sides of the glass. (Yea, didn't drink from the can... but wanted to be able to look at it).
Aroma is a rainbow of tropical and citrus flavors. Tangerine, grapefruit and pear come through as well as grassy marijuana dankness. 
Taste follows the nose, minus the dank, and the drink down is incredibly light and smooth with grapefruit and hops lingering.
The OG NE hazy tropical IPA. This started it all. Conan yeast, etc... including the IPA 4-pack tall-boy canning craze, and it's still a top contender. One of the most balanced and delicious ever. The hype is real and justified. 725 charactersmig100, Feb 17, 2016

I can't get enough of it! Every time I crack one open its like the gates of Heaven are opening for me, while simultaneously my scalp is exploding off the top of my head. Delicious!! Quite difficult to come by, luckily my Grandma lives in Vermont and is able to get a "somewhat" steady supply to me.  Salud!! 432 charactersHopfordBeerham, Feb 12, 2016

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5yum...what a fantastic beer that totally lives up to the hype! The first time I had it in the can at a bar and found the whole experience rather odd. I finally picked up a few more cans at a random line trade and had a chance to sit down and really enjoy what I consider to be one of the best beers in the world. 
This beer looks amazing in a glass so for everyone drinking it out of the can...you are missing out!
The smell is an explosion of grapefruit and tropical fruits combined with just the right amount of dank pine...this beer smells ridiculous. The taste/mouthfeel is as explosive as it gets leaving me wanting more and more...out of control good! There is a reason this beer gets so hyped...because it's f**king amazing! 731 charactersMcGee666, Feb 11, 2016

4.35/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Received a four pack as a surprise from my wife as an early Valentine's Day present so my ratings might be a little eschewed going up as simply put, how could one not enjoy trying this beer when they opened up the fridge and saw a surprise waiting for them (on Super Bowl Sunday no less)?  (I tried both from can and glass so my review is kind of a compare/contrast review of the two methods)
Poured a cloudy orange body with two finger head that slowly died and left lace ring down glass.  I like the aroma better in the glass as beer has a condensed citric, piney hop aroma w/ hint of medicinal quality in can but out in open, as expected, more floral hop notes along with grapefruit and minor malty sweetness come out.  Smooth, fuller bodied beer, I find that it's a little more smooth and easy drinking out of glass than can, however, a little bit more piney and dry out of can in terms of hops.  Out of glass, I still get a piney, earthy, bitter, dry citric hop presence but I find that the hops aren't as strong/tastebud nuking by a slim degree and there is a touch more of grapefruit/tropical fruit and malt bite out of glass over can.
Honestly, I don't think this is the greatest or most unique IPA that I've ever had; however, it is the most consistent and easily enjoyed IPA that I've had, meaning it's not too sweet or hopped up for style nor any funky out-of-character additions, and the best way I can sum up this IPA is that I drank my four pack in one sitting without a problem and wanted more, more and more. 1,524 charactersclayrock81, Feb 10, 2016

I drank it from the can except for a small amount I poured into a Tumbler glass to check out the color and look etc. Straw yellow to gold, 1 finger of head with some lacing. A little carbonated looking. Smell was outstanding. Hops and citrus peel. Extra ripe mango, a little cannabis even. Taste was hoppy, spicy and a little bitter. Citrus and sweet very well balanced. Just outstanding. One of the best beers I have ever had. Mouthfeel was medium and the aftertaste is tart and bitter, in a good way. World class 546 charactersMTLDOG, Feb 10, 2016

4.23/5  rDev -9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Pours deep gold with heavy haze.  Almost reminds me of pineapple juice though a shade darker.  1 finger off white head is sticky and fairly dense.  Leaves heavy lacing behind.  
Heavy grapefruit and pine hop aroma.  Get orange, mango, pepper, and lemon zest, too.  Light biscuit-y malt.  Just tons of hops.  Orange really grows.
Get the orange and grapefruit in particular on the first sip.  A bit of grassy and earthiness.  Pine hops next, strong but still overshadowed by the orange and grapefruit.  Some biscuit-y, doughy malt.  Noticeable, but not enough to balance the hops.
Oily, sticky mouth feel.  Medium carbonation.  Hop bitterness all over the place.  Lingering orange notes.  Despite the overwhelming hops, still has a decent smoothness.
Big, bold, classic DIPA.  Huge hop flavors. 797 charactersleroybrown10, Feb 10, 2016

4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75A 1 pint can canned on 15th December 2015 (I would have drank it earlier but was very sick for a long period of time) and tried from the can at first then poured into a Spiegelau IPA glass.
Appearance: It poured a hazy golden yellow orange colour with a two finger white head that dissipated fairly quickly but left nice sticky lacing.
Aroma: As soon as I opened the can the tropical aromas immediately came pouring out, but there was still a hint of the metal from the can. After pouring it into the glass, the aromas were not as strong but better with a mix of tropical pineapple, mango and citrus mandarin, orange peel and lemon zest. There was also a hint of pine.
Taste: Strong juicy citrus grapefruit and pine with a hint of tropical mango and pineapple. Nice front loaded bitterness which continues into the aftertaste. On the can it says “drink from the can” so I tried that as well. I have to say that taste is just as impressive from the can.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with medium carbonation.
Overall: An excellent DIPA. Must buy and taste fresh if possible. I only wish I wasn’t very sick when I received it… but I know I wouldn’t have been able to enjoy it as much if I drank it a month ago as I wouldn’t be able to taste or smell much. Although it says to drink from the can, which I did try, I still prefer to pour it into a glass to enjoy. It allows you to enjoy its look and gives a clearer aroma. Well worth the hype. 1,451 characterskitch, Feb 06, 2016

Also if I was thinking about the dank, pure, no censorship nature of this beer I'd give it a 5 too. But for fairness sake, it is a murky yellow/gold color with a  nice white head that sticks and leaves decent lacing. If any other beer looked like this id knock it for the look but this one it's just so fitting. 
S - huuuuge juicy orange juice, papaya, mango, overly ripe fruits, grapefruit, dank ganja, the garlic/onion is in there in a good way. It smells like ripe fruit juice. 
T - dankapotomous rex. Ganja and so juicy, orange, mango, papaya, pineapple, melon, overly ripe fruits, grapefruit. Then there's garlic onion that balances it out in a good way. So resinous...
S - medium bodied, so juicy, alcohol completely covered, aftertaste is bitter orange peel, mango, papaya
O - this beer has officially destroyed my ability to drink other ipas. It's beautiful,  like a sunset on a southern California beach, only its from the exact opposite end of the country. Absolutely amazing stuff. 1,062 charactersHopHunter19, Feb 04, 2016

Drops all the usual pine, grapefruit and tangerine descriptors, a malty, earthy vibe underneath it all.  Pretty dank, bitterness not grating, supportive.  A great east coast dipa, easily 1st tier, world class, there is no argument. 523 charactersrodbeermunch, Jan 29, 2016

F- this beer had a bright character and although it technically probably finished really dry, the hop resins were so apparent and numerous, that bit actually seemed to add body to the beer.

Even in doing so, this is an absolute one of a kind brew and the definition of a world class, perfectly balanced, hop explosion. An unreal drink. From aroma to taste to feel, it is truly unique and incredible. I am trying to compare it to pliny (elder) because I drink it so often and it has been my undisputed favorite imperial, but this is just so different that there is no way to compare. Both are as good as it gets and I cant wait to include Heady as a regular brew to mix up my usual pliny evenings. If you havnt had Heady, you need to. 664 charactersskeeterloveshops, Jan 21, 2016

Pours fairly hazy/cloudy golden orange color with a 2 finger fairly dense and fluffy white head with great retention, that reduces to a nice cap that lasts. Nice dense foamy lacing clings around the glass. Aromas of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange rind, light pepper, pine, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Fantastic aromas with awesome complexity and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt notes; with great strength. Taste of big grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, melon, lemon zest, orange rind, light pepper, pine, cracker, bread, herbal, and floral/grassy earthiness. Large amount of pine/citrus rind/spicy bitterness on the finish; with lingering notes of grapefruit, tangerine, pineapple, peach, papaya, mango, melon, lemon/orange rind, pepper, pine, and herbal/floral/grassy earthiness on the finish for a while. Incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; with a great malt/bitterness balance and zero astringent hop flavors after the finish. Moderate dryness from bitterness that increases through the glass. Medium carbonation and medium-full bodied; with a very smooth, sticky/resinous, and fairly creamy/bready balanced mouthfeel that is awesome. Alcohol is very well hidden with minimal warming present after the finish. Overall this is an absolutely amazing DIPA style. All around incredible complexity, robustness, and balance of juicy citrus/tropical/piney hops and light-moderate pale malt flavors; and very smooth and easy to drink for the ABV. A insanely delicious offering. 1,741 characterssuperspak, Jan 16, 2016

Upon first opening the can I was immediately drawn in by the juicy aroma, after tasting I felt a little bit let down as in my mind THIS was THE BEER to try! The typical IPA notes are all there and in fact this was far smoother than most I have tried. In closing it's a great VT beer and definitely in my top 10 but is it the end all of beers? I don't think so. 465 charactersJ5iel, Jan 15, 2016

I prefer the taste of IPAs because of their huge flavor and hoppiness. One thing I'll tell you, you don't get the after taste of typical IPAs. You can drink this 8.0 ABV as a session beer.... You'll be passed out of you drink t as a session beer though. The unpasteurized canning feels like it's more potent than typical IPAs. I love it. Don't miss this one. Take the trip to Vermont. 456 charactersFernTheBush, Jan 14, 2016

4.07/5  rDev -12.5%look: 2.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Massive thanks to Brandonhelvie for hooking me up with this long-time want! Time to pop that cherry now!
Pours a murky golden color. You know how people say Heady is ugly? It is. Heady Topper couldn't find its aesthetic ass with a searchlight. The head is two fingers high and white in shade. Retention isn't fantastic, and the relative softness of the head means little lacing sticks to the glass. 
No real surprises here. The aroma hits me with notes of grapefruit, grass, flowers, and pine. It's a fairly typical nose for a DIPA, actually...instead, where this succeeds in how delicate it smells. It has all those classic hoppy qualities without any harshness. Subtle malt notes of cracker, white bread, and caramel helps tie things together. While it doesn't really bowl me over, the balance and sophistication is top-notch.
It's a little more bitter tasting than I anticipated. Not overtly so by any stretch, however. Pine, grapefruit, and flowers open it up nicely. The hoppiness of this beer is front-loaded, though it never fully vanishes past the mid-taste (thankfully!) It ends slightly malty - think white bread drizzled with a little caramel. After a few sips, I start to notice the Conan yeast. It seems subtly farmhouse-y, and delivers additional flavors of sesame seed, black pepper, lemon peel, and fresh-cut grass. This strikes an excellent blend of complexity and balance, but it doesn't have a facet that screams "WOW!" Who cares? It's perfectly balanced yet assertively flavored, and that's what matters.
This has a soft, full texture, but it finishes dry. In a way, it reminds me of a saison's texture (a GOOD saison, mind you). Actually, the finish is VERY dry, and seemingly clean despite the turbidity. "So drinkable, it's scary" - John Kimmich and co. aren't lying. It's bitter, but in that pleasant way a good DIPA is supposed to be. 
To me, this is the love child of Pliny the Elder and Saison Dupont. It's not the end-all be-all of beer, but it's still ridiculously delicious regardless. Of course, I'm not drinking this from the can, I poured it into a glass like an effete wuss (even worse, it was a fucking teku - pinkies out!) Come to think of it, the fact that no one singular quality fails to blow the mind is its greatest strength. Beer is meant to be drunk, after all, and the best beers get better as more is consumed. Just like this! Yeah, I'll definitely trade for this again in the future.

4.46/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Straight from the can I get lots of hoppy aroma; citrus, grapefruit, some mango, and pine/resin. Taste is grapefruit with lots of slick resiny pine. Finish has a bit of alcohol but not out of line for the style. The slick hops knock down the body a bit but I'd still call it medium, moderate carbonation. 
When poured into a tulip the aroma is very muted with only faint citrus and pine notes. The beer pours a hazy orange in color with a minimal white head, looks a bit like OJ. Flavor is more tropical and juicy from the glass with lots of mango and some pineapple and grapefruit, pine notes linger in the background. Mouthfeel is a bit slick from the hops but retains a medium body and carbonation. 
Overall a great beer, I've had this a few times before but never quite enjoyed it this much. I won't deny that this an excellent beer but I'm not as enamored with it as most here on BA. 890 charactersmnj21655, Jan 06, 2016

4.59/5  rDev -1.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25This is an excellent IPA, and I'm acutely aware of its cult like status among beer aficionados - amplified because it's only available during a harvest moon of a leap year and only in Vermont (I kid...  mostly).  It is not the best I've ever had.  It's missing what I really appreciate from an IPA, which is bright and complex flavors.  It's well balanced, but that makes the fruit notes muted.  It's also loaded with hop resin which makes it rather unattractive (they tell you to drink it from the can).  As much as I love this, I would recommend "Sip of Sunshine," by Lawson's Finest Liquids instead. 602 charactersLumens66, Jan 04, 2016

Got one finger of short-lived head but with lacing. Color was golden orange and murky, due to unfiltered nature. Actually looks much better than some would lead you to assume. Aroma from can was stronger compared to the glass; hops are giving me citrus, grapefruit, and pine notes.  Taste matches to perfection - I would call this a great juicy IPA. Nice, subdued bitterness on finish. Feel is definitely medium; a bit more body than many of the style. Nice carbonation. Overall, this one lives up to the hype. 612 charactersLouZ, Jan 03, 2016

L:  Pours a semi-transparent deep golden color.  2 fingers of creamy white head... gorgeous lacing.
S:  Citrusy... grapefruit and orange zest... pine notes underneath.
T/F:  You get one heck of a one-two punch with this beer.  Sweetness touches the tongue first... with tropical fruits and citrus teasing the palate before the bitter hops come roaring in to remind you that you are drinking an Imperial IPA.  I absolutely loved the hop profile on this one... tropical fruits and just a hint of evergreen.  Oily and resinous and entirely delicious.  Surprisingly smooth for such a big beer... almost delicate.
O:  A thing of beauty, and easy to see why this brew has such a dedicated following.  The only question now remains... how does a Pennsylvanian acquire more? 808 charactersEMV, Jan 02, 2016

I knew there was something exceptional about this slice of heaven because I basically asked for it in code and it was retrieved from the back as if we were back in the 20's in an undisclosed speakeasy. Maybe the rarity of this beer in south Florida warrants this hush hush conduct. Drank straight from the can so unable to see, smelled of hops, citrus perfect hops, tasted like more. I definitely did not get my fill of Heady Topper although some might argue my thirst is never quenched. Overall I loved it and it was perfect for me. Would not change a damn thing. 704 charactersabitter_poor, Dec 28, 2015

Drank it from the can other than a small amount poured to get a look at it. Looks like a floaty filled home brew. Smell was hops, tho they didn't eminate from the can as other have stated. Taste was quite hoppy with a bit of bitterness but it had an overwhelming booziness to it I didn't expect for 8%. Some citrus and tropical fruits present, but not nearly the life altering menagerie of lupulin I expected/hoped for. 
Feel and carbonation were spot on for DIPA. OVERALL A VERY GOOD BEER, but not something I'd kill someone, in front of they own grandma for. Maybe I'm in the minority but... 658 charactersSINKTIPS_N_SUDS, Dec 21, 2015

4.85/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5This was the best hoppy beer I ever tried, UNTIL I tried Tree House's hoppy beers.
Poured half in a glass, drank the rest from the can. 2 week fresh can. Yellow and haze for dayz. Smell is VERY potent, grapefruit/tropical fruits and dank/herbaceous hops. A bit of pine as well. Wow this beer smells potent.
Taste is what the nose offered: citrus/tropical/dank/herbaceous/pine. So complex but so balanced. It got better with every sip as the beer warmed up a bit. The dank/piney notes became more pronounced, and that certainly didn't bother me.
This beer is INSANELY hoppy but not too terribly bitter. Very, very balanced and well made. Alcohol was very well hidden.
Mouthfeel is medium. Middle of the road, nothing to write home about. Honestly if this beer had the mouthfeel that Tree House hoppy beers had, I'd give it the perfect 100 score.

A: Pours a hazy orange color with a nice white bright head that did not last, lots of lacing, not seeing much carbonation, it looks like orange juice with a white head, clearly unfiltered.
A: Lots of citrus, like crushed grapefruit and orange peels, hint of garlic/onion like aroma, hint of resin, definitely getting more citrus aromas than pine, it's a big smell, solid aromas, very nice. I am not getting any alcohol on the nose, very impressive. 
T: It is as if someone took grapefruit and orange peel, crushed them, then blended them into orange juice, grapefruit like bitterness mixed with some orange juice/peel sweetness/bitterness, there is a hint of onion/garlic like flavor in the middle, some citrus forward bitterness, hints of pine and resin, aftertaste of grapefruit peel, amazingly drinkable, amazingly smooth.
M: Big juicy mouthfeel, very smooth on the palate unlike other IIPAs I've tasted that leave a raked feeling on my palate, this doesn't, it's smooth like orange juice, not sure if it being unfiltered adds this layer of smoothness, but it's very nice. 
O: Very impressed, Heady Topper is amazingly drinkable, smooth, not a big bitter beer, has a nice balance of bitterness with lots of citrus notes and flavors, hints of pine and resin, very easy on the palate, a world class beer. I was expecting a big bitter beer but it's not, full of flavor, if you have a chance, pick it up, it's worth it. 1,463 charactersBrolo75, Dec 08, 2015

Yet, here's the difference: Heady Topper will always look this good because Alchemist has gone to great lengths to perfect this beer. Super turbid, excellent head retention and brilliant variations of orange when held to the light. Only poured to extract a true interpretation of the look. This isn't my first dance with Heady. Drink from the can!
S - I want to apologize to my daughter's mother in advance, because I've never smelled anything like this. I used to smell her when I was at work; I could smell her on the pillow weeks after she was gone. This f*cking beer. Where do I even begin? People brag about opening something and smelling it clear across the room. I have gotten hints of that before, yet not on this level. You crack the can and it consumes your area. It doesn't exist in your space; you exist in the confines of it, which is far reaching. The absolute perfect blend of grapefruit and grass character. The best smelling beer of all-time, period.
T - Let's be real, if the nose doesn't hit the tongue equally, the beer isn't shit. This beer caresses the palate like young lovers exploring each other for the first time. The grapefruit character is the first thing that hits your tongue, along with faint hints of grainy cracker. Mid-palate I get the slightest dose of pineapple, with a gentle wisp of orange peel. The entire time it's so fucking balanced that Mary Lou Retton keeps texting me about her gold medals. Relax, girl. They aren't going anywhere! I could literally drink this for the rest of my life.
F - Tongue smacking bitterness, yet mastered. It's not a full on assault; actually, every time I reach for that OMG moment, there's a soft pillow of excellence that caresses my head to remind me how much effort was put into this beer.
There was a time when PtE and HT were compared to each other. Then the new wave IPAs started to appear. This isn't my first encounter with Heady, nor my last. I, for one, am a fan of the modern day interpretation of the IPA and it begins and ends with this one. I haven't had them all, but I've had enough to know what I like and don't like. This is a masterpiece. They will never have to release a 2.0 or modify the recipe slightly. It doesn't stand toe-to-toe; it stands above anything I've ever drank.
Can you hear that sound? It's the f*cking angels singing. Or maybe it's Lauryn Hill. Heady-la-la. That's the way Kimmich sound when he's doing his thing! 2,544 charactersTheIPAHunter, Dec 01, 2015

A: Silver aluminum! Poured a bit into a glass and it was a murky unfiltered glowing orange with a fluffy white head, per usual for vermont ipas. Good retention.
S: Straight hop juice. Massive pineapple, mango, and guava layered with some pine notes. Malt character isn't even registering, smells like you dumped a jamba juice smoothie on a pine tree. Just nuts.
T: Juicy pineapple, orange, and peach upfront. Resiny and bitter pine and grapefruit follows. Maybe a hint of crackery malt in the long, drying finish.
M: Incredibly soft mouthfeel with moderate, airy carbonation. The moderate body and resiny, lingering finish contributes to the juicy feel of the beer and make this insanely drinkable.
O: Just amazing. The hype is justified. Wish I could drink this literally every day. 811 charactersMore_betterness, Nov 30, 2015

Tangerine, pineapple, and herbal oil nose. 4
Toffee, peach, more pineapple than mango, orange rind, lemon zest, and some herbs. 4.5
Tropical fruit smoothie end and forever lemon. 
Medium, a bit of heat, clingy, oily. 4
Feels like you only start tasting it when you swallow - possibly the longest citrus linger I’ve ever had. But as it opens, it shifts gears entirely to tropical fruit - it can be different with every sip. A kaleidoscope that way: there’s kiwi that I picked up, I suspect you could find nearly whatever aspect of hops you looked for. 
At the same time, I was surprised how unfiltered, hot, and not especially delicate-bodied it is: I expected more finesse. I can see how this would certainly be worth exploring over many cans, so I get the fuss, but not a world beater on first encounter.  4.5 877 charactersStJamesGate, Nov 27, 2015

With that in mind, I have poured this into a snifter and as I gaze upon it, I realize why John always wants his drinkers to drink this out of the can. Oh boy, the floaties, oh snap, yes, I get it, John, most of the world gets it who have had it poured. A solid burnt golden color forming a one finger white foamy head that dissipates fairly quickly and leaves some lacing to be desired.
The smell wraps up bitter juicy dry pine slapping around a big bouquet of floral, grassy and citrus hops bleeding into a wonderful nose zapping aroma. With that in mind, I go to taste this and the flavor is spot on in cueing up the previously mentioned flavors to lead the charge into the feel of this beer. Do you think this is good? I know this is good as the slick oily coat just bends my tongue over backwards arranging an unprecedented sharpness succumbing my tongue down.
My last question and I will start with this: I've only lived in Vermont for less than a year, do you think I like this beer? Just check my numbers. 1,196 charactersBack_in_the_Saddle, Nov 15, 2015

4.94/5  rDev +6.2%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer is the best I have had the few times I have been (legally) drinking.  After pouring a can (which I know you're not supposed to do), I believe that IT IS TRULY BETTER FROM THE CAN!  This beer OUT OF CAN appearance is amber in color and slightly cloudy (similar to a micro-brew high ABV cider).  However In the can it's one of the best IPA locally produced.  
Heady topper is heavy in flavor and ABV.  The initial mouth flavor begins as a traditional IPA but QUICKLY overtakes you with a hoppy, citrus taste masking any indication of its relatively high ABV.  This beer is truly a must try at least 2x to understand the flavor, because as most people will find it develops over time. 692 charactersjared-beer, Nov 13, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This beer is truly flawless.  Unfortunately, I now compare every IPA/DIPA to this and none can replace it (although I've yet to try Focal Banger).  I like it better than SOS, Pliny, Julius, Zombie Dust as well as any other beer I've ever had (although SOS is a close second).  I'm not going to get technical on every aspect since there are plenty of those types of reviews.  I will say that this beer smells amazing, has a fruity taste (grapefruity) and goes down smooth.  I almost wish I never tasted this because now I am going obsess over acquiring as much as possible.  Good luck!  Cheers. 593 characterstonytone, Nov 11, 2015

Unfortunately I only had one during a bottle share but i hope to get my hands on more. I first poured a little to try it in a tulip but left some to compare because on the can it literally states in bold "DRINK FROM THE CAN" and it honestly tasted way better from the can. 
The look was a little light compared to most DIPA's I've had, but it still had a nice light orange color to it, it didn't leave much head either. The smell was very citric, oranges with a slight grapefruit scent to it. The taste from the can was super crisp and smooth, it didn't leave kick in the back of your throat like a Maharaja would, which isn't bad either. Overall I'm really hoping to score more of these to give it another go as one can wasn't sufficient. 834 charactersRoddyMedina, Nov 10, 2015

3.78/5  rDev -18.7%look: 2 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 2.75 |  overall: 4Appearance - Nice golden orange color, good lacing, but has the clarity of Yak Wool. 
Smell - Uplifting orange blossoms!! Citrus/earth/sunshine/springtime, tiny bit of caramel. 
Taste - Similar to the smell;  almost overpowering hop profile. Grapefruit,  tropical snorkeling. Pineapple juice gives way to an earthy, minty, BOOZY finish. 
Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied, lightly malted with good carbonation. Ineffable, enigmatic texture that starts off abrasive but has a dry finish and leaves me wanting to sip again, sip again, sip, sip, chug!
Overall - Scored last in a blind taste test with Pliny and a small army of comparable local brews (DuganA, Mercenary, Raja, Maharaja, Drydock IIPA). I was surprised it even lost to Dales Deviant. I would compare it more to Vortex, but I don't think this east coaster holds a candle to any of the west coast IIPA's any better than it did against Colorado's finest. Now that I've enjoyed many cases of Heady, I place it high on the list of tasty IIPA's; perhaps top 50, but certainly not top 20. Definitely better from a glass like any beer. I feel like the brewers recommend drinking from the can because it's unfiltered and looks like a homebrew in the glass, but no self respecting beer nerd can abide drinking from a can! Here in Colorado we have many superior double IPA's. I would call heady an old-school, low-brow IIPA that gets laid based on it's irresistible pheromones but causes some coyote mornings when the lights come on. 1,475 charactersEbla, Nov 07, 2015

4.27/5  rDev -8.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Canning date unknown, but purchased on October 23rd, presumably from the 10/22 delivery day.
Appearance - Poured a few ounces into a glass to give a description of the appearance, but the rest of the review will be from the can as requested to be drank by the brewer. The brew is hazy and kind of a dull golden orange color, like watered down orange juice. Very little head that is quick to dissipate, leaving a mostly barren surface and thin ring around the edge of the glass. Lace consists of a few small spots around the glass, with fair stick.
Smell - Strong citrus and minty/leafy character. Light pine. Very subtle caramel note. 
Taste - Follows the nose. Caramel malt underbody is more noticeable, and play wonderfully off the prominent, but controlled hop profile. Leafy/minty hops nearly outshine the citrus, grapefruit punch, while undertones of pine pop through. There's also a hint of pineapple zing, though it's quick and fading. Finish is leafy and slightly minty with a touch of citrus.
Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Texture is smooth, oily slick and dangerously chuggable with a semi-dry finish. Possibly the best attribute here.
Overall - I can see how this is a popular beer, but it's nearly impossible to live up to the legendary expectations that precede it; an awesome brew with very little distribution makes for a hell of a whale. That's what I've found. If this were more widely distributed I don't think it'd quite have the fanatical following it has, but by that same token it's one of the better DIPA's I've had. My advice: don't go Ahab for it. 1,600 charactersTheSixthRing, Nov 04, 2015

4.6/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5First time pouring it from the can.  A very hazy, bright, golden yellow body with a snowy white head.  The hops make themselves known the moment you crack the can.  Lot of ripe citrus, lemon zest, tropical fruits, papaya, mango, a hint of melon, peach, and pine resin.  There's an excellent underlying sweet maltiness to this beer that I suspect is partially thanks to the conan yeast strain.   The mouth feel is very cream, medium-full, washed down by nice carbonation, followed by a pleasant sweet tropical lemon aftertaste.  On the flavor, sweet lime, grapefruit bitterness, lemon candy, peach, pine sap, some grass, papaya, honey malt, and melon.  
I've been able to score some heady on occasion at some craft beer bars but this is the first time I was able to enjoy a can at home.  It's clear why this brewery has gotten so much hype over the years but I think there are some newer breweries currently closing the gap.  I need to make a trip up to VT eventually because even for this world class DIPA, the $11/can prices around here makes it a one and done purchase for me. 1,079 charactersCzarkazm, Nov 02, 2015

4.3/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Got this one from De Hopduvel in Ghent, BE. The next one I will drink from the can, but this one I had to dissect. No idea how fresh it is.
Golden-orange pour, hazy, with very little head and no retention. It does give way to a very fine and sticky lacing, but is in no way impressive looking - the focus must be on the taste.
The smell is like a typical west-coast IPA, lots of pine, citrus (grapefruit mostly, and some lime) and tropical fruit aromas, some dankness, maybe some green apples, a bit of honey and a slight funkiness.
Moderately complex and balanced taste. Pine notes up front, citrus (grapefruit and lime again), followed by the sweeter notes of pineapple, papaya, mango. Bitter-sweet aftertaste, and a surprisingly light body. On the down side, it does have a strong herbal bitterness in the end, and the alcohol is a bit too present in the aftertaste, but maybe I had an old can, not sure.
Decent beer, definitely one I would try again, but not the best IPA out there. 986 charactersMarius, Oct 25, 2015

Even as someone who lives close to the Heady delivery locations, this is unnecessarily difficult to get a hold of.  Certainly a great beer, but I would recommend any of those dishearted to find this sold out to seek Lawson's Sip of Sunshine.  It's just as good imho but much more available.
L - Cloudy amber body with nice foamy white head.  Great retention and lacing.
S  - Nice hoppy citrus
T - Strong bitter hop, floral, pine, citrus, and peppery.  Malts are earthy and smokey in the background.  Aftertaste leaves you with fresh bitter hop.
F - Medium body with moderate fine carbonation.  Resinous and sticky.
O - Yep, a fantastic IPA.  The hype may be over the top, but it is an exceptional beer and I'd drink it frequently if I could.  Certainly worth the effort for a taste. 862 charactersJAFoley, Oct 23, 2015

I think Alchemist are doing it the way it should be done.  Make an excellent product, sell it locally and don't expand.  
It wasn't the best beer I've ever had.  It was an excellent scent-laden IPA.  It has wonderful art and a great drink.  I doubt I'm the only person to pound this beer in the parking lot of a random Vermont corner store.  It got me very drunk, and exceptionally jolly.  I bought it and had to determine if I needed to buy more to ship home.   (There were several cases available fresh from the delivery).
After the first sip, I knew that I just wanted to drink these 4 beers on vacation and not stress it.  Fighting the collector impulse is hard sometimes, but this is a better experience than a notch-on-the-belt beer.  I drank one heady topper in the parking lot, one while watching Bernie kick everyone's ass in the debate (Vermont pride), and one while meandering around a foliage view.    I left the fourth beer unfinished.  
I'm glad that Heady Topper is in the world.  I'm glad I got to try it.  I think it is worth consuming this beer with love and respect.   Thanks Alchemist. 1,225 characterskingmaxwell, Oct 20, 2015

It tasted like a hop milkshake. So creamy and delicious, each sip built upon the previous with loads of grassy, piney, and tropical flavor bursts balanced perfectly with an amazing yeast/malt backbone. Poured half into my Spiegelau IPA glass and drank the other half from the can. This beer is heavenly. It is the most well balanced beer I've ever had. Well done Alchemist! 487 charactersflskydiver, Oct 18, 2015

Otherwise - truly an experience of a beer. 303 charactersthorkelson, Oct 16, 2015

If you go to Vermont, you need to check out a local store and find out when their deliveries are. I was fortunate enough to score a case at a great spot on Route 7. Smooth, beautifully hopped, lightly malted, magnificently balanced, slightly sweet. Do drink it in the can. I resisted and tried a little bit in a glass first. It is better in the can. the Alchemist has mastered the ability to put a World Class Beer in a can. I'm enjoying one a night until they are gone and I look forward to another trip to Vermont. I will share with only my BEST friends. 633 charactersallhoppedup2, Oct 15, 2015

4.99/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I consider myself a relative newcomer to the world of craft beer, having gotten into it rather late in life. However, I consider myself a quick learner. I have been rating and reviewing beers on BA for a little more than a year now. I feel that day by day I'm acquiring more beer tasting experience and that my reviews are getting better. As a result of an increasingly discerning and sophisticated palate, I find that my reviews while mostly positive, are becoming less effusive in praise. This past spring, my father, after a trip from San Francisco, brought me at my request a few bottles of Pliny the Elder. Long story short, I thought it was quite possibly the tastiest and most perfectly balanced IPA I had ever had. I had no choice but to give it a perfect 5.
 Fast forward to Columbus day weekend of 2015. My wife and I drove up from NYC for a weekend getaway at a bed and breakfast we like in Lake Luzerne NY. On a whim, from there we decided to drive up to Vermont for a day. We got to Burlington and I immediately went in search of the famous and elusive Heady Topper. After asking around, I found out that it sold out at the liquor stores, but was available at several bars and restaurants on Church Street. We went to have dinner at the Scuffer, which is where I finally laid my lips on this white whale. The verdict:
Absolutely fucking delicious!!!! The aroma is dank, piny, resiny and overpowering with hops, yet, there is also a strong biscuity and crockery malt. The taste: total hop bomb yet such a strong sweet malt presence. Truly a perfect balance. What a tasty, flavorful and delicious brew. So easily drinkable. If I wasn't driving, I would have had about 5 of them. 
 As for my final score, Ive debated whether or not to give it a perfect 5. I believe that this brew is as good or even better than Pliny the elder. However, as was strongly suggested by the can and my server, I decided to heed their advice of keeping it in the can. However, my wife wanted a taste but refused to drink it from the can. (I know...she's weird about this, but hey, we all have our little quirks) Anyway, I poured her a little bit in a glass and could tell that it was an attractive hazy looking brew .I also took a sip from the glass and could tell how the taste opened up. I could also see how in the can, the tastes of the hops felt more compact and intense, which I might like better. So there you have it. This beer is like a perfect 5, except for the fact that since most of it was invisible to me inside of the can, I was not able to properly evaluate it on the look. 2,578 charactersGajo74, Oct 13, 2015

I did a blind tasting with heady, pliny the elder and sip of sunshine and heady and pliny were the top performers. All very strong beers....I have then done straight out of the can and as weird as it sounds it does add something. Are pliny or heady worth the effort.....if you love hops, and you want the experience....100% yes. If you love beer I think experiencing beers from those who love what you do is key....and The Alchemist love beer and what they do. 552 charactersBiggiekrock627, Oct 13, 2015

Poured a light orange with a nice white head, hazy as hell. The nose was a wonderful combination of citrus, orange, piney, resinous hops, grapefruit, dank and delicious. A nice malty backbone supported the massive hop bloom. The taste followed the nose and was delicious. Grapefruit, orange, lemony, piney and resinous, dank and delicious. So glad I got to try this beer. 537 charactersClavisAurea, Oct 12, 2015

4.15/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Description: Golden slightly cloudy color with a white head and lacing.  Aroma was a strong floral smell with some citrus, especially orange.  Taste was similar with floral and citrus up front.  There is some nice hoppy bitterness on the finish but it's not a hopbomb and is very well balanced.  I thought I detected some earthy/umami flavors as well but they were pretty masked.  The alcohol is present but like the bitterness is not overwhelming.  Carbonation is light to medium.
Suggested food pairing: Bacon wrapped bacon

Ideal time to drink this beer: You're on a business trip to Vermont and feel that you should do something "Vermonty" while there.  Maple syrup is a popular option, but that seems so lame and cliched.  You ask your hotel concierge for a recommendation and he directs you to a local pub where Heady Topper, one of the world's most highly-regarded beers, is available.  You pop in for a draft and enjoy the beer, but more importantly you've now earned the right to casually drop a line at dinner parties about how you had a fancy-shmancy beer while in Vermont and can wax about all of its finer points.  Chances are the listeners won't have had Heady, so you can say pretty much whatever you want.
Overall: 4.25 (This beer is good and I would likely drink it again) This a good beer, but only a "good" one.  If I didn't know Heady's reputation I would never guess that it was considered a top-10 beer in the world.  I really wanted this to be a fantastic beer that would blow me away, but I just couldn't get there.  I'd put Sip Of Sunshine ahead of this by a wide margin.  Maybe the can I had was a little off or less than fresh; I'd like to try some more just to see if that was the case.  But for now, I can only judge the one I had and it didn't live up to the hype. 1,857 charactersSHDoyle, Oct 11, 2015

Heady had a very nice to it, the smell was not something I picked up well from the can, the taste seemed to be a little citrus with a very small bitter note from the can but was quite drinkable. Once it was in the glass it lost the very mild bitter taste I picked up and became a dipa I could crush! 433 charactersmich34, Oct 10, 2015

Aroma of tropical fruit, pine, slight floral and herbal, pineapple, mango and melon with tropical fruit esters (pear/peach)from the yeast. Flavor matches the aroma and add a very slight malty sweetness that is just enough to play off of the perfect amount of bitterness in this beer. A touch of wheat also. Mouthfeel is light but with a slightly creamy fruit juice feel to it... Overall awesome DIPA. 461 charactersStolenface1, Oct 08, 2015

The taste was not like anything I had tasted before, I assume people like the taste and this beer but it was a drain pour for me.  Thankfully I had a friend that wanted and could not find it to buy and was very happy to get the remainder as a gift.  I appreciate all different types of beer but I could not drink this.

S-Citrus is plain as the nose on my face. That would make it very plain for those not familiar.
T-There is the citrus you would expect. There is no bitterness what so ever which I find amazing.  It's not complex or groundbreaking (anymore), it's simply incredibly well done.
F- A pretty good level of carb. Certainly not full or silky. What you would expect from an DIPA.
O-I now know why people wait in line for this beer. It isn't anything groundbreaking anymore. It's too old for that. It is simply an exhibition of doing something as close to perfection as possible.  The can states "So drinkable it's scary", and I think that's about the perfect summation. 777 charactersNotAlcoholicJustAHobby, Oct 04, 2015

It overwhelmed my senses. 
I knew it wasn't the best beer I ever had, but I bowed to the fine craftsmanship it took to produce this masterpiece. The hops melted through my body. It tasted potent and I couldn't wait to purchase some, which I did the next day, by driving to Waterbury. 
Others have described this beer better than I ever could. But suffice to say, it was worth the drive.

4.49/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Tough to really add much that hasn't been said many times already below, but here goes.  Poured out just a tiny bit to see what it looks like but otherwise almost every time I have drank it from the can as they emphasize.  Delicious and great double IPA, with citrusy, piney hop taste.  However, what many reviews fail to mention is that in my experience, Heady produces multiple waves of flavor that continue even after you have swallowed the beer.  I guess the can says something about "wave after wave of hoppy goodness" and in my experience this isn't just marketing hype.  That really is how it tastes, and the multiple waves of flavor is not something I have experienced with almost any other beer.  Very interesting and my favorite part about this beer.  Overall it's fantastic and definitely worth seeking out.  However, it is NOT worth the degree of crazed hype associated with it.  I can think of a dozen hoppy beers I have had this year that I'd rather have over Heady.  In fact, it's not even the best DIPA made by the brewery (Focal Banger is outstanding).  That doesn't mean I don't say yes any time very fresh Heady is offered to me as part of a trade...you should definitely try it at least once. 1,212 charactersNYC-IPAnAPA, Oct 01, 2015

Just keep doing it. 522 charactersjaytothen, Sep 26, 2015

The small bit I poured had a straw yellow body with a touch of hazy.   A bit more head would have been nice.   The nose is best in class - straight citrus hop pine resin goodness.  Perfect.  The flavors match the nose with peppery grapefruit, grass, and hop resins with a perfectly planned background sweetness to manage some of the bitterness.   Mouth feel is fresh, super peppery, and well carbonated.   It meets the hype. 534 charactersBudlum, Sep 25, 2015

Smell - pure IPA greatness! The smell is amazing even from can, basically is saying drink me.
Taste - this might be the best IPA on the planet, will need to do a side by side vs. Pliny.
Feel - almost gives you a chewy feeling, it's amazing.  Let it sit and then it made me want it more.
Overall -  It's not a perfect IPA but pretty close and might be the best.  Can't wait to have the next few. A++ 515 charactersSeanMNCraftBeerLover, Sep 22, 2015

Take a sip and perfectly soft, medium mouthfeel bring wave after wave of tropical fruit, citrus, and pine along with a touch of dank grassiness and a nice, gentle malt sweetness. It's so balanced. So intense, yet so delicate. The bitterness is there in amount enough to just perfectly support everything else that's going on. It lives up to the hype.

Pours a very hazy bright orange body, looks similar to orange juice. Head was pearl white and an inch. Head retention and lacing were extremely good. 
Smell is big on citrus and resinous pine. Guava, pineapple, and mandarin orange dominate the nose. Not much malt and no alcohol is detected. 
Taste is of peppery, bitter, tree sap, mixed with acidic pineapple and grapefruit. Lime rind and juniper berries are also in there, bitterness increases as beer warms. Malt and alcohol are pretty light.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated. Head stayed throughout duration of consumption, added a nice froth to the beer. 
Overall this was a very good Ipa. One of the most visually pleasing beers I've seen, very unique. The hype surrounding this beer is very high and to a certain degree I think its a detractor to the overall score. Would love this beer more if it wasn't such a pain to get, don't think it falls into the category of all time best when it comes to its style. 1,066 charactersangelmonster, Sep 17, 2015

Look - Poured a little out in a glass to get a look at this bad boy (don't worry, drank the rest from the can). Pours a beautiful hazy golden orange color. 
Smell - As soon as you crack the can open the aroma jumps out at you. Tons of grapefruit, orange and pine on the nose. Just a wonderful fresh hop smelling beer
Taste - HOP HEAVEN! Huge amounts of grapefruit, citrus, orange and pine overtake the taste buds. A slight bitterness throughout but nowhere near as aggressive as I thought it was going to be. Drank every last drop out of that can and was legitimately sad when it was gone.   
Feel - Awesome chewy/creamy'ish mouthfeel with a super dry finish that pretty much forces you to take another drink.....which is a good thing because it's so damn good! 
Overall - This was my first Heady experience and let me tell you, my mind is blown. Understandable why this is one of the top beers in the world! I will seek this out every chance I get. 960 charactersTonyjenlasc, Sep 16, 2015

Taste: Is more subdued compared to the aroma. Again citrus and white wine grape sourness.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied to lighter body, right there in the middle. Less carbonation than I expected, nice nice balance of palate coating hops.
Overall: World class, but not all its hyped up to be. There are definitely better DIPA's out there, but I would never complain if given a HEady, I just wouldn't drive all that way for it. I gonna say like a 97. 670 charactersMatthewHopHead, Sep 14, 2015

Super dank, citrusy hops assault the nose.
Upfront taste is just a cacophony of hoppy goodness. 
The hops over power all other aspects of the beer, but the combination and amounts of hops is just spectacularly made. Love this beer. 248 charactersRJIV, Sep 14, 2015
4.31/5  rDev -7.3%look: 1 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Smells of pineapple, mild pine and mango rind. Tastes very similar to the aroma. Piney, bitter, resiny, no malt sweetness. Mouth feel was crisp, clean, light and smooth. Good stuff! Very dank. Bitter and resiny finish. I'm not going to say that this is the best DIPA in the market, as some would say, but it is very good. I'm glad to have tried it. Definitely buy it if you find it but don't go crazy looking for it or pay more than $10 for a can. CHEERS! 
P.S. The reason I rated it 1 for look was because I couldn't see through the can in order to judge the color, head, carbonation etc. My x-ray powers were off today for some reason. 637 charactersRexBanner, Sep 14, 2015

God damn this stuff is good. pretty much lives up to the hype in my opinion, one of the best beers ive had. very easy drinking and refreshing, especially for a double. ridiculously dank smell and taste, love it! 604 charactersHyptochrons, Sep 11, 2015

L- Golden-orange and hazy. Thick white creamy head that is very well-retained.
S- Resinous and citrusy American hop aroma dominates. Some fruity esters (peach, stone fruit) present as well. Malt is subdued - slightly biscuit-like.
T- A crisp, juicy flavor that balances hop and yeast character very well. Not excessively bitter, but hop bitterness is present (especially in the finish).
F- Fairly dry throughout with a harsh dry, bitter finish.
O- I wish I could try this beer fresh from the brewery. A very good IPA that is slightly hindered by a harsh finish. 665 charactersaobrehm, Sep 11, 2015

It smelled light, and refreshing, with the slightest amount of citrus, to intrigue. The taste was far more full than I had anticipated, with what seemed like many hop varieties joining together to make for a wonderful experience. The best part for me was the mouthfeel, as I think it had almost a nitro smoothness, as it was creamy and heavy. Overall, I wish I had more than three cans..! 436 charactersLucasballek, Sep 08, 2015

He said it was the best double IPA he had ever had. I was intrigued. The admonition to drink it from the can is one that should be heeded for the best experience of the brew, To pour it into a glass would be a discredit. For one thing, the beer is unfiltered. By pouring it onto a glass, you would see all the detritus from the hops and yeast floating around. if poured from the can into a glass, you also lose the best way to experience all the aromatic hops. Do yourself a solid, and drink it from the can. 
It took a few sips to adjust to how wonderful this beer is. Notes of grapefruit, sticky pine, dank earthy tones on the nose and palate.
 This is not a beer for those who prefer CCC&DB (Cheap, Cold, Clear and Domestic"Beer"). The mouthfeel is smooth, dry and lingering.  After my first can, i wanted more. Then, the alcohol hit me like a 2x4 to the back of the head. It's a brew i crave often, but reserve for special occasions. 1,016 charactersNHTruBruDude, Sep 06, 2015

It is the most drinkable IPA I've ever tasted, very smooth, and as the can says it leaves you with "wave after wave of hoppy goodness!" Not to mention at 8% ABV one or two of these bad boys will leave feeling nice and hopped up.

Canned less than 10 days ago, reviewed 8/31/2015
A = Hazy bright orange color, 1 finger of off white head, visible hop sediment in suspension
S = Oh my god... I can smell this from 3 feet away.  Popping the tab on the can immediately filled the air with the aroma of sweet fruit juice.  Resinous, orangey, piney hops, so juicy and sweet, lots of tropical fruit notes such as mango, papaya, pineapple, maybe some tangerine.  This is heavenly.
T = If you had told me this was fruit juice, I would have believed you.  Orange, pine, more tropical fruit, coating your tongue in waves of oily, resinous hoppiness.  Bitterness is restrained, letting the flavor and aroma of the hops shine through.  Malts take a backseat in this beer for sure.  Estery alcohols shine through at the end.
M = Slick and wet, super juicy, soft medium mouthfeel.  Very drinkable.
O = The hype is real, folks.  This beer deserves it's cult status, and I am so happy I was sent not one, but two of these.  Worth seeking out and trading for! 1,113 charactersDas_Reh, Aug 31, 2015

The flavor is more pine to me and I think the label is spot on here with...."dense hoppy finish in your mouth.  I think that dense and oily mouth feel is the best I've ever had! One of the smoothest and easy drinking IPAs I've had.  I'm drinking this side by side with Todd the Axeman and I'm not ashamed to say I prefer the aroma and taste of Todd but the feel of Heady a bit more. I wouldn't turn down either tho. 501 charactersRoland7792, Aug 27, 2015

3.91/5  rDev -15.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.25 |  overall: 3.75Appearance:  pours a pale straw yellow color, which is interesting because my friend, another drink it from the can rule breaker said his poured almost orange.  A very fine bubbled head that dissipates quickly to a thin line where beer meets glass.  
Aroma:  whoa.  A fruity smell.  Almost like apricot nectar or pineapple juice followed with spruce.
Taste:  there's that fruitiness again.  Maybe a bit tart compared to the nose.  A "fresh" flavor. Bitter but not gratuitously so.  Not much discernable yeast or malt notes.  This is ipa all the way.  Hops are the star.
Feel:  a thin, somewhat slick, almost oily feel on the pallet.  Possibly explains the anemic head. Not off putting, but not rich at all.  Again, ipa, period.  No nod to head retention or mouth feel necessary.  Thats not what this beer is.
Overall:  nice balance between that trendy bitterness and some really pleasing, unusual hop flavors.  I love the unique flavors and nose this beer shows.  Would have preferred a richer experience, but I get it.  It's disappointing actually.  Such interesting flavors but so little attention to the overall experience.  Just guessing these brewers could do even better if they weren't pandering to one dimensional hopheads. 1,235 charactersBNLTandem, Aug 22, 2015

A: it's in a can dammit what do you think
S: good intense aroma of hoppy bitterness, a tad tart but only ever so slightly 
T: quite bitter, if i'm being honest I find the level of bitterness unpleasant in this beer, I suppose a bit piney and earthy, most of the DIPA's that I have had don't truly impress me with the amount of bitterness they claim to have, hint of melon, decent malt presence here but not overpowering, the bitterness is the strongest element present, sweet on the finish after the beer settles out a bit, at this point the hops help the beer remain crisp though the bitterness has dissipated, malt will come through more the more that it sits
M: silky, dry and clean
O: not bad but I really don't see what all of the fuss is about. This is a good DIPA but there are many that are better. Snake Handler from Good People comes to mind immediately. It is quite refreshing though, and of all of the beers that claim to be hoppy and bitter, this is one of the few I've had that actually lives up to the claims it makes in that regard. The flavor evolves (improves if you ask me) gradually as the beer settles, leaving less pine and more citrus notes. Not bad but tremendously over rated (I should note that if you are a hop head you will very much enjoy this beer), I'm sorry but I'll say it again, just not great 1,405 charactersJackRWatkins, Aug 21, 2015

With the latency of lightning came a surprise the likes of which I had never before experienced and have yet to duplicate since.  Like the picture on the can, simply mind blowing.  For a hop loving homo sapient such as myself, there is no beer I would rather have in hand, no commercial graphic that signals ultimate gustatory pleasure is imminent.  Across look, smell, taste, and feel, as Billy Crystal might say, "Simply mahvelous, darling."  I'd give it a 6, if I could. 631 charactersjcarlham, Aug 21, 2015

4.84/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured into a glass:
This beer changes greatly when poured from the can into a glass.  
In the glass, the beer has a slightly subdued citrus nose that's hard to place.  Pineapple, some say.  Grass, others say.  Orange rind and crushed orange fruit is what I say. 
On the palate it is a heavier beer than other DIPAs... an indication of its quality yeast, IMHO.  It has the backbone bitterness needed to balance the malt.  Finishes a bit dry and without the fatigueing bite of many DIPAs.  You can have two cans of this stuff pretty quickly.
From the can:
From the can the aroma is much fruitier, more orange fruit than orange peel.  I was more likely to take constant sips when drinking from the can.
When I score more Heady Topper, it's going from the can to my tongue.
Good stuff, not life-changing, but very well made. 828 charactersmttaylor, Aug 19, 2015

It is a very nice can, but I pour just a small amount of it into a glass to see the hazy straw, pale lemon yellow body with very little head to speak of. But since the beer's appearance is not supposed to be a part of the experience,  I won't grade harshly on that. 
As soon as I pop the tab of the tall boy, I immediately get hit with loads of fresh and juicy hops. Smells of sticky pine, orange, pineapple. 
The taste is magnificent. A perfect balance of the quintessential hop flavors. Pine needles, fresh pineapple, orange, grapefruit. The flavors only develop as the beer warms. The mouthfeel is great,  it has a pretty full body for any type of IPA, maybe the resin contributes to this. Overall, it's probably the best beer I've ever had. Certainly meets the hype and was worth waiting for. 873 charactersJordonHoltzman, Aug 19, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Happiness lives up to the hype! Rose early for a rural, winding trek to a small grocer on The Alchemist's delivery route during my first trip to the Green Mountain State. Scored a case (cans only) which makes the trip worth all the effort! Pours a rich, moderately cloudy golden orange, like fresh nectar, with a medium head and tight lacing. Notes of mango and citrus reach out and smack the nose hairs immediately. Taste is powerfully citrus, cream and pine with a semi-sweetish flowery, tropical tenor; hoppiness finishes fast with no lingering bitterness. Careful - it begs to be gulped, but this should be savored. Bring your stopwatch. I have a case though, so perhaps a grandfather clock ;) 697 charactersBill69, Aug 19, 2015

Cloudy but the brewery advises you to drink from the can so you don't have the sediment in the glass.  If you drink from the can you miss all the citrus at the nose.  This is a perfectly balanced DIPA that is crisp, drinkable and balanced in hops and bitterness. 355 charactersAlequine, Aug 16, 2015

A - Pours an opaque golden orange color.
S - The nose is all citrus.
T - Flavor is tropical fruits with some bitterness at the finish.
M - Medium carbonation.
O - This is my favorite DIPA.  Flavor is outstanding.  So fresh, crisp and drinkable.  It's just perfect.  Wish I lived closer to VT so I could get it more often. 424 charactersspacecake9, Aug 16, 2015

Drank chilled in the can (as instructed...!?), so there are no comments on the pour, the color, the clarity, the head. or lacing.      
Sniffing at the can top (like some kind of rummy), the aroma is very citrusy and pungent...good start.. 
Taste doesn't disappoint.  Well....it wouldn't if not for all the hype.  "The best IPA in the world" ?!  Who's smoking the crack?  
I've had several west coast IPAs and DIPs that are at least as good as -- some better -- than this.  It is nice to have a high-quality beer brewed in the untouched purity of Vermont...I get it...but let's not lose our minds. 
A very good beer.  I liked it, and I'd buy more.  But I probably won't drive a full day specifically to buy it....again. 840 charactersbilbobrewer, Aug 14, 2015

S - First few smells are straight pine, the next few had more peach and orange with less pine.
T - Wonderfully bitter, juicy, fresh tasting, zero off flavors. Orange, apple, citrus zest and huge pine that builds. Sweet when it needs to be and bitter overall.
F - Extremely smooth and well balanced. You can tell there is a nice carbonation and you can feel the oils layer the tongue. 
O - I've had about 10 cans to really narrow my thoughts down. This is absolutely a perfect beer. The heaviness from the hopping gives way to amazing juicy flavors and then those fade away leaving you with a coating of amazing hop flavors to remember your last sip by. 754 charactersJaredSammy, Aug 12, 2015

4.5/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Rating is based on drinking from the can (with the look rating from an earlier can I poured into a glass).  Smell is heavily floral, citrus, pine, onion, and just a hint of malt sweetness.  Taste is tropical fruit mixed with pine, floral almost lavender-like taste, and a clean hop bitterness.  Some double IPAs leave an increasingly bitter aftertaste with each sip, but Heady feels fresh every sip.  Taste is extremely balanced, making the beer exceptionally drinkable.  Mouthfeel is interesting, with an almost creamy feel.  One of the only beers I've ever had that completely lives up to the hype.  Wish I had regular access to it! 634 charactersOmahaKF, Aug 11, 2015

After all, this is the legendary Heady.  I didn't go gaga over it at first sip so I began to wonder if there was something wrong with my palate.  Maybe I was missing something.  Or maybe it is all just hype.  I've decided it's probably a combination of the two.  It's not my favorite style of beer, but it is admittedly one of the most interesting examples of the DIPA style I've had.
Lots of fruity, floral, chewy resinous hops in the nose and taste.  It sticks in your mouth and makes your lips smack.  It's a potpourri of every flavor that a hop knows how to impart - apart and simultaneously.  Sweet at some points, bitter at others, and not always at the same time.  This beer is like a Mozart symphony - full, busy, in perfect harmony and yet sometimes bewildering.  It's a complicated beer, and yet, I just can't bring myself to fall in love with it.  Oh well, more for everyone else.  Worth getting a 4-pack and trying if you can, and sure, go nuts, get to the store early, hang out with some groovy hopheads like I did, and score a case to gift you friends - everyone wants some, believe me!  Only downside is that it says to drink from the can, so I have no idea what it looks like... 1,305 charactersjmasher85, Aug 09, 2015

Pliny blew me away but heady just delivered. But by no means am I disappointed. Cannot wait to get more of this.
The thing falling short for me is smell and feel. Taste and look are perfection.
Smell is not much different from other brews and feel was rather carbonated. Sorta foamed up on the tongue where I was hopping for a clean finish. 
Overall an amazing beer and wish it was offered here so that I could drink this gold year round.

No date, but the smell and flavor seems right on, so....here's the rest.
Yeah, I poured a little bit out into a mini snifter, I had to, I wanted to see it, so sue me.
The appearance was a hazy pale orange color with a thin whimsical white foamy head. Lacing is few and far between, but I see the floaties, hmmmm....unfiltered, right? Okay, I get it, I think.
The smell started off with pure lovely grapefruit rind. Light grassy to citrusy tones amplify a really nice smooth aroma (I'm guessing because this is unfiltered, right?)
The taste rides a pure eloquent bittersweet bliss of the grapefruit. It runs the gamut on my taste buds. A slight bitter citrus rind aftertaste rides into the finish really awesome.
The mouthfeel starts with a sweet crisp refreshing feel sliding into the bittersweet grapefruit rind-like substance pummeling my tongue really nicely. Carbonation is right on par.
Overall, holy shit, this stuff is spectacular. So glad a buddy sent this to me! 996 charactersSitkaSteve, Aug 03, 2015

Unless some were given a random can not kept cold for the trip to whatever state they came across one in. Nonetheless this beer is truly amazing. And all the beers I've been lucky enough to have in say the top 20 on this board, it really is like splitting hairs of subjectivity. This is a big beer that can really showcase a dipa to people who think they don't like them. Extremely drinkable. Clean. Fresh. Personally I enjoy it better out of can as directed. But have had multiple times and poured in a glass as well to get a look and release a wonderful bouqet.  Many master reviewers here have already described it so well in great detail. All I can say is "agreed!"  I suspect the ones that demerit it have some sort of ulterior motive in trying to unseat the multi-year King.  Oh well. Doesn't change the experience. And I'm sure the alchemist crew could care less what the rating is. They know they are doing a truly wonderful job.  It is a bit of a circus obtaining at times, but hey, adds to the thrill of the chase.   Ps. Focal banger is every bit as good. 1,187 characterscr-egg, Aug 02, 2015
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Let's start off by saying that I am not an IPA fan or a Double IPA fan. This beer however, changed my view of this particular style of beer. The first thing you notice is the fresh citrusy smell of the hops followed by the smell of pine. The beer starts off with a very hop forward taste and finishes with the customary hoppy IPA finish. I must say that this beer is unbelievably drinkable and is overall pleasing to the palate. A pleasant surprise since beers with this high of an IBU tend to be overly bitter and very hard to drink. Finally a beer worthy of its ranking. 572 charactersJNPIII127, Aug 02, 2015

The smooth strong first sip to the last sip is just awesome with the hop scale of the charts this beer has a bit of apricot or lemon taste near the end but damn good the  feel of the beer is heavy on the mouth but has a odd clean taste that makes me want to come back look of the beer is on the lighter side but noticed some cans are darker then others but normally on the light almost amber side smell of it is fresh with hints of lemon all around A+ beer if you have the chance I higly recommend this one 559 charactersVermontcraftbrewfan, Aug 01, 2015

4.46/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a glass! Screw following the can, I need to see the beer.
Look: Light hazy mellow yellow, frothy white head and a small amount of lacing. (To style, the look is off.)
Smell: Juicy and full of lemon and citrus rind as well as some sweet sugary malt smells.
Taste: Delicious! This floral and full of hop juiciness. Very light malt sweetness and no apparent alcohol. This is where the beer shines. Unfortunately it doesnt actually fit the style its suppose to be and I'll argue anyone who says this should be called a DIPA. hence why its getting points docked in overall and not taste, because its still delicious.
Feel is extremely light bodied and finishes with naught but a light lemon peel bitterness. 
Overall: This is hardly a double IPA but it IS a delicious hoppy ale. 790 charactersBeerBrose, Jul 31, 2015

4.51/5  rDev -3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 4.25Purchased in Montpelier, VT on July 20, 2015 (the same day that it came off the delivery truck) and consumed with notes taken the following day.  In other words, this baby was fresh.
This rating comprises notes from two cans - one poured into a tulip and the second consumed directly from the can.
Appearance is a hazy light orange color with plenty of floaties.  The nose has dank notes but the real feature is the overwhelming grapefruit that comes through (especially when kept in the can).  The flavor is dominated by wave after wave of hoppy goodness.  The body is a bit thinner than I expected but seems to complement this beer as is.
The array of hop flavors seems to grow more potent as this offering warms.
All-in-all, a fabulous drinking experience but not quite the greatest beer every brewed.  In parting I will echo the suggestion of the brewer: "Drink from the can!"
Update (Sept 2015): Saw a video made by brewmaster John Kimmich in which he stated that, at one time, his tasting notes indicated that Heady was best at 10 weeks.  Ever willing to experiment, I saved the last Heady in my haul until it reached the 10 week mark (4 weeks before hitting the shelves, plus six weeks in my fridge).  This offering definitely loses something with age.  The strong hop notes are still there but the citrus has been dialed back considerably.  It also oddly appears more boozy. My suggestion is to again listen to the can and "drink this beer immediately." 1,466 characters57md, Jul 23, 2015

Every time I drink heady, I want it to meet the hype that surrounds it. Most recently I drank it 3 days after canning, and as good as it was, it was still not mind blowing. Don't get me wrong, its a great DIPA in every sense, but there is some heavy competition especially in it's neck of the woods.
Super unfiltered and cloudy/hazy orange in appearance. Super piney and bitter. The IBUs labeled don't match the flavor profile. If Heady is present, I'll never turn one down, but I won't put myself through hell to get a can. A great DIPA, but not the best in the world. 627 charactersJonathannRobert, Jul 21, 2015

4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I don't throw around high scores on beers but this one totally deserves it. This does not taste like any other Double IPA I have tried before. Even with its 100 IBUs, the first thnig that washs over your palate is not 'bitter' but 'fresh'. Like drinking a newly mown lawn fresh. And smooth. It's hard to describe. The only knock is on the look which is pale and slightly cloudy but maybe that's why they encourage drinking from the can :-).  Drove 900 miles from Virginia and waited in line for 90 minutes at Winooski Beverage to get my hands on a case to bring back to share with friends. 589 charactershutchscouter, Jul 21, 2015

4.17/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25This is one of those beers that I've had on multiple occasions at multiple different freshness dates. It's fantastic don't get me wrong, but I've never had a can (even one that was canned less than 5 days old) where I was absolutely dumbfounded how good it is.
Look: That typical Vermont hazy orange-ish yellow hue with a good amount of sediment, yep I am a Douchebag and poured it into a glass, I had to see what I was drinking right?
Smell: This is where I was perplexed. Big peachy citric pine notes, with a overwhelming amount of bitterness lingering in the background. Almost smells too piney. I get a big herbaceous and floral character as well. Detractor to the initial peach-like tropical notes. 
Taste: More like the nose, but damn is this beer dry and long lastingly bitter. I had to look up the IBU's, seriously 75 that's all? Feels like 100+. There is also something to be said for the fact that I can taste this Vermont like yeast character that I get in this and a lot of Hill Farmstead brews, kinda drives the malt forward, especially in the older cans I've had.
Feel: Okay, this is where it wins me. Mid to full on the palate, but dissipates quickly enough to keep me coming back for another sip. Creamy per se? 
Overall: An awesome double IPA. But I'm not sure it ever warranted #1 in the world. Still awesome stuff that I like to have every now and then, but I never go out of my way to trade for it because there are much better local IPA/DIPA in the midwest here. 1,488 charactersBlackboardbrewing, Jul 21, 2015

It's amazing, if just a hair under focal banger, due to a bit too much bitterness on the backend for my taste (but I'm just splitting hairs). Amazing stuff! 386 characterswinningwes91, Jul 21, 2015

I drank half from the can as it recommends and half from an IPA glass. Honestly it was better from the glass but to each their own.
Look: Hazy amber color
Smell: Strong citrus / grapefruit pronounced. Slightly floral
Taste: Very hoppy, bitter, citrus upfront giving way to a smooth taste with a bite of bitter at the end
Feel: Perfectly carbonated 
Overall: It was an easy to drink DIPA. Well-balanced and nicely hopped. While my expectations are usually too high, this was a definite exception. Heady-Topper is the real deal. 646 charactersWyurm, Jul 16, 2015

Taste is like a breath of fresh air.  Bitter and crisp, with citrus and dry bready finish.  Fantastic malt flavor, heavily hopped but it retains balanced.  Great flavor and drinkability from start to finish.  This beer can be on the inconsistent side.  My first review of this beer was a 4.78/5... but after having had multiple since then, I figured it needed a new review.

Living in NJ I can't tell you how many times I've had friends or co workers promise they would bring back some from a trip to VT or " my buddy/cousin/whoever lives up there, I'll get them to bring it down " but all fell through.  I finally decided to take a road trip. I planned it well and did the round trip in a day, came back w 2 cases plus some other VT beers.  Successful trip I'd say.  Anyway, with all the hype and what I had to go through to get some Heady I was finally  ready to see for myself.  Well - I can see why this beer gets all the talk.  This isn't even my favorite style, I'm a BBA Stout guy but I must say this is a fantastic brew.  Outrageous flavor that just keeps getting better.  No question Heady is deserving of its # 1 status.

I like the use of malt that allows you to enjoy the hops and not be overrun by them.  Heady has now moved into a first place tie with Bell's Hopslam as my ATF.  Problem is now I want another one and I'm not planning any trips to VT in the near future! 331 charactersJParlow, Jul 08, 2015

4.91/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I was given a can by an extremely generous BA on here, this was my white whale and I have now slayed it and it was worth every ounce of hype.  I took the first sip and it was great, maybe not the best beer I've ever had but it was up there.  The more it warmed up it got better with every sip until I could literally think of nothing I would change about the beer.  A steady supply of this would be dangerous, and IIPA's aren't even my favorite style of beer but this is my favorite beer I have tried yet in my short time diving in to craft beer.  Side note, I drank about half from a glass and half from the can, and maybe it's just in my head because they tell you to on the can, but I think I liked straight from the can a little better. 740 charactersbuckslayer50, Jul 07, 2015

4.94/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I'm not going to do the typical L S T F O stuff that is on this site for this beer. I have frequented the site for years and years and this is the beer that made me have to do a review. I was skeptical when I obtained this beer. It can't be worth the hype. It can't be as good as this website says it is. I'm here to write that it is, without a doubt, the most incredible DIPA I have ever had. Not too strong, yet still flavorful. Still aromatic. I drank it form the can so I can't comment on the look but I don't care. This is a beer that is extremely hard for me to obtain in the area I am. I never thought I would get this beer. And now that I have, every IPA I have ever had fails in comparison. It was perfect. 715 charactersDrDusty, Jul 07, 2015

4.83/5  rDev +3.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5A - The beauty here is in seeing what is coming, but the golden orange body, opaque, and moderate thin white head, are not stunning.  The can art is great, and it is not a bad looking beer, but it is not exceptionally good looking.
S - On the other hand, the smell is a full range of fruit notes, from hints of orange and grapefruit, to stone fruit elements, tropicals and mild grain and grass elements underpinning.  The depth and fullness stun, and my wife, who hates beer, even agreed that this is a good smelling brew.  As full and ranging as this is, it avoids the harsher hop notes common in bold IPAs I've had.
T - Man, oh, man.  Delivering a broad, full range of fruit flavors, mango and grapefruit, peaches, couples with deep grains and floral and grassy notes.  The depth is extraordinary.
M - For how bruising and bold the hop profile, this could have been a scraper.  Many this bold are.  But the feel, though full, with a touch of drying in the close, is not abusive.  A gentle giant.
O - So this is what the hype is about.  A tremendous treat, with bold complex flavors that do not overwhelm the palate.  The real trick here is getting all of these elements to sing in harmony, and the brewers earned their name on this one.  Worth every bit of credit this beer gets. 1,285 charactersTsar_Riga, Jul 06, 2015

Smells of hops, pine, grapefruit, kind of muted coming from the can.  Taste is as advertised, wave after wave of hops, juicy citrus and some resinous pine but just enough malt to keep it balanced.  Moderately carbed and medium body keeps this pretty easy drinking.  Overall, good IPA, still not sure it deserves all the hype, a lot of others out there that are just as good. 452 charactersBradC, Jul 05, 2015

Its hype creates a few more naysayers among the people ive talked to about it.  Nonetheless, its at the top of the list for a reason. Great taste, packs a punch, drink it in the can like it says, i do notice a difference. Its got that murky unfiltered look anyway so the glass wont do much for you.  I cant tell yet if i like this or Lawsons sip o' sunshine better.  But i do know i wish both companies expanded their distribution to other areas than vermont. 527 charactersnheigelmann, Jul 04, 2015

For me, an IPA needs to have something to set it apart, as a lot of hoppy beers taste the same to me.  Heady has a really nice pine scent and taste that I have not seen duplicated elsewhere.  It really just tastes like Vermont; you can almost imagine that there are pine needles floating in the beer.  However, I wouldn't go to the lengths that some people do to get it, especially since there's a VERY limited window where Heady is at its peak freshness. 528 characters2014LM2X1, Jun 28, 2015

L: A little muddy/dirty with light orange hue; Doesn't have the appearance a super clean beer, but displays a nice frothy white head.
S: Perhaps this beer's best attribute! Tons of hops, as expected. Mango and tropical fruits up front that are balanced well with a underlying pine/grass hop characteristic. As the beer sits, that foresty characteristic starts to stand out a bit more. 
T: My initial impression is well balanced, even with hop bitterness punch at the backend. I would say the malt body is light, but hop flavor is definitely the main focal point...as it should be with a beer like this. As far as the flavor, the backbone is tons of grass and pine. A little funny, since the smell painted a slightly different picture.
F: Another outstanding characteristic. I like how light this beer drinks, even though it's 8% ABV. Medium to light body with the carbonation to match it. Finish is dry, but not to the point of were it deters from the overall experience.
O: Tough, I'm going into this beer expecting my mind blown due to it's high rating. I've been around long enough to know that beers are usually overhyped to some extent, but again that shouldn't take away from the beers overall quality. A couple of friends, who have a much better palate than mine, have described this beer's status in somewhat the same manner. If I were to compare this to another behemoth, like PTE, it definitely stands up. Also, I wouldn't necessarily classify this as an east coast DIPA, as others have described. World Class? Perhaps. In my opinion, one of the better DIPA I've had the pleasure of trying. Cheers! 1,676 charactersOlieIPA, Jun 21, 2015

You KNOW it's a good beer when you open the can and the aroma begins to fill the room. The taste is absurdly hoppy. It's literal hop juice. So many levels at once: juicy, bitter, piney, grassy, dank. It's all there. This is a raw and unabated DIPA. A once in a lifetime experience for folks outside of New England. Try it and you will understand its love. Good luck topping the Topper. 497 charactersBranfordBound, Jun 15, 2015

Pours yellow-orange and translucent, white sticky head, that retains well.
Smell is unreal. Powerful bouquet of tropical citrus and pine, a lot of grassy hop. Very difficult aroma. 
The taste is wonderful citrus and flowery hop, hop bitterness manifested with the first sip. I would add a little sweetness.
Pleasant mouthfeel. Medium body, moderate carbonation, bitterness lingers till the finish, really drinkable.
Overall, this is a great beer, but I’m not sure that is best DIPA in the world. 574 charactersSayBoom, Jun 14, 2015

Taste - much like the nose - orange/tangerine, grapefruit, mango, pine

Overall - very good beer, not sure if it is head and shoulders above more readily available DIPA's, but certainly worth trying for lovers of the style 519 characterskeithmurray, Jun 13, 2015

It pours a very, and surprisingly, murky yellowish-orange hue. Plenty of pine and floral scents in the aroma. If chilled before drinking, which this can was, there seems to be a slight carbonated bite to the initial feel, which is at first, and to the last, solid-bodied. Taste is nice and piney, with a tinge of bitterness and an even slighter near white wine tang at the end. I poured this into a pint glass, and this settled into itself two-thirds of the way through--good head and a nice syrupy taste developed. I enjoyed the overall drink. It didn't quite measure up to the intense hype, but still an enjoyable brew. 701 charactersBuccoFan, Jun 07, 2015

L- hazy gold, with an off-white head that lingers seemingly forever.
S- grapefruit like whoa, but sweet make as well. A touch of other fruits. It's just a shade south of perfectly balanced
T- the taste achieves the sublime balance that the nose missed. Honey-sweet, yet juicy, yet jammy, yet bitter. It tastes like everything and nothing.
F- low-moderate carbonation, with a boost that ever-so-slightly approaches medium-full, thanks to the maltiness.
O- the great Heady vs Pliny Debate is settled, in my eyes. 577 charactersTDotScott, Jun 05, 2015
4.72/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75I had this at least a couple of weeks old, would love to give a few day old a shot. Unlike other epic DIPAs, this had a more grassy dankness rather than a juicy one. It almost felt like the taste profile is grassy/earthy based (in a good way) rather than juicy/citrusy/fruity based like Maine Dinner or Carton 077xx. 
Dinner remains my top DIPA but I had it 2day old. Other Half All Green follows. 
I'd love to reevaluate Heady Topper when it's at its finest. It's just true that the full power of these beers is experienced in the first few days after bottling. 563 charactersBeern1ck, Jun 05, 2015

I think it's particularly popular because it doesn't blow your mouth's sides out with hops - this is more influenced by English-style beers, and it shows.

A: Pours hazy golden amber with a frothy off white head that settles to a thin layer and laces lightly. 
S: Citrus, pine, tropical fruit, caramel malt sweetness, and a hint of alcohol.
T: Citrus, grapefruit and a little orange, pine, hints of tropical fruit, mango, a little spice, maybe even a bit fruity, with a solid caramel malt backbone, and  a hint of alcohol. Very tasty from the glass, but for some reason it's even better straight from the can. 
M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, really smooth and drinkable.
O: In full disclosure, my can wasn't uber fresh, it probably had 2+ months on it, but still a really good beer. That being said, it's not my #1, but still high on the list. I would love to try this one again super fresh. Who wouldn't? 867 charactersRyanK252, Jun 01, 2015

Once the first sip touched my lips and trickled down my throat i knew what i had just tasted was greatness. The after taste is literally thirst quenching, by far the best IPA ive ever had, and to top it off its a double IPA! yet soo smooth. Anyways, the fruity smell and perfect amount of hoppy taste followed by a smooth after taste is next to none. Highly recommend this beer! 439 characterscarney710, May 28, 2015

No color observations because it was consumed from the can. The can looks nice though.
Smell is floral with a solid hop aroma.
Taste brings strong hops without any overpowering bitterness. The hops have staying power that linger on the palate. Dangerously drinkable.
Mouthfeel is smooth and clean.
Excellent beer that lives up to the hype! 398 charactersBsquirrelbrewer, May 26, 2015

However it is a strange recommendation as it limits the possibility to smell the beer. It is a very hoppy beer with a strong citrus feel. It is slightly too high in alcohol as you can feel it almost immediately but I guess it is normal for a double IPA. Cannot see the date on the cans but bought one from Skinny Pancake in Montpelier and the other from the farmhouse tap and grill in Burlington, which I strongly recommend for their beer selection and food. 565 charactersFuori_fuoco, May 26, 2015

Since then I have tried a plethora of new amazing beers from up and coming breweries, like TreeHouse and Trillium, which made me wonder if I still liked Heady just as much as I used to. I was able to score a can last week and had it yesterday for my birthday. To my surprise, it still lives up to its hype! It might not be my favorite DIPA anymore, but it is definitely up there in the top 5.
Drank half from a snifter, the second half from the can.
L: golden straw in color; hazy but not muddy; can see some light coming through it. 
S: Dank goodness. a lot more herbaceous and resinous than what I remember, some citrus, some biscuity malt and a slight hint of  tropical fruits, but very minimal. 
T: Follows. More citrus notes and a decent amount of lingering bitterness. 
M: Nice and pillowy, on the medium to full side. Wonderfully frizzy carbonation
O: Just excellent. As I said, top 5 DIPA for me. 953 charactersdiemilio, May 26, 2015

Somehow hits you on the chin, although not extremely strong, but at the same time has a long lasting, complex feel. I'm not articulate in the sommelier language, more like "this be real good, gotta stock cave" kinda guy: in my way I recommend it without hesitation. Travelling to  Vermont over the Memorial Day weekend I planned on buying it because of the hype (I live in Massachusetts where it's not available) and stood in a line for nearly 3 hours to get a 24-can case. Time well spent. 554 charactersbrewmine, May 25, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Let me start out by saying I'm not a lover of very hoppy beers - so going into this was interesting as I knew it would be high on hops -- but there is also the whole "trying to even get your hands on this" mystique that made me need to try it?!
Look - like many, I drank from the can so I have no clue what it looks like.
Smell - immediate floral bouquet as soon as I cracked it open.  Hops factory comes barreling out into your nostrils and immediately evident this was going to be strong
Taste - the immediate bitterness and higher alcohol content is strong up front of the palette - but as it moves toward the back you really get that sweeter, more citric-type taste.  I was impressed by the complexity of this and not dismissive as I am with many strong hops-laden beers
Feel - I was pleasantly surprised at how smooth this was.  I was expecting very high carbonation but it was toned down yet enough to aerate the flavor of the beer
Overall -- again - I'm no lover of hops but if I step back and review this from that of a beer expected to be full of hops -- it really does meet many of the expectations you have in a beer.  It's got insanely good smell/flavor/feel right from the start and it's a beer that packs a nice punch.  I probably wouldn't have more than one at any given setting.  I was happy I was given the chance to try this beer and quite surprised at how well they did with this. 1,404 charactersTwinCreator, May 23, 2015

It was not easy for me while I was there and the time since could have been kinder to me as well. I got to march earlier this week with the other alums and since I didn't want (or get) any gifts for graduation, a can of this that I traded for up at the Cloverleaf was all I wanted as a gift. Never before was I so excited to have a beer given the lofty ranking of this on here and even though it wasn't quite a "5" in my book, I can easily see why so many people on here enjoy this!
Even though the can said to drink from it, I had to pour it out like I've done with every beer that I've had over the nearly 10 years that I've been reviewing on this site. The golden hue had a moderate level of dankness to it and the head was as thick and frothy as any I've ever seen. Hops and grapefruit dominate in the nose with both of them being strong but not overbearing in the taste. Pine, tropical fruit, and a hint of lemon zest coalesce nicely in the taste along with a bright carbonated presence and a mouthfeel that is as resinous as any West Coast beer. I probably messed up when I poured this out and untamed it but I did leave some on the can for the end and because this beer was so potent, it's best served one mild sip at a time.
While not a session beer, it's hard not to have just one in a sitting. I didn't have a choice but if there was more here, I would have popped them open once I polished this off. The herbal aftertaste of this beer was proof at how mild this was for an American Double/Imperial IPA as the 75 IBU were just the right amount to go with the alcohol and the flavor profile. While not the best beer or IPA I've ever had, there's no doubt that this was a must-try for anyone on here looking to taste the best of what America has to offer with so many beers nipping at the heels of this on the rankings, this will no doubt remain just as sought-after once it drops from #1 on the rankings. There's nothing quite like this out there and with so much available these days, that's a feather in the cap for a brew worthy of the lofty status it has earned! 2,162 charactersJerzDevl2000, May 22, 2015

For taste the bitterness was not overpowering which I expected (not being an experienced IPA DIPA drinker) .  I was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed the pine and citrus together.  I will begin to try more IPAs because of this but from the few I've had, this is easily the best tasting and most enjoyable. 410 charactersjoberlander, May 18, 2015

From the can initially as recommended,  but then poured into a tulip.
A - What can I say? Honestly, it is not an attractive beer, especially for the style. Cloudy (actually opaque) pale orangish yellow with minimal white foam. But I understand that the yeast, low in floculence, is important component of the beers character. Okay, but it's ugly.
S - Again after a few sips, I felt like I was cheating the beer by drinking from the can. Whatever is gained from preserving the arromatics, not pouring, are lost due to simply not having access to the olfactory.  The beer has a nice piney aroma with citrus notes especially as it warms further.
T - Taste is bitter with intense piney and cirussy flavors - very much followiing the aroma. Malt backbone presents as enjoyably sweet,  but not at all cloying, and like most American IPAs lacks complexity to let hops stand out.
F - Feels nice. Silky. It is obvious to me that the look of the beer is a "who cares?" The particulate matter, the yeast, whatever makes it cloudy possibly serves the mouthfeel. 
O - This is an excellent beer. Not the best. 1,191 charactersWickedSluggy, May 18, 2015

In one sip it goes from citrus bomb to dank, back to citrus and then finishes dry with pine like hops. So many flavors and the hop aroma smell should be a scented candle!

After taking off a day from work, I traveled almost 4 hours to hop in the lines at the venues where this was being delivered that Thursday. I was accompanied by a whole bunch of craft beer lovers. Without disappointment, I was able to obtain several cases of this elusive gem! Following directions, I drank this straight from the can and what a surprise it was... by far one of the best double IPAs in the country. I can realistically see why this beer is so sought after. If you haven't already, do your best to obtain a fresh can of this beer... it will change your thoughts about craft beer. Cheers! 704 characterstregan_20, May 12, 2015

A: I drank it from the can, but I did pour a little bit for a friend. It was dark orange with a thin, white head.
S: Floral, herbal, orange, peach, mango, very tropical, some pine, hoppy.
T: Similar to nose, however this beer seems to have just about every kind of taste that an IPA can possibly have…pure brilliance! It starts off very dry and then explodes mid sip with citrusy/tropical goodness and then fades into bursting hops.
M: Hops are somewhat prickly to the tongue, extremely balanced with the sweetness, dryness, mild bitterness and overall complexity.
O: A perfect 5!! I have given a few 5's in the past, but this beer is the best!! 720 charactersCoffeePorter, May 09, 2015

4.98/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Serving: 16 oz. can poured into a tulip. No canned on date, but picked this up recently in a trade and was told it's "as fresh as can be", so I'm assuming no more than 2-3 weeks old at this point. 
A: Pours a very nice, hazy, golden-yellow color. Leaves a nice 1/4-finger bubbly white head at the edges. Almost looks like fresh-squeezed orange juice without the pulp. The haze and unfiltered appearance here is really how I like my DIPAs, as it gives off that appearance of depth and character that you just don't get with clear, filtered IPAs.
S: Huge orange and tangerine notes up front. After that, pineapple and a touch of banana. Definitely some mango in there as well. Surprisingly, no grapefruit, as this nose comes off more sweeter fruit smelling and less citrus or acidic. Almost has a Pina Colada thing going on with some coconut in there. Very nice.
T: Again, large orange and tangerine notes up front. Aftertaste is almost like licking the inside of an orange rind. In the middle you get a nice mix of pineapple and mango. Taste is all hop flavors here, very little bitterness or piney notes to it. 
M: One word for this would be "juicy". It's just full, rich, creamy and juicy. Great carbonation, alcohol hidden well. Perfectly balanced. Just the right amount of malt so that it's appropriately in the background here, because this is all hops all the way. Aftertaste is just a touch bitter, and it does coat your tongue, but I wouldn't call it a palate-wrecker by any means. Very, very dry on the finish. Maybe a little too try. 
O: Reviewing a beer that is already known as the #1 beer on BA is very difficult. There's a lot of preconceived notions that go into it. I've had this beer several times now, in three waves. First time was "woah! best beer ever!". Second time was a little more down to earth, especially after having tried many other top DIPAs in the interim. Now my third approach to this legend, and I'm somewhere in between. I have more respect for this beer and what's able to do consistently. It certainly is ONE of the top DIPAs on this planet. Not naming it #1 isn't a diss, it's just that I think that's impossible. When you're this good, the only way to truly decide is with a blind taste test, and I don't have the time nor the resources for that. This beer really does have everything you want in a DIPA, and I guess any beer in general. It's smooth, drinkable, balanced, and explosive. Explosive as in it just hits you with hops over and over, but never really fatigues you. An example of fatigue would be Stone. They just go really hard, but at the end, you're exhausted and your tongue hurts. Here, you can go all day and it's still really enjoyable. Pliny, Heady, HF, Double Sunshine, Perm Funeral, Square Grouper, doesn't matter. They are all elite. Any of them can be 5's and #1 on any given day. Heady is up there and they should be proud. 
Recommendation: It's the #1 beer in the world. Get it. Drink it. Make your own opinion. 2,979 charactersSparty1224, May 06, 2015

4.71/5  rDev +1.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75First, thanks to the nameless one in Vista for the can I got to share with my girlfriend, I got to try Heady without having to either trade for it or go to Vermont. :) I have had so many wonderful DIPAs that I knew right from the first sip that nothing would shock me with greatness ever again; but drinking this beer, I could definitely understand why it's (currently) the top rated beer. 
Pours cloudy but not ugly, as I did not drink from the can, as suggested. The nose was rife with tropical fruit and a slight hard to pinpoint 'musty' quality that I assume was from the yeast. The flavor gloriously followed the nose, with a very big pineapple flavor lingering. The mouthfeel provided just enough body and bitterness on the tongue to let you know that this is a real DIPA, and the alcohol flavor is nowhere to be found. 
Would I call this the greatest DIPA I've ever had? I'm pretty sure I've liked others more in the past, but the fact that I have to dig deep into the memory banks says a lot about Heady Topper's quality. 1,031 charactersfox227, May 03, 2015

2.65/5  rDev -43%look: 4.5 | smell: 2 | taste: 2.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 2.5Let me begin with a precursor: I've had Heady on several occasions, my first being almost four years ago. I'm writing this review because this batch from early February when I purchased a case is simply a shell of its former self and must have something wrong with it (and not because it's been 3 months since it was canned; because it tasted the same right after I bought it and it's been refrigerated ever since and should still be plenty drinkable at this stage). Cracking a can brings an overwhelming smell and subsequent taste of peanut butter, peanut oil and peanuts. As I am not a homebrewer, though I work in beer retail, I do not know how to pinpoint this off-flavor/smell (i.e. diacetyl), but it is certainly not the Heady that blew my mind when I first had it four years ago. My main motivation in writing this review is to alert others to the possibility that clearly not all batches of Heady are created equal now. If this can be chalked up to mishandling (exposure to heat), and is not a fault of The Alchemist, I would certainly understand. But as I purchased this case in the midst of a bone-chilling winter, I find that possibility not very plausible. And don't get me wrong; this is not intended to throw The Alchemist, John and Jen or their staff under the bus. They are working tirelessly to bring this beer to the masses of VT, the U.S., and now--yes--the world. Hopefully this is simply an anomaly and their quality control only improves with further batches, yet now with their increased production and the new Stowe facility, this may only become more difficult in the future. As a die-hard craft drinker and one who knows where Heady belongs in the upper echelon of DIPAs, I hope this does not prove to be the case. 1,740 characterswildfire275, May 02, 2015

A - Hazy, orange.  Not quote opaque, but its tough to see much light through it. People say this beer isn't great looking in a glass, but I beg to differ.  Bright white, fluffy head with that pour.
S - Explosive fruity hops.  Peaches are huge in this can.  There is citrus too - orange, slight grapefruit.  Sweet mango, passion fruit underneath.  Killer smelling beer.
T - This beer lives up to the hype.  An awesome DIPA.  Sweet hops up front - peaches, mango, stone fruits.  Very hoppy, but amazingly balanced.  Middle of the mouth you get grapefruit bitterness, and the back end breadiness balances this amazingly.  This is 100+ IBUs?  You'd be hard pressed to know that if you were drinking this blind.  Awesome stuff.
O - this was my first NE DIPA, and still one of the best.  After drinking this from a can, there isn't a huge difference from the glass to the can.  Highly recommended. 946 charactersjow_42, May 01, 2015

4.99/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5At this point, reviewing Heady Topper is analogous to rating the character of Derek Jeter.  Everything great has been said, everything said has been great, and that standard is not going away. So, we are no longer worthy of trying to compare this IPA to anything else on the market. A reviewer below writes that although Heady is "an incredible IPA, there are others equally as good." I think they are claiming that there is no better beer being brewed in the world right now, than what is being produced here in the US. I almost completely agree.  The only exception is maybe Belgium, and their exotic ales, however, Brewery Ommegang has made the gap very small these days.  Anyway, USA is killing it, and the beer buffet out there has something great for everyone.  The only criticism of the referenced blog below would be that a reader could get the impression that they were placing Heady head-to-head with the likes of Rogue Dead Guy Ale. That would be like comparing an 18 year aged cheddar to light orange ballpark nacho melt. Not that there is anything wrong with either.  We all have our favorites, and it's nice that the writer below is proud and loyal to the other great beers out there, and publishes their support. This makes the world go round, and keeps all of these committed brewers thriving. I enjoy them all too. 1,331 charactersmirp1, Apr 27, 2015

A wild combination of bold flavor and feel in a very drinkable beer. This is on the crisper/sharper end of the hoppy IPA spectrum that can leave the mouth feeling a bit dry, but it's more balanced or subtle than some of the hop-explosion style beers. Glad I got to try it, and I'll get more given the opportunity, luckily I think I can find IPAs in the same niche and caliber locally at Maine Brewing. 441 charactersPip_Count_167, Apr 20, 2015

The aroma is right on par with the unreal taste - it's a blast of citrus, pine and pith that hovers around the can. I'm a fan of drinking straight from the can but no harm is wrought if it's poured into a  glass. So many in-depth reviews on here so I'll be brief - big body with a soft mouthfeel supplemented by an entirely unique cascade of citrus, pine and bitter-hop flavors. The bouquet of apricot, orange rind, lemon, grapefruit, crackery malt, tobacco and tea hits hard up front then proceeds to coat the mouth and linger for a few seconds after the sip. Gorgeous. Nothing like it. 649 charactersManapuaMan, Apr 17, 2015

4.31/5  rDev -7.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25This beer pours a hazy bright yellow golden color with a huge, frothy bright white head. Retention is excellent with a one finger cap lasting the entire beer and many chunky hanging sheets of lacing. Smell is a citrus and tropical fruit. Grapefruit, lemon, orange, tangerine, and a slight bit of dankness pine are all present. Taste is the same with just moderate amount of bitterness. Feel is very soft at first with a prickly bitterness on the back end. Overall a very good beer.
This beer blew my mind a few years ago when I first had it and was easily the best IPA for me, but the last 5 times or so have all been no where near as good. I've been reluctant to edit my review, but after this last one I feel like I have to. I'm not sure if my palate has changed or if Heady has changed, but it's not the same. I definitely prefer Focal and Heady is way behind TH, Trillium and Fiddlehead in my opinion. 906 charactersCNoj012, Apr 12, 2015

Feel: Good amount of carbonation. The bitterness is at the end and lingers.
Overall: Good but I would put some other DIPAs ahead of Heady. 326 charactersKMachHops, Apr 09, 2015

My first thought was I love the graphics and the name. But i was a little apprehensive to drinking it from the can. But holy hell were the contents of that can just marvelous. My favorite thing was the aftertaste. Savoring each moment between sips, I found myself sipping just to recharge that taste. Man, this beer was just AMAZING. If you can someway get your hands on it. Drink the living shit out of it. 503 charactersNickmaaan, Apr 08, 2015

I am very glad I had the chance to try it and would encourage others to do so as the beauty of beer is everyone has a different palate and even that changes over time. 368 charactersGig2828, Apr 08, 2015

4.65/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 2 |  overall: 4.75Look: The can looks awesome when you can see it. Unfortunately every time I go to Vermont I see an empty space where this beer is supposed to be. Why does everyone want this stuff so bad? Let me explain.
Smell: Smells like victory (not to be confused with Victory Dirt Wolf) when you open it, simply because it's soo hard to get. It also really smells awesome. Like...pinesol and hops, more pinesol, more hops...
Taste: I drank this on the top of the mountains with my friend. It was a good day. It nearly blew my head off like that picture on the can. My friend said my eyes were turning green from all the hops...kind of like the incredible hulk. Yeah, the taste was that good.
Feel: I'm gonna give it a lower rating because theres so much hops I feel like you get hops pieces in your mouth. I was def tasting chunks. But then again, maybe a fly or two went into the can while I wasn't looking. Everyone wants this stuff. :)
I give this the 4.75, it's almost perfect...texture just needs a small tweak. 1,008 charactersPlower, Apr 04, 2015

Drink from the can, as soon as you open the smell hits hard; Intense hops. Taste is just like the smell, punches you in the face with the hops. With the high IBU rating it's not a surprise. Easy to drink, but stay away from too many as you'll get numb from the flavor. 315 charactersChrisP802, Apr 04, 2015

However, i came from around the world and have been Homebrewing for 8 years; just to drive countless hours and wait in line; only to take a sip of the worlds finest! Yes, it lives to its standards! I e-mailed the company and all the stores to assure myself and acquire some of this brew! I got turned down by both saying to follow the truck and wait in line. I did and popped my first can at Route 7 in Shelburne VT at 945 in the morning to find the LOve of my IPA's!! A very balanced and strong double IPA leaving resigns of pine flavor in my mouth many minutes after drinking. 5 out of 5 for sure and still to this day worth the wait as i did on 30-March-2015 at Route 7 in Shelburne VT. Thank you, I will do this again just to get a case. Chris 811 charactersBEER88, Apr 02, 2015

4.59/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A friend from Vermont hooked it up and brought a few cans over.
Appearance:  I drank it from the can (as instructed), so I'm not sure. The can is interesting enough.
Aroma:  Possibly muted due to the can. I was expecting something more intense, but it has a nice piney-hop aroma.
Taste:  I took one sip and was overwhelmed by waves of pine and citrus long after swallowing. 
Mouthfeel: A bit on the syrupy side, but has an incredibly smooth and clean finish.
Overall:  I won't hesitate to call it the best IPA/DIPA I've tried.  I had a Sculpin immediately afterwards and it paled in comparison. 599 charactersshillzor, Mar 27, 2015

L - Hazy and almost syrup thick.  I was half expecting hunks of hop cone to plop into my glass.  Certainly not the most appealing looking beer
S - Quite light on the nose.  I am getting why the instructions are drink from can...  This isn't your floral hop bomb - more dank with hints of citrus but muted
T - Surprisingly light and smooth with a sharp bitterness on the finish.  Dank piney hops with a slight sweetness, but very well balanced based on how syrupy the pour was - I expected it to be sweeter
F - A touch prickly but smooth and rich.  I could swear this was half oats or something; so soft and velvety
O - Digging it.  Quite a polarized IPA.  It isn't trying to be more than one thing, it just goes for it and does dank, piney and rich as hard as possible. 892 characterspagriley, Mar 25, 2015

I'm a native vermonter who doesn't have regular access to this anymore, so perhaps I will do a full detailed review when I next have a fresh can.
I used to turn down grabbing a 4pk of this when it would come out, weekly, at the local cooperative where I worked, grabbing a Victory Dirtwolf or some other local VT options. However now that I live in Jersey City, I have to say, this is the tastiest beer that I've ever had. The best DIPA unquestionably. And I look forward to having it again all the time now that I don't have the availability. Too much of a good thing, and you don't know what you've got on your hands...

This winter I trekked up to Waterbury VT to do some skiing with my gf in nearby Stowe. We knew about this beer prior to the trip but didn't realize just how rare and difficult it was to track down. Shops in Waterbury who stock the brew have special stickers on their doors that designate them as authorized retailers. Can you believe that? It's like an Apple product!
I did some research on where the best place was to purchase the Topper after two unsuccessful trip to local shops. Silly me, it was a Wednesday after all, I should have known that cases of this sweet nectar don't survive that deep into the week... I used BA and found that the State Liquor store off RT 108 was the place to head towards. There I met manager Bob, a big surly santa type figure. A friendly and chatty fella, Bob helped navigate my search for the Topper and even told me about special Maine Beer Co releases, as I had picked up a few bottles of their beer to hold me over until Topper came.
He told me and the 3 other guys in the shop who were also searching to come back tomorrow at 3 o'clock sharp if we wanted to score a 4 pack.
The next day, I was excited to ski but I think I was looking forward to getting the beer even more.  After each run, I checked my phone to make sure we wouldn't miss it. I knew the shuttle schedule by heart as I wanted to time our departure in exact coordination with the release of the beer. After ending our day on the slopes, we took the bus back towards town. We told the driver we we're on a quest and directed him towards the state liquor store. He didn't bat an eye as I'm sure this request didn't seem out of place in northern VT. Try doing that in a city, see if they stop for you to acquire your rare double IPA.. 
We nearly sprinted into the shop as we saw others starting to pull into the lot as they too must have also been tipped off. We scurried to the back of the shop where there were several cases laid out with a sign that pointed to it. Like a flag had been planted by early everest explorers, like yes, you have made it, congrats!
 We paid our money and exited the shop with two 4 packs in hand, as each one of us was allowed 1 pack. We anxiously waited for our ride back so we could crack these bad boys open in the hotel.
I think the search was the high point. It's like tourists that come to NYC and wait inline for 3 hours to eat those bizarre cronuts. Yes the cronut is probably good, maybe even worth the ridiculous wait. But what they gained besides the calories was a story. That's what our Heady Topper experience was like. The brew is awesome, don't get me wrong. But if you already drink good beer than this is just another to add to your list.
Heady Topper to me will always be a reminder of my trip to Stowe, having to make a special stop alongside the road to grab a 4 pack with skis in hand. It was an awesome experience, and I recommend the same to anyone who has the chance to do so.
Sorry for my rant, I love this site and was excited for this to be my first post.
Good luck to all finding this elusive brew!!

4.49/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Pours a hazy bright orange with a thick soapy white head. The smell hits with a floral quality but you will get some tropical fruit notes if you really dig your nose in; pineapple, mango, melon, a bit of juicey orange, and a touch of sweetness. That sweetness comes through even more on the taste, almost honey or brown sugar-like, not really your typical malt sweetness. There is some mild fruitiness again, I'd say the best descriptor is ripe cantaloupe but there is some melon, guava, and papaya in there as well. Mouthfeel is soft and sticky, not too much bitterness, the sweetness lingers. Definitely hides the 8% ABV well.
I can see why many say this is the best beer in the world, it's very approachable and very smooth. My favourites in the style tend to be a little more brazen and bold but this is certainly a great beer. 832 charactersBeervana, Mar 19, 2015

4.21/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Drank this beer straight from the can.  Aromas of grapefruit, tropical fruit, pomegranate, mango, kiwi, oranges, pine.  Taste is wave after wave of hops.  Tropical fruits upfront followed by a piney resinous bitterness on the back.  Medium body, carbonation is moderate, extremely refreshing at 8.0% abv.  
I can see why hopheads flock to this beer.  Even long after I finished my can the hop flavors were still lingering on my tongue.  Its impossible to appreciate the complexity of this beer if you don't like hops.  I am not a hophead myself but this brew deserves its world-class ranking. 593 charactersVogie, Mar 18, 2015

Artificial rarity factor keeps prices high. I've had plenty of DIPA"s that I liked better than this one. Not to say it's not good, but the price is insane. Aroma: hops, hops and more hops. Taste: Hops, hops and more hops.
I don't get the whole drink out of the can thing, 80% of our taste comes from aroma which you don't get from drinking out of the can. Gimmicky at best - the 100 rating baffles me. 503 charactersLarryV, Mar 17, 2015
3.98/5  rDev -14.4%look: 2.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25Before I go further with this review let me make two caveats:  First, the three times I received a can of this brew was from people who traveled to get it, so I don't know how it was kept for the days or weeks before it got to me.  Second, I'm not trying to topple a giant, Just trying to give an honest review while trying to follow BJCP guidelines and not let public hype influence my observations...  Anywho, let's drink some Heady Topper!!!  
From the Can (Only three days old according to the friend who got it), drunk from 40-50 F
Even though it says "Drink From The Can" I poured about 4oz into a juice glass to evaluate: 1.5 fingers of lasting white head with medium/small bubbles on top of a golden yellow body with slight orange/light-copper highlights.  BJCP says Imperial/American IPA's can be "a bit" hazy...  This brew's more cloudy than a Hefe... sorry Alchemist, points off there if we're going by the book...
Aroma Is pleasant, huge mix of hop florals (citrus, piney) with hints of malt, light brown sugar, and stonefruit, but on this particular can nothing seems to stand out above the rest - it makes me think "American IPA" but not much else.   *Note, stronger aromas started to come forward as it warmed, more florals and malt sweetness
Taste is fairly balanced between malt sweetness and hop bitterness considering how hoppy it is.  Flavors of grass, lilac, other florals, light brown sugar, peach, apricot, macintosh apple, with a tinge of yeasty breadyness.
Mouthfeel is spot-on, light to medium bodied, fairly smoth with a prickle of carbonation that dries with the hop bitterness at the end, makes me want to take sip after sip.  Well done.
Overall, a well done IPA, But this can (in my opinion) rates lower than the first two I had over a month ago.  While this batch seemed to be more hop forward (the hops were definitely more aggressive in this batch) the first two I had were definitely more malt forward with larger bursts of stone fruit, ripe honey-crisp apple and tropical fruit flavors cutting through the background.  Had I rated one of those cans instead of this one, my personal bias towards more malty beers might have given it a few more points. (except for appearance, guidelines are guidelines no matter how tasty the beer is)  I thought those two were amazing and delicious, this one was just "eh, another strong, bitter American IPA"  Has anyone else found such variability in this brew?  All that aside, still my #1 East Coast IPA.  
Also, they really mean "drink from the can" the 4oz I poured out lost the more subtle hop and fruit flavors fairly quickly. 2,609 charactersKJHB, Mar 16, 2015

This was a hazy, muddled straw color. It poured with a large, dense looking, sticky head.
A nice hop bouquet was evident as soon as the can was cracked; a delicate fruit salad aroma consisting of mango, pineapple, and juicy oranges. There was little in the way of malt balance, just a hint of sugar cookie.
Tastes as the smell suggests it would, just a wall of juicy hop layers. Fresh, pungent, sticky; wonderful. As big as this tastes, the fruit flavors come across as delicate. I guess because so many different flavors are discernible. There was a nice bitter bite at the end.
A great DIPA for sure and at reasonable price. If I had access, I drink tons of this one. Thanks guys! 728 charactersDIM, Mar 15, 2015

I got lucky and went to Monk's Cafe in Philadelphia in search of Pliny the Elder and found out that they were serving Heady Topper.  The line for the beer went out the door.  It lived up to the hype in a big way.  Everything about this beer was phenomenal.  The first sip was almost magical.  Like the beer was massaging my tongue.  Every sip after that got better and better.  The only disappointment was when I realized my can was empty.  Perfect beer. 522 characterstheultimatesound, Mar 14, 2015

I can't pick up some of the more subtle notes others have highlighted, but perhaps it's because I don't drink quite enough IPAs to be sensitive to them. 402 charactersIan_Alexander, Mar 14, 2015

The absolute worst double IPA I have ever had, and this is my favorite style!
Hops are barely existent, there is an inherent smoothness to the beer but it tastes of wet cigarettes. I wish I could say better things, but it almost tastes like a homebew that was not properly sanitized. But two cans from a two week old batch? What in the world. Now Sip of Sunshine from Lawsons was incredible, but this, not a chance. just awful. 660 charactersDanielGJ0, Mar 13, 2015

4.46/5  rDev -4.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had a can today at City Tap House (Logan Sq). Drank most of it from the can. Poured off about 4 oz into a taster glass.
The first thing that struck me was how damn smooth it is. Almost like real-life silk drawers. Pretty fantastic.
It's light on the palate for 8%, dry, but not sharp or crisp. The booze is real soft and very well balanced by the hop silk and its soft static hum of bitterness.
In the glass, it's a pale, faded shade of yellow, and hazy. Bit of a ring of foam, but no magic in the head stand.
Flavor-wise, I feel like green tea was the first impression, biting in the middle and aftertaste. Not just that, but a lovely concentrated, soupy fog of citrus - first orange, with lemony highlights, then later grapefruit in the finish and aftertaste... Perhaps a dash of pine in the background... Not terribly spicy... After the first few sips, some graham-crackery malt seems to sneak in there on the tail end of each swig. It's but a peep, though.
The aroma in the glass brings it home. It's kinda straight-up-the-gut West Coast IPA. Fragrant, but subtle.
Overall, it's one of the more elegant hoppy ales around. The execution is impressive.  But I have to say that I find the raw flavors of Sculpin or some of the Green Flash IPAs, et al, to be something that I would go back to again. Not so this.  It's just one in a long line of scarce beers that, while quite good, never melt my brain or make my body quiver in ecstasy.
Thanks CTH for only charging $7. It was worth it. 1,494 charactersBouleboubier, Mar 12, 2015

L: Poured a bit into a glass to share (though I agree with the can that was a mistake--see below for differences). Standard IPA look: orange-ish with good head retention, haziness. 
S: Smells like a lovely pine forest. Different varieties of pine too--not just one-note, with a bit of floralness and orange mixed in. 
T: An outstanding IIPA. Piney, but not overwhelmingly so. The taste from the can was a bit more bubbly and crisp than the bit I put in a glass--I recommend keeping it in the can. As I drank, I got more and more floral notes, though the taste was still strongly pine bitters. A hint of bubblegum showed up about halfway through--no fruit though. As the can says, the taste comes in waves--but they're more restrained than the sharpness of, say, a PtE. No hint of the 8% ABV. Only slight negative note--the aftertaste was a bit too strongly bitter. No other flavors left on the tongue, just a moderate dry, lingering bitterness. 
F: Creamy, yet crisp. No lingering resin, but when it's in your mouth it feels less like pine needles and more like pine brulee. One of the biggest differences  between this and other IIPAs is this mouthfeel. 
O: Worth waiting 2+ hours for even though I'm not the biggest fan of hoppy beers. Better than PtE, though I'd be interested in putting the best of Alpine or Societe up against it. The freshness of the can really shone through here and for the price (only $7!) I couldn't ask for much more. A great beer and a great beer experience. 1,550 charactersvig180, Mar 12, 2015

From the first sip, I noticed some very subtle pine and citrus, which developed into this beautiful buttery-toffee finish. It has sort of an organic mouthfeel which I really dig; could be the fact that it is unpasteurized and unfiltered. Just the right about of bitterness and unique hop flavor to make this extremely satisfying. Killer IPA. 374 charactersblockdude, Mar 09, 2015

4.95/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Poured half into a snifter to get a good look at it, left the other half to be consumed from the can as is suggested by The Alchemist.
A: Surprisingly light and rather clear in color, I expected it to be a little darker given the aroma when cracking the can (I don't really know why, just my mind at work I guess). Thin, light head that dissipates quickly.
S: The nose is very strong, indeed. Heavy pine and hops and a light floral note set a nice precedent for the rest of the experience.
T: I will have no problem agreeing that this is the cleanest, most well refined example of the style I have ever had. It is super fruity (grapefruit and other citrus fruit), and super hoppy. Not terribly complex, but it ends with a nice peppery spice. Everything is super bold and well defined. Simply beautiful.
F: Feels just heavy enough and features great carbonation. Certainly nothing bad here.
O: This one is pretty hard to sum up. I've been waiting a long time to try this beer, as have many others. I went into this knowing that realistic expectations would lead to an overall better experience. It's an absolutely fantastic beer, no doubt about it. I don't, however, feel I need to go crazy to obtain more. As great as it is, in the end it is simply another beer I guess. I just can't help but wonder, will the second can really feel as special? Super glad to be able to cross it off my list, though.
Oh, and just for the record, it's good out of the can AND a glass......but make sure it's cold! 1,501 charactersZebraCakez, Mar 08, 2015

Thick and very full bodied. Lacks citrus. Very crushable but this just lacks all the hoppy fruity qualities I want in a double IPA. It's a good beer but I guess I'm spoiled with west coast ipas.

A: did not pour entire can in so was pretty clear compared to pictures I've seen a little dirty straw with some haze 
S: light tropical fruit gives way to herbal smells with some earthiness and a light bread smell
T: very herbal with some earthy hoppiness it does have some light fruitiness it's fairly complex
M: wow does this have a nice creamy mouth on it so good
O: I'm disappointed after wanting to try this so bad I wouldn't consider this world class the mouthfeel is world class and while a tasty double IPA it's not as fruity or tropical as I would have liked it, it hints at fruit but it's a lot more earthy hops and herbal tasting. It is a very complex IPA, but I just have had so much better IPAs with less work.  That mouthfeel though wow. 793 charactersSomethingClever, Mar 06, 2015

Look: Hazy bright/light orange yellow. Said to drink out of the can, but nah. 
Smell: Somewhat musky, citrusy, heavy on the pine. 
Taste- Hops hit first, which cascade into an insanely well balanced hit of pine and citrus. Lots going on here with grapefruit and citrus. Hard to get a hold on because everything is so well balanced, but above all else- delicious. 
Feel- Dry finish with a medium body that leaves you wanting another sip
Overall- Had been looking for this for a few years now and was very excited to have a chance to try it out. I mentally prepared myself to combat the hype around it and try it objectively, which was difficult to do after the first sip because its so damn good. Hands down one of the best beers I've ever had. 769 charactersYeahRightt, Mar 05, 2015

A: 1) Metallic, silver with a guy who appears to have flaming hair. No light comes through. For some reason he's drinking from a glass when it says not to. 2) Golden, clear in appearance as I left the last 2-4oz in the can to drink separately.
S: 1) limited amount coming through, definitely grapefruit with some melon. 2) Much more open. Citrus, pine, grapefruit all come strong on the nose.
T: 1) Nice and clean, balanced flavor throughout each sip. Somewhat dank, a bit of tropical fruit pushing through. 2) More tropical fruit comes through from the glass
F: Nice medium carbonation and a dry finish. Comes across the same in the glass.
O: Excellent double IPA with great balance 784 characterschrisjws, Mar 04, 2015

4.45/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5I find it very unique. The only other DIPA similar that I have had that I can think of was Mastermind. Very murky/cloudy. Not overly hoppy or bitter. Somewhat subtle in the flavor department for what I expected, but very, very good. Orange, tropical fruits, herbs, earthy, wine like alcohol. Very crisp bite to it. Similar to Hill Farmstead beers in mouthfeel. Just different. I know, real helpful, but I dont think I can describe it with any justice. 
All of that being said, it is an outstanding beer that I will gladly drink any time, but there are several I feel are better. 579 charactersWesMantooth, Mar 04, 2015

Now the second time around.. It's 5-29-15,  my brother cracks a can open, I'm nervous, still a great beer but something was missing, not Gina put to much into it, I still believe it's world class, but I have now a whole bunch more west coast ipas and dipas under my belt and they are definitely right there with heady.  I rescored this drink cause I'm a little more critical with more experience.  Still a top 3 I'm my book. 577 charactersDynobolt, Mar 03, 2015

I am a relative noob, but I can recognize a truly great beer and this is definitely one!  Definitely worth the try-though if I'm being honest, I am more partial to Gandhi--but that could be a Connecticut bias;-) 451 characterskjmcc0729, Mar 03, 2015

The only bad thing was, this was the "mystery beer" and it was consumed after Pliny The Younger. While it was a very good beer, I believe it's slightly over-hyped. I'm a West Coast IPA guy, so that might also be why. This was good, not great. Both Plinys blow this beer out of the water. But, hey, I got to cross this one off my bucket list. Never thought I'd get this on the West Coast, and glad I did. 463 charactersssman4432, Mar 01, 2015

I poured about 2 ounces of this into a glass in order to rate it's appearance. The remaining beer was left in the can as requested by the brewer's notes.
This poured slightly more pale yellow than I expected, with a 1/2 inch white head that left strands of lace. 
The smell is of citrus fruit, tropical fruit and faint pine. 
The taste is bitter grapefruit, subtle tropical fruit sweetness followed by pine bitterness on the finish. 
The texture is medium bodied with medium carbonation. 
This is a very well balanced double IPA. Not a one-dimensional hop bomb by any means. World class without a doubt. 673 charactersFurlinator, Feb 22, 2015

4.29/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Pours a very hazy, cloudy and just plan murky. the color is burnish orange. The head produced was tall with sticky froth that leave plenty of lacing in my glass.
 The aroma is bursting with hops, and it should it's dry hopped. Lots of citrus and tropical notes like tangerines, pithy with pine and resiny dank freshness.
Very bold tasting with a sweet bitterness up front and then dries out to a smooth finish.
The hop flavor was more subtle then in the nose but in the taste i got some citrus and pine notes. Malts come to the fore front towards the end.
At the finish I can pick up some tropical fruits. The taste is also somewhat raw or wet.
A very good beer. Worthy to a point of all the praise and hype. 708 charactersmicromaniac129, Feb 17, 2015

Appearance, from what I saw from the others who poured theirs into cups, was orange-copper in color and topped with a huge head. The aroma was outstanding, citrus and tropical fruits, lots of pine, a little faint malt. Taste is slightly sweet with orange, pineapple, mango flavors. The bitterness comes mid palate featuring pine, citrus peel, and resin. Medium body, thick texture, moderate carbonation, dry bitter finish. Is it worth the Herculean measures to obtain? Maybe not, but a world-class DIPA. 564 charactersSierraFlight, Feb 12, 2015

4.82/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I don't think I have rated anything as high as this one. I honestly looked for defects in this as to not let the legacy of the beer sway my review and suck all objectivity out but damn, it really is worth every penny of hype it receives. What I look for in an IPA is balance. Typically when I get into DIPAs, I tend to relax my search for balance as it is typically replaced by too much sweetness or a touch too much heat (and that's in the best DIPAs I've had) The reason I believe that Heady deserves the critical acclaim is that it has re-written the rules so to speak, for me in approaching the DIPA. Yes, it CAN be well balanced and brilliant within the style. This one opens up with a great nose full of citrus AND pine somehow, without overwhelming on either. Taste follows identically until the sweetness in perfect harmony with the perfectly balanced malt backbone join in and combine every sensation together for one, again, very well balanced taste that finished with just a tiny touch of heat that reminds you that it is a DIPA. Full bodied, well balanced, pretty much every superlative that you can find in describing a great experience in drinking a beer belong here. 1,181 charactersgopens44, Feb 10, 2015

4.98/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I am spoiled to live in Vermont and have ready access to Heady. I think, these days, people hear 'Best in the World' and expect an out of body experience or something. This experience is entirely in the can. I'm sure there are other beers that are objectively as good. I doubt there are any better. This beer won't fix our national deficit, make dogs love cats, or bring back Jimi Hendrix. It will, however dance across the palate in an entertaining way. My advice is to open one and enjoy slowly from the can. The entire flavor profile changes as it warms. I am sure many people have tried Heady that was shipped to them. Getting this beer warm is like feeding a wet Mogwai after midnight. I shipped some to myself when I was on assignment in Texas. It was sent on a Saturday and I got it Monday. Was not the same beer I sent when it arrived. For anyone who has had it this way and reviewed it, I really don't think you got it the way it should be. Oh, and about the can vs glass debate... if you drink it slowly the later complexity is seriously diminished when its been poured into a glass. 1,093 charactersWalruzuma, Feb 09, 2015

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5It's been said time and time again that this beer is either the best that's ever been had or exceptionally overrated. I suppose the only way to rate it is to hearken back to my initial thought when I took my first sip-- "how did they fit all of my favorite flavors in this can?" It really is great. There are many either great beers that measure up, for sure. However, the more popular it becomes the harsher the ratings get. It is what it is, and that's an amazing beer to be enjoyed, not exalted or compared. It's in good company with many other greats that this country is producing.

This would fall within my top three DIPA's I have tasted. Has a great smell, color and taste and awesome finish. Not so sure about drinking it out of the can! I just prefer a snifter style glass versus the can. Only thing better than this beer is Patriots winning the Super Bowl! 354 charactersSpeckerman, Feb 06, 2015
4.64/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5I broke the rules poured from the can into a pint glass, oh no. First of all this is a really good IPA and I'm glad I drove to Vermont for it. Wonderful piney hop character and solid ABV at 8%. Very smooth too with great aromas and golden color. However I'm not so sure this is really the best IPA in the country. While it's certainly no run of the mill IPA I've had numerous IPAs that would compare to it or even be better. I'll agree with my man coffdaddy in his review, Jai Alai by Cigar City kicks its butt. And the directions were a bit excessive although I've had it from the can as well as a sniffer. 607 charactersbarfootbandit, Feb 06, 2015

4.86/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Okay, I've had a bunch of Heady since my initial review here. Since that one was less than 150 characters, let's do one tonight that counts. Can is roughly 2 weeks old. Thanks, Theresa! :)
Look: I've poured it into a glass before when sharing it, it looks okay. I generally drink it from the can. Can't ignore those capitol letters, right?
Smell: Mmmm! Floral, piney, citrusy, and that deliciously tropical Conan yeast. Even though this beer is rather different from Lawson's Sip of Sunshine, they're definitely brewed with the same, very estery yeast.
Taste: Yes! 100% deserving of the hype. I feel like I've been largely desensitized to bitterness with all these IPAs, but Heady definitely brings the IBUs here in a noticeable way. It's not to the extreme, but the bitterness pleasantly intermingles with the dank floral, piney, fruity hops; it's super drinkable, I have to repeatedly tell myself to slow down because, not only is this an 8% beer, it's a rare treat. Left to my own devices, I could definitely guzzle a can or two in a very short amount of time.
Feel: Fluffy with perfect carbonation. The only reason it's not a 5 is because I've had Double Citra by Hill Farmstead. That's what a perfect mouthfeel is like. That said, this is pretty close.
Overall: 1000% worthy of the hype, don't listen to anyone who says otherwise. Go on, make a pilgrimage to Waterbury. Heck, stay at the Stagecoach Inn, eat at Hen of the Woods, and make a weekend out of it. You won't be disappointed. 1,495 charactersOnemoresolo, Feb 06, 2015

While IPAs are certainly not my favorite style of beer (although I am becoming convert) this beer is amazing.
It's got all the great characteristics of the style that I love; oily mouth feel, fresh hoppy nose, creamy finish that fades to a refreshing tartness and drones that just welcomes another cool sip.
Generally, I am not a "hop head" so I really appreciate an IPA that does not blast me with bitterness. 532 charactersfritzboyle, Jan 26, 2015

4.53/5  rDev -2.6%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Gotta start with gratitude. Much love and big thanks to @Roguer for sending this one along in the BIF box I received. Awesome.
The pour is... just kidding! You don't pour Heady Topper! What do you take this for, some peons drink! It's silver! And black! Like the Raiders! But way better than the Raiders! Because the Raiders are terrible! 
Nah, since I'm such a rebel, I ignored Mr. Kimmich's pleas and poured a small amount into a glass, just so I could peak at what I was about to enjoy. A murky yellowish that turns greeny orange in the middle dense bits... Let's leave this one in the can as John suggests. Big bubbles fade to a patchwork of offwhite greenish accumulations. Lacing slithers back from whence it came.
The nose is at once floral and tropical mangos and softly nuanced. On first pop it's the florals and some light summer afternoons. Word. Tropical fruits sneak up on your olfactory like something that would sneak up really well and bring out the aforementioned mangos and orange and maybe some spice creeping in behind the shadow.  
Somewhere in the world between fiercely sweet and reassuringly bitter strength the vicissitudes of flavour this beer brings forth unrepentent pleasure. The parents of this beer are an oddly matched pair: the matron the sharply protective, unflinchingly polite hostess honey sweet matched with a quiet behemoth. His strength only matched by his compassion and the floral bitterness of tropical fruits, culminating in a resinous pine blended bitter finish. That's the most pretentious god damn description I've ever given. Damnit Vermont! Anyway, to summarize: great soft hops to start; floral and tropical and spicey and starkly sweet. Gets more bitter throughout finishing with a blend between the original and some more pine sap elements for a long finish that retains the best of all the above components. Carbonation is fineprint tiny pinpricks. Medium-well body, but trending closer to medium, which I'm all for. 
Is this the best beer out there? I don't know. Is it a damn good beer bottom line? Absolutely. If you stripped away the hype and did a true blind taste test, I don't know if it would consistently top everything ever, but it absolutely deserves the plaudits it receives as an incredibly drinkable amazingly delicious concoction. I consider myself lucky to have had this can sent my direction. Again, Roger, thank you thank you, you put the rest of us to shame ;) 2,435 characterskemoarps, Jan 25, 2015

4.91/5  rDev +5.6%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75One of the top rated beers ever and I finally go my hands on some thanks to Drizzew5! I wanted to truly see this beer so I did pour it; sorry Alchemist.
A - Beautiful vibrant apricot color (somewhere between bright yellow and orange). Extremely opaque capturing all of the light with tons of resin and dry hops. Very coarse white head and moderate lacing.
S - Great hop fragrance with a lot of everything that tropical flavored hops will give you. There is some orange, tropical fruit, pine, herbal, and maybe some light floral to bring together. Not as fragrant as Pliny but great aroma. 
T - Amazingly terrific hop flavor with a full on blast of tropical fruit hop deliciousness. At first it was difficult to distinguish any particular flavors from the complete overtaking of my taste-buds but eventually the candy sweet hops yielded great peach, apricot, and pineapple tones. There is also pine and citrus that makes this one of the best tasting beers ever! The bitterness is strong but really just compliments the flavors and helps cope with the candy-like flavors. I couldn't really taste anything other than hops. 
M - Medium to high mouth-feel with medium carbonation. It is thicker than some DIPAs and I really like the resiny character of this beer.
Overall, one of the best beers I've ever had. The tropical fruit flavors are just amazing and gives your mouth quite a ride. I would strongly recommend this beer if you can get it fresh! I prefer this over Pliny the elder but not over Permanent Funeral.

4.99/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I drank some from the can and poured the rest to see it. 
Appearance - This is the one area that took a hit for me. it has a golden opacity that glows with light present. The head was creamy as the name would suggest. The bubbles seemed to never end
Aroma - If I could give one aspect of this beer the highest notes, it would be the nose. It was intoxicating in and of itself. The floral bouquet dances and plays with your senses, letting you know something amazing is coming. It had small traces of fruits... maybe papaya, orange... The hops were just right
Taste - The initial flavour comes through strong and clean but not overpowering like some west coast ipas. You could tell that the flavour profile has taken time to craft. There were still some fruits coming through, but I think they are mainly ester-driven: some lemon, some cantaloupe or melon. The malt shows itself with is a big split from that west coast bite
Mouthfeel - creamy carbonation, with a smooth finish. It was pleasantly dry and popped off the back of the tongue.
Overall - Yes it lived up to the hype. 1,082 charactersCraigTravor, Jan 20, 2015
4.55/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75L - nice can, yellowish orange body, opaque, two finger head fades slowly
S - grapefruit, a sort of dry woody smell, malt, pine, floral
T - orange juice, medium sweetness, a little pine, hint of biscuit, clean tasting (no "weird" vegetal flavors, no onion, not very dank), perfectly balanced, definitely dominated by PNW rather than NZ hops, fairly bitter finish
F - medium to high carbonation, medium thickness, slight heat on the finish
O - This is an updated review after several years.  Much of what once made this beer unique has become common.  I don't think I could pick this out of a lineup of Grimm DIPAs, for example.  If anything, HT would be the most indistinct, which makes sense -- it helped to define a style, and now sits smack dab in the middle of that style. 780 characterscfalls, Jan 20, 2015

4.85/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Pours a clear golden color with some head that disappears rather quickly.
It smells like piney grapefruit.  It actually smells exactly like Victory's DirtWolf for anyone who has had that.
However, smell was where the similarities to DirtWolf end, as the grapefruit flavor isn't nearly as strong in the taste as it is in the flavor.  The piney hops are much more prominent, along with some other fruity flavors and bready malts.  They have managed to load up the hops on this one while still remaining a solid balance.
Goes down very smoothly with medium body and medium carbonation.
At first, I was kind of skeptical if Heady Topper could really live up to its rather large reputation, but after trying it I really was not disappointed.  Is it the best beer I've ever had?  Probably not.  But it is in the running. 818 charactersfps_dean, Jan 18, 2015

Enjoyed the rest from can. Smooth mouth feel. glides over your tongue leaving tiny bursts of hop bitterness. The back of the can describes it better than I can.

Did not pour so can not comment.
Smell.  I was overwhelmed it was such a strong orange smell followed by a pine scent.  If I could wear this smell as a cologne I would.
Taste. The hops hit me at first but settled down quickly.  Very balanced and very drinkable.
I am sad to say goodbye to Heady Topper but unless it falls from the sky I most likely not be tasting again which is too bad as this is a great beer and should be have a wider distribution. 641 characterswarrendietrich2001, Jan 18, 2015

L: Well, it looks great in the can because of the great art, but when poured out into the glass its very rustic, cloudy brew. I actually love when beer looks like this, and I think it perfectly embodies the New England style.
S: Sometimes I get fresh-cut grass, spruce or pine, and other times it smells like slicing into a grapefruit. 
T: Juicy citrus mouthful with piney notes. This is a super delicious beer, but you probably already knew that.
F: Ridiculous; the bitterness of this beer should be overwhelming but it's just so smooth on the front and backend. No booziness at all. Amazing carb, and a nice full mouthfeel, but also extremely drinkable. 
O: While it's not my personal favorite DIPA, this beer deserves to be in the conversation for the best in the world. It's revolutionary and nearly flawless. 941 charactersCayseyW, Jan 17, 2015

4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Can got provided by Steve, thank you very much!
Has a completely clouded orange-amber, peachy color with a decent, long staying, froth head.
Smells of grass, mixed with pine and dank, tropical fruits, foremost orange, nectarine and tangerin, due to the resinous maltiness.
Tastes much hoppier than the nose revealed, unleashing an hop onslaught on the palate from the very beginning, masterfully balanced by earthy white-bread malts, which receive a glazed accent, as the hops turn dry, parting from their grassy, slightly tropical initial direction. The fruitiness begins with ripe oranges, peach and tangerine, while more and more citrus peel gets added. While the malts are indeed capable of setting a counterpoint to the hops, they don't got an overly sweet character to them, more like a biscuity earthiness - just the right amount to prevent this brew from being hop water. Finishes with a dry, long lasting grapefruit bitterness, coming along with quite a bit of pine and a distinct maltiness. Drinks overly smooth, while ending with an enjoyable, almost herbaceous, bitter hop bite, developing from the fruitiness, without swallowing all of its sunny components. 1,173 charactersaleigator, Jan 16, 2015

S: IMO,the best part of this beer.  Fills the room with a resinous hop smell.  Lots of tropic fruit, and sweet malty  notes
T: pine, oranges, slight pineapple, and sweet malt.  
F: this is a soft and easy drinking brew to the palate.  Light carbonation
O: Had not tried Heady for quite some time.  It was nice to re try it the other day.  I knocked it down in rating a bit, but still a great beer. 482 characters-Rick, Jan 15, 2015

4.59/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Smell smells like a medicinal weed shop. First sip was from the can. Really dank hoppy taste. Really hoppy and no malts. Rest of the beer was poured into a glass. The pour was perfect. I didn't even need to aggressively pour into the glass. From the glass, the beautiful smell goes away but the taste of the beer is still the same. Still tastes hoppy but I wish it was alittle more sweeter. It is like a less malty pure hoppiness from alpine beer company.  Only two problems, one is that the carbonation goes away fast, second is that the finish falls flat. I think pure hoppiness is a lot better than this
P.s. I got a hop leaf in my can 639 charactersjooler, Jan 14, 2015

4.59/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance: pours a light honey color. a small half-finger to finger of a foamy white head with good retention and a solid lacing. completely hazy and opaque.
Smell: strong hoppy bouquet, notes of honeydew and other melons, papaya, orange, pine and bold hop resin. light lemon bread malt sweetness in the background. 
Taste: opens up with a flavorful but not over the top hop taste. first comes the fruits, mainly tropical but including orange, honeydew, cantaloupe. after the fruit it develops some pine taste. the malt backbone is barely there, giving a light lemon bread sweetness. Right at the end a strong bite of hop resin comes through.
Mouthfeel: medium bodied. bitterness is bold but not overly assertive and doesn't linger too long. slight dryness that adds to the refreshing qualities. strong drinkability.
Overall: needless to say a top notch beer. I don't think its my favorite DIPA but that isn't because it isn't a superbly crafted beer. And don't forget to drink it from the can. the taste is better than from a glass. 1,038 charactersSportsandJorts, Jan 13, 2015

The appearance of the beer is extremely cloudy, bordering on chunky.  Aroma is amazing with dank, piney, and fruity hops all interplaying with the yeast esters.  The flavor is a little bit coarse and unrefined, but super hoppy and delicious.  Body is fairly dry, appropriate to the style.  Overall, this is like a hoppy punch to the face! 419 charactersShamasUVA, Jan 11, 2015

Took the first sip from the can, as directed, but had to pour into a pint glass to rate.  Poured a hazy medium straw color.  Overwhelmingly wonderful aroma.  The taste was nice at first, maybe felt a little thin on the palate, but each sip got better.  Small head with minimal retention, light lacing.  This beer is all about the aroma and flavor.  Piney earthy aromas and flavors.  Very much a New England example of an American DIPA, in the same ballpark of the Gandhi Bot. Goes down very easy for an 8% beer.  If I could get this beer regularly, I would have it prominently featured in the regular rotation. 642 charactersKidDoc, Jan 10, 2015

Sculpin by Ballast Point was comparable, but Heady Topper had the most fragrant nose and ever-changing taste I have had the chance to experience. Worth the two and a half hour drive (one-way), for sure. Drinking out of the can, as recommended, I only noted its light, creamy yellow color towards the end. Very smooth, and definitely not the most bitter IPA (as they admitted on the can), but I would have to agree with the brewer; "sometimes I wish I could crawl into the can." 506 charactersDasBeanstalk, Jan 05, 2015

S: Sweet dank fruit. Orange, juicy melon, grapefruit and grapefruit rind, lemon, and crisp pine resins. Big juicy piles of hop and a very clean malt base. Simple and complex at the same time. All sorts of hop aromas weave together creating quite the mouthwatering situation.
T: Delightful layering of hop flavors on bready cereal malt. Very fresh. Grapefruit, melon, orange, lemon, pine forest, and mango. Bitter but the flavor trumps all. Pretty fantastic. I can see why people are so addicted to this stuff. It's beer candy.
M: Very juicy feel with resinous sticky qualities all over the place. Soft and swirlable. Clings to the buds. Body and carbonation levels are perfect.
O: This is one solid beer. Very pleasurable on the palate all over. For 8% this is impressively consumable. 928 characterstastybeer, Jan 04, 2015

3.47/5  rDev -25.4%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 3.5I have been a big fan of IPA beers for over a year and have sampled at least 15 of the top IPAs.  I finally made it up to Stowe for skiing and got a chance to try the famous Heady Topper.  I could not  have have been more disappointed.  There is nothing extraordinary about this IPA whether you drink from the can or pour in a glass.   Stone Enjoy By is by far much better than HT.  If you have gotten hands on that one, not need to hunt down HT at least in my opinion.
When I was growing up, Coors was only available west of the Mississippi River, which created this mystique about the beer.  When you finally got your hands on one, it was a disappointment as you can imagine.
I give the Alchemist team credit for the marketing behind HT but don't go out your way to get your hands on one - its just an above average IPA. 824 charactersRacatalano, Jan 02, 2015

4.96/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Worth the hype? Oh yeah! This is probably the best smelling and best tasting beer in its class I have ever had. 
Appearance: I drank two. 1 I poured into a glass (Which is not recommended and the second one I drank from the can as instructed to give it the full evaluation). Cloudy yellow not much red in this one but a bit. Decent amount of head that settled pretty quickly. 
Aroma: Holy hell this has the best nose of any IPA I have ever had! The only thing close is probably Sculpin. Earthy dankness some sandlewood notes, floral and some citrus fruits rind in there as well. Its amazing how much they put into the bouquet of this beer.
Taste: Here you go, this is the best IPA in the world, perfectly balanced IPA, not too bitter not too malty just perfect balance. Piney resinous hops dominate, but you also detect some citrus notes in there as well. I think this is just another perfect example of NE IPA's, its earthy. That is what we get from these, they are not bitter bombs like West Coast style IPA's but they are a category all of their own. This one I would describe as floral citrus fruit forward and a lot of dank earthiness going on as well.
Overall: Amazing experience. I wanted to end the old year with a bang and begin the second half of my journey after Pliny with something amazing, and I have! Thoroughly enjoyable beer and I would drink it as often as I could get it! 1,394 charactershumuloner22, Jan 01, 2015

S: very fruity. Lots of tropical fruits i get a lot of pineapple, then the resin/pine backend follows up.
T: where this beer reigns king. Incredibly juicy with tons of tropical fruits coming through, still has a great  hop/bitter bite with that "dankness to it. the aftertaste is amazing, and leaves the hop taste on your tongue. It's also incredibly drinkable with almost no taste of alcohol.  
F: carbonation is spot on and very refreshing. It has a bit of a sticky finish to it but that makes it awesome with that hop aftertaste
O:  Juicy balanced and some good hop bitterness. 642 charactersGinjaSlice, Dec 30, 2014

Beautiful looking beer with a great pillow-cap fluffy head that seemed to last quite awhile.  The aroma of lemony tangerines and grapefruit is delightful.  Real easy to drink, the 8% not noticeable, and the smoothness is ridiculous!  Tastes like the aroma but probably even better!  Also I enjoyed the lack of a bitter aftertaste.  To summarize; Heady Topper was the most wonderful and amazing IPA I have had to opportunity to try.  The hype is well deserved and all my expectations were met!  Well done indeed. 583 charactersdpgoblejr, Dec 30, 2014

A: I will update the appearance upon my next review (edit of). I plan on pouring my next one in a glass.
S: Had a very strong hoppy, citrusy, tropical-fruity smell up front. Also got some sweet(ness) notes intermingled in there as well.
T: Starts with citrus, moves to sweetness, then a light bitterness which gives way to more of a mild-to-medium level of bitterness. Left a nice balance of piney sweetness in mouth (aftertaste).
M: Had a light-to-medium body and a low level of carbonation.
O: Fantastically balanced. Not sure that I have tasted the level of complexity that this one offers between the smell and taste (from initial to aftertaste). 722 charactersembass, Dec 29, 2014

Looks:
The beer itself looks amazing in a glass,a very thick,non-clear unfiltered,straw colored beer,I like unfiltered:) as I poured into a dogfish head IPA glass is looked even better then I thought,the foamy heady grew and grew and stayed for days it seemed!
Smell:
As I opened the can,and heard that crack of it opening i was smiling ear to ear lol...
the smell is a strong hoppy hop field,with pine resins and more hops! easly the best beer Iv ever smelt! and although I love IPA's more then any other,and iv had some amazing ones before,the smell of this was notches above anything Iv ever had the chance to smell:)
Taste:
Right after smelling it I was so excited! this is the momment Iv been waiting for,for years lol...my dreams have been answered!
It says to drink from the can,I did try the first sip from the can and then gently poured it into a nice IPA glass,spent for mins smelling it! lol...
The first taste was heaven in a glass! the best tasting beer on earth? probably! 
Conclusions:
does it live up to the hype?
Oh fuck ya! the best smelling and tasting IPA iv ever had the privlege to try! it was well worth the wait! I drank a can last night without a glass,and out of the can I wouldnt rate it as good,I think this beer needs to be in a glass! 
Thanks to my wonderful and amazing girlfriend I now not only got to try the heady topper,I got a few extras as well! these cans are a day or 2 old from the brewery so im happy as can be,will be a great christmas:) 1,639 charactersbracelet666, Dec 24, 2014

Smells very earthy with nice hop aromas. Waves of flavors from sweet to citrus with a crisp dry finish and never wrecks your palette. I went out of may way to tried not to buy into the hype. But in the end it won me over, best beer I have ever tasted. 339 charactersDeshaies, Dec 24, 2014
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A brilliant, complex, and stunning DIPA on all accounts. Strong scent of pine, earth, floral aromas, and fragrant, fresh hops. The taste slams your palate against a hop wall that gives way to citrus, pine, peach, and genius hop flavor. These multiple flavors surf across the palate to settle into a lovely, magnificent finish. I'd compare the taste to a crashing hop wave that opens the palate with its startling, ingenious complexity. 
I recently was in Vermont to try this beer for the first time and ended up with two cases. Was going to sell some but can't fathom letting any go. Easily the best DIPA I've had and likely the best beer I've ever tasted. Believe the hype. This is magic in a can. Once I run out, I doubt I'll be able to return to any other DIPA. The bar has been set. 787 charactersredflamingolingo, Dec 24, 2014

A- Absolutely gorgeous beer! Somewhat cloudy yellow-orange pour with a fat, foamy off-white head that left a good bit of lacing down the glass.
S- Big citrusy smell like grapefruit coming to the forefront the most. A little resiny dankness as well
T- Citrus, piney bite, nice bitterness throughout with a good balance of malt.
M- Light-medium side with a slight prickly carbonation. 
O- Huge expectations with this. Honestly though, not the best DIPA I've ever had. A great beer, no doubt. I would always take it if available but not over EVERYTHING. 596 charactersJamesStreet, Dec 19, 2014

A. Wow. The most opaque IPA/APA I've ever seen.   Pours a tangerine color with a 2 finger head. I gotta say that opacity really strikes some curiosity. 
S. Smelling big citrus here.  Grapefruit predominantly. Little bit of malt sweetness that kinda reminds me of marshmallow.  The curiosity grows.
T. Wow this is good and complex.  Citrus right away with sweetness and a little bitterness then bam, a decent bitterness takeover. Leaves a grassy/piney aftertaste.  Makes me feel like I need more to refresh my palate. Which is OK cuz I'm enjoying it.  Very complex flavors going on here.  Maybe not totally balanced.  But it takes you for a ride through the palate spectrum.
M. Prickly that chases the swallow.  Light to medium body.  Finishes dry.
O. An awesome beer.  Especially if your in a bitter mood. Keeps you wanting more.  Mysterious to look at.  Aromas a very nice.  Glad I tried. Soon I will try out of the can and re-review. 1,068 charactersIPAGeorge, Dec 18, 2014

You want to know why? Because it tastes and smells like a fucking IPA. It doesn't taste like a glass of orange juice. It doesn't smell like a Bath and Body Works display counter. I repeat: It tastes and smells like a fucking IPA. Sure, there are some really nice mango notes in the nose, a touch of dankness too. Sure, the palate has some tropical fruits, some clean, well-done malt, and an excellent level of bitterness to ground the brew. But this is a sum of all parts beer -- all the pieces work together to create, well, an IPA. Heavy is the Heady that wears the crown, but it's still the jewel of the NE. 721 charactersbreadwinner, Dec 16, 2014

4/5  rDev -14%Happy to try this for a second time - many thanks to a generous colleague. 
Must say that I only partially deviated from the instructions on the can and poured a bit of this into a tasting glass to get a look at it. Delightfully unfiltered, hazy, and slightly orange. Looks like a great rustic farmhouse ale. Befitting its Vermont origins, I think.
Ruby-red grapefruit predominates in the nose. A little pine, a little lemon peel, but mostly delightful grapefruit. Smooth and relatively lightly carbonated from the can. Very little indication of the ABV, but the grapefruit continues, balanced by a moderate malty sweetness. It might be my imagination, but the body reminds me of a bier de mars, made with a touch of oatmeal. Finish is dry and hoppy, but not so overwhelmingly dry or bitter that it completely overwhelms. 
Is this balanced? No, not really. Is it drinkable? Quite so. Does it live up to the hype? I answer this with a question: could it ever have lived up to the hype? Scarcity breeds demand, demand breeds desire, and desire feeds hype. And what is hype but the unrealized hopes and expectations of a wonderful experience for delighted beer enthusiasts? There is no denying that this a great beer. I prefer to leave it at that. 1,247 charactersB-J-B, Dec 13, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%Just joined BA so I rating all the beers I love.
Heady topper... It's a 5 
Even though I'm tired of it. I took a break recently for 6 months and my nephews coming to visit so I got him a case since he likes to trade and I had one. It made me remember what a great beer it is.
It's sold at 4 places within 3 miles from me so I just don't buy it anymore... But it's great 372 charactersBadliverglen, Dec 10, 2014

16 oz can, highball glass
A – Bright, but slightly darker orange, with lemon yellow highlights.  Creamy white head, about a centimeter tall, with very high retention.
S – Tons of grapefruit and very clear mango aromas.  Incredibly high hopping.  Resiny scents shine through next, especially while the beer is still in the can (as they indicate it would.)  Some slightly doughy malt is present, but the hops are the star.
T – Grapefruit is very high, and the mango is present but much more mild than in the aroma.  Again, some bread dough.
M – Very well carbonated, creamy and bitter, and very well balanced.  Incredibly refreshing.
O – Obviously this beer’s reputation precedes it, and it’s hard to drink it without that in mind.  Regardless, this is an incredibly well-made Double IPA, that I would love to drink over and over again, if only I could get my hands on a supply.  Best beer in the world?  That’s debatable, but it is definitely fantastic. 992 charactersinfinitebruner, Dec 04, 2014

Pretty epic. Taste follows the nose to a T. It's an explosion of hops, starting sweet and fruity and slowly building bitterness the more you drink it. Worth the hype? I think so. Is it the best beer in the world I ever had? I don't know, but its right up there and damn close. Glad I got my hands on it. 414 charactersDan269605, Dec 03, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%My only gripe is the whole drink from a can...I'm not buying that. However, this is by far and above my favorite beer to date. The perfect balance of hops and malt for my palate. Although hop forward, there isn't that strange aftertaste associated with some overtly hoppy beers. The alcohol seems non-existent. Notes and tastes of citrus (grapefruit in particular) meet a creamy and well-rounded pine. 401 charactersrynegne, Dec 03, 2014

Best in the world?... to hard to quantify but this beer pushes perfection. I will say, I had two cans shipped to me, had the first out of a can and the second out of a glass (because I like to look my beer in the eyes while I sip it) it was better out of the can, though I also had it 3 weeks fresher from the can. Somehow this beer manages to have a serious hop punch that still feels balanced. 491 characterscambabeer, Nov 28, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +2.2%Are you kidding? This is the nectar of the beer Gods. The hype is real, my expectations have been met and exceeded. If you want a breakdown of the subtle nuances, look at all the other reviews. This was 6 or 7 day old beer, and if you are lucky like me and get 4 of them, by all means drink it from the can as recommend, when poured into a glass the flavor seemed diminished. Enjoyed!! 385 charactersBeglane, Nov 24, 2014
4.8/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Would I stand for several hours in line hoping to grab a case of the highly sought after The Alchemist#HeadyTopper... No! However, this imperial IPA may be one of the best IPAs I have tried from the Northeast. The  aroma reminds me of fresh squeezed orange juice & the  palate is an assassination of hops! Grapefruit, orange, mango, lemongrass & fresh resinous marijuana. This IPA's personality is vibrant, flavorful, assertive and bone dry. But somehow, the danky aroma & the aggressive bitterness find a way to coexist as one. If a friend or someone offers one up.. Take it because it worth trying and experiencing. #craftbeer 628 characterswrogers19971, Nov 24, 2014

Pours a hazy, golden straw color. Outer edge is a pale straw, with more golden orange dominating in the center. Lighter colored than I was expecting. Fluffy white head that lingers slightly. Excellent lacing. 
Smell is so forward with juicy hops. Lots of citrus:  orange and grapefruit dominate. Slight minty smell coming through as well as a good herbal, almost medicinal notes. Great enticing IPA smell.
Taste is gushing with fresh oranges right up front. Amazing hop bitterness. The flavors dance in and out with a huge lingering flavor of citrus and herbs. Orange blossom, lemongrass, other earthy undertones. Slight astringency and alcohol burn, but it somehow only amplifies the hop bitter flavors. Resin begins to dominate on the finish. Man does this beer linger on the palatte. Sticky,piney resin and woody, cedary, chewy hops mellow out as the finish continues to linger.
The mouthfeel is a flash of crisp citrus right up front, but quickly fades into something that I can only compare to a mix between a creamy belgian wit and pulpy orange juice. Probably my least favorite part of the beer so  far.
Overall I have to thank a Friend for just gifting me this beer. He knew I was into good beer and has family at The Alchemist. He asked if I had heard of Heady Topper, then asked if I wanted some that they had brought down for Thanksgiving. Aways grateful for some southern hospitality. 1,532 charactersBigRedDog, Nov 23, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +2.2%Its the complete package.  Had my first can last night at One Mile House which they were serving for their anniversary.  Actually ordered a Maine Lunch first upon seeing it on their extensive beer list. They have it on tap. After taking my first sip I noticed the guy next to me drinking a Heady Topper out of the unmistakable can. I was shocked and immediately order one - now double fisting a heady topper and a main lunch.  The rest is between me and my taste buds, but all of the accolades here are spot on. 511 charactersjazzface78, Nov 21, 2014

Thanks Chad!
Poured a honey, orange, hazy color with two fingers of off-white, frothy head. Sporadic foamy lacing on the sides of the glass. Great retention on the top all the way down. (Sight - 4.00)
Smelled potent juicy hops from the get go. Got Citra hops, tropical hops, juicy peaches, tangerine, nectarine, Ruby Red grapefruit , orange, floral hops, pine, mango juice, caramel, passion fruit, slight pineapple juice and faint wet Cascade hops. Pretty damn good on the nose. (Smell - 4.75)
Taste wasn’t quite as good as the nose, but still pretty great. Got tropical hops, passion fruit, grapefruit juice, mango, pineapple juice, Citra hops, nectarine, peaches, tangerine, caramel and astringent bitter finish. Felt like I could taste pulp it was so thick. A bit boozy late. (Taste - 4.50)
Medium body. Creamy texture. Average-to-lively carbonation. Abrupt, fruity, refreshing finish, but bitterness lasts for some time on the tongue after. (Feel - 4.50)
So glad I got a chance to try this one. One of the best IIPA’s I’ve had. (Overall  - 4.50)

The bitterness does not destroy your tastebuds like most DIPAs and the taste is fantastic.

Your goodness I now deprived
Last of my splendid ale
Hazy,  foamy, yet  pale.
Thine lacing be most thick 
But never fading soon or quick.
With head, bold as  cream
caps this beer of mine dream.
Smells rich of hop and flower,
Within this beer doth tower,
With potency unknown
till confused drinker stumbles home.
Thine experience smooth,
For my gentle palate thou soothe.
Note of peach so strong
Thou make the ales tasteful song.
Can of silver thou shine
When opened; aromas slow time
Thine embrace of hops I recommend
For your can: a gift gods did send.
So yah, it's that good. 605 charactersHaydn-Juby, Nov 16, 2014

I'll keep it short. 
Moderate copper color with a frothy egg shell head.  Out of the can smell of resin to pineapple to a light malt base. The taste follows with sharp bite of pine hops. Next is a light malt base, sharp pine, with a strong resin finish. 
Damn good beer. Glad to try. This was more resin/pine profile than expected. 400 charactersmacher0, Oct 31, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +2.2%As we all know this beer is incredibly hard to get your hands on.  I had this in college a few years back when I didn't truly appreciate good beers.  I was fortunate that my local bar in Brooklyn got some for an event and I (overpaid) got a few.  
A--Out of the can as directed
S--Hops galore, super dank.  Oranges and grapefruit
T--super bitter but incredibly well balanced.  The hops are present throughout but never overwhelmed.  I love my hops but I would guess someone who isn't the typical hophead could enjoy this.  I dont think other DIPAs could say this.
M--This is where Heady gets it done.  So smooth--creamy, yes, but just the appropriate amount.
O--The hype is real.  I was planning on making a trip up to Vermont soon and even though I had  a couple in NYC I still plan on it.  Its an experience that every beer drinker should enjoy.  I know some will downgrade based on its cult-like following and limited accessibility but seriously this is the best IIPA I've tasted--I cannot compare it to Lawsons or Pliny though as I haven't had the chance yet to try them. 1,075 charactersTbub18, Oct 31, 2014

S – Very pungent piney, citrusy aroma. Pineapple, over ripe fruit, hop forward.
T – Taste does not disappoint, again straight forward hops, no crystal malt, very dry. The amount of hop taste The Alchemist actually gets is very impressive. 
M – Mouthfeel fills your mouth, lively carbonation with an abrupt bitterness finish, quite oily 
O – The amount of hop taste The Alchemist actually gets is very impressive, the aroma, especially if you smell out of the can is very very intense, but the taste completely mimics it. 572 characterssimont1, Oct 30, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%Let me start this review by saying: it's been a long time coming and much anticipated to finally get my hands on this gem!!!!  
LOOK: silver and black (absolutely spectacular)
SMELL: blown away, by far the best smelling DIPA I have ever been in the same room with.  pine bark, pine sap, pine needles, pineapple, tangerine, orange,  mango, earth, biscuits, fresh baked bread, christmas trees, fresh air, pennies, dank as fuq, there is a big, giant, humungous nose on this beer.
TASTE:  this is truly the definition of a hop bomb.  It's pine needles, pine sap, pine bark, tangerine, orange, pine sap, hop resin, definitely unfiltered, raw yet smooth, sweet, exact replica of the aroma, very fun to drink as you make your way down the can the flavors bounce around from sip to sip.  simply genius, i finished this first Heady topper in about 13 mins and i don't regret a single impatient moment.
MOUTHFEEL:  creamy, buttery, prickly, calm, very medium bodied, goes down easy and hangs out for a bit after you are done...
OVERALL: I Highly recommend this beer, there is a reason it is #1 in the country.  Self explanatory, if you are researching this beer, then you already know.  Its worth whatever it takes to get your hands on it.  brilliant, simply brilliant! 1,264 charactersbeerded_drunk, Oct 23, 2014

Poured a hazy straw color with a thick head of creamy foam.
The aroma was grapefruit and floral hops.  And hops, And more hops.  Wow.
Flavor is grapefruit rind and floral hops which almost, but not quite, hide the malt .  Hop bitterness that lingers through the finish.  Not a beer to be quickly quaffed.
Body was medium with a ton of hop resins left behind to coat my mouth.  Its rare that I've tasted this much lingering hop presence.  Maybe only on some of the Green Flash beers.
Overall, this is a great DIPA.  Definitely deserves to be in the conversation of my top beers. 735 charactersmr-jj, Oct 21, 2014

Smell is unlimited sweet citrusy hops. So incredibly sweet on the nose. Like hoppy candy. The taste is awesome. Great bursts of citrusy west coast hops but also a good bit of pine. Surprisingly balanced in terms of hop profile. Mouthfeel is pretty standard of a DIPA. Smooth and well carbonated. Overall this is such a great beer. Maybe not the greatest beer of all time but defimtiely something I wish I could keep in my fridge at all times. 541 charactersILMbrew, Oct 19, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +2.2%Huge beer with an enticing nose and massive, complex flavor. Ignoring the print around the top of the can, "Drink From the Can," I poured this into my usual tasting glass and enjoyed the soft aromas of bitter orange, sweet malt and citrus, with spicy and earthy notes. The flavor was intriguing and seemed perfectly balanced.
Tasting from the can I noticed more of a tingle and an edgier hop nose that settled down as it sat.
Is it worth all the hype? The Alchemist is brewing a great beer but I think the limited availability bolsters the mystique. Still, it is one heck of a delicious American Double IPA. 609 charactersTheBrewologist, Oct 19, 2014

And nobody can because the alchemist made the prototype east coast IPA before anyone else could beat them to it. Massive juicy citrus hops all up in your face. Hazy and beautifully bright golden in appearance. Mouthfeel is superb, very soft but still really well carbonated. Lacks the bitter dank finish of west coast styles but that's why people love it. Get your hands on a heady and your taste buds will be rewarded. 487 charactersdd43, Oct 17, 2014

No date that I can see -- but purchased a week ago today, and flown home in a friend's luggage. Another gift from him that elicited a nerdy gasp of delight when I found it on my desk.
Pours hazy golden with a perfect inch of surprisingly coarse head that stays standing for some time, and relaxes more than fades. Smell is excellent, beautiful bright floral and citrus notes with a strong pine note, clean fresh hop aroma (I'm not sure I've ever smelled a beer that smelled this similar to actual living hops).
Taste is so hop forward. Delightfully so. Resin, intensified grapefruit rind, pine, just enough honeysuckle and tangerine sweetness to balance. Bitter finish is ridiculously long.
Mouthfeel is thick and filmy, but the film is delicious. Overall, unsurprisingly, this is on my short list of best beers I've ever tasted. I would love to do a side by side comparison with some of the others. 970 characterssnaotheus, Oct 16, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -3.2%After driving all day through winding Vermont by-roads with my wife (she wasn't a problem, but endless construction was) and waiting in a long-ass line at Beverage Baron, you bet I was going to pour this into a glass.  I could smell tangy hops as soon as I cracked the can, which was a good sign.
Looks an awful lot like a hefeweizen of some sort, with a nice, even cloudiness. Great head retention and gloppy lacing down the glass.  I broke out my rather old Humble Patience 20oz nonic glass, for some Vermont nostalgia.
Really nice resinous hop aroma.  Very floral with some fruity malt esters mingling well.
I've had a lot of big IPA in my day, but this one is pretty singular.  It's neither too oily, too malty, or too hoppy.  It has almost an orange juice sweet n' tangy thing going up front, with a surprisingly creamy mouthfeel that somehow makes me think of milk or a rootbeer float.  The carbonation is perfect.  The brew is very hop forward of course, but in an unusually gentle, somehow elegant way.  Sweetness is always there, but somehow hops are presented and showcased throughout the entire sip without ever being shocking or abrasive.  There's a lot of juiciness in the finish, with a really pleasant citric/resin hop scent wafting up into my sinuses.  It's a big beer, but has such an impossibly mellow demeanor that you can easily forget you're drinking an 8% beer.
I had more than a little pessimism about how good this beer really is, mostly attributing the hype to scarcity and mythology, but it really is pretty outstanding.  I was skeptical about Westy 12 when it ruled the roost, and was largely let down, but I think the reviews are accurate in this case.  I don't think I'd drive 8 hours round trip to wait in line at a specific time to buy it again, but it is worthy of the hype.
Of all the beer styles in the world, a double IPA is one that I'd never expect to call gentle and smooth, but this one certainly is.  My only complaint is a touch of alcohol heat, especially on the first sip.  It creates a dissonant tone after such a perfect first experience.  Its not very bothersome, and I don't even notice it halfway through the beer, but it was a bit of an off note after a surprisingly great first sip.  After drinking this beer, I have a new perspective on double IPA, and I'm realizing that there's a lot of really bad ones out there.  For me, it's sort of like the first time I heard Metallica's Master of Puppets album at age 11-12.  I realized that most of the other heavy metal I thought I liked was absolute garbage or at least not as good as I thought it was. 2,602 charactersUnionMade, Oct 14, 2014

Gotta say, the 5 stands.  This beer is soooo good.  Immediately after finishing the last one, I was scheming on how I could get some more.  The beer is very hazy in color, golden almost.  Smells like a helicopter crashed in a gigantic field of hops and the blades spun around for 10 minutes.  Taste is so unique:  You do, as the can says, get wave after wave of hop flavor washing over your palate.  Man, it is so delish.  Feel is also fantastic.  I can't wait to get me some more of this. 620 charactersChcshammonde, Oct 14, 2014

A: well... its in a can, and while i may look like superman.. i sadly do not have x Ray vision... however i have poured this in a glass and personally i love the unfiltered hazy orange yellow look. Lets me know its about to go down.
S:  Blast to the nostrils. Fruits, peach and orange and nectarine. Pine also and extremely floral. amazing Nose on this.
T:  Perfection at what it is. Balanced with that malty sweet frutiness, bitter finish.
F: amazing coating, not too carbonated to give you a creamy feel, and the flavor lingers well after it its gone.
O: There is a reason this is one of the best. Even with all the new young studs this still holds it down.  Is this the best DIPA ive ever had, no. But it surely is one of them and worthy of such high praise. 
Side note: I now reside in California and get fresh Pliny whenever i want and it cannot hold a candle to Heady IMO. I can get bored of Pliny, and im always "Ready for a Heady" 1,141 charactersHop_God, Oct 13, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%On a trip up north to Vermont I realized I was in Heady topper country.  I honestly wanted not to like this beer based on the fact everybody likes it.  I thought the limited access was the majority of the reason it was so desirable.   Expecting a normal IPA with some deviations I can say I was dead wrong.   It was like nothing else I've had before but so familiar to my favorite hoppy IPA style.   I was a little unsettled about drinking it out if the can but got used to it after the third one.    The first thing I did was smell the hoppy aroma which was great. The beer was excellent, a dank, hoppy, piney, citrusy IPA with a more heavy mouthfeel.  Very complex   If I could buy this I would always have a 4 pack in my fridge.  But I'm from NY and the beer doesn't travel far. I tried 5 or 6 different stores the alchemist website states it delivers to and all the stores sell out in hours to a single day.   A bartender hooked me up with two cans after a couple of hours of drinking and chatting.   It's not easy to obtain this brew making me want it more.   The two in my fridge are killing me right now     I'll be sure to give one to a real beer guy friend who knows his hops and has been around the beer isles.  This will not be wasted on a bud light drinker I promise 1,278 charactersrussell157, Oct 08, 2014

3/5  rDev -35.5%Well I finally had a chance to try the infamous Heady Topper. A friend was working in Vermont and came across a 4 pak at, of all places, a gas station convenience store. Well, with great anticipation, we sat down at my home bar, popped the top on a can and away we went. First thing to hit you was the aroma. Piney, hoppy. And that's where it ended for me. This beer is better suited to be an air freshener than a drink. I was sitting there tasting what in my opinion is way over the top flavor finished with bitterness. I just don't see what all the fuss is about. With all of the thousands of beers in the world this is the # 1? Not a chance. In the end I felt like a kid who got a beautifully wrapped gift only to discover a bag of sox or underwear inside. What a bummer. 774 charactersAvool1960, Oct 04, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%This beer is so unique and exceptional that it's hard for me to figure out how it was concocted.
A - RUSTIC......cloudy, unfiltered, dark orange hue, glows like the sun when held up to the light.
S - Explosive dank weed and grapefruit......hops that must have been found in another world....unique in every way....never smelled or tasted anything like Heady. 
T - Dank weedy citrus upfront following the smell but the hop explosion is ridiculous. I recall thinking of other easy to find IPAs being explosive in taste and smell and when I had Heady for the first time and returned to the beers I've had before it ruined what I thought was once complex. 
M - immediate dankness, carbonation and hop explosion that I can only describe as hoppy pop rock grapefruit earthy soil weedy candy in the mouth that lasts for minutes.  If you're a wine drinker think high end $100 bottles napa cabernet lingering explosion.  This beer changed what I thought a beer could be. 
Danger - my new category that I created on my own.  Danger is when you have an 8% beer that at first sip you feel like one pint will be just plenty but as you continue to drink you want to sip more frequently and more frequently and the alcohol is so well hidden by the mesh of flavor and mouthfeel that you continue to drink and go back for more until your night is over. Most 8% beers let you know when enough is enough.  Heady does not. That's how you get notoriety apparently;)
O - is it the best hoppy ale on the planet?  From my experience some days yes and some days top five.  Abner certainly is right there, Lawsons too...harder to get and I recall a side by side on draft where i preferred Abner but there's something about scoring those 4 pack cans and bringing them home.  Heady is not for beginners in some cases but if you like hops this one will blow your stack.....I'll end by saying that this is the most dangerously drinkable 8% beer I've ever had. 1,935 charactersHopDeezy, Oct 04, 2014

4.75/5  rDev +2.2%A quick review as I didn't take tasting notes and had a few days ago.  Drank from a 16 ounce can poured into a pint beer glass and drank with friends after a 10K race.
I loved it... understand that.  But my underlying belief came true:  more hype than anything else.  It is an extremely good double IPA, but there are others out there (Breckenridge 571?) that I've also enjoyed thoroughly.  
Great citrusy (grapefruit?) overtones, but as one friend put it, a bit sweet.
If I get to Vermont this winter and can call a liquor store to reserve a case, I'll certainly pick some up.  However, I won't be skipping a morning's skiing to drive from store to store to see if they happened to have gotten any in overnight and if they happen to have any left (which is what I've been told I'll have to do).  Too many other quality beers out there that I won't have to jump through hoops of fire to get my hands on. 906 charactersjman42, Sep 30, 2014

Once when it was ranked #3 back in 2011 or 2012 when I was still a novice beer drinker and had no idea what  dIPA beer was or how it was suppose to taste. Now after trying  over 200+ beers I would say my taste for beer has developed alot more esp. enjoying Sours, IPAS, and any stouts barrel  aged I cam to appreciate this beer much more. Loved the aromas and taste of all the hops and flavors delivered from 
start to finish. Cheers to Heady-topper 513 charactersdanhahm, Sep 30, 2014

Deep golden color; cloudy (opaque); rich creamy white head with thin lacing on the sides of

Smell:  Mild hoppy aroma, slight amount of malt and citrus.  Smelled delicious and rich.
Taste:  Delicious mild hoppy taste, some malt flavor and some citrus/acidic flavor.  Very nice.
Feel:  Medium body.  Rich, substantial and velvety feel.  Medium, but smooth, carbonation.
Starts off smooth then progresses to slight tingle from the carbonation and ends with a 
slightly dry finish.
Overall one of the best IPA that I have ever had.  Delicious.  I could drink this over and over

4.75/5  rDev +2.2%Heady is delicious - no doubt about it. I wouldn't say it lives up to the hype like Double Sunshine or Abner, but it's definitely not a disappointment either. I'm drinking my 8th can as I type this FYI.
Pours a perfect orange-peach color if poured (I prefer it in a tulip) with 1 finger head if poured carefully. lacing on the glass is thorough - lots of foam left when done.
The smell is bright, juicy, and citrusy with lots of melon, mango, and other tropical fruits. Surprisingly little grapefruit, and next to no pine/grassy.
Taste follows the nose. Delicious as I said, and a combination of cantaloupe, mango, and guava, with incredibly smooth bitterness on the back end. I get something slightly sharp - you might call it onion if you think hard about it, but it's a nice balance to the fruit. Very little in the way of malts on the taste. I do get a little alcohol - especially in older cans (month+). It's not an issue - , and far less than in a DFH 90min. This is a  juicy, fruity hop bomb. Awesome.
It's also perfectly carbonated, although it's slightly more syrupy than I prefer. It coats your mouth and takes a minute to disperse. Again, not an issue, but slightly more than I prefer.
Heady is close to a perfect double IPA - but it's still a solid notch down from the best offered by HIll and Lawsons. Still a delicious beer and for the price it's tough to beat ($4/16oz can).
My biggest knock on Heady is the Alchemist's attempt at keeping it exclusive and hard to find. I've visited liquor stores that had plenty of Heady, but couldn't sell me any due to agreements to only sell it on specific days. It's a pain, but visit the Alchemists website and go to the stores recommended on the days recommended and you'll have no problem buying as much Heady as you can afford. I've always found as much as I wanted without an issue. 1,846 charactersRichKent, Sep 28, 2014

3.1/5  rDev -33.3%look: 3 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 3.75 |  overall: 3At the time of this review, Heady topper is ranked on Beer Advocate as the best beer in the world.  I was up at Stowe in Vermont for a british car show and found a bar that served this infamous beer on tap. Overall, if I didn't know this beer was so highly ranked, I would have thought Its alright, but not memorable in the least. If anything, all the flavors are very well balanced. The only decreeable flavor i could pick out was mandarin orange. I think this would be a nice session beer, but this is absolutely not a memorable beer. For all the hype, this was a letdown as there's nothing memorable, special or unique about it. FWIW, I'm also not really an IPA guy. 669 charactersTheRossness, Sep 25, 2014

It needs to be enjoyed with complete awareness and yet total relaxation, in the fullness of time, each sip a journey to an exotic Roger Dean-esque alien landscape, where you sit beneath a strangely geometric tree, listening to the far-off flesh-eating birds chirping, and think, "This couldn't get any weirder. Well, maybe if I were tripping, too." 388 characterssquarooticus, Sep 24, 2014

The hop aroma and flavor are fresh, bright and juicy.  The bitterness is about perfect.  But to me it's that mouthfeel that is most distinctive.  Well, that and the large amount of beautiful yeast sediment that you can culture from any can. 321 charactersZrings, Sep 23, 2014

4.53/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75First sampled Sept 2014 at The Reservoir in Waterbury, VT as part of an epic flight* (Heady, Edward, Sip of Sunshine, and Conehead); revisited today (April 3 2015) courtesy of a trade with one of our local ski club members who had the presence of mind to buy a CASE while he was up that way.
No idea what this beer looks like since I followed directions and drank it from the can.  This is not the biggest DIPA I've ever had, nor is it a hop bomb. It is, of course, quite hoppy and has some alcohol presence, but the overall impression is that everything works together extremely well.  Very smooth and easy to drink.  This is a brew that makes me want to live in Vermont, and I hate winter.  
* True confession: I thought Sip of Sunshine was the best of the flight. 768 charactersdbl_delta, Sep 22, 2014

3.97/5  rDev -14.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A good but overrated DIPA.  Good hops profile and a solid malt backbone but nothing about it was overly impressive.  As has been said in many other BA reviews before, I've had better IPAs and DIPAs.  Maybe the cans I have aren't the freshest?  Honestly, if it had a wide distribution I believe this beer would drop out of the top 10 on the BA 250.  Does anybody remember Westy 12 being #1 a couple years ago?  After their 12/12/12 release in the US that beer has steadily moved down to #12.  I certainly won't seek out Heady again unless it's straight from the brewery.
Had another chance to drink Heady.  This time I was assured that the beer was fresh.  It was picked up from the brewery about two weeks before I drank it.  My opinion hasn't changed.  I just don't see what's all that great about this beer.  It has a good hop profile but I can think of five IPAs off the top of my head I like better.  I think I'll put this one to rest. 940 charactersELS, Sep 21, 2014

I think they had allowed it to get warm which affected the taste. I then took a trip to Vermont and headed straight for Waterbury.  I thought it would be easy to find once I got to the home town but I may as well have been in California. I struck gold at the best Western hotel I stayed at because their cafe had some in stock.  I did end up finding some to bring home after following multiple leeds taking me to multiple towns. 574 charactersRancidAggro, Sep 18, 2014

Looks hazy orange, a big two finger fluffy head that recedes to half-a-finger and stays like that for a longer while, with lots of traces on the glass.
Layers upon layers of hops straight from the smell, getting big citrus (grapefruit, blood orange, tangerine), also big tropical notes (mango, maracuja), but also strong pine and strong leafy hops. Light pale malts, nothing to concentrate on there.
From the get go, truckloads of hops, but not the most "painful" bitterness, just a ton of flavor. Begins with bitter sweet blood oranges, grapefruit peel, some tangerines too, peach, easing into tropical fruit with pineapple, juicy mango and maracuja. Big floral note, hinting honey, but more like sweet petals, closer to, say.. orange blossom water. The "green" part of the hops dominate the finish with pine resin, concentrated hop oils, Sweet Kush dankness, making up a big bitterness that doesn't erase all the previous flavors.
The aftertaste is hoppy, also leaving a bit of room for the grainy/bready malts. Low carbonation, medium body, incredibly smooth. No time to detect any alcohol.
It's so tasty that you don't even realise it's over so fast. Drinking it from the can tilted the balance more towards leafiness for me. Incredible show of hops. This time, do believe the hype! 1,355 charactersdcmchew, Sep 16, 2014

In the cans that were less than remarkable, I observed what I think is an usual amount of air space between the top of the can and the top of the beer inside the can.  In terms of volume, it was approximately a 1 ounce void in a 16 ounce can. In these cans the bottom of the tab, once opened, barely touched the top of the beer.  I found myself wondering if this air space contributed to off flavors, mainly because the cans I thought tasted amazing were full of beer - no air void in the can. It's a solid beer and it's fun to stand in line for it, but each time I head to VT I find myself more impressed with other VT offerings and less impressed with Heady. 754 charactersGeomarly, Sep 14, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%I'll preface this by saying I was incredibly skeptical of this beer. I was in Vermont and couldn't pass it up. Everyone kept telling me it was the greatest thing ever, all I could think was "yeah right don't buy the hype." Now I know that no amount of hype can do justice to this beer.
Appearance: Had it straight from the can as directed. Honestly not a huge fan of the can artwork.
Smell: Very fruity, I picked up faint earth scents. Like being in an orange grove on a dewy morning with bits of soil clumping to your shoes.
Taste: The fruit smell flowed into the taste, but the taste was complemented with a pleasant hoppiness and grass-like flavor. Dry but not overwhelmingly so. Hints of so many things yet nothing dominated.
Mouthfeel: Smooth with enough carbonation to know you're still drinking a beer.
Overall: Someone outside of Stowe told me that people have been known to hide out by the brewery and tail delivery trucks while they make their runs. If I lived in Vermont I'd do the same. 1,003 charactersClarenceClawmons, Sep 14, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%WOW Fantastic.
A - N/A since it's in a can and should stay that way.
S - Citrus, Passion Fruit, Mango, Pineapple, And of course HOPS
T - Sooooo smooth for a DIPA. Scary smooth. You can chug this it is so crisp. I'm having a hard time putting the can down just to do this review. OMG on a Hot day after mowing the grass this would be soooo good. You taste the citrus and the Hop balance. Very little malty flavor. 
M - Smooth and dry. Just the right amount of carbonation.
O - I can finally mark this off my Holy Grail of beers to try. Got 2 cans via my first trade here on BA. Now i need to find out how to get this in Pittsburgh more often. If you have a chance to get this and try it you have to or you will regret it. 727 charactersSlayer213, Sep 08, 2014

4.72/5  rDev +1.5%Case purchased 8/8/14 at Hunger Mountain Co-Op. Gave away half, drank half. Not much variation between cans, which is what they strive for.
Drank all from can as directed, had tried a sampler at brewery in 2013 so I have a rough idea what it looks like. Can does focus nose, but a good tulip glass will do the same. You can definitely tell the difference between a fresh and month-old Heady, but the month-old is still fantastic.
Nose to me is mostly grapefruit with some lemon. Subdued floral component as this isn't quite a West Coast (or quite an East Coast) style DIPA. Subdued malt profile as this is about the hops. 
Taste is all citrus and hops, as much as one could possibly want in a beer.
Medium to full-bodied, strongly carbonated, incredible balance, dry finish. 
Had to leave some room in my rating for something better to come along (hope to grab one of their other beers at a truck sale sometime, for example). 
I do a round-trip drive from VA each August to get my case (or as much as I can get). Very difficult to get if you aren't willing to travel to VT and not easy to get unless you plan before you get there. I recommend the Heady Spotter website to maximize your opportunities. Worth the trouble, though. There's nothing quite like it. 1,265 charactersIvoryFoxhole, Sep 08, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -3.2%By far, the nicest look and feel of a bottled/canned IIPA. Big fluffy white head and oodles of glass sticking lace. Low-medium carbonation give it a very soft and creamy feel, particularly when pared with the medium+ body. Aroma and flavor are as good as you could want for the style. Lots of pine and a long lasting bitter finish. Residual sugars lean it a click toward the sweet side and there's a touch of alcohol in the finish. Big thanks to Chuk for securing this one for me. 480 charactersLittleDon, Sep 07, 2014

Taste follows the nose. Heavy grapefruit and hops. Lasting bitterness. This is a hop Bomb. Not a delicately balanced IPA like Julius. I pick up on some lemon zest and orange zest.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Carbonation is perfect.
Overall, awesome beer. Lives up to its hype. Not a delicate ipa. It's supposed to be a hop Bomb and it is just that. Really nice tropical favors and intense hop bitterness make this a beer any hop head would love. 571 charactersJustin8mypants, Sep 07, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%First and foremost, gotta give a BIG thanks to DCLAguy11 for hooking me up with this brew I've been wanting to quaff for over a year. Seriously, thank you. I was really excited to try this. Re-he-he-heally excited.
So, to begin with, I drank this within 24 hours, making sure it was chilled. Drank straight from the can because, duh, it says 3 times around the rim, "DRINK FROM THE CAN!" With that, no color description.
The smell is best described as hop heaven. So tropical. Pineapple, grapefruit, some pine, peach, guava... Amazing.
The tasting? ... Oh man... Oh, man... OH MAN! So delicious! Trying my best not to be affected by hype and hopes, but it is very well balanced and like it says on the can, "wave after wave of hoppy goodness." The first sip gives off a very tropical dry hop taste. Guava, peach, ever so slight, along with papaya and pineapple. Then after the dry tropical taste, I get this wet, traditional IPA flavor; so full of grapefruit, pine, light lemon. That "second wave" is juicy. Finally, it just ends with a nice resiny mouthfeel that grows like a ghost pepper: more and more hops as you drink, but ever so subtle and leaves a craving for more sips.
I gotta say, this is indeed the best DIPA I've ever had. Here in Texas, I've had good Double IPAs, such as Deep Ellum's Dream Crusher & Karbach's Rodeo Clown (which are very very good), which are both amazing (can't help but praise), but this one takes the cake. It's just head and shoulders above the rest, and if I could get it here, I would probably go broke. Immediately after I drank this, I needed to continue the amazing feeling it left, a blonde ale I consider solid tasted like swill. This is both good and bad; it goes to showcase how well crafted Heady Topper is. This whole heartedly deserves the hype.
Citizens of Vermont: consider yourselves blessed. 1,849 charactersOliOxenFree, Sep 07, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%Finally got to have one of these last night!  To me, this beer is perfect.
A: Took my first sip from the can since the can says I should.  I had to see this beauty though, so I poured the rest into a snifter.  Poured a very hazy orange color with a nice eggshell white head.
S: The aroma of this beer was unreal.  As soon as I opened the can it hit me.  Super dank and pungent, piney, and aromas of tropical fruit and citrus.  
T:  Sticky bitter hop resins up front, but the bitterness isn't overwhelming.  That's followed by pine and fruits like pineapple, peach, and grapefruit.  The finish had a subtle malt bready sweetness that helps keep the beer smooth.
M: Dry, but not thin.  Medium bodied.  Sticky hop resins with medium carbonation.  Super easy drinking, I could put a few of these away in a hurry.  Not boozy at all.
O:  To me, this is a perfect DIPA.  As it says right on the can, it doesn't strive to be the biggest or most bitter, but it's flavor is amazing.  Wish I had regular access to this beer. 1,018 charactersBrams17, Sep 03, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%Look, I'm not going to add a whole lot to the conversation here, but I've got to write something - I'm tearing up as I type... I've had this 4 times now. 1st at a party in Somerville, and I was half in the bag already. 2nd time it was warm. 3rd time was a tip from a guy at the bar I work at 2 a.m. And I'm having one now. All have been memorable. It is a remarkable experience.
A: I poured it out into an 10oz glass and it shows a hazy yellow gold. 1" of white foam. I did drink the remainder from the can as instructed. 2nd time I've done that.
S: Woody, earthy pine, then comes a wave of baked peaches and apricots, and finally the much anticipated ruby grapefruit. 
T: Sweet bread malt, and the grapefruit bitterness. Lingers to orange juice and honey, balancing the hops. Wonderful.
M: Chewy, yet spirited carbonation. Just a kiss of residuals. Alcohol?
O: This beer makes me smile. Tough to describe, but there's this luscious backbone that screams for all that hops. Every time I taste it I can't get over the sweet homebrew note that counters that Imperial IPA hop blast. It's like a dash of salt on your watermelon, or a couple granules of sugar on a cucumber, it just works. I adore Stone's Ruination (had it on tap for years where I bartended), but this is less refined, more casual, less pretentious, yet bolder - drink it from the can or don't. Just be happy knowing it's out there. A+ 1,404 charactersNedGreene, Sep 03, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%This is a beautiful IPA that holds back on the bitterness that can *sometimes* overpower the delicate flavors in hops. While I love bitter beers that push the IBUs like Stone's 'Ruination,' Heady Topper takes the opposite approach while still maintaining a well-balanced malt character. The waves of hops wash over your palate and after you swallow you're left with that biscuity aftertaste from the lighter malts. 
I absolutely love this beer. The Alchemist deserves all of the praise they get. 496 charactersRastacola, Sep 02, 2014

4.55/5  rDev -2.2%First beer I had in my trip to Vermont. From very recent notes.
A: Looks like every other DIPA I had. Hazy yellow/orange with a strong pure white head. Strong lacing and retention.
S: I still can smell it. It is very sweet, juicy and home made pink lemonade-ish. In the sense it smells like a sweet red grapefruit, some notes of lemon rind, orange juice and peach. Some hops dry-ness in the shape of lemon rind.
T: It's just like the smell. First, you get the grapefruit and the hop punch (citrus peel, grass), then you get the sweetness with the orange juice, peach and very ripe pineapple. And a taste that lingers on and on and on. Actually a bit sweeter than expected.
M: Medium body with a light amount of stickiness.
D: This is extremely drinkable and is a summer beer. You can down this one very easily. The sweetness helps to balance the hops punch in the long run, but this is still sweeter than what I prefer.
This IS an amazing beer, but, to me, this is not my favourite beer in the world. But, I do see how it must pleases highly to everybody and makes it so everyone gives it a really high score. Still, it feels slightly over rated, very slightly, but this is an amazing brew. 1,196 charactersflipper2gv, Aug 29, 2014

As mentioned on said can, this was waves and waves of hops. Bitter grassy, herbal up front, and crisp transition to a full mouthful of dry hop explosion on the finish.  Lingers like no other.   Intense without losing its identity as a brew.  Not over-hyped in the least. 308 charactersKomodoDragon, Aug 27, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%To be fair, my buddy and I drove up to VT to get our hands on this beer that is in high demand and only sold in VT.
Appearance:  Would not know as we drank them in the can.
Aroma:   Citrus fruits, mint, hops.
Taste:   Wow.   This beer is a wonderful balance of fruit and massive hops.   It starts off with the citrus fruits that are in the nose, and then the name of the beer comes into play as the hops just do not stop.  I would say it is a bit on the dry side in the finish.
Overall:  AMAZING!!   The can says it all, "so drinkable it is dangerous."   My only knock on this beer is the availability.   I understand the buzz that is created with the elusive factor of beers like this, Pliny, Founder's KBS, etc.   And while the brewer John Kimmich has every right to keep this limited, I would suggest he brew more and make it available to more states (just a business take IMO).   Nevertheless, we ended up getting four cases between four people and have enjoyed this all summer down here in New Jersey, and will be back in VT next summer to get more (or sooner if we ski).   And while we had other great IPA's in Vermont such as Lawson's and Hill Farm Stand, this one (to me) is just so drinkable it is scary in a good way.  Cheers!! 1,238 charactersdahlen22, Aug 26, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%A: Golden, Hazy, Very Cloudy, Two-Finger White Head, Medium/High Carbonation, Decent Lacing.
S: Peaches, Apricot, Grapefruit Zest, Guava, Dank, Grassy
T: Grapefruit Zest upfront, leading into Peaches and Guavas, a Bready Malt Middle that serves as a perfect backbone to launch this Hop Drive Brew onto your palate, finishes dry and dank with increased attention to the bitterness balancing all the sweetness and juiciness of this IIPA.
M: Medium-Medium High Body, Chewy
O: 100/100, I've only had a handful of IIPA's on this par and only 2 that were better.  This is the perfect example of what an IIPA should strive to be IMVHO. 
That being said, Heady isn't even the best beer I have had (IMVHO), however I give it a perfect 5 rating, as it is a perfect beer in my eyes, by that I mean it is one I could drink everyday for the rest of my life and not be disappointed ever...  It's my go to beer, it's what I drink after every work shift when something new or "better" isn't on the tap list.
People should however understand that there are better IPA's in VT, The Alchemist makes at least 2 of them currently in limited batches for their pop-up truck sales. 1,163 charactersVTLocal420, Aug 26, 2014

Poured into and enjoyed from a Spiegelau IPA glass – sorry, John, I just can’t drink this White Whale from the can.  
APPEARANCE -- Cloudy, light amber and alive w/ carbonation.  Thick off-white, sticky head that left strong rings of lacing w/ each and every sip – MOTO!
SMELL – Powerful floral & herbal aroma that motivates – GET SOME!
TASTE – Wonderful citrus & flowery hop flavor that is surprisingly NOT overpowering but well balanced and unquestionably an epic DIPA – OORAH!
MOUTHFEEL – Nice smooth feel w/ a carbonized refreshing finish – GOOD PIECE OF GEAR, LAMINATE IT AND TAKE IT TO THE FIELD!
OVERALL – A Top Notch DIPA that absolutely lived up to the hype!  A long time waiting for this beer, but w/out a doubt worth the wait!  Would love to do a head-to-head w/ PtY and RuinTen to determine who the King of IPAs really is, but in the end a great beer that makes me proud to be an American – SEMPER IPA MAC!

4.65/5  rDev 0%Reviewed from notes. Sixteen ounce can shared by Dan - thanks.
A: Pours a slightly hazed yellow with a nice one-inch thick white head which lingers and settles to a thin cap yielding splotchy lace.
N: Juicy grapefruit, tangerine, orange fruits, floral.
T: Resiny, citrusy, mildly sweet malt for a good balance, some faint dankness.
M: Moderate body and medium carbonation. Dry, bitter, citrusy, sticky and resiny finish.
O: Well, after having this a few times I've noticed some variation from can to can probably due to factors such a travel to west coast, temperature, etc. This is definitely a top DIPA, but I'm just not convinced it is the best. The ABV is well hidden and is a creeper, though I'd love to have another and continue the research. 753 characterswethorseblanket, Aug 21, 2014

Say what you will about hype, supply and demand, etc., it has nothing to do with that.  If that's what you think then it is just not to your taste- it happens, own up to it!.  This is one perfect beer for hop-heads like me.  The look is classic- a cloudy light apricot color.  Nose is all citrus, pine, and dank-weed.  Flavors are similar with that funky dank flavor predominating- a unique flavor seldom repeated and hard to qualify- a creamy texture, very mild bitterness, just enough malt to balance (in that regard belongs in the same category as MBC, TG, HF, RR and Lawson's), and a long lingering finish.  
Overall-- One of a kind, my only perfect score (although I haven't officially rated Abner (its a 5), nor tried King Sue- love PS). 766 charactersReady4aHeady, Aug 20, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -3.2%Consumed directly out of the can as directed on the labeling. No canned on or best by date present. Purchased at Bueno Y Sano (Burlington, VT). 
A: Unknown other than the little dribbles on the brim of the can which is golden.
S: Aroma is readily assessed through said can opening with a gamma ray like propulsion of tropical fruit including passionfruit, mango, and pineapple topped off with grapefruit and lime citrus and finished with a blast of pine and some floral notes as well. Pale maltiness is one-dimensional and a bit crackery without much residual sweetness. (4.5)
T: An extremely well-executed beer with a mirror of the aroma, yet intensified with tropical fruit and citrus notes blending with pine resin, floral, and a bit of grassy-herbal honeysuckle in there as well. Pale maltiness is light caramel and crackery, but it mainly serves as a vehicle for abundant hops assault. No yeast or alcohol and bitterness is surprisingly medium -- I think I consumed the entire tallboy in about 12 minutes. It is a very good American DIPA, but I still think there are a few more unique (ST Oak Aged Unearthly) and more aromatic and flavorful (KR Citra DIPA). (4.5)
M: Extremely smooth without being creamy, more slick related to the medium body and lowish carbonation. (4.5)
O: I really enjoyed my first experience with Heady Topper -- it is an exceptional beer and I trust it was fresh since I was close to the source. It was worth the trouble to track it down, and I found it in an off-the-beaten-path place in Burlington. Check it out for sure. 1,557 charactersargock, Aug 20, 2014

In a blind taste test that included Abner, Dinner, Double Citra, Focal Banger, Gandhi Bot, Mastermind, Pliny the Elder, Second Fiddle, Sip of Sunshine, Society and Solitude #4, the Substance, and Zombie Dust, Heady Topper was crowned king. 
There is great batch variability, but the right batch will reaffirm why this is considered the #1 beer in the world. 433 charactersrodmanfor3, Aug 14, 2014

Served in a can as the label so duly instructs, I did pour a smidge into a snifter for the sole purpose of being able to rate the appearance. And so here it goes...
Appearance.. Seems cloudy enough. I am surprised that the hue is pale gold as opposed to dark like some IPAs. Has the look of a wheat beer almost with a sudsy head, little lacing.
Nose.. This is the cornucopia of IPAs.. Tropical, fruity, floral, bitter. Yes.
Taste.. Follows the nose and more. The right amount of bitterness and heat doing just the trick. All the qualities of a desirable ipa.
Mouthfeel.. Slick and powerful
Overall... Now I know what the hype is about. It's for certain to me now why this brew is so coveted. Not to say I haven't had other excellent IPAs similar to this style. In fact, all things said and done I have had several that could give heady a run for its money. But! An amazing beer. Must get more. 1,021 charactersfgmiele, Aug 14, 2014

4.5/5  rDev -3.2%This beer is a stable and outstanding brew.  There is nothing to negatively state about it.  The only reason I give it a 4.5 is because there is something that I taste in Pliny, Fat heads Hop JuJu and Three Floyds Permanent Funeral that just amazes me.  I believe its the fruity aroma matched with the spectrum of flavors that hit me from those beers over Heady.  Can't go wrong with heady though, its outstanding. 414 charactersecarl97, Aug 12, 2014

Appearance- drank it from the can- but the can is a beauty!
Smell- it's like happiness, rainbows, money, cars, puppies and everything good was condensed into the aroma wafting from the can
Taste- what can I say- perfect, not the most bitter, not the most sweet, just probably the tastiest
Mouthfeel- perfect, full bodied, not too carbonated, 
Overall- so I had to drive 4 hrs, wait in line for 2 1/2 hrs and ended up securing two cases. To me, it's the experience, almost a ritual. That's what adds to the allure and that has made this beet gain a cult following. Driving through some of the most rural and beautiful country in the u.s. Just to wait in a line with people who are as fanatical about great beer as you are. Totally worth the $80.60 for 20 beers.

4.33/5  rDev -6.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.25What better way to break in my brand new snifter than with a can of Heady Topper, the #1 rated beer on Beer Advocate.
A - It pours a very hazy light orange with a one finger, white head that retains well. 
S - The nose is a bouquet of citrusy goodness. Mangos, passion fruit, grapefruit, pineapple, with a slight touch of pine on the finish. I was quite surprised however at how subdued the nose was. The can is fresh so I was expecting an explosion of flavor that I didn't get. 
T - There's the explosion I was waiting for. Follows the nose very closely. Flavor is intense and bright with the aforementioned citrusy notes shining through. Mid-palate turns to pine. Finish is a bready malt backbone that shows its head but doesn't overshadow the hops.
M - Great feel. Medium bodied, light bitterness, relatively dry, and very drinkable.
O - Great beer? Hell yes. Excellent beer? Yes. Best beer I've ever had? A resounding no. Worth the trouble of getting it but just barely. 979 charactersPSU_Mike, Aug 11, 2014

It's a very nice, refreshing, not terribly complex brew. Good quaffer on a hot summer day, with a light grapefruity bitterness and a clean finish. It's fine. It's nice. I'll drink it again for $4 a can, but I won't drive to Vermont to get it or pay a scalper $14 for it. If I don't see it again, no big deal, there are hundreds of equally good, similar brews out there. 
This seems like one of those "the harder to get the better it tastes" situations. 551 characterssanhedrin, Aug 07, 2014

In the taste, big grapefruit, dank herb, a wall of bitterness, and a fruity ale yeast strain. Papaya, pine, sap, menthol, eucalyptus, citrus. Wood, earth, but still fruity. 
Fruit flies appeared quickly after opening the can and pouring, possibly the best scent this species has ever experienced in nature. I felt much like the flies, in a drunken stupor and following the smell by instinct. 578 charactersStinkypuss, Aug 07, 2014

My first taste tonight (technically 4th) of this fine, superfine IPA , and I was not disappointed. West Coast style, in my opinion, and a beautiful cloudy hoppy dirty brew. If you pour it in a glass. Which is NOT recommended, so says the can. Well, some like it in the can, and I tried it, then poured it into a pint glass. 
This pretty much defines what a brewer dreams hopwise. The alcohol is hidden, blends nicely at any rate, and will kick yer ass if you don't watch it. Cheers to Alchemist and Bobby Peru who's gift has not gone unappreciated. 580 charactershudsonvalleyslim, Aug 05, 2014

Pine and wood with ample floral and juicy citrus aroma that's peach, mango, orange and grapefruit. 
Flavor is more along the resiny/dank/pine side of things. Has some bready malt character. Ends with a fruity edge with a melange of everything in the aftertaste. 
Bitter but understated a bit making this way too drinkable. Dries out the palate a bit. Medium bodied. 
I didn't want to be swayed by da hype, but after getting over any preconceived notion and delving into a can it is really special. 651 charactersMattSweatshirt, Jul 31, 2014

If your in Vermont, waiting every Wednesday at 10 am outside of the store for the truck to arrive, hoping you'll get a 4 pack or 2, when it's as fresh as ever. 
This beer has a truly one of a kind taste and smell. A bright hazy gold, with a fluffy head. It's by far one of the most unique beers in Vermont, and anyone who's from here knows, that's a lot to compete with. Absolutely the greatest IPA out there. We're all hoping for "The Crusher", "Focal Banger", "Holy Cow IPA" to start bigger production. Keep it up Alchemist. 735 characters802Brewing, Jul 30, 2014

T: citrus.. Less lemon than the smell.. More sweet.. Zero pine and no bitter after taste.. Devine!
M: medium

4.29/5  rDev -7.7%look: 4 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I was able to get a can of the Heady Topper through a new acquaintance out of J'Town, PA. I traded Two Bros Night Cat and Side Kick for it. The beer poured a hazy straw color with white head that is leaving a lace. The scent is mostly sweet malt....and I was hoping for more pine and citrus. The taste was a good balance between sweeter malt and bitter hops there is presence of some pine and a touch of apricot like citrus all bolstered by an oily resiny base. The mouthfeel is medium in body with smooth carbonation. Overall this is a solid beer....but not the best IPA I've had (IMO). It's great...don't get me wrong...but the original Zombie Dust before is was massed produced was better. 692 charactersWoodBrew, Jul 27, 2014

Smell- Grassy with some floral characteristics.
Smell- Grassy, dank and floral.
Taste- Very piney taste, notes of citrus, a lingering earthy bitterness. I was surprised by the strong biscuity backbone of pale malts here.
Mouthfeel- This beer is resinous but surprisingly easy to drink. Carbonation and consistency are both very good.
This is a very good beer but not a traditional double IPA. Still, it grows on me every time I come back to it and it really is exceptionally tasty. 578 charactersspacebear09, Jul 26, 2014

Smell - Very hop full aroma. hints of citrus and heavy pine, i would even say it has a canabis type aroma being very grassy and piney. 
Taste - Hops are strong forward and stay consistent all the way through. Hints of pine and grass. 
Mouthfeel - very rich mouthfeel, staying wet on the palate making you want more. 
Overall - this beer is perfect, very complex and well balanced making it one of the best IPA's out there. 591 charactersTobes181, Jul 25, 2014

It was in this mind frame of slightly lowered expectations that I had my first sip of this admittedly outstanding beverage.
It's not that the beer is intensely rich or bitter, but that its profile is one of the most layered I have ever tasted, especially in an IPA, a style which can often times seem very one dimensional, no matter how hoppy you may like it.
Appearance - Silver with black highlights. Beautifully shaped cans. ;)
Smell - Marijuana. No joke. Pineapple. Caramel. Pine. Flowers. Wow.
Taste - Soft bitter pine, malt, pineapple and a variety of consumable greens. Very consistent with the smell.
Mouthfeel - Creamiest IPA I've ever tasted. Chewy even. 
Finish - Stays with you all day.
Overall - Yup. It's the best IPA I've ever had, knocking the citrus-heavy Lagunitas Sucks off of its perch. Having tried other great double IPA's like Triple Sunshine, Enjoy By, Focal Banger, The Crusher, Lunch, Abner, and Society & Solitude #4, I think I have enough comparison to justify my reaction.

Anyway, I ordered one with a glass not realizing that the can COMMANDS you to drink straight from it. I tried it both ways, and it is one great beer. Hell, you could drink this off the floor with a straw and come to the same conclusion.
Golden in color, and hazy (as is my memory after a few). The taste is amazingly well balanced between the sweetness and bitterness. It is a mighty brew, full of complex flavors that I can't begin to describe accurately. Needless to say it is relentlessly drinkable, but will put you right to sleep if you are not careful. Goodness gracious, it truly lived up to the hype. 789 charactersLitterbean, Jul 20, 2014

The nose is heavily fruity, but there's a piney quality to the hops too. A second whiff gives me some floral hints and.... more hops. What can I say? It's intensely hopped up, but it smells delicious. 
Interesting. It's citrusy and grapefruit-like, but doesn't possess that dry bitterness that I usually find. There's still something fruity and berry-like going. Mid-palate there's a breakthrough of sweet, caramel-like malt, some breadiness, and more earthy hops. This provides an excellent balance. 
Initially, the beer was drinking rather mellow-like, but with successive sips the intense bitterness overtakes my tongue. This thing is a beast. There's a good bit of carbonation and a medium-body that allow for some enjoyment before the brutally dry, long finish. I only get a hint of astringency on this towards the finish and that contributes to the dryness. 
The fruitiness in this beer is what makes it most impressive. It's not excessively grapefruit heavy while still offering citrus and it's not overly piney either. It's deceivingly easy-to-drink and that would mean trouble if I had access to more. 1,200 charactersONovoMexicano, Jul 20, 2014

Intro: Many thanks to Jet and Danica for the great surprise @ CAAS. 16 oz. can/ Served in a tulip glass and shared with a friend.
Appearance: Pours a hazy orange with a fair head that subsides into lacing that lasts throughout. Although the can says “drink from the can” I couldn’t resist seeing for the first time.
Smell: Straight away hops and citrus bouquet. Reminds me of Pliny and the West Coast IPA’s. No barrel aging, no honey, nothing to get in the way. Just simple, straight away goodness.
Taste: An extension of the bouquet. Hop forward, piney, and citrus. Very clean. Very consistent with any high quality brew. Well balanced, not over the top like Palette Wrecker.
Mouthfeel: Dry, crisp, and clean. Not syrupy on the finish, not malty, just the normal hoppy aftertaste.
Overall: I’m not going to gush over the best beer known to civilized man. I believe there is a lot of hype surrounding this beer. Admittedly, it’s a great example of a DIPA. One of the best I’ve had or known about so far. It’s very drinkable and very enjoyable. Thank you again Jet and Danica for allowing me to experience this. 1,164 charactersheysuz, Jul 19, 2014

I'm a f**king rebel. I drink it from my IPA glassware) If kept in proper temp, this should look translucent and dark orange to you. No suspension, no settlement (if you see protein settlement, you kept it for too long!)
N: Take a big whiff as soon as you pop the top, and you'll get a noseful of sweet malty and some prominent but not at all overpowering hops
T: Not straying too far from the nose. Just perfect balance of what IPA should be. Malts. Hops. Water. Sweet, then bitterness, then sweet + bitterness. It's complicated without feeling complicated.
M: If you take it in all too quickly, you can feeel that 8% ABV burn on the roof of your mouth and the back of your throat; take it slowly, and you'll see how magical it is to blend the bitterness of the hops from last sip with the sweetness on the front of your tongue from the next sip.
O: In the past 2-3 years of my trading years I've had probably a case worth of Heady. I'm happy that I've got friends in high (latitude) places that can keep sending me a 4-pack or two every drop. It's definitely worth the chase folks. 1,200 charactersMalibuKenny, Jul 18, 2014

Everything from the presentation of the can, the four pack little plastic holder thingy, to the fact that it's a pounder can, just makes it that much more special.
I was lucky enough to make a trip to Montpelier, VT and purchase three cases of this delicious beer. I listened to the instructions and I have drank every single one from the can. That is the only reason I couldn't really judge the appearance that much as I can only see it in the bowels of the dark can.
The smell gets you immediately. My nose lights up as I take my first sip. You are hit with a wall of amazing hop flavor. I have come to expect this from double IPA's but what I was caught off guard by was the extreme smoothness at the end. I mean this in the best possible way when I say it ends with little to no drama. It's deceptively easy to go down and would be very dangerous if you didn't know what you were drinking.
Definitely in my top two or three beers... 1,020 charactersThomasJ25, Jul 16, 2014

The smell will make you want to climb inside. You may find yourself smelling the beer more than you are sipping it. 
I have had it straight off the tap in Vermont with John Kimmich and I have had a can 6 months old and this beer holds up nicely. Not saying I would suggest keeping it around that long by any means. 
Drink it fresh and from the can and don't be a douchebag. 485 charactersrwhite757, Jul 16, 2014

How does one disregard such a declaration? Furthermore, how do you rate appearance on a beer you can't see? Well, I cheated and poured some out. Nice, rich orange body, not too much head. But since it's the can that's truly making the appearance, let's talk about the can. The can is awesome. The dude with the outburst of hops from his cranium: terrific. And I'm partial to the message on the back: "Don't Be A D-Bag, Recycle This Can." 
Once you crack Heady open, sniff it immediately. Like you're President Skroob in Spaceballs, hungry for fresh oxygen. The smell is wonderful. It's fresh, full of grapefruit and bitter pine. I love it!
Heady's a bitter bomb from front to back. Again, grapefruit and pine are piled onto the palate (oh, the alliteration). Oddly enough, the taste is not quite as fresh as the smell. 
A bit syrupy on the mouthfeel. Heady doesn't drink as cleanly as, for instance, Hill Farmstead or Maine beers. 
Overall, I think Heady Topper deserves to top the 250. Is it the best beer I've ever had? I don't think so. But it didn't disappoint me one bit. 1,162 charactersMakeMineADoubleJack, Jul 15, 2014

The nose is so fresh, full of citrus fruits and piney hops! No surprise here, that's pretty much the taste on the palate also. Quite a hop punch to this DIPA, excellent balance and acidity, alcohol masked well. Unbelievably drinkable and just so damn fresh. It's like I'm chewing on a hop cone. They say it's the water that makes this special but whatever it is, keep doing it. I hope they begin to distribute because getting a can of this in NYC was hard. Definitely worth seeking out if you are a hop head. It's a tough call, but I think this might top the all mighty Pliney! 681 charactersbneel317, Jul 14, 2014

I am lucky enough to have family near Waterbury, Vermont. I'm not a big IPA fan, but this is certainly the best beer you will ever hope to try. I especially love that it is only in cans. 268 charactersGuardian, Jul 13, 2014

Appearance - Slightly opaque beige-orange with hints of yellow around the glass. Wispy eggshell pebbled head with lacing.
Smell - Unavoidable hop burst. It's balanced though, with the malts sharing the same space in the room. Earthy and citrus plays with the sweets. A bit of tangerine, lemon peel, and spice with the breads.
Taste - Woa. No kidding around here with the flavor composition. Sip, think. Sip, think. There's a lot going on in there. From the citrus first noted in the smell to the very smooth boozy warmth on the finish, it's quite complete. The grapefruit and tangerine are there and persist as the malt sweetness fills the entire mouth.
Mouthfeel - Medium/full body, carbonation is quite spot on to still play with the tongue.
Overall - says NOT to pour into a glass, but I think even if you do it's incredibly satisfying. I'd like to compare this with Pliny the Younger, the day will soon come. 995 charactersSark, Jul 04, 2014

Drank most of them from the can as instructed (but had to drink one from a glass too)
Appearance is a wonderful, murky, yellow-orange.. looks as much like a geuze as it does an IPA
Smell is ridic, best scent on an IPA ever... whatever your 'mental image' of the way an IPA should smell like is, it should be heady.
One of the best tasting IPAs out there, but HF double citra was the first I have had beat it in a side by side. Not excessively citrusy or floral, but a good mix of the two.
Mouthfeel is what makes this beer amazing in my opinion, unlike any IPA I have ever had.. almost thick in its own unique way. Incredible
Overall this has to be a 5. It ca be beat, but when you are comparing greatness to other greatness, it is hard to say that one is the clear winner. This beer has made me drive 12 hours one way 2 years in a row. If you haven't had it, trade for it, or make a beer-cation to Waterbury VT... it is worth the effort and then some. 991 charactersj-con1263, Jul 01, 2014

Poured into my SN Liettich Balloon glass despite the "DRINK FROM THE CAN" text on the can. Pours a hazy golden yellow with a foamy white head. This is exactly what a DIPA should look like. Smell is of citrus and mango. The smell out of the can is just amazing. Best part of this beer. Taste follows the nose. Just in-your-face juicy hops. Fruity, citrusy, a little pine. The bitterness isn't overwhelming, which makes for a very drinkable and enjoyable DIPA. Mouthfeel is great. I always say with a juicy IPA you need a fuller mouthfeel and this is exactly what I mean. Overall, a great DIPA, one of the best. Would I go way out of my way to get it again? Probably not but it's something everyone needs to try at least once. 775 charactersMisSigsFan, Jun 30, 2014

The marketing on the can is unique and adds to the experience of searching and getting this beer.
The only downside (personally) is that I have to travel so far to get it! 430 charactersbol3by, Jun 27, 2014

Awesome hazy orange pour with 1/2 foam head. 
Nose is pungent with orange peel and fresh juicy mango
Taste is juicy fresh fruit, packs a small punch of hops but its more than welcomed
Bite at the back of the tongue is a reminder that this is a DIPA

Pours a hazed apricot with 2 fingers of rocky pearl colored head. Not gonna detract for haziness, apparently they aren't going for this dropping bright. Sheets of lacing, very good head retention
S: Leafy hops, breadyness, pears; maybe the only short coming in this beer, not getting any citrus pop
T: Pineapple, white grape, bread fruit, breadyness, slight honey malt notes, a touch of peach & apricot, with leafy hops layered underneath. Tea-like notes mix with grapefruit, breadyness, & woody hop notes; just gets better as this warms. Finishes with some honey, caramel & toffee, sneaking past the woody, leafy & citrusy hops, a touch dry too; much pineapple & a little mango too
MF: Medium bodied, soft carbonation & superb balance, some tingly acidy pineapple notes as well 
Drinks too damn easy, now I wish to drink from the tanks, because although is very good/super complex, I sure this is mind blowing a few days old... 1,010 charactersrusspowell, Jun 25, 2014

Super fresh can from the brewery thanks to a fellow BA.
Cracking the can open I'm hit with tropical hop aromas and grass with the fury of a thousand suns. Immediately I'm transported to the moment I had my first whiff of a hoppy beer. Wow. So juicy. Immediately I know this is a treat. 
Then came my first hurdle...to pour or not to pour? The answer was simple: do both. With a few size able gulps thrown into the trusty Kane Teku, I could see this beer is unapologetically hazy. 
The taste is basically everything you want a DIPA. Very tangible flavors of pineapple, clementines, and mango hit you like a right hand from Iron Mike all the while a very pleasing bitterness lingers long after the finish. 
With each taste, you get hit with waves of flavor, as if a war is being waged between tropical fruity hops and the piney/grassy hops. Both vying for your attention. 
medium chewy body with no alcohol to be seemingly present. Absurdly drinkable. 
Over this was an experience very much akin to that feeling a kid has getting an xbox on Christmas. 
Truly a benchmark beer for me. 1,230 charactersItsMe, Jun 24, 2014

Traded for this, advertised as 1 week old, by the time i got it i'm assuming closer to 1 month old… however i'd find it hard to be any better fresh than it was a few weeks old.
the smell is very attractive.
The first sip blew me away with the perfect blend of the tropical citrus and hops built into a body that is a bit more full than your average dipa ... few sips in you get more of the hops. After taste sticks with you for a while. 
You easily forget that this is an 8% beer, and it'd be nice if they could bump it up a notch more but this is still a creeper. This is so drinkable it's dangerous. 
Thank you to the dude in PA that shipped me this amazing stuff. Cheers 759 characterspaul_db, Jun 21, 2014

S: Amazing, as many others have said. Lots of fresh hop smell with a nice citrus aroma.
T: Fantastic. With the IBU's coming in at 75, it's neither too overwhelming nor boring. Well bittered for the style. Grapefruit and sticky resin notes.
M: Smooth and appropriately bitter on the tongue. Not overly carbonated.
O: Living in VT and being able to get this all the time (at least Thursday afternoons) where I live I may be biased, but Heady Topper is one of the best DIPA's I've had. At 8% ABV it's biting but not overwhelming (I do like a high ABV stout or barleywine) and keeps it crisp with the aroma hops addition(s). Delicious and perfect for a VT summer BBQ. 785 characterslifenoob, Jun 20, 2014
4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25A: A very light orange, almost yellow, and quite cloudy.
S: Heavy tropical fruits and flowers: mango, pineapple, lychee, and jasmine. There's very little hint of hop bitterness in the nose.
T: The fruits are not present in the flavor. Instead it's a wash of hop resin; bitter but not overpowering. The finish is sweet and boozy. The aftertaste is strikingly bitter.
M: Medium bodied with some astringency.
O: Good. Not the best tasting DIPA but perhaps the best smelling. 475 characters01001111, Jun 20, 2014

4.21/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4Dear beer drinking community,
Never understood the hype behind this beer. Yeah, it's good, but there are so many better IPAs out there, at least to my palate. Fresh Pliny and Blind Pig are examples. What rogers your jollies so ferociously that you would put this into such lofty heights as being the ranked 1 beer? Maybe I'll never understand, maybe it's the exclusive market, or the story behind it, or maybe it is the fact that you probably over-traded for this, and you're quietly lying to yourself on a site to make yourself feel better and the sensation that it gives you makes you jizz uncontrollably, but that does not make a beer taste better. After all, now there's jizz in your beer. Get over the ego-trip of having a beer people have had thousands and thousands of times over.
Sincerely, a hype hater. 814 charactersTrifecta1, Jun 19, 2014

Appearance - golden-orange hue.
S - citrusy, pine notes. Hop aromas galore. One of my favorite smells in the world.
T - world class taste from beginning to end.
M - nice feel, good level of carbonation
Overall - Definitely one of my favorite beers in the world and very accessible for me. I tend to think some of the Hill Farmstead brews are slightly better, but I stock-up on Heady 4-6 times a year. I feel lucky to get to imbibe Alchemist brews frequently! 574 characters311bulldog, Jun 19, 2014

4.73/5  rDev +1.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Acquired via trade at DLD. Shared witha buddy.
A - Looks as promising as all the folk lore. Perfect golden hue, right amount of carbonation and lacing around the sides of the glass.
S - Big floral, citrusy, pine notes. Was expecting more concentrated hop aromas as this is coming from a can. When tasted from a can did not make as much difference as the multiple warnings of drink from the can would elude to. 90% for aroma. Better DIPA aromas out there for sure.
T - Nothing wrong with the taste from beginning to finish. No lingering lupilin tangy taste as other can IPA's have, great malt body and neither the hops or malt outweigh the other. Was hoping for more hop presence though.
M - Mouthfeel, carbonation, coating the tongue all perfect. Well executed and this was possibly the best part of the beer. (Which is why it is not the #1 brew in the world)
O - Awesome not worth the hype or what people trade for it. On that note, although its not the best, nothing is wrong with it just built it up too much in my head. Hope to try again in the future to try and reverse my original opinion. 1,100 charactersHesscabob, Jun 16, 2014

4.43/5  rDev -4.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Can from HopSynonymous.
Look: well, the can looks nice, I guess... kinda hard to see anything else when obeying the edict to drink from the can.
Smell: again, really hard to get any strong aromas. I can tell it's an IPA, and that's about it.
Taste: the initial flavor is very citrus- and tropical-fruit heavy. If it stopped there, it'd be a decent IPA, but nowhere near #1. Thankfully, it doesn't stop there, as piney, floral, and grassy notes all make an appearance. Also a very nice balance of sweet and bitter, but a bit more elemental in these tastes—it's not so much that the fruit flavors are sweet and grass flavors bitter, as much as there are those flavors, side-by-side with those basic tastes.
Feel: pretty nice; medium body, dry, good carbonation. Suffers in comparison with MBC pales.
Overall: well, there was no way this could live up to the hype. It was really solid, but it wasn't the best IPA I've ever had; nor was any of its characteristics (smell, etc) best. Still, glad to have gotten the chance to try it. 1,034 charactersneurobot01, Jun 16, 2014

4.87/5  rDev +4.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This heady topper is about 3 weeks old which is about the peak in my opinion. The very fresh stuff is a little off to me. 
Served in a tulip glass, yes I ignore the serving instructions because I can't resist the smell. 
Appearance is orangey/straw color with a white head that fades to lacing
Aroma is orange, pineapple/tropical fruit, flowers, melon, and "green" and really shines as the beer warms. I always enjoy how the smell progress from more green/floral initially to more a more citrus/tropical fruit dominated as it warms. 
Taste follows the smell to some degree. The hops dominate and the malt plays a balancing role at most. The balance is amazing not too bitter and the carbonation refreshes the palate. Very drinkable. I have noticed that as this beer gets older the green can turn towards the "green onion" notes. 
Overall just an amazing beer. Not the hoppiest beer out there, not the most citrus (try double sunshine) but the big hop nose, the balance, and the drinkability make this all around awesome. 1,025 charactersET-12345, Jun 14, 2014

Stand up dude, who drove 7 hours each way from outside of Philly to track down this highly sought after beer. Looks great in a glass took sip from the can but didn't think it would do the beer justice after that first sip. 
Pours into a chalice with a semi hazed golden peach/apricot hue with a bright white head, forms nice even layered lacing down the sides of my glass. I love the can the label the huge paragraph on the back, but the DRINK FROM THE CAN! I just can't figure it out. 
Aromatics, beautifully dank hop explosion from the minute you crack the can. Resinous hop oils, dank Mary Jane, lemon pith, slightly vegetal even dare I say garlic note in the tail end of the nose. 
Flavor has the perfect light malt base to provided biscuit bready notes without ever touching into the caramelized sugar realms, leaving each sip of this stuff right into an assault of hop character with a bone dry finish. I would honestly brush my teeth with this stuff, it's so good. No hype train here, a highly drinkable completely unique DIPA. Is it the best DIPA I've ever tasted? Certainly not but it's Fuckin' Good!!! A really resinous complex hop explosion on the palate remaining quite balanced and extremely effortless to consume. I would be dangerous if I had access to affordable cases of this stuff. The highlighted hop notes are as follows: dank hop resins, lemon pith, pine, and that vegetal garlic note I picked up on the nares. Usually offended by that trait in a hop profile, that's not the case here. 
Mouthfeel is perfect, like I said way to easy to consume this stuff. Oily slick with those hop resins, medium bodied carbonation is soft and caresses the palate, bitter drying hop bitterness finishes each sip...with hop burps soon to follow. 
Overall, I really really like this DIPA I can't explain why but I do. I'm willing to make a pilgrimage at some point, also to checkout fine beers like Lawson's, and Hill Farmstead both of which I've never consumed. Not earth shattering but so unique there's just no other canned/bottled/draft DIPAs with these traits they built they're brewery around this recipe and I can see why. No let's see more innovation and how about some distribution outside of Vermont. 2,321 charactersWVbeergeek, Jun 14, 2014

Appearance - Golden tan, burnt yellow with a nice, foamy 1 inch head and lots of sticky lacing.
Smell - Upfront blast of piney, grapefruit hops. Floral note, lemon, banana, tangerine. A slight amount of caramel near the end.
Taste - Ok so here go's, I am drinking about 6oz in a glass, the rest out of the can. At first sip, piney, grapefruit hops. Very smooth, not so much bitter, a little mix of lemon and honey smoothness. Floral and citric , has a little grassy flavor from the hops. Minimal caramel malt is noticed at the finish. Nice hop bitterness with slight alcohol warmth at the finish.
Mouthfeel - Hops coat the tongue with pine and grapefruit. Tongue gets a nice floral, herbal flavor, with some honey and minor caramel malts. Aftertaste is Hop bitter and a little dry.
Overall - Well, The #1 dipa has been conquered. I'm surprised at how smooth, and easy drinking this is. This reminded me of a more smooth, balanced and less alcohol version of hopslam. IMO, which honestly means nothing to anyone else other then me, this is not the best dipa ive ever had. I can think of 2 or 3 locals ive had that I enjoy more. And a few other ipa's ive had that I liked more. I did enjoy It moreso then the other highly ranked, hyped dipa pliny but there's no way id travel a long distance to buy it or I wouldnt trade for it again but,,,,if it was available at local shop id pick it up for sure in when I want a change up from my favorites. I did enjoy this more from glass, as I always do for any canned beers. 1,536 characterswvsabbath, Jun 13, 2014

Don't get me wrong it's good but not as hoppy as I was expecting. Can't tell but missing something. And mouthful was just alright.

A: It was recommended to drink from the can, so.. uh.. it is silver in color, with some nice condensation on the outside. If I had poured it into a glass it would be a hazy grapefruit color. 
S: Huge american hop aroma.. Citrus, grapefruit and pine. Slight caramel, but the hops on this are really just killer. Pungent, but not overpowering. 
T: Hoptacular. Bitter, with huger amounts of citrus and tropical fruit. the bitterness is there, but takes a subdued backseat to the tremendous hop flavor. It's like drinking a walk through a hop field. 
M: Medium in body, fairly high carbonation. Long lingering bitterness. 
O: That's a heap load of hops.. tasty as hell, and just the thing if you want to crush a hop craving. This thing is beautiful homage to hops. 811 charactersBeejay, Jun 12, 2014
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Ok, I have been waiting to taste this one for a long time now. One of customers, who has in in depth knowledge of all sorts of beers, brought one 4 pack in for me to try. He was heading up to Vermont, so he was going to buy some more.
Once I opened the can, the room came alive with citrus, grapefruit, banana and so many other perfect hoppy aromas. It was grassy and so alive. It was at a point that I was more than satisfied with the bouquet, I need not take it any further.
The first sip (from a glass) was fullness in my mouth of hops, cream, grapefruit and lots of smooth body. The after taste was just as pleasant.
From that point on, I drank it from the can. I was really surprised at just how smooth it was considering the IBU count (120)
I so enjoyed this beer, but now, I will have to wait until a second tasting of it (which should be tomorrow) Was it the best beer I've tasted? Did it have everything a hoppy IPA should have?
I dont know, but I will re- review this one tomorrow.
For now, I am 100% satisfied, that I was able to taste a legend (Dino, Thanks!)

Got to re-taste a fairly fresh one....If there was a 6 rating, this would be the beer I would give it to.

This one was less than a week from brewing! Fantastic, even better than the ones I have had before. I guess the best way to describe this is that it is liquid GOLD

Lucky to get my hands on 10 day old Heady. Better and better, cant see how anything can get better, but this one was so far over the top. LOVE IT....
1 4pk remaining then I will hold back for 4 or 5 months before getting my next haul 1,611 charactersrdilauro, Jun 12, 2014

Overall: What's not to like about this robust double IPA? This is what a DIPA should taste like. So full of hoppy goodness, I can barely stand it. Deceivingly drinkable despite the 8% abv. Scary good! 376 charactersChristopherProvost, Jun 11, 2014
4.75/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Drinking straight from the can, as instructed.
A: It is a good can. The aesthetics of the font and the illustration are pleasing, and I dig the black tab. One of the best can designs I've seen for a beer, so I'm rating it accordingly.
S: Upon cracking the can open, I'm getting waves of pineapple, orange juice, lemon, piney resin, and some apricot, with no one scent overpowering the other.
T: Wow! Very juicy, but not overwhelmingly so. Citrusy notes of grapefruit, orange, lemon, and apricot all flow out of the can and coat the palette in a perfect harmony. There is a slight bitter hop tinge towards the finish, which is when the light, well balanced malt comes in for a smooth finish.
M: Incredibly smooth, medium bodied with a lighter carb level than I'd expect for a DIPA, but it works. The smoothness of this beer is, for me, what helps it excel to the top of the top 250. Very little alcohol presence, making this an exceptional easy drinker.
O: A superb beer that deserves it's high demand, and one that I'll be jealous of not being able to get easily once my allotment is gone. #1? Eh, maybe... I prefer Pliny, but that's just my personal taste, and I would never, ever turn down the opportunity to get more Heady in my fridge. 1,244 charactersHalfbrother83, Jun 11, 2014

Best places to grab some Heady right now is in Burlington at the Beverage Warehouse if you want a case (bring a friend! one case per person) or if you just want a loose can, Blue Donkey at lunch or Vermont Ale House both in Stowe are dependable if it is a Friday. As always, check the Alchemist website first.
Very glad to see Heady on top right now. The Alchemist had the best brewery tap room in perhaps the United States - pint of kombucha! - until the flood a few years ago went up halfway their window. 648 charactersBenempt, Jun 10, 2014

4.8/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Poured half into a tulip glass to compare can vs glass, beer is a light yellowish gold, quite cloudy and hazy with a good white head and lacing. Looks fantastic.
S- very fresh, citrusy grapefruit and mango, florals, apricot, a subtly balanced malt profile, very inviting and complex. Hops are so full bodied, from the can I detect some peach, pine, maybe some slight nuttiness, very delicious.
T- lives up to the expectation of really flavourful balanced hops, from the can it is really tasty and full bodied. Waves of grapefruit citrus and apricot, light and floral notes are in abundance, slightly sweet malt notes provide a solid base. This deserves a high reputation. It all flows so smoothly together, a rustic fruitiness and slightly resiny hops come through, such a flavourful hop character without being an overly bitter dipa. I think out of the can is the way to go on this actually, it's amazing.
M- from the can, a filling assertive carbonation. Satisfying big pale malt body with a coating light pine resin. So tasty with a creamy balanced finish, with a dry floral/citrus aftertaste. Simply, it tastes and feels like utter perfection, brilliant start then waves of hoppy resins.
It's quite the reputation to live up to, being ht. My first experience tangling with this legend was a very positive experience, it's certainly up their with Pliny, and I would love to do a h2h. It's a very nuanced and flavour forward profile, lighter and more floral than I might have expected, it nonetheless delivers what could easily be called a flawless execution. As a dipa goes, this would have to be near perfection, as far as across all styles... That's a matter of opinion. All I can saw is I feel privileged to have gotten to try this beer, especially the lengths taken to get this can... And it doesn't fall short of giving a really excellent experience 1,861 charactersmick303, Jun 08, 2014

Does not have the drinkaablity of Pliny but if you are loking for a wham in your face IPA with some malt backbone this is the best.

Heady pours a hazy light copper with a fluffy head that lingers as beautiful lacing on the glass. Pine, citrus and fresh cut grass fill the aroma. Especially when fresh, this beer is the closest thing to sticking your nose into a handful of hops. Thick, resiny hops fill the flavor, but there is almost more sweetness than bitterness upfront. Delicious light malt rounds out the intense, fruity, citrusy hops. The resiny, piney character lingers on the tongue in the after taste, and begs me to take another sip. 
A friend was kind enough to bring me a 4 pack, and despite being around three months old, the beer is still delicious. 716 charactersericj551, Jun 08, 2014

4.79/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Thanks Dan (CaptCleveland) for including this as an extra. Only bosses do that. 
Date of review is 6/7/14. The Can is about 11-14 days old. I can't wait. 
Appearance- I will pour just a few ounces into a small tasting cup just to get an idea, but will drink most out of the can.
Smell- WOW! Peaches, mangoes and lime blast me. I also get strawberries and mint. Hop scent takes a far backseat to other delicious scents. 
Taste- Super smooth are the first two words on my mind. Absolutely no alcohol burn whatsoever. At 8% I was expecting some. Biggest two flavors I get are hops and limes. 
Mouthfeel- This beer is soooo velvety. It just disappears as soon as you take a sip. I think this can is magical, because I just want to chug the whole thing. Such a unique experience. My mouth is dry and hoppy all at once. 
Overall- World-class beverage. Top 3-5 best IPAs I have ever tasted. Try to get this beer! 911 charactersfrenchblood21, Jun 07, 2014

A- perfect. I love a light colored DIPA with little malt in the appearance. Yellow with a slight orange hue.
S- punch of fruity and citrus hops. Mango, orange, and other fruits on the nose. No malt anywhere but that's how I love a DIPA.
T- by far the best beer I've had. I'm an IPA or dark stout guy by heart, and while there's tons of great barrel aged and rare stouts out there, this is just my favorite beer overall. No alcohol apparent and one must careful with these. I could drink a case of Heady and have to be carried home or to the hospital, just that refreshing.
O- I find it harder to find words for the good ones. This us just the best beer I've ever had, no matter the hype, this deserves to be #1 in my book. 778 charactersEveningCordial, Jun 01, 2014

4.99/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was lucky enough to visit the cannery before it was closed to the public and have been able to get a few cans of Heady from various friends since then. Every time I have one, it's a borderline religious experience.
A: Orange-yellow, hazy, with a good chance of a few floaters. The appearance wasn't a turn off for me, but I can see how it would be for some people, hence the very slight deduction in this category. If you only have one can of Heady, do yourself a favor and follow the recommendation of drinking straight from it. It does make a difference.
S: Pine, loads of citrus, weed, moss. Dank. The first whiff when you open the can is hard to describe but it's amazing. 
T: Huge hop bomb, but what's scary is that it doesn't have any of the bitterness that a lot of DIPAs out there have. It's ridiculously smooth and drinkable. You can literally distinguish every note of this beer, whether it's the citrus, pine, weed/moss- there isn't one note that overpowers the next. And you can pick out something different in every sip. Simply amazing.
M: This is another category that I think really sets Heady apart from other DIPAs, including Pliny. I personally prefer the silkier and thicker unfiltered mouthfeel of Heady. Others may not have this preference, but I think the added body really adds to the whole experience. 
O: Heady Topper is the real deal. I can honestly say it is the best beer I have ever had. I'm always a little sad when I'm finishing my last can because I know it'll be a while before I'll be able to get another. I just wish the Alchemist would start distributing in Boston... 1,610 charactersVTbrewfan, May 30, 2014

4.99/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5So this is my first review as I am new to BA. I have been drinking this beer for sometime. My profile picture is off my trunk leaving Waterbury VT, I found a place that didn't have a case limit (like most do) so my trip was very productive.
I love IPAs and this is tops for me right now. It is perfectly balanced and just makes you happy while drinking. 
The color is golden and hazy
Pine and citrus notes
Finish is smooth and delicious. It has staying power and doesn't dissipate anytime soon
Hit the Prohibition Pig and had it on draught, I preferred it out of the can to be perfectly honest.
Truly a must have for ANYONE. Most of the time you hear how good a beer is it never lives up to the hype...THIS DOES.

A: Hazy, straw yellow, and cloudy (I know it's supposed to be cloudy). White frothy head, with good retention. 
S: Pine, citrus, diesel, a bit of peach, and severely dank. Sweet malts on the back end. Outstanding! One of the best smelling DIPA's I've ever put my nose to.
T: Big hop profile. Bitter, flavorful, drinkable and full bodied. Well rounded. Tastes just like it smells. Big pine, citrus, and diesel notes. There's an undercurrent of peach married with the very clean malt backbone on this beer.
M: Surprisingly drinkable and clean. No bad aftertaste. No off flavors. It doesn't weigh down the pallet too much. It doesn't leave the mouth dry or sticky.
O: For a 9.2% beer, this one's got the goods. Refreshing on a hot day, or sipping on during a brisk fall afternoon. 887 charactersMicroBeerMan1980, May 28, 2014

The smell was worth the cost of beer. The pine taste lasts long after your last drink and makes you want to open another. 
I think it is better out of glass, even though it said to drink out of can.
Overall I think Heady Topper is the perfect beer for hop-heads. 372 charactersibu4u, May 24, 2014

A: Hazy yellow. Gorgeous blood orange throughout. Quarter finger head with gentle pour that coats the top of the beer and recedes to look like a map and lingers around the edges of the glass. Decent lacing. 
S: Clean crisp citrus. Orange peel all the way. 
T: I'm glad when this element is the highlight, and it is with this one. Sweet and juicy. Fresh squeezed OJ. Tangerine. Perfect amount of bitter. Slight candied sugar.
M: Fresh citrus coats the entire mouth.  Bitter notes dance upon the tongue and cheeks but are balanced out just in time to not be overly aggressive. 
O: Incredibly well balanced IPA... Medley of sweet, citrus and bitter flavors play perfectly off of one another. One I will continue to snag without question when the right opportunity presents itself. Wish I could make this my "regular heady" Disc Golf beer. 918 charactersBoski, May 24, 2014

So I guess it's fair to say I wasn't a hop head. The aroma is what first got me. Like a bowl of freshly cut tropical fruit. The mouthfeel is down right dairy-like. Creamy and not too thin. There is a perfect balance of bitterness and malty undertones. I live 5 hours (10 round trip) from the nearest retailer and I regularly make the trip to obtain HT. If you get the chance, don't pass it up. 481 charactersSpecialPatrolGroup, May 23, 2014

4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This has been on my wants list for almost 2 years. I am going to try to be as open minded. If you would have told me 5 years ago that the #1 beer in the world would be from a can I would have said you were crazy. Lets see.
A strong pour generates two fingers of foamy thick yellow tan head. Retention is very good and spotty lace is left behind barely. Body is a hazy honey orange in tone. Really pretty standard for the style. Just hard to get excited about this tone.
Nose is prickly and piney all in one. Citrus rind and sweet marmalade play all surrounding a generally musky tone that carries this wonderful scent. Truely sweet nose in terms of what you usually expect from a big IPA.
And then you get it. With first sip you immediately are greeted by such a unique hop profile. Bold hop goodness attacks the mouth. Its almost like sucking on a whole hop cone. Full of dynamically bitter hoppines from the moment it hits the tongue all the way through the nicely long lingering mouthfeel. Pineapple and musky pine play in the entire palate.
This is a truely wonderful beer. I would easily put it up there with the top 5 I have ever had the pleasure of trying. 1,167 charactersSPLITGRIN, May 23, 2014

Smells really good. Big, dank hop nose leaning towards the pine spectrum.
Taste is very intense. Immediately reminds me of Stone Ruination. It's about all hops with some subtle cues to the malt body.
Mouthfeel is medium to light for a double ipa! I had to double check the can. It's real nice though. Has a bit of stickiness, a bit of dryness.
Overall I think the beer is great. I had a vertical of it next to Pliny the Elder. Heady Topper definitely blew my palate out. I've drank hundreds of IPAs. I don't think it really lent itself 100% to my taste preferences for hop but it was damn good. I'm a bigger fan of the citrus, grapefruit west coast style IPA.
Either way, super glad I got to try this. The beer has eluded me for years and I finally got to give it a go last night. Sweet! 912 charactersdjbreezy, May 16, 2014

S - The smell of this brew is delightful. Hoppy and a little sweet, but not in the least bit overwhelming. 
T - Well what can I say. On first sip I was shocked. I thought to myself what is the big deal. Then I had a second sip and then a third and it started to come together. This is a strong hoppy beer without the palate pinching bitterness of some of the higher IBU competitors.
M - I need to reference my above comment about palate pinching bitterness. This ale just does not have it. I don't feel the need to brush my teeth after having one. It is so well balanced.
O - I admit I went to try this beer on reputation. It really is as great as advertised. Of course everyone has their own tastes. Enjpy! 903 charactersGemmett71, May 10, 2014
4.35/5  rDev -6.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25L: What a beautiful can!
A: Big pine needle, zesty citrus, and soft fruit, very aromatic out of the can. Malt is noticeable as a slightly toasty breadiness and there is an amazing peach-like ester profile that melds with the hops.
T/M: Smooth bitterness upfront, moves into intense, pine needle and stonefruit hop character with tropical and spicy complexities. The malt character is slightly more prominent than the aroma, creating a light, toasty bread character that moves into a drying finish and a slick mouthfeel. Very complex, but the hops are always at the for-front, and the bitterness is never overly prominent. In a couple words, perfectly balanced.
Overall, this is one of the most well-balanced and complex IPAs I have ever had. I can totally understand why this is the highest rated beer on the site. The flavor is nearly perfect, and as long as you don't mind haze or drinking out of the can there is very little that you could find at fault about his beer. Every phase of the brewing process contributes to the flavor of the beer. Hops, malt, peachy esters from the 'Conan' yeast, as well as numerous intricacies I am sure only the brewing staff is aware of (ie water profile). This is a real ale, so many brewers seem to be taking the IPA away from the malt and yeast character and this one embraces them and finds balance with them. This beer is a true beer. 1,379 charactersSiriusfisherman, May 10, 2014

The locals consider this the Miller Lite of VT but what a flipping awesome ML it is. I had this after 3 HF IPA/PAs and it still stood out as awesome on its own so that speaks to its epicness. 
I have to say though the can is definitely the better route. It holds more of the hop profile that HT is known for.
Most already know the flavor specs so just thought Id share my experience and say the locals I spoke with rate this just behind Double Sunshine for the States best Double IPA...if only that wasn't an even more rare "whale." But whatever I'm just thrilled to have now had HT in my life. 770 charactersoldmankoch, May 10, 2014

This is definitely the best IPA I've ever had. It survived UPS shipping to Ohio and still was good cold the next day.
A friend of mine and I split a can together and each taste was better than the last.
Highly recommend and would drink again for sure. 300 charactersJpinoniemi, May 09, 2014

Pouring it reveals a normal yellow beer, nothing spectacular about the color, but the aroma that comes out of the can immediately after opening it is crazy. It releases a very strong aroma of pine and hops. Taste is very bitter, very piney, but refreshing and thin. You could drink a few of these and just think of how amazing this beer is. 488 charactersJulioH, May 08, 2014

APPEARANCE: The color falls somewhere between straw pale and a very light orange. A strong head forms with the first pour and it sticks around for a while. Lacing is a little spotty, but still manages to cover a good 40% of the back of the glass.
SMELL: A lot of pine, a touch of grass and a good dose of grapefruity citrus with some hints of tropical fruit. Not as intense an aroma as I would have expected.
TASTE: This is a hoppy beer. The hops are there for the whole sip, from beginning to end, in full force. Early on there is a light toffee flavor to balance the aggressively orange citrus flavor. As the beer nears the finish the bitterer, grassy hop flavors kick in for a strong finish.
MOUTHFEEL: Medium to light in body, but more towards the medium side. The Heady Topper is dry all the way through, which makes me very happy. Carbonation is light, but with a nice little sparkle. 
OVERALL: OK, the comparison must be made…I love this beer, but Pliny is better. And I may be a West Coast snob, but there are a few other West Coast IPAs that I would prefer to this. For lack of a better term this is not as “bright” a beer as some others in the category. It is certainly more balanced, but that is not always what I’m looking for in a Double IPA. 1,339 charactersStoneTSR, May 06, 2014

Appearance - Hazy orange colour with a medium size head. Left good lacing
Smell - Floral, grapefruit, dank pine and resin some more tropical fruits 
Taste - Orange peel, pineapple, pine resin, tropical fruits, slight alcohol taste. Hops are major punch to the mouth
Overall - Glad I got to try this one once just to say I did. However I don't think it's worth the trouble that people go to to get it. While it is a great DIPA it's up to each person to decide whether its worth the hype 502 charactersDna_Infinity, May 05, 2014

4.25/5  rDev -8.6%Based on the last few cans of Heady Topper that I've had I have to down grade the rating a bit.  I wish there was a better way of distinguishing which year or version of Heady Topper this is because it's not the same as it once was. Having said that, I did a blind tasting on 8/29/14 with the recent batches of Focal Banger, Rapture, The Crusher and Heady Topper.
It was the third lightest in color of the 4 beers with a hazy golden color.  On the nose I got passion fruit, citrus peel, wet pine, orange pulp.  I have to say these Alchemist beers are great on the nose. 
The taste: I got some slight bitterness and some citrus.  There wasn't a pop or anything special and at 8% I could still get a lot of the alcohol so the balance was a bit off for me. 
Overall my blind guess was that this was Rapture but I was wrong.  In my humble opinion I put Heady over Rapture but way behind The Crusher and Focal Banger.  I think Heady needs to get it's act together. It is no longer the #1 beer in BA. 997 charactersDCLAguy11, May 05, 2014

A: fucking can is beautiful.
S: grapefruit rind, lemon, lime zest, mint, and pine. Mild breadiness. Very intense aroma as soon as the can is opened its a shotgun of aroma
T: a lot of grapefruit up front. Blend of complex citrus...orange lemon, lime. Finish is mostly citrus but mild herbs like mint and a balanced pine to keep the citrus in check. Mild malt bready background but hops are the main assault.
M: a creaminess floods the mouth and bubbles all around but dissipates to a nice wetness in the mouth and slowly a dryness settles in. Fantastic wave of complex mouthfeel that sets this apart.
O: they werent trying to make the hoppiest DIPA out there, but they did. This is a beast. Intense in aroma, taste and a creamy thick mouthfeel. But it remains very drinkable. A 4 pack would be too filling but whose drinking a 4 pack of this. Sip, savor, enjoy. Excellent excellent beer. So far, one of a kind and deserves the hype. 1,021 charactersjageraholic, May 02, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured into an IPA glass. Directly contrary to what the can says, I know, but it would be a shame not to see this beer. Super hazy pale orange color, with tons of bubbles rising up through the liquid, and a super thick off-white head that blankets the glass in lace as it slowly fades.
Aroma is an amazing array of hop flavors - pineapple, grapefruit, evergreen, cat pee, onion grass, etc. etc. etc. It seems like pretty much every descriptor of hop aroma could be attributed to this beer. A tiny bit of a light biscuity flavor makes itself known as well.
Follows the nose - just an amazing array of hop flavors. It really has every hop flavor you could desire in an IPA all rolled up into one, with none of the flavors overpowering any of the others. There is the perfect amount of biscuity malt to keep it from careening over the edge of hoppiness. Finish is just bitter enough, with a little less bitterness than the palate might suggest, and the aftertaste is pleasantly citrusy.
The mouthfeel is shockingly creamy and buttery. Moderately thick with lots of carbonation. Perfect for the flavor profile.
Overall, I feel a little ridiculous to be giving it a perfect 5, but there's really nothing I would change about this beer, and it embodies everything I love about IPAs. It definitely lives up to the hype, although I do have to admit I was disappointed on my first sip because I expected it to be God. And then I took another couple sips and all my disappointment faded away. I should mention that this was pretty fresh - cans purchased on 4/25/14, so I imagine they were brewed pretty soon before that, but unfortunately, there's no date. 1,650 charactersMasterfulIdiot, May 01, 2014

A- Deep hazy golden with a dense as can be. Intense lacing. Absolutely love the unfiltered look. 
S- Wow. Can be picked up from 3 feet away. Huge citrus aroma. Grapefruit pith with biscuity pale malts. 
T- Hop forward of course, but the balance impeccable. Finishes dry and bitter without roasting your taste buds. A few waves of west coast hop character dance over the tongue. Quite resinous and pith-like.
M- Mid body, creamy to a degree, with a lingering dryness with each sip. 
O- A beer that my wife and I enjoyed on our second anniversary. It is a serious IPA that brings it with the hops, but remains so balanced. I would still prefer PtE and a handful of other IPAs over this one, but I can see why this one gets so much love. 837 charactersBosoxfan20, Apr 29, 2014

Equal to La Cumbre Elevated IPA and Pliny the Elder for my taste buds. I just wish I could try all three at the same sitting.

Hazy, unfiltered, fluffy off white head which clings to my glass. Yes, I used a glass. 
Dank resinous hop smell. spicy woodsy pine, and citric oils. 
Explosion of resinous pine and citrus rinds. Mixture of grapefruit and lemon. Spicy, musky, and full of depth. Rare a call a beer dank, but it applies here. Malt back bone, although not cloying or sweet like some DIPAs, does an amazingly job at balancing out the huge complex hop profile. 
Mouthfeel is full, carbonation is biting. 
Overall, having one of these fresh as opposed to a few months old is a game changer. I wrote my previous experiences off as a beer with too much hype. But being able to enjoy fresh examples has made me into a believer. 884 charactersIeatlambfries, Apr 27, 2014

4.72/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Purchased 2.22.14 from the Montpelier Discount Beverage and Redemption Center.
Drank 4.26.14, poured from a can into a Lagunitas Mason Glass.
We were on a mission to find this beer, and after a grueling drive up from NYC through blizzard conditions we were barely able to acquire anything to bring back with us. Luckily, the local bars of Montpelier had more than enough supply to keep a half dozen thirsty beer guys from burning down the capital of Vermont after discovering they purchased the last six 4-packs in a ten mile radius. 
However, when you hear (after the fact) that a line forms on Friday mornings at Hunger Mountain Coop, two hours before opening, and that they sold out their entire 4,320 can delivery in less than 90 minutes, you realize you never stood a chance, and to be thankful you found anything to bring back, and even more thankful than McGillicuddy's Pub not only doesnt overcharge for Heady, but that they have tons of it. Anyways, on to the important stuff...
A: Cloudy honey coloring, no visible particulates, lots of visible carbonation immediately after pouring, one finger of crisp white head, leaves a few small traces of lacing.
S: I never seem to pinpoint much of the aromas found in DIPAs, but if I had to try, I would say Tangerine, Grapefruit zest, Lemon grass, and a few other tropical notes... maybe Mango. Whatever you 'think' it smells like, it smells fantastic, and is definitely a beer built for the nose.
T: Immediate taste of pine, then the aforementioned tropical fruits, and then finally, a lingering hop heavy, but malty finish. Not enough to overwhelm, but just enough to remind you that yes, this is a DIPA loaded with savory hops for your enjoyment, but also big enough to knock you on your ass after two pints.
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, with a slight oily retainer. The residue remains long after the initial sip, enough to remind you that you need to keep drinking, but not enough to ruin your tastebuds. Just what I want, and expect out of a high end DIPA.
O: A beer that suffers from its own success. Make no mistake, Heady is a fantastic beer, one of the best I have ever had, but the hype machine is far too powerful. I would put it in the same category as Double Sunshine, Hopslam, Double Daisy Cutter, and Dreadnaught, with no clear winner...and I dont consider that a slight. That is heavy company. 2,377 charactersuntitledeuphoria, Apr 26, 2014

Excited to finally try this beer.
A- Pours a murky orange about two fingers of head that settles to just a small top layer. They say to drink from the can but I am one of those people who prefer an unfiltered beer that is cloudy. Im not a big clear beer person so this gets high scores for me. Such a beautiful beer.
S- Hop bomb. Tropical citrus fruit notes, Big bold Peach, Little bit of resiny pine/grass. Everything seems to be in perfect balance. This beer smells like the creater brewed it hundreds of times just to get the right smell ratio. 
T- Oranges, Grapefruit,Peach,lemon, slight pine/grass aftertaste. Sweet malt backing up all the hops. This beer is a showcase for the hops, nothing more nothing less. You get everything from the smell except even better. If I could give this a 5.25 I would.
M-Substantial high end of medium bodied. fruity, then bitter. Not a harsh bitterness though this is a carefully calculated bitterness. It's very pleasant. Is the bittering addition all hop extract? 
O-Some reviews may be skewed because the hype behind this beer. It has a lot to live up to before you even try it. That may seem unfair but this beer surpassed my expectations. This is the Michael Jordan of beers circa 89-97 It is going to score 30 a night on you and not give a shit if you planned on stopping it. Is it the best beer in the world? I have no clue I haven't tried every beer yet. I do know its the best beer I have ever had, and I've had a lot of them. John is a Hop Whisperer and I will drink his beers anytime I get a chance to. 1,593 charactersEvahflow, Apr 20, 2014

I was pleasantly surprised that they had it.
I only care about taste so here it goes. I generally don't like IPAS because they are bitter. Some bitterness is OK. There are two things to know. 1) This one is not bitter at all. 2) this is very hoppy.
Having said that, this is one of the best IPAs that I have ever had. But it is in all honesty, just a good version of Budweiser. A very good version. Point being that I don't understand all the fuss. I could name 20 beers that I'd rather have than drink this ever again. It's honestly not all that special unless you prefer IPAs above all else.. 671 characterskfh227, Apr 18, 2014

However upon having a can to myself, straight from the can, I can definitely see why HT is so highly regarded. 397 charactersjsunj, Apr 18, 2014

I enjoyed enough to skip over to 240 Pearl Street and buy a case of 24 for roughly $88 USD. In case anybody wants to load up, delivery for Heady Topper is on Tuesday, so make sure you go when a delivery is imminent or shortly thereafter. Sitting around today and on my third can right now, and each one sheds more light on why this beer is so popular. It tastes light...fresh...and just bottom line - a real nice IPA.

Although, the level if IBU's have been consistent at times I can have one where the hoppiness really comes through while other times it is more gradual and the notes are released with perfection. I know that the brewery has other brews that it releases in limited quantities, but I hope they can try and produce the other options with a bit more releases then they currently offer. But no complaints they are staying true to their brew and "Heady Topper" is always on my list of brews that I would have on any given day. 611 charactersSovietBear1982, Apr 16, 2014

I now understand why it is the #1 beer on BA. My favorites were always Pliny the Elder and Enjoy by. This one boasts them both. I immediately opened a Pliny to compare while I still had some Heady left at the bottom of my glass. To me, the Heady looks much better. The PtE is clear and the Heady is cloudy with yummy goodness. The Heady smells scrumptious and emits a better aroma. The PtE is crisp and clean and the Heady is complex tasting. PtE is a bit more carbonated than the Heady, however, I believe this Heady is nowhere near as fresh as the PtE. In the end, I love them both. 
If I were to be stranded in the mountains for any amount of time and I had to select one of these to keep me company, I would have to select the Heady, and the PtE would be his backup.
Nauseatingly good. 927 charactersmabermud, Apr 16, 2014

Limited Distribution + Good Brew = Cult Following
I did the taste test with it and Pliny and yes it's better than Pliny in my opinion HOWEVER I think there are better DIPA's than both beers out there.
O - It's a more complex IPA which I liked about it. There is a bigger malt presence and therefore not as bitter as some out there. I liked it better out of the can, which actually balanced the beer out. The beer pours like a hefeweizen. It's a great beer, but I don't know that I'd want it over some of the local options I have. 704 charactersICMTM, Apr 14, 2014

Poured into a teku, because I am a badass.
A: Beautiful glowing dark orange. Translucent, hazy. Cream colored head that disappears after a while and leaves huge gobs of uneven sticky lacing.
S: Pine, green tea, orange, peach, mango, grass.
T: Pine, mango, grassy, candied fruit. The age may have diluted this. I remember it popping more when fresh.

T - Semi sweet up front followed by a building development of hops; citrus, zest, fruity, dry, resinous. Finishes dry and bitter. Flavor lingers. 
O - First of two cans I acquired from a trade. Phenomenal DIPA - unlike really any other brew I've had - can't just place it in a category saying it taste like X Beer.

I've had it in a tulip glass to try and accentuate the hops, and took the Kimmich recommendation and drank from the can. Both are great, but prefers a straight from the can approach. And here's why:
In the glass, very orange and murky. Light and pronounced head.
In the can - nothing but a fantastic and constant hop-slam in your face.
In the glass, hop presence remains, and as the beer warms, the various hop aromas come into play. 
In the can - hop complexity - this baby will keep you guessing with each sip.
Mouthfeel - for a DIPA, it is deceiving - fruity, smooth, not overly bitter - quite accessible. 
Is it the best DIPA ever? It's hard to give it a perfect score, because it means there's no opportunity for another to surpass it - but this is one of a few to emulate - sets the standard. 
Last point - had one fresh, had one 'aged' in my fridge for several months, mostly because it was the last one and I was afraid to let it go. For best flavour and overall experience? Drink this baby fresh. It was meant to. 1,113 charactersFiveByFive, Apr 09, 2014

Smell / Nose: Smells strongly of fresh cut grass, rich hops, pine and citrus tones. 
Taste: Big Grapefruit flavor, apricots, smooth creamy, but hoppy finish. The can is right, its very drinkable. 
Mouthfeel: It has a slight mineral taste, like spring water. Each sip leaves your mouth clean and extremely pleasant, your pallet is fresh after every sip making it very drinkable.

Well, the can orders you to drink from the can, so I did that first. Okay, I can see why this has a following. And not just because of the obvious: yes it's ridiculously hard to get hold of outside Vermont. Or inside Vermont, frankly. At least as of this date in early 2014- I drove to the Hunger Mountain Coop in Montpelier VT on an early spring Friday and dutifully waited in line with folks from all over (like literally- the couple from Switzerland standing next to me included) for 3pm to roll around.
People who know me know I don't taste hard-to-get beer haphazardly. I do this scientifically. This is my 107th IPA I've formally reviewed (I've only posted a handful of reviews here on BA..but they are comprehensive :), and I always have a control IPA I know well as a taste reference. My usual control, Two Hearted, was sadly not available at Hunger Mountain. I went with one of my fave SD brews they had available, Green Flash West Coast. For good measure, I threw in a Maine Lunch that happened to be available at the Coop (effing score!)
On to the head-to-Heady review (after pouring into Worthy glasses):
Appearance: quite yellow for an IPA. Clarity: not cloudy...impossible to see through. Very little head on the Heady
Nose: hops, pure and unadulterated. I'm getting hardly anything else. Maybe a hint of citrus, but it may just be left over in my nostrils after the West Coast (or Maine Lunch, which has similar color, a bit more clarity, and a really sweet fruity nose).
Now to where it counts, down the gullet: Overwhelmingly full mouthfeel. Creamy. More creamy full hop than I think I've ever tasted. Which is saying something.
And the verdict: Honestly? Too much. Weedy. Here's the jist of it: IT TASTES LIKE YOU'RE DRINKING PURE HOPS & KIND BUD WHIPPED UP IN A BLENDER WITH PURE O2 AND MOUNTAIN SPRING WATER.
Yes, I know that statement may now drive a whole new wave of people to consider this beer the unattainable holy grail. It's definitely not a bad beer. Not at all. But in reality, after the first few sips, vs other really good IPAs, it's maybe A LITTLE MUCH. As a drinkable beer, the Maine Lunch I'm having beside it wins. Solidly. But this shiz is def worth trying sometime. Holy crap.
UPDATE: Despite losing in the head-to-head with Maine's Lunch IPA in my initial review, there really is something about the incredible mouthfeel and DRINKABLE intense hoppiness that keeps calling me back to the fridge for another can instead of trading. It really is a surprisingly unique IPA experience and not just a case of scarcity helping ratings. After several more, I feel I need to give Heady even better scores in a couple areas.
It's quickly becoming an addiction, and not the right addiction to have for those of us living on the opposite side of the country. Damn you, Alchemist. 2,853 charactersmewanderinghome, Apr 06, 2014
4.99/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed from a 16 oz can as instructed.
A - Poured some out into a shot glass to see what it looks like. Pale pilsen color. The body is hazy from the yeast and hop resin. I enjoy the minimalist design approach of the can as well.
S - The smell of hops wafts tremendously from the open can. Scents of peaches, flowers, grass, and a touch of resin fill the nostrils. Delightful.
T - Even better than the smell. A rush of tropical fruit and ripe orange taste assaults the tongue. Just a touch of pine to remind you that the flavors come from hops, not actual fruit. Compared to other famous DIPAs, there is no discernible onion/garlic/savory taste at all. The malt backbone is appropriately sweet and balanced, but really serves as a showcase for the amazing hops. A touch of bitterness hits the palate toward the end, but astoundingly does not linger. The aftertaste is of the tropical fruit and honey.
M - Wonderfully creamy with enough viscosity to remind you of the 8% ABV. Carbonation is present but inconspicuous so as not to distract from everything else going on.
O - This beer is seriously good and perhaps the best DIPA I have ever tasted. Whereas there is usually something lacking in even the best of beers, there is nothing I can think of to make this beer better. Believe the hype. 1,297 charactersporter_collie, Apr 06, 2014

I absolutely love Sculpin IPA and have been looking for a beer that exceeds the aroma, taste and feel. I found it and surpassed it with this beer!
Smell is excellent and the taste is excellent. I love the aftertaste that is still on my tongue as I'm typing this out. Lots of citrus and pine and all the great things I love in a double IPA.
This wins over sculpin and Pliny IMO. 
Just wish I had another can! 521 characters16hourdrive, Apr 05, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I went into my first Heady Topper with great expectations. My friend, whose beer opinion I've trusted since the 7th grade, really talked great things about this beer. It really intrigued me about how good he said it was. So I decided to get my Google on and do some research. Every rating site I found gave it tremendous reviews. Thousands of reviews and all of them were extremely high ratings. I found myself determined to track this brew down!
Long story short. So, somehow, I eventually managed to get my hands on The Alchemist Heady Topper. (Thanks Zach!) Any who, here is my opinion:
Appearance - Couple things. I love the book, "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coehlo, and I love the appearance of this can. Haha! The head exploding with hops is a great symbol of what this beer is capable of.
Smell -The fresh aroma of hops released when this can opens makes my mouth water in anticipation.
Taste - I loved the taste. Delicious hoppy taste that really resonated on my tongue with each and every sip. Probably the best beer I've ever tasted.
Mouthfeel - A smooth and creamy feel that made me cherish each sip. Drinking this beer fast is a crime in my opinion. A nice slow drawn out sip will bring forth the flavors and delight fullness that beer advocates have craved since the cavemen discovered fire.
Overall - I'm drinking my 3rd ever Heady Topper as I type this and all I can think of is how honored this beer makes me feel. The Alchemist Heady Topper was only meant to be drank by a chosen few. Because, by Odin's beard, this is the mead of gods!!! 1,559 characterskess_419, Apr 05, 2014

A- This was very interesting to me. When I poured it from the can it looked a lime green. But once it's in the glass it is a dark yellow, off gold color. The head is about an inch and is off white. The head goes away after a few minutes but maintains a nice lace that covers the whole top of the beer.
S- When I first popped the tab I got hit in the face with tropical fruits. There's so much grapefruit, orange, lemon, pineapple, and apricot. There's a sticky sweetness in the back of the nose that is similar more to a syrup more than a sugar, if that make sense. The hops are huge in this beer. There's an excellent mix between bitterness and grass, floral characters in there. There's even a lightness in the smell. 
T- I tasted this from both the can and the glass to decide which tastes better (there's an ongoing debate regarding this). First from the can; the hops hit first with a bitterness which then changes into tropical fruits with pineapple, grapefruit and apricot as the most prevalent. The malt is way more detectable in the taste (as it should be probably) which tastes really sweet. It finishes with a bitterness on the back of the tongue and a floral grassy, taste that remains for a long long time. The longer it sits the better it gets. Now, from the can; The fruits are the first thing I taste from the can. Then the malt sits in and smooths out the taste with a bit of syrup and then the bitterness hits. The aftertaste is very similar to the glass. 
M- thick, bitter and fruity. It's not bitter enough to make it hard to drink but just enough to cut up your mouth a little bit. In a really good way. The bitterness escalates as it sits on the tongue after the swallow. 
O- An awesome beer. Probably my favorite IPA now, It's between this and sucks. This beer has a great balance between hops and malt. The hops are great and everything from top to bottom is great in this beer. I honestly think though that the beer is better in the can than the glass, you get a much higher concentration on flavor and aroma. 2,093 charactersmlhyatt, Apr 03, 2014

A: Very cloudy (murky?) with some large-ish sediment floating around. Heady is an unfiltered beer, but this this seems excessive and other similar unfiltered DIPAs do not have this problem. The beers pours a nice orangey color and forms a huge, thick white head and leaves nice lacing behind.
**Edit: Having a few more cans of Heady, I have found the sediment to much less in other cans leaving the pour very hazy/cloudy which is fine by me! Therefore, increased the appearance score from 3.25 to 4.0 to 4.25**
S: To die for! A massive hop nose dripping of pine tar and grapefruit.
T: Hops again with big grapefruit and other citrus flavors (sweet oranges and tangerines) as well as though classic American bittering hops drying the beer out a bit. Complimenting this heavy hops regiment is the perfect malt profile balancing out the brew. A long dry clean finish.
M: Medium body and carbonation. Very clean and round.
O: This is just a great balanced beer! It is not the hoppiest beer nor the maltiest, but it achieves perfect balance and is incredibly easy drinking. One of the few double/imperial IPAs that leaves your primed for a second! 1,219 charactersmtomlins, Mar 31, 2014

A: The can is clean and simple in design and appeals to my OCD engineer side. Pour it into a glass and it is a nice hazy caramel color.
T: Hops pure, unadulterated hops! Grapefruit again, lots of pine . . . Hey but where is the bitterness, just enough to clean the palate or the next gulp. No real alcohol, just citrus and pine.
M: This is the genius of this beer, too many DIPAs leave a syrupy film in your mouth, but with each gulp of this you get a smooth feel followed by a slight crisp that leaves your mouth refreshed and ready, no begging, for the next.
O: So far the best I have ever had, maybe stupid but this beer has been life altering, I have been searching for HT's equal for 3+ yrs. A couple times I have thought to myself "wow this is kinda like heady!" but a few sips later and they all become too bitter or too sweet/syrupy. I have been lucky enough to do a side by side camparo of heady and Pliny but it was not even close and I had to assume that something was wrong with the Pliny, maybe it was old? Anyway, hope to try it again some day. 1,183 charactersVTEno17, Mar 31, 2014

like others, i was a skeptic, wondering how much better could this beer really be compared to dirt wolf, hopslam, other top knotch ipas, etc. Well for me, the hype is real. IMO, this is a perfectly crafted, well executed representation of a DIPA. Now that i have began home brewing, i have a new appreciation for what it takes to craft a delicious beer. From the nose right on through to the mouthfeel, this brew is outstanding. sip after sip you continue to taste just the most absolute fresh, juicy, dank, hop flavor. mouthfeel is sticky, medium bodied and almost creamy.
definitely my new favorite beer. well done Alchemist, Well done. 810 charactersEurso16, Mar 27, 2014

4.83/5  rDev +3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75A long time coming for this review. Two of my great friends brought back 2 cases. I went into this the same way it sounds like a lot of people do. very excited BUT somewhat skeptical. How can everyone agree that this is one of the best beers no matter what your personal preference in style is? Well...just because it is. Luckily my favorite beers are imperial IPA's. The can says Heady Topper, but I almost instantly nick named it 'rolling thunder' for two reasons. 1. Its got a high ABV in a 16 oz serving. 2. because its rolling waves of super deep hop, after hop, after hop. Each wave releases a different flavor that ignites your mouth with an assertive force and refuses to leave after you're done drinking it. It takes about 5-10 minutes for it linger away. My favorite part of this wonder is the very middle. There becomes a blast of grapefruit dryness in the middle that is incredibly apparent. You might say its sweet because its a very bright flavor but its not sweet in any sugary artificial way. I think the moment when the middle grapefruit blast hits is the best because of the waves of pine and floral hops that come on the front, and back ends before you reach that middle peak explosion. It has an awesome body that you can really feel on your palate, and has an aromatic smell that you can not ignore.
SO. that all being said.
A - Awesome. really cool looking (slightly funny) can. I poured a tiny bit out to see what it looked like for real. Musky greenish/deep brownish yellow. Almost completely non-transparent.
S - A piny hoppy blast straight to the dome that is noticeable from the moment you crack the can.
T - Insanely awesome. Rolling waves of hops that include pine, grapefruit, and slight floral notes.
M - A medium body on the heavier side. Lacing up your mouth with goodness.
O - You know you want one...or 10. Its awesome. Do your self a favor and make the trip to buy a case! 1,914 charactersChilly444, Mar 24, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Ok so the beer is perfect. I have been drinking it for a while and it never disappoints nor does it become old. the flavors are always fresh tasting and always exciting. the first time I drank it it I poured it into a glass because I thought the "Drink out of the can" was hype. Incredible as the taste out of the glass was, it was otherworldly out of the can. The initial whiff of the hops when you pop it open is Ecstasy. The promise of a great beer to come delivers on your first sip and then the magic happens as each sip brings out different flavors from bitter to sweet back to bitter all in different stages. 
I received the new IPA glasses as a gift and drank the Heady Topper from it. Sacrilegious I thought to myself. The glasses do a great job as the initial aroma is less dramatic and more subtle which is not a bad thing. Now I get to admire the color of this golden nectar. 888 characterstony11, Mar 23, 2014

M: A medium bodied mouthfeel that leaves the tongue salivating for more. 
O: I have been searching for this beer for a while and it did not disappoint! I will have the next one in a glass to compare the taste. Heady Topper is a must try for any IPA and IIPA fans! 682 characterscontrolfate, Mar 21, 2014

A honey-like sweetness and very floral.
Bread and not quite grapefruit but still a tangy fruit flavor. Spicy and not quite as sweet as the nose. Not bitter, as advertised, but a little metallic (or maybe alcoholic). I saw it's a combination of six hops, the only one I'm sure of is simcoe. After that, possibly cascade, possibly amarillo. 
A softer finish, kind of a sticky beer. 427 characterspants678, Mar 21, 2014

It's not some revelatory flavor that doesn't exist in any other beers, it's the combination of those flavors and how everything is perfectly balanced. It's the Goldilocks soup of beers, just right. 
The hop blend is a perfect balance of dank, fruity and floral and the alcohol has a nice drying effect without being overly hot. 
I do believe the Conan yeast gives it's a unique fruity character as well. 
Vermont is quickly becoming the best beer producing state in the country. 584 charactersChrisfarleywine, Mar 18, 2014

You do not see, you cannot smell correctly and it looks cheap! Anyway, I did obey what the can says and I did drink it out of the can. 
Tasted in two serving, first time is out of the can, as prescribed, and second time is poured into a glass. No big difference in smell/taste between the two servings. But at least I could appreciate its golden slightly orange colour. Looks hazy and forming a nice head with some lacing. 
N- Immediately at opening, a delightful smell emerged from this can. How this amazing smell comes out of this? Mesmerised, totally impressed! Explosive notes of hops resins, very citrusy, pink grapefruit, tropical fruits upfront with herbal undertones (cannabis). Very floral. WOW
M &T-mouth is extremely pleasant, more dry the expected as from the nose revealed at first. Bitterness is biting strong at the very beginning but not overshooting. Feeling is slick, almost creamy. Tremendous amounts of flavours are released on firsts sip. Explosive taste of hops resins, citrus and tropical fruits, pink grapefruits. Carbonation is moderate/low which is perfect for a DIPA. Perfectly balanced, Highly drinkable. 
Overall, a PERFECT DIPA ! Perfectly balanced on all levels. Would enjoy over and over again. A definitely must have for all hophead. 
Thanks to the Church Street beverage manager who point this beer out and picked it up for me, because I would have skip this beer while making my choices the last time I was there. Today, I can tell you I would have made a great mistake. I regret that I only had one four-pack! 1,646 charactersblaje, Mar 17, 2014

I drank from the can, as instructed. 
The smell crushes your nose with all of the citrus fruits. You almost don't think its beer.
The taste is a hop utopia with the perfect amount of bitter. Finishes very clean. Wide-mouth + tall boy can makes the gulps large and satisfying. You don't want the beer to end and it doesn't. The last sip was better than the first. Everything balances. Taste sensations come on in waves.
Mouthfeel is perfect. I don't know how else to describe it. Not thin, not thick. Medium carbonation. Dangerously drinkable.
Completely sober, this gave me a solid buzz but I never tasted the alcohol. There is a reason this beer is so loved. It is joyously good. 805 charactersBrewsforBreakfast, Mar 16, 2014

§- straight hops, done right. Citrus and pine are prominent with a light hit of alcohol at the end.
T- once again... large, delicious, beautiful, hopsss. It's not like most double ipa's though. This has real flavor. I can tell that the brewer used his skills meticulously. A nice sweet grapefruit prevails, amongst the likes of pine and pride.
M- by far my favorite thing about this brew. Perfect carbonation leads to a buttery bouquet that clings to the pallet.

I HATE drinking beer out of cans, so I defied the recommendation from the brewer and poured my first can into a Samuel Smith English tulip glass, self-serving at just under fifty degrees fahrenheit out of my beer fridge. Not sure how fresh, but BigStein88 visits his old home state of Vermont fairly often, so I doubt if it's more than two months old. 
a: Hazy dark gold, not as hazy as I expected though, although I do see some tiny floaties. Two inch tall white head receded slowly to rocky surface foam and dense lacing.
s: Intense citrus and pine. Later, lawn mower grass clippings. (!)
t: Do not find this as citrusy as on draft. In fact grassiness is the most prominent and persistent flavor, much stronger even than any wet hop ale I have had (yes I know this is not one of those). Moderate hop bite, but little in the way of lingering bitterness as the brewer's text on the can seems to suggest. Blindfolded, I'd have said this is the freshest wet hop IPA ever. 8% alcohol is well concealed in any event.
m: As on draft, moderate, slickish.
o: I want to say this is The Best I've Ever Had. But truth is, and heretical though it is for a New Englander to say, at this point the Pliny the Elder I had last night was even creamier and more enjoyable. Might be my own fault for not following the other part of the brewer's instructions, and pouring it all out into the glass at once rather than saving the yeasty last ounce for a final savory pour. 
The intense grassy flavor is different and very good. Definitely unlike any DIPA I have had, but not what I expected, especially in light of my previous, citrusy rather than grassy taste experience with it fresh at the cannery last August and on draft at the Prohibition Pig in Waterbeery (sic).
Will add more to this essay on Heady when I crack the other can. I'll probably bite the bullet and drink at least part of that out of the can to see if it makes a difference.
In view of the above, am changing my original review ratings: a: 3.5-3.75; s:4-4.25; m: 4.5-4.25
ORIGINAL 8/18/13 REVIEW:
8 oz. draft at the Prohibition Pig pub in Waterbury VT and several ounces more in a mini-snifter at the brewery the same day.
a: A hazy gold with a finger thick white head which dropped to a surface film.
t: Sweet citrusy goodness. Alcohol well hidden. Not as hoppy as I had expected, but very tasty indeed.
m: Moderate, slickish and almost chewy, an impression no doubt reinforced by the cloudiness. Probably why the brewer recommends drinking it straight from the can. Oh if only I had had that opporunity! But alas "CANS SOLD OUT" greeted me at the end of the entrance and the front door at the brewery. 
o: Excellent, appealing, refreshing, all those good things. Whether I would concur it is the best I can't say for sure. I do feel a bit troubled by the fact that I liked Double Sunshine better at the same sitting at The Pig. But I had that first, and they were different. 
I know you know this already, but the friendly gal who poured my sample at the brewery said weekdays are the time to get some in cans. This week they sold out on Thursday. Usually it's Friday. I was there on Saturday, after dinner, around 6 P.M. I had figured they'd be out. But I also visited half a dozen stores where HT was supposed to be available, and even saw two places had hanging signs which read stuff like "Head This Way To The Heady." Nope. 
And Lawson's or Hill Farmstead anything? Forget that too. Trek up to Greesboro in the middle of Nowhere Vermont (sorry, I am sure it is very wonderful up in that part of the Kingdom, it just looks like Nowhereland on my maps) and buy Hill Farmstead at the farm if you want some (and I know you do, I can hear your heavy breathing). Call ahead to make sure they have some. Preferably from across the street. 
Lawsons might show up at the Warren Store on Thursdays. You may have to haunt the place or get a job there. Or go early on the second Saturday to the Waitsfield Farmers Market. Get a ticket from the Lawson's booth. And Waits in the Field until your turn. Are we getting a bit frustrated with limited availability and frantic buying from craftier-than-thou beer connoisseurs yet? After driving a six hour round trip and coming home empty-handed, Yes.
UPDATE 4/7/15: Saved two cans until I could go up again to buy more but it's turned out to be almost a year so far.  Good test of the theory that IPAs go bad quick.  The old Heady I am having now from mid-April 1914 poured mostly foam over hazy orange, receded to thin surface foam and patterned lacing.  Not as hoppy but with loads more grassy notes and added floral notes as well, making this still very enjoyable!    The quality still shines.  Raising my ratings A: 3.75 to 4.25. 4,949 charactersscotorum, Mar 11, 2014

Resin, pine, grapefruit, citrus, anything and everything you can imagine..and can't imagine. Same goes for the flavor. Huge hop explosiveness perfectly balanced by a huge malt backbone. Mouthfeel is absolutely perfect. This beer is so good I just want to ramble on all day about it.
All in all. Best DIPA I've ever had. Lived up to and beyond the hype. 605 charactersBoardwalkBock, Mar 11, 2014

smell is intensely hoppy with undertones of peach type fruit
flavor is waves of hops but not overly bitter.  It's truly amazing how intense the hop flavor is without being over the top bitter
the mouthfeel is incredible, it just rolls off your tongue and down your throat.  Coating everything in its path with the oily, hoppy deliciousness.  I would give it a 5+ for mouthfeel if possible
overall, this beer is truly unique and there's not much out there that comes close.  To me, it's amongst the best, beating out ALL of the big name (you know who you are) ipa's and iipa's hands down. 690 characters2ellas, Mar 09, 2014

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks has to go to nedvalton, a most generous BA'er for hooking me up with my first Heady Topper. As soon as I popped the top on that shiny silver and black can I got blasted with the dankest, hoppiest, fruitiest, hop bombiest goodness I have ever experienced. There's just so much going on with the smell, that I am having a hard time nailing it down. Here goes nothing, grapefruit, pineapple, citrus, Bubblegum surf wax, I swear I'm getting that. This stuff smells exactly like I imagined it would after reading so many of the reviews on here, an absolute delight. I poured about half into a tulip glass so that I could get a good look at it. Pours a super hazy and resinous golden orange hue, minimal head and lacing. It smelled amazing in the can, but the complex aroma really opened up once poured, now I'm even more intrigued. My first sip and all I can say is, YES! Worth all the hype, 100 percent! I've had a few other beers that come real close to this, but the mouthfeel and balance along with the juicy aftertaste make this an absolute work of art in a can! With each sip it gets better and better, the bitterness isn't overwhelming at all, and couple that with the citrusy/fruity/floral undertones that coat your tongue, it's easy to forget that theres alcohol in there. Just like it says on the can "so drinkable, it's scary" Overall I can see why this beer is ranked #1, because it just became my #1 as well. Thank you nedvalton, and thank you Alchemist! 1,469 charactersQwest_35, Mar 08, 2014

3.99/5  rDev -14.2%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Good head but quick dissipation, mild lacing. Cloudy and golden in appearance. Nose is mild-moderate in strength, fruity with no hint of dank-type hop aromas. Taste is very smooth, silky mouthfeel, with moderate-strong but not overwhelming hop profile. It's all peach and grapefruit with no dank character at all, more intense and complex as the beer warms. Only a mild suggestion of the heat in the finish. This is a great beer but perhaps not as world-class a beer as Pliny, in my humble opinion. 498 charactersMaurizio, Mar 08, 2014
4/5  rDev -14%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4My can was said to be super fresh… poured into a New Belgium goblet the hazy and yeast debris was quite heavy. Otherwise, tawny-amber in hue with a sticky white head and plenty of subsequent lacing. 
The nose was lovely, lots of tropical fruits… mango, pineapple and oranges, citrusy and juicy. Quite lovely and inviting. 
The palate didn’t quite delivery the intense hoppiness I would have liked in a DIPA. Big fruit notes follow onto the palate, similar to the nose but with some added pine and a toasty/caramel malt at the finish. Delicious, complex but well-rounded and tasty as hell. Best DIPA on the planet, not IMO. It lacked a strong hop bitterness punch but had ample flavor. A lovely quaff.
Medium in body, modest carbonation… it’s the mouthfeel you’d expect in the style.
Overall, Heady Topper was a great beer and happy as hell I tried it. It won’t go down in my personal Top 10 DIPA. It’s not even an issue of hype because I don’t pay attention to that shit anymore. And excellent beer, tasty as hell and worthy of the praise. 1,061 charactersbditty187, Mar 08, 2014

I've had it probably over 20 times, very hard to get, but they always happen to show up at our beer tastings. I'm not a huge fan of the amount of yeast/sediment in the bottom, but if you pour it just right into a pint glass you can avoid most of the sludge. Very hoppy and very flavorful. 350 charactersGfunk, Mar 05, 2014

T-Taste is smooth grapefruit and citrus, floral tropical notes, light honey-like sweetness accenting lingering pine notes, soft finish. 
M-Mouthfeel has a medium body, incredibly round and well-balanced. Get carbonation.

A- A hazy as heck golden/orange. Big fluffy white head. All sorts of sediment. Strangely beautiful.
S- Simcoe. Lots of it. Big astringency, orange, mango, and 
T- Big hype, and it lives up to it. It's PERFECTLY bitter. Not too crushing, but just enough in your face. Orange, mango, some hoppy floral presence as well. A very slight sugary sweetness. It all melds just perfectly. The aftertaste is slightly sweet, and a present, but not overkill bitterness is there as well. Pine mostly on the finish. I could drink this stuff all the time.
M- Slick and creamy. Oily. Carbonation perfectly scrubs the palette.
O- I've had plenty of big hype beers that didn't deliver. Heady delivers. In spades. 807 charactersJWU, Mar 05, 2014

Very Lucky to have a friend pick me up 12 of these unreal IPA's . while I like hoppy beers I like balanced IPA's not overly bitter. . This beer is perfect. Drinkability is unreal for an 8% IPA.

Living in NH, my close proximity has allowed me to enjoy it fairly regularly. A wonderful smelling beer that when fresh can literally fill a room with a floral citrus hop aroma. It pours with a nice head, and has a typical cloudy appearance in the glass for the style. The alcohol is well masked. This beer has a nice balance of heavy citrus hops and bitterness. My only wish is that the alchohol content were a little less so I could enjoy more than one in an evening. However, it is the kind of beer you can drink slowly and savor each sip. If you have not had it, make a trade to get it, as it deserves the #1 rating it currently holds. 753 characterstheIPAman, Mar 02, 2014

Many people say that THEIR regional IPA is "better than Heady", I've heard it said about Hopslam, Gandhi-bot, Zombie Dust, Pliny the Elder, Jai Alai, etc. But when put head to head (no pun intended) it is (A.) Heady Topper that it is being compared to and (B.) the Heady Topper that comes out on top (given the taster is unbiased). 785 charactersDuffman79, Feb 27, 2014

Pours with light-medium body and a modest white head. The room fills with fresh hop aroma as you pour!
Nose is hops. Perfect hop perfection. Usually the nose of an IPA is citrusy, piney, grapefruity, catty, grassy--describable. Heady Topper smells in the glass (or straight from the can) exactly like when you take cones and rub them between your palms! I've never smelled another beer like it; no other beer effuses that overwhelming essence of fresh cones ready to brew with.
Color is hazy straw, almost green, suggestive of a white ale or hefe.
Taste is hop forward but not overwhelming. I've sampled and brewed IPAs with extraordinary flavoring hops, this one does not deaden the tongue, instead it excites the tongue! Neutral to dry finish, no sweetness to mar the hop-forward nectar.
Edit: Myoriginal review sadly sufferd from grade inflation. Tasted side by side with Pliny, the Toppa is missing the clarity and bitterness that make a more perfect beer.
Mouthfeel is light-moderate, smooth, easy-drinking, with no evidence of alcohol warmth or fusels. Bitterness is light.
As it warms in the glass, it perfectly maintains its balance. It is a pleasure to drink from start to finish, goes down very easy and smoothly. Wish it had a hint more bitterness, but flavor and aroma are dead on.
Overall an amazingly drinkable beer, one that I enjoy again and again. Literally, because you can actually buy this--any time you want as much as you want (well I saw somebody buy 10 cases the other day--I suppose you could want more...)
I must taste this head to head with PtE--have case will travel, need to hook up with BAs when The Elder is on tap.
12/22/11 edit:
Quoting from the can: "Drink this beer immediately, we are always making more."
This is a no b.s. warning to the wise. If you're drinking old Topper, you're not really drinking Topper. It changes character so much in just a few weeks, loses a lot of the raw-hop-cones-shoved-up-your-nostrils sensation.
Vinnie counsels regarding Pliny the Elder: "Drink fresh, do not age! Pliny the Elder is a historical figure, don't make the beer inside this bottle one ... Age your cheese, not your Pliny ... Pliny is for savoring, not for saving! ... Respect hops, consume fresh!"
This admonishment for Pliny the Elder applies likewise to Heady Topper. 2,443 charactersBattleRoadBrewer, Feb 27, 2014

Poured it into a tulip glass - Nice orange appearance with a firm, white head. 
Smell was pure grapefruit, lemon and pine. Still don't understand why The Alchemist says to drink from the can? Why cheat ourselves out of the smell of this masterpiece?
The taste was equally full of citrus: grapefruit, pineapple, lemon zest and mango. Nice bitter end - awesome!
The mouthfeel was of medium body with a bit of carbonation. Smooth. 
Drinkability? Hell yeah!! This is a MUST HAVE beer. Can't wait to open the next one, and the one after that... 686 charactersTaylorMade2014, Feb 26, 2014

4.73/5  rDev +1.7%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Thanks to the DreamWeaver. Word on the street is this can is approximately 3 weeks old. Not ideal, but I'm not complaining (too much.)
A: I'm drinking it from the can (like they suggest.) However, the can is pretty badass. I'll give it a 5.
S: Nice wave of citrus smelling hops are released upon popping the can. Bringing the can up to my nose gives me a really, really strong dose of ruby red grapefruit. It smells extremely sweet and citrusy. I also pick up a bit of alcohol and pine. Smell is pretty good, but not perfect. For comparison, Zombie Dust, in my opinion, has pretty much the perfect IPA smell. 
T: Way more going on the nose will lead you to believe. Starts of slightly sweet. Melon and guava are fruits most present in the beginning. I get that ruby red grapefruit that was in the nose somewhere in the middle. It gets slightly piney and bitter toward the end with a distinct caramel taste. Slightly bitter and alcoholic on the way out.
M: The mouthfeel is pretty much perfect. Minimum carbonation. Unbelievably smooth. The body just seemlessly allows the waves of hop flavors to hit the palate unhindered. Alcohol isn't very noticeable in the taste, but it's very, very sneaky. 
O: I've been blessed with amazing IPAs over the last couple of weeks (DirtWolf, Abrasive, this..) Is this the best beer in the world? Probably not. Is it the best DIPA? In my opinion...probably. What's great about this is that it's not a hop or IBU assault...the hop flavors are a bit more subdued than you'd believe, but that's a actually a good thing because it allows you to experience such a huge range of hop flavors. The malt base is really sweet, too. Normally, I like drier IPAs, but I don't seem to mind the sweetness here.

Every time I drink it though, I drink it straight from the can, because that's the right way to drink this beer "says the can", but next time I'll be sure to pour it into a glass.
The smell of this beer is of floral and citrussy hoppy goodness and the taste fills your entire palate and stays there for a good bit and sends you to heaven if not for a short while 592 charactersimhoudinibitch, Feb 23, 2014

Kind of a hazy gold color. Nice white head, good deal of lace.
Mostly citrus aroma, but also pine and a bit of floral hops. Sweet malt.
Amazing taste. Grapefruit hits first, then the resiney pine, followed by a flowery taste. All this superimposed on a caramel malt background.
Hop-forward, but not aggressively so. Just a fun beer to drink. 527 characterslordofthewiens, Feb 23, 2014

Enjoyed straight from the few weeks old can.
This beer starts giving you feedback as soon as you crack the top. Just after breaking the seal, I was flooded with aromatic burst of pine and citrus. You barely have to get close just to get a waft of it's array of scents. A closer breathe yields some less-dominant floral notes as well. Great smell.
This first sip brings out an absolute wall of flavor. This beer doesn't wait on your taste buds to alert your brain that you're sipping something good. Right as it hits your tongue, you can taste grapefruit, citrus and a surprisingly strong malt backbone. Just as you start to really get that bitter flavor from the resin of the hops, the sweet, biscuit-like malt jumps in and makes the middle of the taste sublime. As the last of it falls off the back of your tongue the sweet and bitter flavors slowly fade in unison and there's a nice balance on the aftertaste. One that doesn't have you smacking your lips from the bitterness, but keeps you thirsty for another sip. On it's way down, I get a small hint of alcohol with the slightest metallic flavor that reminds you that you're drinking this from a can. The mouthfeel is slightly dense and a little frothy, but very typical of this style.
This is really a fantastic beer. It's by no means a hop-bomb, but has a very generous bill that's equally balanced by it's fantastic malt character. Since I can now say that I am lucky enough to have had both Pliny and Heady, I can say that they are similar but different. With Pliny, I get more pine and less grapefruit off of the head. The malt takes more of a secondary role and I get less resin from the hops throughout. With Heady, the malt is sweeter, and makes its presence known throughout as it dances with the bitterness. It's impossible to chose between the two, but they are obviously in a category of their own. Heady is a very well-balanced IPA with as much flavor-per-sip as you're going to get in the IPA category. Definitely lives up to the hype. 2,025 charactersZaso, Feb 22, 2014

Gobs of hops (grapefruit, orange, pine) burst out of the can upon the first sip. Drinking it from the can (as they keep demanding you do) adds to it's mystique. It causes you to focus entirely on taste and smell, and this beer does not let up. 
What really impressed me is how the last sip hit me just as hard as the first. Usually with these really big double IPAs, my pallette gets overwhelmed about halfway through (I'm looking at you, Palate Wrecker), and I no longer really taste as much as I did at first. I did not have this sensation with Heady Topper. Its a very well balanced, complex, and huge, double IPA. 686 charactersThomahs, Feb 17, 2014

A: Nice pale yellow-orange color with thin lacing around edge of glass. Hardly any sediment out of the can.
S: Outstanding aroma of citrus and pine notes. Very pungent and one of the best aromas that I have ever experienced in a beer. Can gives much more citrus notes and is much better than pouring into glass. Had peach and pineapple in the can and more grapefruit in the glass.
T: Very strong American hop notes with strong pine and citrus notes. Very grassy and just a great hop experience. A little imbalanced but falls into the DIPA style
M: Nice mouthfeel with the strong malt backbone, perfect carbonation and a very dry finish.
O: Outstanding beer and I am so happy that I got my hands on a couple of cans. My favorite double IPA and one of my favorite beers. Will definitely enjoy my next one straight out of the can! 983 charactersramay729, Feb 13, 2014

The appearance is surprisingly not that bad, with a careful pour. It's murky but doesn't look close to some of the pictures I have seen. Hazy orange with a bright white head.
The smell is incredible. Absolutely huge aroma on this one. Pine and a mix of citrus (grapefruit, orange, lemon.) Some tropical notes. Dank and herbal. Amazing.
Taste follows similarly. Big citrus and pine. Some bready malts backing up the huge hop flavor. Bitter, but with just a touch of sweetness to back it up, though overall a very dry beer.
Medium full body and perfect carbonation for style.
The aroma, flavor, and mouthfeel of this beer are so spot on. Really, this is the perfect double IPA, and one of the best beers I have ever had. I didn't want to buy into the hype, but it really is fantastic. I'll have to figure out how to get more of this one. 966 charactersDanny1217, Feb 13, 2014

Taste: Wow!. Exactly what I like. More hops than a bunny rabbit. Hides the alcohol well, and has enough bready malt to make it very smooth and easy to drink. Definitely taste the Citrus and has a nice bite. After taste stays around for at least 10 minutes. 
Mouthfeel: Dry and creamy. A little bit chewy, but I like and expected that, as it is unfiltered and unpasteurized. Not too little and not too much carbonation.
Overall: Is this the best beer in the world? I don't know, I haven't tried them all. For me it surely lives up to the hype. For me personally, it is perfect. Has everything I'm looking for in an IPA. It is worth going after. I wouldn't go to crazy as it is just beer, but damn it is good. I will continue to trade for this when I can. 1,142 characterslanciloti, Feb 11, 2014

A: Enjoyed in a glass--hazy appearance with lots of sediment. Not pretty but knew that going in.
S: A grapefruit in a Christmas tree farm. Very pungent.
T: A powerful citrus and pine bomb. Don't taste tropical fruit flavors. Taste on the tip of the tongue is consistent with the smell from the glass and rewarding. Malts very subdued. No alcohol burn. 
M: I found the mouthfeel about perfect--not syrupy in any way. Slightly on the drier side which is my preference.
O: Unique beer. Not blown away but certainly for something so hyped, not surprised. Rarely does something live up to that degree of buildup. I found it delicious and something I would like to get again. It is a world class IPA but scarcity lends a lot to the mystique. Worthy of the praise. 790 characterssurfcaster, Feb 10, 2014

***I am giving this a 4 for "appearance" to be fair. I'm willing to bet that this beer is not going to be under a 4. I will edit the appearance score once I try my second, which I will pour into a glass***
A: Unknown, drinking it from the can as instructed by the Alchemist! Will do a second review with my other can poured into a glass. Edit/Update to come in the near future.
S: The hop nose is more pine than citrus, but both are there. Nice resin/sappyness Almost sweet..I'm getting honey?. Citrus is a little more tamed than a normal hard hitting West Coast DIPA, but it's there. It's a nice contrast from what I'm used to. Along with this wonderful nose bouquet, I also get a tiny hint of some spice, allspice, clove to go with the pine, citrus, and honey. Maybe a little bayleave? Strange, I know, but I'm picking it up. Subtle bread/earthy malt tones underneath all of which make this a fantastic, complex aroma.
T: Seriously, this is unlike any other beer I've had. It's got a really nice pine and honey hop presence up front, which matches the nose. The malty underbelly of this beer keeps it from being like just another West Coast DIPA. It's not an all out hop assault, but a balanced beer full of all sorts of flavors which meld together like a wonderful witches brew. Or shall I say, and Alchemist's brew? Honey, pine, candied citrus, spice, rye, bread...It's all there, and wonderful
*edit* 
As I continue to drink...And burp...I'm getting some herbs (in the burp). REALLY well done. How do they do that? Hahaha
MF: I can see why you're supposed to drink this beer right from the can. I normally am a glass guy only, but hey, I figured my first foray into Heady Topper should be done as the brewer requests. I'm stunned with how great this beer hits the palette straight from the can. All sorts of stickiness on the lips and tongue. Carbonation is lively and perfect, letting you experience all of the flavor complexities. 
O: Yep, I'm also on board with this one. It's deserving of all the hype it gets. I was lucky to score a 4 pack which I shared with my beer loving cousin, so I've got one more left, and I already can't wait to drink it. This beer is worth searching out and enjoying because it's unlike any other beer I've tasted thusfar. Not to add to the hype, but I'm not one for lying to myself just to be a contrarian.

I found a can purely by accident at my local distributor. I decided to drink some of it out of a glass and some out of the can as suggested. 
I could not find much difference either way.
The smell of HT is outstanding. Citrus rules this beer. 
The color in the glass was beautiful. 
I will remember the taste for a long time. By far the best I have drank, but I am relatively new to tasting great beers. 468 charactersdonbet69, Feb 09, 2014

A- Poured from the can. I know, I know DRINK FROM THE CAN! I wanted to enjoy the visual. It's an amazing pour. Gorgeous top of white head about two fingers. The color is the portrait of an unfiltered IPA. I like it when I can't see through my beer. The color is a thick amber-orange. It looks like an orange is smothered in a thin layer of caramel. Goin hard on the imagery. 
S- So complex. Hops roll with a grapefruit citrus aroma. There's a subtle light sweetness lingering in the lacing. Great aromas.
T- It hits in waves. Hops and citrus crash followed closely by the bitterness. This reoccurs several times. It's almost as if the flavors are undulating. Closes out with a very nice balance into a strong hop finish.
M- Exceptional. Great balance in the mouth. Medium mouthfeel and a nice healthy dose of carbonation that isn't too dry and actually leaves you refreshed. 
Overall I think it's expected to say this beer is amazing but I can't just say that. My first experience with this beer really has me thinking that I could drink 5 or more of these at any time during the year. It's simply a great brew. The Alchemist really knows what they're doing.

Everyone claims to get a ton of peach flavor, but I really didn't. I got more pineapple/citrus. But Still a great brew.

A..No idea, I didn't pour it.
S..Great goodness this was full of hops. Almost over the top hops (if there is such a thing). To be as descriptive as possible, it smells like a very good 420 session.
T..Beautiful hops obviously. Some citrus tastes as I recall. There was a bit of maltiness, but faint as you'd expect from such a hoppy brew.
M..Quite easy to drink. No problems whatsoever. I had no feeling this beer was 8% abv; could enjoy 3-4 easily.

A: Hazzy dark straw almost orange. nice finger head that persists and a lacing on the glass. 
S: Intense citrus fruit aroma Grapefruit, orange, and lemons lead to a biscuity malt backbone. 
T: Grapefruit forward flavor not too grassy or resiny. A little creamy. Biscuity malt with some honey. The sweetness fades to a lingering bitterness. Finishes somewhat sweet.
M: Medium carbonation with a medium body. 
O: Amazing beer well balanced bitterness with sweetness. I like how the hops are not too harsh or grassy it makes the beer very drinkable. It seems to finish sweet which helps offset the bitterness. 695 charactersAmgarnier, Feb 05, 2014

S - Citrus, grapefruit primarily, then some resinous piney notes and sweetness work their way in as well. Smells amazing! 
T - Sweet malt is the backbone to big citrus flavor. Grapefruit dominates and the parts to reveal some tangerine, mango and lemon notes. Finishes dry, slightly bitter and piney. Layers of flavor, this is a complex IPA. Taste lingers on the tongue, the hop resins making themselves known. 
M - Exactly what you'd expect. Medium toward full body and perfect carbonation. Coats the palate. 
O - Amazing beer! This beer deserves the hype. Is it the best in the world? To me, yes, so far. Best execution of a popular style. I will grab it anytime I can. 784 charactersHopBomb515, Feb 03, 2014

Gratefully, the experience took place in a true Mecca location...Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, Vermont -- appropriately, the very site of The Alchemist's original brewery (prior to Hurricane Irene). In any event, as my good friend Khalil Saliba and I saddled up to the bar here (on Tuesday night, 1/28/14) and nervously ordered the first Heady Topper of our lives, the excitement was noticeably palpable. Hell, I almost shit my pants when the lovely bartendress set the beautiful tulip glass down in front of me. Awesome 2-finger head, which dissipated very slowly. Beautiful, cloudy orange/amber color, with expected cloudiness. Tremendous sticky lacing throughout. The nose was an incredible citrus pine of grapefruit, with hints of orange/mango/tangerine, all of which was replicated on the palate. But perhaps the most remarkable aspect, and (I believe) the signature of the HT experience, was the stupendous balance between the citrusy hops and the chewy malts throughout, with no heat of alcohol evident whatsoever which, along with the lovely, full mouthfeel, makes this beer outrageously easy to drink.
All in all, an outer-body religious experience. If I could paint worth a damn, I'd cut my ear off for a cannot this Joe! 1,267 charactersJohnParadee, Feb 02, 2014

S: Citrus, citrus, citrus with hints of pine, grass, and all other sorts of hoppy goodness.
T: Bright and refreshing with loads of grapefruit and tropical fruit. Great intense bitterness, with little to no lingering astringency. Hops are all in the nose, with very little (relatively speaking) hanging around the back of your throat.
M: Delightfully full, but crisp not creamy.
O: Worth all the hype. I've tried plenty of tasty DIPAs but this is king. It's a truly impressive balancing act, getting all that flavor without compromising any other aspects of the beer. Awesome. 657 charactersMJKerr, Feb 02, 2014

8% ABV
75 IBU
APPEARANCE: drink from the can like I was told right on the top! 
AROMA: once I cracked the can I got my nose as close to in it as I could. Lots of hops, dark pine, more earthy and vegetal then the bright citrusy west coast ipa's I've been tasting. 
TASTE: the hops for sure hit your mouth like a punch from Mike Tyson. Dank, grassy bitterness in there. Herbal spiciness, lite citrus and floral notes. 
MOUTHFEEL: medium to heavy body, oily and slick that coats your mouth with a hop resin. Has a very creamy texture to it. 
OVERALL: I do believe this is a great IPA and understand the hype behind it. For my palate personally I still put this right under Pliny the Elder.

Drove ~600miles after they announced they were no longer selling out of the brewery for a couple cases. Worth the trip.
You get the chance to buy some do it. Just drink it ASAFP. After a couple weeks it does start to fall off and go towards the malty end. Honestly needs to be fresh inside 3 weeks to really enjoy it the way it were meant to be. 446 charactersMS22, Jan 27, 2014

Pours a very cloudy bright golden orange with a finger of foam, no transparency. Very mild carbonation, good lacing and retention. Pretty murky but not bad looking 
Smell actually better out of the can. Very strong pine and grapefruit hops with undertones of floral orange and lemon. A very mild bready and semi sweet malt in the back with a touch of alcohol
Taste is with the nose- strong pine and grapefruit with a bouquet of floral citrus on the bottom of the hop profile. The malt is very sublet with a hint of caramel and just a little bit of sweetness. Again a splash of alcohol on the finish 
Feel is a medium body with a dry finish. Pretty bitter, alcohol concealed well, high drinkability
Overall a really good beer. The number one all time? I disagree, definitely on the top tier though. That said I'm really looking forward to trading for some more in the future 978 characterslordofstarside, Jan 27, 2014

poured, yes POURED from a 16oz. can into my NEBCO DIPA tulip
A: yes it's hazier than many, but that doesn't detract from its glorious sunburst amber/orange and beautifully-built pillowtop head. Can't wait to dive in (literally).
S: When you crack the can, a wonderful hop aroma bursts out of the can but then seems to go into hiding. However, halfway through the glass, when you can get your nose in there, all that delectable and enticing dankness surfaces, combined with a smorgasbord of tropical yet earthy hops. Boom. 
T/M: OMFG. I've been a Pliny lover for many a year now, but I have to say, this beer is its equal in every way. The sheer intensity of the hop flavor is unparalleled in craft IMO. This is quite literally, hop juice. The biscuity malts don't even surface until the finish, when then extinguish the onslaught of hops and even everything out. Just intense. As far as feel, if an oiler, more resinous DIPA exists, I've not yet had it. This beer literally just coats your entire mouth. You'll taste Heady for days and days.
O: Unreal beer, truly world-class. Can't wait to take the pilgrimage to Northern Vermont and bring home a buttload of it. Drink this now! 1,218 charactersmarkgugs, Jan 26, 2014

4.85/5  rDev +4.3%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Consumed right from the can, because The Alchemist told me to, and I'm not about to second guess that magnificent man.
A - ok ok, I poured a little bit into a taster glass. Came up bright hazy yellow with lots of particulate in it. This beer is rustic and untamed, and it shows. But I just put a 5 because how this looks is irrelevant. DRINK THIS FROM THE CAN, DANGIT!
S - imagine sticking your head into a refrigerated bucket of hop pellets and taking a deep whiff. Pretty much. Pine, grapefruit/citrus, malt sweetness, grass, mint
T - first taste is bracingly bitter and smacks you right in the face with its hops. Subsequent sips mellow out but still leave that lightly resinous aftertaste. It's like drinking straight hops.
M - First sips are bright, clean, and fizzy on the tongue, As you continue drinking, the now stirred-up hop particulate really begins to coat the mouth and significantly dry up the mouthfeel. Personally I don't mind it at all but some people might be turned off by the change halfway through. Expect this one to morph a bit as you're drinking.
Overall - I love this beer. Not just because it's a damned drinkable brew at 8% and a blast of hops with every sip. No no, I also love this beer for the values it represents. In this world of pasteurized brews that'll stay good for a long time and change little in the bottle, this is a meticulously crafted product designed to be the best at its youngest. Like Pliny the Elder, this demands vigilance in finding it and drinking it while the time is still right, rewarding one's diligence with an experience hopheads, and beer fans in general, would give their eye teeth for.
Keep this refrigerated. Treat it like a perishable product. Take a road trip to VT with friends and ravenously track this down. Just took my last sip of the can, and it's still a bitter, sweet, hoppy, resiny, beast of a brew. Is it my favorite beer I've ever had? I'm not entirely sure, but I can safely say this deserves BA's #1 spot on the rankings. 2,005 charactersDannyS, Jan 25, 2014

Really lovely light hoppy citrus. Herbal grassy hop notes mixes in the light lemony citrus like a delicious lemon candy. 
Taste is light in body but full of incredible hop notes. Real interplay between the herbal and citrus hops. Tangy and deliciously bitter.

I've always approached beers of this magnitude with a somewhat naive sense of awe, but not this time. Going at this one as "just a fucking beer".
Has one-finger of fluffy off-white that drops into a scattered lace in it's own good time. Color is an impenetrably cloudy orange. 
Smells of oranges, bananas, grapefruit and resin. While not overly complex, all the components float in concert. 
Tastes of deep grapefruit, taffy, and vanilla with a core of rind, resin and other light fruits. A bit spicy too.
Medium to heavy bodied with minimal alcohol heat. Smooth from beginning to end. 
As with all great beer there's something intangible. This one has that esoteric element in spades. Is it the water, he terroir, or maybe even an unknown "magical" touch from the creator (brew-master that is)? Who knows? All I know is when all is said and done, this is not "just a fucking beer" 908 charactersstephens101, Jan 25, 2014

4.96/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5I can't say enough about this beer, I've been drinking it consistently for over a year now, I'm from Vermont so I grab a case every Monday. I never felt the need to review it until now. As I said, I drink Heady Topper quite a bit, but this last weekend, I had the pleasure to taste it against Lawson's Double Sunshine, Dogfish 75 Min IPA, Pliny the Elder, and Hill Farmstead's Abner, and for the first time since I've been drinking Heady Topper, it had competition. I love Harpoon IPA and drink it regularly, but after a Heady Topper it's tastes like Bud Light. 
Though Heady Topper was still my top choice out of the beers I have to say the Lawson's Double Sunshine is a close second. (I didn't get to taste much of the Pliny)
Anyway, back on topic, the reason Heady Topper still topped the chart for me was the hop aroma, from the smell to the taste, you can tell the hops are perfectly balanced, and fresh. They're overpowering, and that's what I enjoy in a beer.
As far as appearance, the beer is beautiful, a yellow-orange, with an amazing head, almost a perfect sight.
Smell - Unreal, from the moment you pop that can, it fills your nose with hops, try popping it and catching that first burst of air thrown from the can - there's nothing like it.
Obviously the taste is perfect, it's intense from the first sip to the last, whether the beer is a few hours old to 6 months, sure the flavor changes a lot in between then, but either way you have it, you'll enjoy it.
It's a semi-heavy drinker, it coats your mouth with fresh hops. Amazing.
Overall it's still my single favorite beer, I'd like to give it another shot against Pliny the elder, and def. against the Younger, but being from Vermont, you can't complain when you only get just a sip of the Pliny's. 1,785 charactersFreeTheHopFreeTheMind, Jan 21, 2014

A- This beer pours a cloudy, hazy golden color slightly tinged with amber, but still very much light for an IPA- an Imperial IPA at that. It looks more like a Hefeweizen. A nice, slightly uneven inch and a half head that lasted about two minutes before settling down to an eighth of an inch. Nice fluffy lace coatings slide down the snifter with every movement
S- Remarkably the aromas of this bold flavored ale don't stand out as much as the taste. It smells like a well balanced IPA. Some floral hop aromas, grapefruit, The scent although not complex does smell very fresh and very good
T- I can see why this has such a following. It is like drinking liquid hops of the most delicious and highest quality. These hops are very tasty and pungent in a good way. This is a bitter DIPA. But it's also a sweet DIPA. Other than the POW! of the hops, the beer is actually very well balanced.
M- The mouthfeel is just spot on. It is smooth and creamy, yet refreshing and drinkable with just the right amount of carbonation.
O- Overall, I can see why there is so much hype with this beer although I think a huge part of it is that it's only distributed in just a couple of towns in the state of Vermont. I will say it's one of the best DIPAs I have tasted, although fresh from the tap Enjoy By is right up there too. My buddy got me a four pack of this for my birthday and I am very grateful. It's a great beer to drink on a summer night and the 16 oz. serving just enough. A little more than your typical 12 oz. home serving, but much easier to finish than a 22 oz. bomber. I don't know about the hype, but I would say the ratings are pretty accurate. This is a legendary brew to say the least! 1,748 charactersmitch3114, Jan 17, 2014

Pours a golden yellow / orange, very hazy. 1 finger of off white head that doesnt stay around long. Be careful not to pour the entire can! Here I do follow their directions, otherwise you discover the particles and hop resin, hey, its unfiltered. (Can't taste)
S- Dank Pine needles, pineapple and orange jump out of the can and fills the nares. A delight to just sniff for a bit. 
T- Once again DANKNESS, some grassy bitterness, orange, pineapple, and slight bitterness hangs around for a long time. Some floral notes here all rolled up into one great package
M- Medium, carbonated, well balanced perfection.
O- The best beer I have ever had. Lives up to the hype. Its IPA perfection for me. If there was anything negative or constructive critisism I could offer is that this may not be an every day beer for some because it is someone heavy, calorie dense, and comes in 16 ounce cans. 2 of these may make you feel full and bloated. Besides, this shouldnt be looked at as an every day beer. It's a spectacular beer made to be slowly sipped and enjoyed once or twice a week max, IMHO. Cheers. 1,285 charactersRobsVolt, Jan 16, 2014

A- Pours a muddy hazy golden rod color, looks like a shade of preserved lemon. A medium white head that dissipated to a thin film. Pretty hazy but can still see the shadow of my finger through the glass. The second pour from the can is very hazy and has some particles. 
S- As soon as I cracked the can a way of hops fills the air. It is a hop dream. Sweet, lots of pineapple and citrus. Dank pine and a mellow bitter nostril burn. All the aromas are the biggest I've experienced in a beer. 
T- HUGE HOPS, sweet, dank, long mellow bitterness, pineapple, orange, light malt on the aftertaste, the hop resins stay on your tongue for a long time. 2 hours after drinking this and I could still taste the hops. 
M- Easy drinking all while having a full mouthfeel that is not too thick not to thin. 
O- This beer definitely lives up to the hype in my opinion. Hops to the max. They must have a huge late addition of hops in this beer. Seems like definitely some Simcoe and Amarillo in here. This is how I like my IPAs, dank, slightly sweet, fruity and mellow long bitterness. A benchmark beer for sure. Congrats to The Alchemist for having the balls to make such a huge hop aroma and flavored beer. 1,394 charactersPaulyB83, Jan 14, 2014

Appearance is murky apricot orange with big and bountiful light cream colored head. Hazy as can be for an IPA. Massive lacing, more so than any other Double IPA I can remember.
Aroma is huge orange, pineapple, pink grapefruit, pine, parsley, and star fruit. Smells very west coast with really no malts showing up.
Taste blows up with straight hop character. Big bitterness followed by a dry herbal finish. Tons of orange peel throughout with piney highlights. Little to no dank character. Almost all citrus and pine. It goes where many fail to go though, to that point of huge bitterness that actually has complexity and balance that keeps you coming back for more. Grapefruit for days in this.
Mouthfeel is heavier side of light or maybe lighter side of medium? Definitely crisp and gives the impression of being lower in abv.
Overall, this is classic. Full of fresh hop character and a masterpiece among many brewed in the same style. Doesn't break ground in any new way but just shows what something masterfully brewed tastes like. Deserves to be in the same sentence as that which contains other world class double IPA's, but to me falls short to the likes of Kern Rivers Citra, Lawson's Double Sunshine, and the stellar Alpine Bad Boy. 1,289 charactersMarcWP, Jan 14, 2014

Tap poured into a snifter. Hazy yellow with a nice white foam cap.
Citrus and pine hop aroma. 
Taste of the hops but without a bitter start. Slight bitter aftertaste and that is what sets this beer apart. More flavorful without the explosion of bitter taste . Citrusy with a hong of pine. Even the college son appreciated this beer over his preferred Budweiser, Great beer , flavorful, well balanced but doesn't club your senses.

I cannot testify as to the appearance of the beer. I drank it from the can, as directed.
Before drinking it, smell it! It doesn't get any better, really. Just amazing.
It tastes as good or better than it smells. By far the smoothest double IPA I have ever had. So drinkable, yet full of rich flavors. I only had one can, I could have imbibed many more. 425 charactersWortman1998, Jan 08, 2014

Had one on Tap when in Waterbury. I had my first one from the case out of the can as directed the next day I had one from a tulip glass. was impressed with the smell or nose both ways. The appearance is the weak link here. Not ugly but a little hazy you might say. Dose not effect my felling towards the beer at all though but I scored it a 4,25 to be true. 
 I enjoyed the Heady Topper very much. It is a wonderful beer. One I can not recommend enough. I am enjoying my case with a select few and will drive back for an other when needed.

Pours a hazy orange with a little sediment and not much in the way of head action. The aroma is fruity - tropical, with some apricot and mango. The flavor follows suit, with mango, apricot, pineapple, and a blast of big sticky hops. The mouthfeel is big and round. This beer is at once unusual and familiar - it reminds me of the beer to which it is so often compared, Pliny the Elder, though it is bigger and fuller, both in its tropical fruit and rounder mouthfeel. It's clearly less dry than the Russian River beer. But curiously the West Coast beer to which it most closely compares, in my view, is Racer 5 from Bear Republic - they are different beers, but both are round, fruity and given to showing up with a thick orange haze. It is as if Racer 5 and Pliny crashed into one another and spawned some crazy new hybrid. Heady Topper is a very good beer, but I wonder whether the frenzy would be as great if it were produced in greater quantity and distributed more widely. 1,048 charactersSeanibus, Jan 06, 2014

Creamy and ebullient in the mouth.

Appearance the can is well done with nice artwork. It fits nicely in your hand. I put a koozie on the can to prevent heat transfer from my hand, it doubles to keep my hand warm. Since it's opaque you can't see what the beer looks like.
Smell: piney, citrusy, resiny, that quickly drops off. Drink this one quick.
Taste : hop forward with lovely malt backbone. So balanced.
Mouthfeel: nicely carbonated gives the back end a little tingle to match the front end hops. 
Overall: I guess this is a pretty good beer. Maybe even a top ten beer but I haven't tried them all yet so I want to keep my options open. :-) 678 charactersBillDon, Jan 02, 2014

Beer pours hard and frothy with a single finger lacing swirling to a butterscotch/apricot color. Absolutely beautiful for an IPA.
The smell of this is a complete knockout a double fisted paisley colored floral scented uppercut to the nose. Just full of fragrant floral excellence gently doused with a hint of a Werthers Original butterscotch candy. Its just dying to go to the darkside and give you an alcohol or resin aftertaste but it walks the tightrope of full fledged flavor power without giving in.
Honey drenched carbonated mouth feel washing down slightly syrupy.
This is borderline perfection. It might not be the best IPA but I've certainly never tasted its equal. If you can get your hands on one, grab it, You wont be disappointed.,

Heady Topper pours with about a finger's-width of white foam, bubbly and cratered. It does not stick around long, becoming a ring around the glass, exposing the lid of the hazy, unfiltered golden body with auburn highlights.
Loads of grapefruit in this bouquet, a little grassy, a bit of herbalness. And a sweet malt scent barely coming through. Very nice foundation of tropical fruit.
Heady Topper leads with that grapefruit, tropical quality on the palate. It gets a little diluted by a bit of earthiness, and a really nice bitter kiss of resin in the finish. Not quite balanced, there certainly is a sweet malt poking through, but the hops are so far ahead in the flavor department.
Very, very smooth for a DIPA. And very creamy, runs right over the tongue. Obviously dry on the finish, because of the very bitter hops on the back of the tongue. And it is also impressive how long the flavors stick around on the cheeks. 
What needs to be said? This is obviously a world class beer. Is it worth the hyperbole that is said in the same breath as the name of this hallowed DIPA offering? Maybe. There are other DIPA's that manage to squeeze more clean citrus qualities onto the palate. Thanks for the opportunity to try this one again Hawkeyenation! Good luck on your hunt for this one, and enjoy! 1,399 charactersPintofbrown, Dec 30, 2013

Pours a hazy golden orange, decent sized white head for the pour and moderate lacing. Quite hazy but the can states that it is the intention.
Smell- Wow, as soon as I lifted the tab on the can the smell poured out. Pine and more pine, some grapefruit and orange in their as well. I actually get a bit of bitter orange in there also, very pleasant.
Taste- Very well balanced, not bitter at all for a DIPA. Some caramel and malty sweetness, good amount of orange in there. I get some lemon and citrus on the back end with a bit of pine. Awesome taste.
Mouthfeel- A bit thick for the style but it works well. A bit of a creamy texture. Not overly drying and leaves a slick feeling in the mouth.
Overall- Awesome DIPA and a great beer in general. Balance is awesome for such a hoppy beer and one with a higher ABV. Definitely recommend it. 930 charactersIPAdams, Dec 30, 2013

It appears slightly cloudy and light in color, though if you drink it from the can as advised you will scarcely notice the color.
It smells glorious, with a strong hop presence on many notes.
Those hops come through in the taste - hops rendolent of citrus (namely grapefruit) give a clean, sharp flavor.
The flavor clings to the tongue, saturating the senses with the layers of hops. Despite this, the flavor cleans exits with each swallow. 540 charactersGuinnesslover, Dec 29, 2013

If fresh, it pours out a hazy lemonade yellow with a thick foamy head that slowly dissipates and leaves a bit of lace.  
Smell is heavy with citrus and a touch of tropical fruit and dank.  
Taste varies a little by batch but is typically a grapefruit bomb, with some cannabis, and finishing with a perfect balance of soft bitterness.  
Mouth feel is just right - medium body, clean and refreshing.  
Overall, this is the ultimate Vermont style IPA - as good as it gets.  I wish I could brew it. 623 charactersFFreak, Dec 27, 2013

Took a trip to Montpellier for a crazily hectic search for this magical nectar. The process of finding HT, and trying to beat out other people in the parking lot to the next case made the first cracking of the can that much more rewarding. After all, this beer is incredible
A: Drank from the can.
S: Beautiful floral aroma upon opening the can. The aroma is pitch perfect for an IPA. I also believe the aroma resonates throughout the drinking experience. 
T: The taste is second to none. The initial tasting is unexpected as your hit with a flavorful punch of hoppy explosions on your palate. It's not too citrusy and not too bitter. 
M: Great body and feel to HT. It has a great ability to linger in the mouth, which is lovely when were talking about this good a beer.
O: Overall HT deserves a top ranking. I feel as if in many ways HT sets itself apart from other IPA's because of its incredible taste and lingering feel. 
Side note: The definition of the ALCHEMIST ( A person who studies and engages in the practice of the process of transforming something common into something special) is incredibly fitting for this beer.

I am currently drinking my first Heady Topper. I drove, and I am not exaggerating, 30 hours to get a can of this beer. Texas to New York. I thought I would have to do another 3 hrs but I lucked out in New York and found a four pack for a whopping 32$. 
But God, was it worth the 32$. I have never drank something so aromatic. Upon opening, it literally smelled like the bliss of a summer day in a field of evergreen trees. 
Lots of people on here are talking about complexity. This beer isn't as complex as an einsbock, but the wave after wave of hoppy goodness that overtakes you is TOTALLY worth the wait, price, or sacrifice it took to get a can of this liquid gold in your hands. 
Enjoy...when you get some yourself. 785 charactersneverdie77, Dec 24, 2013

I prefer it in the glass so I can admire the color and the smell. It appears a murky yellow / orange almost resembling juice. The smell is hops and more hops. Taste just like it smells - awesome!

Smell wise I just got an abundance of pine and your typical grapefruit.
Taste was just a SUUUPER bitter pine bomb with some malt sweetness.
medium mouth feel and well carbonated...
Overall....Is this beer good? Yes.
Is this beer hoppy? Extremley
Does this perfectly describe the definition of an east coast style IPA? Yes
Does it deserve to be world class and rated 100 - Absolutely not. The only reason I could see it maaaaybe recieving this rating is because for a higher abv ipa...it is CRAZY drinkable. 546 charactersGlennlawless, Dec 21, 2013

A: okay, if you follow the directions " drink straight from the can" how can you rate appearance? So I started drinking from can then poured the second half into a FFF Teku. How anyone can rate appearance a 5 is beyond me unless you thin the can is beautiful. Appearance is a murky golden color with decent head but retention was lacking. 
S: amazing, one of the best smelling beers I have ever had, tons of floral notes, cirus, pine, aroma does not dissipate at all.
T: again, outstanding. Very different than any other DIPA I've had. On par with Pliny, Dreadnaught, and Abrasive.
M: very good but not quite as smooth as Dreadnaught or other slightly higher abv beers. 
O: definitely worth seeking out if you like DIPA's. Very different from most others as well, the aroma is probably the best I have ever sensed but the taste, mouthfeel, and appearance bring it down for me a bit. 934 charactersDocrock, Dec 20, 2013

A: Very murky, hazy. Brown/yellow/orange color
S: Pine, Lemon, Bread, Sour Grapefruit, Cleaning supplies
T: Very complex. A lot of resinous pine, lemon, grain (not sweet malt), very bitter at first in the back. The complexity of it makes it so the flavor is different with every sip. Layers of different hits of flavor and bitterness and an almost Umami type flavor that cant be described.
M: Cant complain about anything here. Very full, smooth, mellow.
O: I dont know how old my can was but I know it was at least 1 month. Ive had HT before and hadnt reviewed and the aroma was much more potent and amazing. The aroma seemed to be very subdued on this can. The mouthfeel and the development of flavors from first sip to the last is the reason to drink this. Sucks, Enjoy By, Pliny, Double Jack, etc. etc. have better appearance, aroma and first taste. There is something very unique about HT though. Its definitely in a class by itself. 972 charactersvitALEity, Dec 20, 2013
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Tried it at the brewery on tap, tried it from the can 1 day old, and tried it from the can 6 months old.
It is said that IPAs are best when young, but this one is a little different in my opinion. If you drink it fresh, you will get a TON of bitter aftertaste. It's a little too much bitter for my liking. BUT, the aroma and front of the mouth hop PUNCH just makes me not give a shit. I've never smelled a beer with a better aroma. Hell, the brewery itself smelled like heaven. I decided to let a can sit for about 6 months and tried it again. Let me tell you, it tasted MUCH better. The bitterness subsided a bit, but the pine, citrus, and floral, almost even cereal scent was still there, and still strong. The flavor actually developed quite nicely over time. I highly recommend you try a vertical tasting of young and old. 
I will go back to Heady Topper in VT and age it for a year next time and see what happens. 920 charactersbball208, Dec 19, 2013

A: Reminds me of someone throwing up Keystone Light on an empty stomach. Hazy appearance that is not very appetizing. The appearance is not judged on the can/bottle as many of the other reviews seem to think, which just adds hype to this beer.
S: Very potent odor given off by this beer. Strong scents of pine and citrus. 
T: Tastes like a hop bomb on the forward palate and then subsides into a pleasant taste. The forward taste is however to overpowering for the aftertaste and makes you want to take another drink to wash away what's on your mind. The aftertaste is actually very pleasant and worthwhile, but the forward taste kind of ruins it for me. Granted I enjoy stouts and prefer a strong malt backbone which this beer fails to deliver, I have had much better than this.
M: Very amazing body to the beer. Reminiscent of a stout's body. Very thick and coats the palate. Best aspect of the beer in my opinion. 
O: Was it worth the 4 hour drive? No. Will I ever seek out this beer again? No. Over hyped beer that is not worth your effort to obtain. It is not bad by any means, but it is not a top tier beer. Even Lawson's Double Sunshine IPA(sold in Vermont) is better than this beer. I prefer Surly Abrasive Ale and Stone Double Bastard Ale over this any day. Turns out even the piss taste of Corona Light is satisfying after a physical adventure. 1,419 charactersTheBeer, Dec 19, 2013

A: Its in a can, so hard to say.
S: Floral aroma initially when you open the can, but the can limits the aroma for the most part. It smells excellent and exactly what you want a double IPA to smell like. The American hops are just trying to escape the can with no luck. I think the aroma would be better served in the proper glassware.
T: taste is excellent. Perfect. The initial taste is hard to describe, i get a little bit of the aluminum taste from the can, but it quickly takes a backseat to the overwhelming taste of hops. Very citrusy, very bitter. The taste is dry with not much sweetness from the malt whatsoever, or it could just be overpowered by the amazing taste of what you expect from a double IPA... HOPS!
M: Excellent, it's exactly the way I want my beers.
O: Overall this definitely deserves to be right where it is as a top 5 beer in the world. You can't compare it to Pliny the Elder, I think they are on different ends of the Double IPA category. I can't say which one is better because its been a couple years since I've had PTE, but this one is very very delicious. I'm going to try my next one in a glass and see if the taste even gets better!
Overall: 100/100. You owe it to yourself to try and get your hands on a 4-pack of these cans! Well worth the drive to Vermont! 1,500 charactersJLateralus21, Dec 18, 2013
4.37/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Amazing beer, have had it many times as it is locally available. If it is more than 2 weeks old it quickly becomes an average IPA. 
Appearance is murky, can not see through the beer though light passes through it. It is a glazen orange. No matter how cold or careful always pours with some sediment. Conan yeast gives this beer a nice creamy mouth feel. 
This beer balances sweet, bitter and citrus hop qualities like no other. Great beer, will buy it as long as I can find it! The one issue is that this beer is a bit thin for my preference but the creaminess that their conan yest puts out makes up for the final gravity. 625 charactersjeastman, Dec 18, 2013

A- Drank the majority of this beer from the can, but I wanted to see what it looked like, so I poured a few ounces into a snifter. Looks like grapefruit juice with a bit of orange juice poured into it. Pretty friggin' cloudy. A small head, that I'm sure would expand had I poured the whole can. Overall, not too impressive. I can see why "DRINK FROM THE CAN!" is exclaimed on the label in all caps.
S- Wow. Could I just smell this beer forever? So pungent, and so delightful. Huge citrus (specifically grapefruit and clementine), pine, and floral notes with a hint of sweetness. You're not gonna make a beer that smells better than this. You're just not. So don't even try. 
T- Hops on hops on hops. Juicy, fruity sweetness balanced out by the hop bitterness. Hops, citrus, sweetness. In that order. And me likey that order. The bitterness lingers, requiring a solid smacking of the lips. Love that. The taste is not quite as phenomenal as the nose, but quite lovely nonetheless.
M- Not the best mouthfeel I've had in an IPA. Feels just a little bet empty. Maybe a little watery at some points. Doesn't detract too much from the beer, but could be improved. Pretty good amount of carbonation, with a dry finish. Hop oils totally coat the tongue.
O- I think I'm understanding the hype. This was a really enjoyable beer. Only room for improvement would be on the appearance and the mouthfeel. But where it really counts, this beer delivers. And I have 7 more in the refrigerator. You lucky dog. 1,712 charactersjbwimer, Dec 07, 2013

4.81/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Drinking this beauty on a lazy Saturday afternoon and figured I should have reviewed this a long time ago.
Review is mainly based on a 2 weeks old can, but with comments from other tastings I had before.
First, I think it's useful to have the debate on the best way to appreciate Heady Topper. It took me half a dozen cans to figure out the "drink from the can / review from a glass" thing, but now, it turned as a well-oiled ritual. Flavors and aromas on Heady Topper are really volatile (more than on any other hoppy beer I have had so far), yet, the nose is so great it would be a pity to drink it from the can. So what I do is pouring it in my de Heeren van Liedekercke glass (which is a small, not too wide wine glass, more or less a white wine glass) 2oz. by 2oz., it enables me to enjoy the nose but have the beer rest in the glass with not too much contact with the air. I'm very proud of this technique, it makes me consider myself a professional Heady Topper drinker :-/ And now, let's review it:
A: Everything has been said of how bad-looking this beer is, hazy as hell with lots of sediments floating around (it will be hazy however you pour it, but a gentle pour can avoid the sediments to come to the glass), yet I really love the look of it. Hazy straw / orange in color, with a foamy white head, quite lingering, this looks very juicy, like a fresh pressed grapefruit.
S: This is the best part of it, fruity, juicy, with a resinous scent, very complex and appealing with aromas of mangos, peaches, oranges, passionfruits, grapefruits and pineapples.
T: Taste is very fruity also. If drunk very fresh, one can taste the fresh hops, grassy and floral aromas, which do mellow after a week or so and leave fruity waves of hoppy, fruity goodness flooding from the front end of the tongue to the back end of the throat, with a lingering, resinous aftertaste and a bittersweet dryness on the finish (which also mellows with time). No heavy sweetness, no over-malting defect, no alcohol is to be felt. I could drink 5 liters of this on a single night.
M: Mouthfeel is smooth with a high carbonation and a dangerous dryness on the finish, calling for the next mouthful.
O: Contrary to many DIPAs, Heady Topper is not so focused on hops, but has a real yeasty liveness, light on the malt side but very well balanced, not at all as bitter as expected from the IBU, but still very smooth and fruity. It evolves gracefully (probably at it peaks after one month, but it can be enjoyed even one year after canning, regarding my own experience, being really focused on the yeast quality). One of the best DIPAs I have been able to try, and one I really love revisiting on a regular basis. 2,688 charactersFux, Dec 07, 2013

Pliny wins every time
 I like the idea of cans. When you get a fresh one it's very cloudy, naturally, because it's unfiltered. I don't really mind this but a lot of people do. The taste is great. Very hoppy, grapefruit and floral. I like the beer a lot and I want more, but it's not as crisp of a beer as Pliny. Heady is a bit more malty and slightly more bitter. Whenever you can find this beer drink it right away and do not save them or age them. It is best drank as fresh as possible. 534 charactersHomersTomaco, Dec 07, 2013

Appearance: perfect color for this type of beer with a mild haze to it. Almost greenish hue.
Smell: Pine and citrus through and through. Pineapple, mango, orange, and pine. Its what I had always dreamed of for a IIPA.
Taste: Wow, amazing, simply put. The taste matches the nose but there's almost a candy like sweetness to that's very very subtle but works for it incredibly well. Hops up front and citrus more towards the middle with a perfect just sweet enough finish.
Mouth feel: Perfect carbonation, insanely drinkable. That's worth the experience alone almost!!!
Don't let the hype scare you, it scared me. This truly is what its cracked up to be. Good work Alchemist Brewing co! 752 charactersWreckedPalate, Dec 06, 2013

4.96/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.25 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from a 16 ounce can into a Spiegelau tulip - no, I didn't follow the rules and drink it out of the can. No freshness date printed on the can.
Appearance: Pours a hazy dark honey blond with orange highlights and a 3 finger fluffy eggshell white head which dissipates very slowly leaving a 1/2 finger puddle of foam gently resting on top. Decent lacing.
Smell: The nose is huge. I got a blast of hops as I poured it from the can into the glass. Huge citrus aroma with resinous pine, floral sweetness, pineapple, a touch of honey and just a bit of bready malt in the background .
Taste: Sweet citrus, pine and grapefruit dominate throughout. The flavors aren't overly complex, but it's incredibly well-balanced. The aftertaste is bitter, but not overly so. There are hints of sweet orange in the aftertaste as well. This beer just does what it intends to do: give waves and waves of hoppy goodness on your palate.
Mouthfeel: Medium-to-full-bodied with just the right amount of carbonation. 
Drinkability: Insanely high drinkability. I wish they still counted that toward the score here on BA. Goes down so smooth, I can't believe it's 8% ABV. 
Overall: Amazing beer overall. There is a reason this is considered amongst the world's best beers. It's phenomenal. Honestly, I don't think there's one thing I would change about this beer. This is a beer to seek out. If you ever get the chance, you must try it. It's world class. 1,435 charactersadam42381, Dec 05, 2013

S - Smells delightful/amazing/everything great in this world. citrus with other tropical fruits and world peace.
T - delicious creamy IPA that cover all the nooks and crannys of your mouth, very hoppy yet fruity with a resounding aftertaste of perfect bitterness and fruits. unlike any beer i have ever had. what it lacks in appearance it more than makes up in what counts, THE TASTE, this is a true nectar of the gods.
M - Creamy embodied mouthfeel that dosnt give you that typical IPA dry feel at the end, simply put.. perfection.
This elusive beer is worth the effort to find, you will not experience an IPA like this anywhere else. 785 charactersMigz, Dec 02, 2013

The beer is is golden yellow witha sticky white head. It laces the glass and the can doesn't look half bad either. 
The nose is dank with spicy hops there is a slight malty sweetness but the hops are obviously the star. From the can the smell of hops seem a little more prominent but the spicyness is subdued. Reminds me of a less intense abrasive.
The taste matches the nose full of hops spicy and very dry. I am a little underwhelmed, while tasty probably wouldnt make my top 5 dipas 543 charactersbishopdc0, Nov 29, 2013

This can was bought in mid-September. Poured a hazy rich goldorange with over 1 finger of off white head. This faded to nice lacing on the glass. Light carbonation noted.
First whiff is hops and then the citrus presence, namely grapefruit, pine and some other hints. So nice on the nose but it doesn't give away anything about what's coming in the tasting....
Remembering that this has been sitting in the fridge since mid-September I figured there would be some difference between this and the one I had at the brewery. I wasn't too far off. The hop profile has softened slightly but the first notes are the hops, then the citrus, other fruit hints and pine. The beer is still so balanced there wasn't one flavor that stood out above the others. Certainly the malts haven't taken over and dumbed down the flavor profile, it's just a bit mellower than when fresh.
Medium body for me with a clean, fresh taste and a dry, hop finish. Smooth all the way through. Lower carbonation than what I remember but I don't mind a bit.
Overall this beer lives up to its name. As I compare it to other DIPA, this one is still at the top of my list, even one that's a little older and less-fresh than right out of the brewery. Awesome job Alchemist and hopefully I'll come by some more of this down the road.

But a buddy scored this and I had to try it out of the can followed by in a glass. I actually like the glass offering better, but here goes: Poured from can into DFH snifter. Great looking light pale yellow beer with an inviting 2 fingers of head. Straw hues and a bit of cloudiness. Smell is awesome. Citrus hops meet earthy/pine hops. Getting grapefruit and apricot on the nose. Taste was pretty balanced and smooth for such a strong announced IBU. For not a big fan of the style, I was glad it went down as easy as it did. More pronounced fruit as it warmed. The can offering just seemed a bit less flavorful? to me than the glass. Feel was great with a medium heft and carbonation that was pleasant. Overall: The best IPA I have had, but again it's not my wheelhouse. I liked the citrus frontend and balance. I can see where those who love the style would really like this. I would drink again and think it's a must try. 988 charactersTheDinger, Nov 24, 2013

Although the instructions on the can say to drink from the can I have on occaision used a glass, which is my prefferred beer drinking method. When you first open one you are hit with a wonderful smell that is not matched by any other beer I have ever experienced. The flavor of this awesom double IPA is very hoppy yet slightly fruity at the same time. There is something else unique about the tast but I cannot put it into words. I guess I find it robust and strong but smooth at the same time. The limited avaiablity undoubtedly adds to the mystic of this beer. I usually only get to have some about twice a year. Whenever I drink other IPAs I always mentally compare them to Heady Topper and they alwasy fall short, even if they are very good. For me nothing tops Heady Topper! 822 charactersDWaters, Nov 21, 2013

4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75The beer pours a pumpkin hued orange that is very cloudy. Ecru colored head is well maintained with thick gobs of sticky lacing left with each sip. The scent is overwhelmingly hoppy and seems to span the entire hop spectrum without becoming muddled. Notes of pineapple, pine, orange citrus, pear and some background general scent of yeast. Very heady experience. 
The taste is a wonderful progression and balance. This isn't a bitter IBU bomb, but a cascade of hop flavor. Nice medium bodied mouthfeel that doesn't thin out or dry out the palate. The flavor begins with the citrus hops and gives way to a more fruity impression of peach and apple. Finishes with an assertive bitterness that refrains from overpowering. Obviously the beer heavily favors hops rather than malts, but gives an impression of balance rather than being overly hop agressive. 
I was wary to review this very hyped beer without careful consideration. I was lucky enough to have a case from a recent trip to Vermont to mull over the different aspects of this beer. Difficult to call any beer #1 in the world, but very appropriate to call it outstanding. 1,129 charactersJmamay22, Nov 20, 2013

pours an odd, murky brownish orange with lots of sediment chunks floating around and a think white head
aroma- mango, peach, pineapple, fresh grains, some rose, spicy hop zest
taste- sweet citrus hits the palate up from with tangerine and lemons, fresh tropical fruits mango/pineapple, a little hop spice with subtly sweet bready malt. Some berries in there. Finishes with a grip of pine/hop spice and a bit dry-malty
feel- medium bodied, drinkable, mild booze, delicious, juicy, zesty, dry
this is a great beer. Obviously a lot of hype, probably mostly due to its limited availability, but this is probably one of the best IPAs out there. Juicy, resinous, clean. I'm glad I got to try it!

3.32/5  rDev -28.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 2.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 3When a beer reaches the lofty heights of a Heady Topper it feels almost unfair to pen a review. After all, how could I possibly review it based solely on it's merits and deficiencies? Most everyone will either praise it's strengths whilst ignoring the faults or harp on flaws and turn a blind eye toward the many amazing things this drink does so superbly. 
If I'm honest, and I'm certainly making a valiant attempt, the color is spectacular. It really is the perfect color for a double IPA. Any darker and it'd be obvious this beer would be far too sweet. Sadly though, it's just too damn cloudy. I can't express the amount of pride I feel as a homebrewer when I pour something I brewed and the body is the proper color and you can see through it like a window. This doesn't happen with this one. Great? Yes. Flawed? Well, that's a second yes. 
Fortunately the nose ups the game even more. The malt is assertive, whilst the hops fight for dominance. It's nothing short of a tapestry of aromas: orange, peach, pineapple, and maybe some mango. A sip reveals some pleasant booze, while maintaining hop presence. Lots of tropical notes dance seductively alongside malty sugary caramel. The big problem arises in the finish. Where it should be bitter the sweetness slams on the gas floods the palate like an uninvited guest. After half a can or so, the sweetness becomes overpowering for me. 
One of the great things about this brew is the price. The Alchemist could have taken the opportunity to charge through the nose for a beer with this reputation but it certainly is fair. I'm sure if I lived in the distribution area I'd come back to Heady Topper again since the price is very reasonable. That's despite the fact that it doesn't wow me like it does most people. Certainly worth a shot to see if it ever clicks with me. 1,824 charactersTheBungyo, Nov 18, 2013

Hard to get, only made in limited runs and available from local shops that limit 1 four pack per customer. So if you want to stock up be ready to travel around and visit several shops. Get there early, they sell out fast. 297 charactersdoddja, Nov 16, 2013

Definitely one of the best IPAs I have ever had, beating out sculpin and stones enjoy by... The bitterness is non existent and you get swept by the grapefruit and pine flavors immediately. And even after settling a bit, the typical dry ipa bitterness never arrives. A must for every beer fan but with the understanding that there is a hype factor. Once again...I could think of many more Belgians I would prefer. 527 charactersJC333, Nov 16, 2013

Sorry, good for an east coast IPA, but no match for west coast. Pours a cloudy opaque orange color, odd chalky mouthfeel, and a little thick for the style. Prefer a cleaner, crisper, more bitter, hop forward IPA. I see why they want you to drink from the can, not a good looking beer at all! Taste not too far off. Not even in my top ten. Sorry.
Maybe I received an old can, would love to try again, but not gonna trade across the country for another one. No date, hard to determine freshness. 563 charactersgreg1973, Nov 15, 2013

Pours a murky, shiny orange color. Smells very citrusy and piney. The bitterness is extraordinary. Has a thickness to it that makes it unique but not strange.

The smell featured waves of balmy pine, grapefruit and pineapple. 
The taste was nothing short of a hop laden punch in the mouth. Puckering pine and grapefruit assault the palate initially, with a secondary and somewhat soothing tropical fruit and grainy malt. 
The mouthfeel was full and round with a drying bitterness.
An extraordinarily complex use of hop additions makes this one a world class experience. Believe the hype. 546 charactersplaid75, Nov 09, 2013

But every time I crack one, I am reminded that God loves us and wants us to be happy, whether we're up to our assholes in alligators, or sitting on the back porch watching the dogs play. I may prefer Pliny, but I can't shake the feeling that Heady Topper is better. It's hard to admit your favorite ain't the best. 512 charactersScipio, Nov 08, 2013

Appearance - Drank from can so nothing to report here.
Smell - Opened the can and was immediately hit by waves of grapefruit, peach, pine, lemon, and flowers. Aroma continued throughout the entire can.
Taste - Huge hop presence upfront that is balanced very well by the sweet flavors contributed from the tropical hops. No harsh or lingering bitterness to speak of. Get tastes of orange, grapefruit, lemon, peach, pine, mango. 
Mouthfeel - Smooth bitterness with a soft carbonation on the tongue. Dry finish with a medium body that makes you instantly want to go back for more.
Overall - This a wonderful beer that is deceivingly strong as you get no sense of any alcohol in it. The amazing aroma paired with the fantastic tropical and piney flavors makes any hophead rejoice. I normally pour every beer into a glass to consume butnI chose to follow the instructions on the can and I do think it makes for a more enjoyable drinking experience. I will try pouring the next one into a glass to compare. Regardless, this beer has set a new bar for all IPAs moving forward. Well done! 1,127 charactersItsGotaBeUrBull, Nov 08, 2013
4.85/5  rDev +4.3%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This review is based on a couple Headys I've have over the last week (following a great trip with the girl up to northern Vermont). Drank one from the can, another from a snifter.
A - I can see why Alchemist encourages you to drink from the can. Heady pours a muddy amber, not the least bit of clarity, with a surprisingly robust fizzy head. The odd yeast floaty is visible. Resembles White Oak Jai Alia or Burton Baton, or some other barrel-aged IPA.
S - Now the substantive argument for drinking out of the can. Crap the top and you're smacked with a barrage of grand aromas: pine needle, passion fruit, tangerine and doughy malting. What's amazing is how each note is distinct and sharp. Really assured. Poured in a snifter, the nose dissipates quite a bit.
T - Heady is more salad than stew. The IPA flavors are bright and they don't so much meld as dance off each other. The grass, grapefruit, and lemon flavors are held together, it seems, from Alchemist's proprietary yeast and the slight malt back. Sweet and earthy, tart and succulent.
M - Dances that fine line between substantial and refreshing. This is a deviously drinkable IIPA.
Massively tasty IPA. I can simultaneously understand the fanaticism surrounding it and am perplexed that people speak of it as a total mold-breaker. What it is is incredibly well-made. Perhaps I'm being harder on it because of the hype, but Heady hasn't ruined all other IPAs for me. That said, pretty psyched to have a case of it. 1,479 charactersTheCuriograph, Nov 08, 2013

Appearance: I chose to ignore the label and drink it out of a glass rather than the can. It pored an extremely cloudy golden color. The color and head it pored with made it extremely appealing, but it lost points to me as all the sediment floating around definitely takes away from it. 
Smell: HOP BOMB loaded with citrus. Very strong nose which lead me to believe that my palate would soon be demolished. Beautifully potent smell.
Taste: An absolute explosion of flavors. Hops attack loaded with tangerine, grapefruit, a slight hint of pine. This is what I love about DIPA. The alcohol is almost non-existent which is extremely dangerous for something that tastes this good. 
Mouthfeel: stick yet very smooth. Doesn't wreck the palate like I thought it would as it goes down 100% clean making me want more and more.
Overall: Couldn't be more pleased with this beer. Definitely wish it was more readily available, but there is something cool about seeking it out and getting it on rare occasion. Like finding the holy grail. Is this better than Pliny? In my opinion, I remember enjoying Pliny a tad bit more, but would love to get a hold of each to do a side by side comparison. 1,401 charactersMattyBones, Nov 07, 2013

Outstanding looking beer, not that clear watery look that many have, looks full and rich, orangish color, impressive head that stuck around and lacing was ideal.  I know I am supposed to drink it from the can but it is a great looking beer.  The smell is unreal, the citrus really jumps out at you.  The flavor follows and is also incredible, the juicy citrus jumps out at you, real smooth except for the bitter.  May be just a bit to much for me (not a hop head).  Plus, the bitterness lingers on the back of the tongue.  Rich, full texture with great carbonation, the perfect amount.  I did not notice any alcohol, it was an extremely easy to drink beer with the exception of the lingering bitterness.  Not the top for me but I completely understand why the hop heads love it. 891 charactersJamieDuncan, Nov 05, 2013

I shared a can of this during the Music City Brew Off where John Kimmich was the featured speaker.
The beer is a murky honey-colored affair, with a rich head and lacing. The aromas are delightful with tons of hop character but also a big malty presence. The hop smells are tropical fruits primarily, with also pine and citrus notes.
The taste is hop-forward as you'd expect, with a big juicy bitterness made up of grapefruit, mango and other tropical fruits. But this isn't a one-trick pony that just kills you with hops -- it's a complex and well-rounded beer despite focusing on the hops. The feel is creamy with a thick and chewy body. 
The tasting we had left me wanting more of this world class double IPA! 860 characterssommersb, Nov 04, 2013

4.99/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance - They say to drink it from the can, so that's what I did. Living fairly close by (in NH) I've had more than my fair share of Heady, and a few times I've shared it with friends that have poured it out. I've not seen the extreme cloudiness on these occasions, but you can definitely tell it is unfiltered.
Smell - Perhaps the best thing about this beer, once you pop open the can you get a big whiff of incredible hop aroma's. Citrus, big and bold. I like to take a little time to take it all in before I even start drinking. 
Taste - Talk about balance! Many IIPA's try to bludgeon you over the head with hops or over the top IBUs, this gives you a full palate of hop flavor that isn't off putting. Not super bitter, lots of citrus hop notes, with some lingering pine afterwards. 
Mouthfeel - Just right, not overly carbed.
Overall - I had heard lots about Heady before trying it, and I have to say I was expecting to be let down (as the saying goes, if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is). In this case the legends held true for me. An IIPA like no-other, the perfect balance of all things hoppy.
As a side note I was able to try Heady alongside Pliny, and have to say they both hold up incredibly well. Totally different beers that shine in different ways. Certain palates may prefer one over the other, but side by side you can really appreciate the different directions they take the IIPA style.

4.98/5  rDev +7.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Many thanks to shawnp for hooking me up with this one.
Appearance - A very cloudy straw colored beer. The cloudy appearance is expected as this is an unfiltered beer.
Smell - Hops, not much in the way of malts. Like citrus and grapefruits - smells fresh. 
Taste - A perfect level of hops and the taste is similar to the smell - citrus and grapefruit. It is more sweet than bitter. Sometimes IIPAs can be overwhelming, but this is a very well balanced example of the style.
Mouthfeel - Medium amount of carbonation and it goes down smooth
Overall - This one lives up to the hype. It is very well balanced and quite drinkable. Would love to try it side by side with pliny and abrasive 687 charactersshadetree67, Oct 30, 2013

This beer is the best thing since slice bread.. If you haven't had the Heady Topper find a way to get this beer in your hands...I went on Saturday October 26. They were sold out of the cans.. The lady who was handing out the samples told me on Monday they will have more for sale.. Once I walked in to the brewery on that Monday... Wowww!! You can smell the hops once you walk in.. The machines were cranking! Bottles we're being filled and my smile grew. I bought myself two 4 packs.. I'm happy with what I bought BUT something is telling me I'm going to have to drive from Boston back to VT - this time I'm grabbing a case. 729 charactersGuess2814, Oct 29, 2013

A - Poured half into a snifter and left the other half in a can each of the four times I drank this to compare. Beautiful bright sunshine orange with pale highlights and a half inch creamy foam head.
S - smell is by far the best smelling IPA i have had a chance to try. Fresh fruits, grapefruits, flowers, pine. Not to overpowering hoppy smell.
T- My favorite DIPA to date as it taste like it smells. THe balance between the fruit and the hops is perfect.
M - Overall amazing mouthfeel. THe alcohol is hidden perfectly within this monster.
O - Found a reliable source in Vermont to pick these up for me and will be buying more when the time arises. Now that it's getting colder its time to stick to the world class stouts! This is the cream of the crop of DIPAs! 868 charactersdrmcleod10, Oct 29, 2013

A: Cloudy golden blonde.
S: Sweet, citrus and floral.
T: Strong flavor. As unique as it smells. Even and nuanced. Flavorful. Lots of freshly mown grass and pine with malt sweetness. Big aftertaste.
M: Crispy and prickly and coarse. Nice mouthfeel. Smooth at the end.
O: One of the IPAs that tastes as good as it smells. I think a key component of any great beer, especially IPAs is the mouthfeel/carbonation/body and this one is great for conveying the flavors here. 558 charactersgillagorilla, Oct 29, 2013

4.73/5  rDev +1.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Appearance: Mysterious. No, I’m not trying to be cheesy. We drank it straight from the can, as suggested. Could see a little bit of golden liquid on the rim of the can as I drank it.
(Andrew did later pour one into a pint glass to solve the mystery. It is a very cloudy, deep golden yellow. There. Mystery solved, but this beer is obviously not about how pretty it looks.)
Smell: From the little punch top opening, upon popping, fragrant floral and slight citrus notes filled my immediate plane of smell-o-vision. It was very strong and helped make sense in why The Alchemist doesn’t want you to pour from the can to help contain those beautiful esters for the flavor you’re about to consume.
Taste: Upon the first sip, my very first reaction was that this beer is not intentionally wrecking my taste buds like a Bell’s Hopslam. This is what I thought I was getting into and was slightly disappointed until the hops slowly creeped in and engulfed my entire sense of taste. Heady Topper is every bit of hoppy as Hopslam, but nowhere near as harsh making this extremely drinkable and enjoyable to the novice IPA drinker. As the nose suggests, there are tons of floral notes, and as the more a drink it, there are a lot of citrus notes, but they are not bright. The citrus comes from more of the oil from an orange rind to add slight sweetness and mellow out the big floral notes. As it warms up, I started noticing some honey sweetness, so you have that to look forward to as well.
Mouthfeel: This is the best part! It’s so smooth for how intensely hopped it is! It’s creamy, but it is not to the point that it’s dictating how fast you can enjoyably drink this beer. It’s so enjoyable for a hoppy, relatively higher ABV (8.0%) beer that I was quoted saying, “I could drink this on a hot, summer day after mowing the lawn.”
Overall: Overall, I’d say this might be my favorite IPA, in general. For how balanced it is, I could always enjoy one. This is not to say that if I had to choose, there would be times that I would much rather have a more harshly bitter beer as a Bell’s Hopslam or a Founder’s Double Trouble. It really comes down to how something can be so hoppy and so drinkable at the same time. Just remember, drink it from the can. It’s worth it.
I’ll give Heady Topper a 4.8 on the ol’ trusty 5.0 scale.
Cheers! 2,357 charactersTheBiercast, Oct 28, 2013

This isn't super pretty, but the beautiful creaminess of the head brings the appearance up a bit, otherwise not a good look. Will go from can next time. Pours a hazy light golden copper color with just under one finger head. Big floral pineapple and grapefruit aromas, sweetness, mango. Yum. Flavor is heavier on the bitter pine up front, some earthy dirt (in a good way), with some beautiful tropical fruit lingering on the palate, and a pretty dry finish. Almost a creamy feel as I get through this. This highlights the tropical hops for sure. Slick mouthfeel but plenty of carbonation to lighten things up. Is this am excellent DIPA? Yes. Did it live up to the hype for me? Probably not. But very nice in a very different way from some other in the style. Would still likely go for Dreadnaught, Hopslam, Pliny, and Enjoy By before this one. But that's pretty good company. I will revisit tomorrow with a fresh palate to make sure, and try out of a can.
Have had a couple of disappointing cans of this recently and hoping it's not a trend in the wrong direction. Knocking the rating a bit for now, but will be in Vermont in June and perhaps some fresh from the tap experiments will lead to another readjustment. 1,311 charactersBMMillsy, Oct 26, 2013

Appearance: Hazy amber color with a thick white head. Heavy lacing on the glass.
Smell: Hops and citrus were strong but not unpleasent. Very floral characteristics.
Mouthfeel/Taste: Smooth medium bodied. Taste was complex, bitter all around but a good sweetness to balance it out. Pine and citrus were the dominate flavors.
Overall: This beer certainly lived up to it's reputation. It was a complex beer and the taste got better with every sip. Very hard to get, if you want to get it be at the brewery just as it opens otherwise it sells out almost instantly. 623 charactersCavanaghty, Oct 25, 2013

A- Pours a murky golden-orange color, looks like the color of the sun, with some sediment and floaties swimming around near the bottom of the glass. Big foamy and pillowy white head that has great retention and leaves a few small patches of lace as it settles. 
S- LOTS of hop resin up front with a leafy and dank aroma, notes of fresh cut grass, herbal & earthy hop aromas, pine and just a hint of sugary malt sweetness
T- Right off, the first thing I notice is the freshness of the flavor of the hops, big leafy and grassy notes are complimented by some danky herbal/medicinalflavors, there's a touch of malty sweetness that kicks in mid-palalte but only as an underlying addition. The finish is piney and dry with an inviting hop linger
M- Medium body and moderate carbonation leads to a big foamy and creamy mouthfeel, finishing smooth and crisp. Probably the most drinkable DIPA I've ever had
O- We've all heard the hype, was it the best beer I've ever had? No. But it is world class and one that I would seek out again. The biggest thing that sets this and Pliny apart from other DIPA's are their amazing drinkability. The hops are packed in, but they are not overbearing. I could drink a 4pack of this in one setting, which is nearly unheard of when it comes to this style 1,336 charactersTreyliff, Oct 24, 2013

Pours the hazy light orange. Small bubbles hanging around the edge. Looks really nice. 
The smell is super piney with a twist of tropical fruit, or what I would call the "heady topper smell."
It is a mix of the old school and new school. A little bit of alcohol coming through actually. Not as pungent as I remember. 
A little different than I remember. A very nice balance of bitterness, pine, citrus, and breadiness. Not as sticky and juicy as some other batches. But still really nice. Bitterness lingers a little as well. 
It has a nice creaminess to it that helps emphasize the oils from the hops. It kind of sticks to the inside of your mouth, keeping the resinous character around longer.
Overall, very good. Every batch seems to be just a little different. Some are solid, some are other-wordly. This one is somewhere in-between. 987 charactersraynmoon, Oct 22, 2013

I prefer the glass, and the brewery wants you to drink straight from the can. What do you do? Have them side-by-side! This will be a combined review from a straight pint glass, and the 16oz can, switching between sips as I watched the Talladega NASCAR race.
Big piney and citrusy hops wafted out of both cans, whetting my appetite for this much hyped brew. The beer poured a very cloudy, barely translucent, orange color with about 1/2 inch of just off-white head that moderate retention and low lacing.
As mentioned, lots of citrus and pine hops upfront in the aroma, with a low, almost nonexistent malt profile. The taste was the same, tons of hops and low malts. The beer from the can seemed harsher and more bitter, not in an entirely pleasant way, than the beer from the glass. The flavors were smoother and more even from the glass.
The body was fairly typical for the style, but this is one of the driest finishing beers I've ever had. I'm almost thirsty after finishing each drink. Drinkability was dangerously good, I could see a 4-pack disappearing before you realize it. Overall, a very good brew, one that almost matches the hype that surrounds it (which is not the fault of either the beer or the brewery). Certainly a must try if given the chance. Thanks again Ryan and John! 1,361 charactersbeertunes, Oct 20, 2013

3.46/5  rDev -25.6%look: 3 | smell: 3.75 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 2.75 |  overall: 3.5Here it is folks, the single most overrated beer in drinking history. I've been a beer fanatic for a decade and a half, and the beer drinking world has a lot to answer for on this one. The best beer in the world? What a joke. I wouldn't even put this in the top 10 of IPA's let alone beers of any style. 
I'm not saying this is a bad beer. It's just criminally over-hyped and overrated.
Let's start with the obvious; drinking this beer out of the can as it says to do on the very can you're supposed to drink this out of = a bad idea. It's much better in a glass, and the right glass with a tulip shape will make the aromas even better. I guess the whole drinking from the can thing is little more than a hipster ideal. I certainly hope this trend doesn't continue.
The hops are right in your face, but ultimately unbalanced. Anyone can throw way too many hops into a beer. But it takes real skill and finesse to create a hoppy beer that's balanced and drinkable. There are heaping amounts of grapefruit, pine, and lemon rinds on the front. And then heaping amounts of grapefruit, pine, and lemon rinds in the aftertaste. The malt backbone is there, but it's too faint to balance out the assault of hops.
So far, the best IPA I've had was another Vermont brew; Lawson's Hopzilla, which I gave a perfect score. It's the perfect DIPA. When I die, I want to be embalmed with it. 
Other IPA's that are better than Heady Topper: Ballast Point's Sculpin. Hooker's Hop Meadow IPA. New England Brewing's Gandi-Bot, Sierra Nevada's Torpedo, Southern Tier's 2xIPA, Southern Tier's Hoppe, Southern Tier's Unearthly, 21st Amendment's IPA, Hill Farmstead's Abner, Rock Art's Belgo American IPA, and others that I'll probably think of later. 
I've never been so embarrassed for the beer community for rating this so highly. My fear is that the beer scene is being overrun by a bunch of hipsters who think that exclusivity is more important than the art of brewing. Heady Topper is hard to get. That doesn't make it the best beer in the world. People are rating this beer so highly because they want to brag that they drank it. In a blind taste test of the world's best IPAs, Heady Topper would lose miserably. 2,203 charactersabriggs1, Oct 18, 2013

As instructed, I drank from the can, so I will not rate the appearance. 
S: Nice bitter, citrusy nose. Plenty of hops in there, but I wouldn't describe it as particularly "piney." The citrus really comes through and makes the bitterness pleasant. 
T: Perfect balance, a barrage of hoppy goodness that holds up over the entire 16oz. Grapefruit provides a tarty sweetness to compliment the hops. Delicious.
M: Low carbonation, medium to full body. Can really get the complexity by letting it sit on the tongue before swallowing. 
Overall, this is a great, great brew. A lot of these beers get overhyped to the point of no return, but Heady stands up to the reviews. Alchemist does right by this beer, and I couldn't find a fault. 850 charactersjshusc, Oct 16, 2013

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance - Had the luxury of having this on tap while visiting my hometown of Middlebury VT but I will review the can considering everyone is drinking this from a can. Appearance from pouring from a can, you will quickly notice that this brew is unfiltered, sentiment at the bottom, slight bubble carbonation, pours a nice murky orange color with a two finger head that slowly will disappear. The color is enough to tell you this is unfiltered.
Smell - Aggressively hoppy at first, when you crack open the can you will definitely smell the hops coming from the can. Grape fruit, mango, peach, nectarine, grapefruit; you can immediately tell this is an IPA, not the strongest but smells very balanced in combination with the slight breadiness and sweet tones.
Taste - Man, where do I start here? It's this great combination of grapefruit, bitterness, sweet, bready, goodness. I mean to pick apart each individual characteristic is a disservice to this brew, everything is so balanced.
Mouthfeel - A slight carbonation, if you hold it in your mouth there's not enough carbonation to burn the tongue, it is very smoothing going down the pipes and will leave this bitterness that will make you return for more. 
Overall - Upon first drinking this, I thought it was extremely over hyped. But when you realize you've hit the middle of the can in 2 minutes, you'll understand it's drinkability. This isn't the most aggressive IPA out there, the ABV is a bit high; however, considering it is a DIPA, I'd say this brew is spot on. It's a great brew; however, to you that are buying this on the gray market, I strongly suggest not paying more than $8 a can. These run $12 a 4 pack in Burlington and I've seen locations out here in Los Angeles reselling them for $12 a can. This is completely ridiculous... It's a great experience to try, but don't get taken advantage of. Cheers! 1,875 characterssantomark, Oct 16, 2013

I can see why they say to drink from the can. It's a cloudy, murky yellow amber color with a slight head. It reminds me of homebrew in how it looks. I guess I have gotten used to super bright IPA's like the ones from Stone. The appearance is the only knock. The smell is magnificent. Super citrus, pine and resin. Upon tasting, I really can't believe the lack of bitterness that does not come with all that hop flavor. The hop flavor must come from a killer hop stand. Small amount of sweetness at the end of the sip, but make no mistake, this is all about hop flavors and aromas. I've never had an IPA quite like this. Mouthfeel is moderate and well-carbonated. Overall, this is a new type of IPA that I will look out for. Huge hop flavor and aroma and slight bitterness. This one kills it! 935 characters33nickadams, Oct 14, 2013

4.84/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Fairly fresh, received in a trade. Should be less than 2 weeks old. I poured a little bit into a taster just to see appearance, the rest of the review will be from the can, as the brewer intended. 
A- Pours a cloudy orange with a half inch white head. Very good retention and lacing. Clarity is downright ugly, although I personally prefer the rustic look for a good double IPA. There is no denying this thing was dry hopped to heaven and back. 
S- Grapefruit, citrus, pineapple, some malt. Huge hop aroma that has some floral grassyness, but mainly a full frontal assault of pine resin mixed with grapefruit, pineapple and peach. 
T- I missed this beer. Follows the nose very well. Tropical fruits mix with a strong bitterness that overtakes the malt, although not so much that it is overwhelming. In my opinion, the best tasting DIPA out there. 
M- Carbonation is spot on, body is a medium with a fairly dry finish. No lingering sweetness, although certainly a ton of lingering bitterness. 
O- I am admittedly a huge Heady Topper fanboy. Honestly, I am kind of surprised it has taken me this long to actually review this. Definitely not the best looking beer from the classic definition of how a beer should appear, but I think the cloudy, almost dirty look shows you that they care most about the flavor and aroma of the beer, sacrificing looks for the characteristics they like the most. 
(Ok, maybe that sounds like something you say about a really ugly girl.)
Either way, this is a world class example that I hope the alchemist can continue to produce at this level for a long time. 1,595 charactersjustforrazors, Oct 13, 2013

*- Since it says to drink it from the can, this is a moot point as far as their presentation of it goes, I suppose. Nonetheless, I don’t think it looks bad at all (I had read that is wasn’t pleasing to look at).
Pours a greenish, slightly cloudy orange with a fat creamy white head. Good retention; good lacing. 
S:
Green. Stanky citrus, crisp twinge of astringency (it kinda tickles something inside you) and bold resinous hops. Hits you square in the face upon opening the can.
T:
Waves of piney, medicinal, skunky, grassy, and citric hop flavors with the same weird twinge of astringency as the smell; pineapple, grapefruit, weed, and hops of all stripes intermingled with rich odorous grass flavors. If hops have the flavor, it is here in varying degrees.
M:
Good carbonation, medium body very slightly creamy with a finish that manages somehow to both linger and disappear quietly. 
O:
I hate hype and I think that oftentimes it does a disservice to otherwise enjoyable things. As such, I was not expecting HT to live up to the myth created around it. Boy was I wrong. I had multiple audible gasps while trying it and have savored it every time since. 
Part of what skewed my expectations was the general tendency towards intense IPAs that a lot of breweries have. Because of this, I assumed that it would be the bitterest hop-bomb to ever destroy my taste buds. However, it is so good because it is so restrained. It tastes like hops; no question about it, but it tastes like little else. This means that it can be as hoppy as it is without being needlessly ‘confrontational’ in its flavors and aromas. Actually my girlfriend (who can’t stand hoppy beer) tried it, liked it and sneaks tastes of it when I drink it now.
Anyway, I am gushing. 
It is a world-class beer for what it is. Is it the best beer in the world? I honestly don’t think so. Is it one of (if not the) best double IPA in the states (and possibly the world)? Without a doubt.
Would fight to be able to try again. A must-have for any beer enthusiast. 
With apologies to Chuck D, do believe the hype. 2,091 charactersTheDoctor, Oct 12, 2013

Cloudy orange-gold body light skim of a head on top. Didn't pour enough out to really let one form or allow any lacing. A slight swirling of the glass brings it back to life; small tight bubbles.
Smells...Holy Sheeet! Citrus. Grapefruit. Lemon. A dank hoppy aroma on the end. Some malt sweetness.
Tastes...Wow! Can see why this is so highly rated. I just fills the mouth with hops and a great amount of carbonation that fills the whole mouth with hoppy goodness. A dry finish.
Drank it out of the can and out of the glass and I gotta say...I prefer it out of the can! It seems to retain a nice bite to it. This isn't to say that I would refuse to pour it into a glass to enjoy it either. An all around great DIPA, no doubt in my mind as to why this is on top!

Appearance: Pours a tight and creamy looking two finger head. Cloudy, peach colored body. Looks like pulpy peach juice. Yum! 
Smell: Hell of a nose. Hop resins, a bit of onion, bright citrus fruit, pine, sweet tropical fruits, and a sweet malt maltyness.
Taste: Tastes like caramelized hop candy. Very resinous hops. Follows the nose; citrusy and fruity. Some piney bitterness. Sweet malt backbone and a lingering breadyness. Despite the hop overload this is very balanced and never too much. 
Mouthfeel: Very creamy, low carbonation mouthfeel. Sticks to your teeth, bro. Very little heat.
Overall: Definitely a must try for any hop head and a wonderful example of what a DIPA can be. Outstanding nose and spot on mouthfeel. Overall, a hoppy, balanced tribute to American hops. 878 charactersCowsandBeer, Oct 10, 2013

O - again, I'm glad to have had the chance to try this one. Definitely one of the best double ipa's out there that I've had, more balanced than I expected, great hop profile. 707 charactersncketchum, Oct 10, 2013

If you are a craft beer fan with any level of affinity for hops, you will love this beer. I say that because there is so much more to it than the "DIPA" classification suggests.
Is good cold, is good a little warmer, is good as an IPA, is good as citrus-ey hop blended ale, oh and it's incredibly drinkable for a high ABV... If you could actually get your hands on enough of them to have a HT session!
If you've never had it, or fear you never will, take solace in the fact that HT gets less unique every year of this craft beer era. Sure, I've still never had this perfect combination of flavors and craftsmanship, but you've tasted everything in HT before. Ithaca, Lagunitas, Maine Beer, all of them seem to owe a tip of the glass to HT with some of their IPA's. 884 charactersmrz200, Oct 08, 2013

My dad will love this addition to his beer can collection. Bittersweet grapefruit and dank hop resins dominate, I can already tell this drinks like juice. A bit of pineapple and mango are noticeable on the nose as well. On the first sip, I couldn't believe how complex a one dimensional beer could be. This beer really doesn't need a malt backbone, what a use of hops. Drinks so easy from the can.

Canned...pour into a pint glass...although i know this violates the first seven unwritten vermontonian beer laws.
A: Hazy orange with a thin bubbly head. No floaters. I have to admit I was hoping for some resin and shake hanging out in the glass. But, too new, too fresh. I have a feeling I'll find a way to get through it.
S: A little citrus on top of an aromatic double ipa-ness.
T: Bitter, piney, and hop-sweet with lingering grassy kind of notes. This is a great beer. It reminds me of an earthy Double Jack or what a Double IPA version of Two Hearted would taste like. Seriously tasty beer.
M: Sticky with a super long linger and a little bit of lupulin kicking in now. I'd be willing to bet a second or third would still taste pretty good though.
O: Fantastic beer. One that I'm hoping finds its way past NPH into ready availability. I know that Northwest Indiana could support a steady influx. No doubt that this one beer is all that the Alchemist needs...although, in case the northern vermontarians felt like branching out, a fresh hop version would probably be pretty epic. 1,307 charactersbodhi185, Oct 06, 2013

Beer is slightly hazy light yellow. Lots and lots of happy little bubbles rising energetically from the glass's nucleation point. An off-white/pale yellow head erupts three fingers high. It slowly subsides, leaving behind fluffy, splotchy lacing. Some little floaties in the bottom of the glass. To be honest, not the best looking DIPA I have ever seen.
Aroma is sweet with lemon, mango and pineapple and spruce. Good, good stuff, except for that fleeting whiff of onion...
Flavor is similar to the aroma, but with a strong note that's almost, but not quite, lacquer. Slightly tingly with a nice, modulated bitterness on the finish. This beer is in no hurry to finish up the flavor of each sip, so it's one to savor slowly. It comes on strong but not sharp and finishes smooth but not fast. Each sip is a little experience of its own.
Mouthfeel is slightly thin (though with a little extra body - a trace of oatmeal to thicken it up, perhaps?) and tingly with carbonation. Just a few sips will reveal the alcohol in the form of some heat.
I find it quite an impressive achievement, but I let my non-beer-drinking girlfriend try some and she said it tasted like "pine-scented poison". 1,285 characterscharlzm, Oct 05, 2013

4.25/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5First of all, I want to say that I am excited about finally tasting this beer. It has been on my hit-list for a year and, my stars, I was gifted a can this afternoon by a co-worker (danke schön, Mike). The only potential downside is that it was canned in June, it's October, and I have been cautioned by both John Kimmich and devotees to drink it immediately after canning. Any subsequent lapses in enthusiasm are likely owing to this shortcoming. 
And we're off!
Generally: Unfiltered, unpasteurized DIPA that is regarded by many as the apotheosis of ultra hoppy, high ABV IPAs. Interestingly, the can admonishes the consumer to "Drink From The Can!" I'm of the school that the color, clarity and head are a significant part of enjoying (or not) a beer. So, I poured half into a glass designed by Dogfishhead specifically for IPAs, and left the rest in the can. There's definitely more aromatic concentration in the can, but a swirl in the glass unleashes nearly the same notes.
The Pour: Especially when backlit, this is a pretty beer. Hazy golden, slightly orange in color with an excellent, though not too terribly long lasting, bone-white head. Some minimal lacing on the head.
Face in the glass: First off, I want to taste a fresh one already because my socks are still on...
In the can, it is definitely brighter and cleaner. The pineapple that everyone talks about is not subtle, which makes it awesome. It smells stinking delicious out of the can. There's a classic array of hop notes embracing that tropical fruit. Now, out of the glass: At 64 degrees it smells better than it did at 55, and it's getting close to the concentration I found in the can. The hops are more apparent here, but I'm not getting anything with the word "malt" in it. To be expected...
With Regard to Taste: I find this inexplicable, but I actually prefer it out of the can. Anyway, I drank what was left in the can so onto the poured bit! It's not quite as bright as I was expecting, but the mouthfeel is soft as a pig's nose, which is a good thing. Beautiful resinous and citric hop notes that linger for ever... for EVER... in a sea of alternately mouth watering honey notes and "my-teeth-are-stuck-to-my-gums!" bitterness. It's almost tannic. Perhaps the best thing about this DIPA is the linger... it goes on for days and keeps getting more interesting. Easily one of the most complex beers in this style that I have ever tasted.
Abstract: There's something organic and mildly anarchic about this beers personality. It's extremely interesting to me that J. Kimmich is constantly working on its recipe. I'd regard that as the only philosophy an artisan in the craft beer world could defend. Personally, I am a little tired of formerly great beers being dumbed down for mass consumption and the attendant need for mass production... no names will be mentioned. 
Epitoma: Well, I haven't had a fresh one yet (send beer!) but I am impressed. It's a delicious and heady (wink wink) DIPA. For glass enthusiasts, I get the same aromas at 70 degrees that I got out of the can. Surprisingly, this huge monstah drinks nicely at nearly room temperature.
Note: Bitter!! Dry!! Give me fat food to eat!

Heady Topper is getting a ton of national attention...and for good reason. This is a complex imperial IPA with great citrus smell and flavor and the right balance of hoppiness and maltyness (yes I know neither is a real word!)
This DIPA is very smooth, well balanced and very easy to drink. It's a relatively high ABV at 8.0%, but you can still enjoy a few in a sitting. While they suggest drinking it from the can you can definitely enjoy when you pour it into a glass, but it does change the flavor profile and you will notice a lot of hop residue since HT is unfiltered. 
 I am a hop-head and can honestly say that this is among the best I have had.
Cheers! 759 charactersHopHeadRaleigh, Oct 05, 2013

Mouthfeel: Surprisingly really smooth for a DIPA. Still enough bitterness though.
Overall: one of the best beers I have had, if not the best. So happy another 4 pack will land on my doorstep tomorrow. 403 charactersmaDUECEgunner, Oct 04, 2013
4.81/5  rDev +3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Canned only 3 days ago (!), this was an incredibly generous trade surprise from mtomlins and a beer I've been hoping to try for ages. It is just plain stunning and actually lives up to my (unduly high) expectations...
Pours a hazy golden orange colour with a respectable white head that has good retention. As the instructions are clearly not to pour it all, am rating appearance mostly on that very attractive can. The aroma is a brilliant blend of my favourite hop-forward elements; resiny pine and citrus with an initial alcohol burn that dissipates dangerously quickly. 
The taste is the epitome of its style and I believe it to be the first "5" I can remember giving?! This may well be the ultimate DIPA. A hop-centric ride from start to finish that is strangely well balanced, despite being so hop-forward. The malt backbone respectfully supports the hop lover's ride and that finish is one to savour. It has a delightful blend of bitterness and citrus that lingers... 
It's been often discussed, but we may now be well enough motivated to make that pilgrimage trek to Vermont!! 1,087 charactershopsolutely, Oct 04, 2013

The smell is glorious. It's piney, and citrusey...vague sweetness, beautiful hop aromas.
I take my first sip and let it wash over my tongue and swallow. Grapefruit dominates the back of my tongue, just the right level of carbonation creates wonderful mouthfeel. A second sip starts to reveal sweeter noted toward the tip of my tongue.
This beer is complex. As John writes on the can, it is not meant to dominate you with hop bitterness. There is just the right level of bitterness mixed with the right amount of sweetness. Citrus, piney, and some alcohol forward notes.
One can and I can feel this beer working it's magic in my head. It has amazing drinkability that really belies how complex it is.
It is perfect. The perfect beer. 767 charactersBoldRulerVT, Oct 03, 2013

It's a little over a week since it was canned so it's super fresh. Cloudy amber-orange pour with a huge 2+ finger fluffy white head with decent retention and lacing. Fresh, dank, resiny hops totally dominate the nose along with some great perfumey, floral and citrus notes. This is one of those really special smelling beers that you'll always remember. The taste is just as big and bold. It starts off like the nose as a total fresh hop monster, full of resiny pine and bitter grapefruit along with some nice tropical notes. About midway through there's a measure of balance as some of the caramel malt sweetness emerges along with some orange peel, tangerine, and a bit of grassiness. The mouthfeel is medium bodied and oddly creamy for an IPA. Surprisingly balanced and incredibly drinkable for such a big, hoppy beer. Overall, not sure it lived up to all the hype, but still one hell of a beer! 964 charactersbeerdrifter, Sep 29, 2013

Had a taste from the tap but reviewing based on 1 pint cans.Both are my first experiences with Heady. It's perfect. Beautiful pale hazy yellow when poured, which I did with 1 of 4 cans I've had so far. Delicious, smooth and flavor-filled. Hits all the right notes. Little floral, little citrus and a little pine lumped together into a spectacular punch of flavor. Spent 10 hrs in a car to bring this home and it was worth every second. 470 charactersjd18, Sep 29, 2013

Deep, dank, fresh bag-o-hops smell...spicy, resinous pine, pungent, juicy citrus, and peaches. An almost toffee-ish malt profile lurks underneath. Huge hoppy flavor (obviously): fresh floral hop cones, grapefruit, pine needles, stone fruit, maybe some tropical fruit. Seems kind of like a lot of Simcoe to me. Dry, smooth,and textured. Bitter, but nothing crazy. This is a great, supremely hopped-up DIPA that manages to stay really drinkable. A bit too hyped up, but undeniably impressive. 567 characterswedge, Sep 29, 2013

A - No idea, BECAUSE I DRANK FROM THE CAN LIKE ANY GOOD STANDING CITIZEN WOULD
S - Like heaven, floral perfume of hops and mild citrus and sweet sweet good times to come
M - Carbonation is perfect, does not take away, but adds to the flavor
T - Absolutely glorious, bitter, yet sweet and citrus, pine, fruity, crisp and fresh...this needs a poem to describe it with any real value...
I drank one right after picking them up from the brewery and then others a week later. Haven't noticed a big change, perhaps very slightly less juicy, if that makes any sense.
Take care not to get carried away, after one, you are good, nice buzz for at least one hour...attempt any more and you are waiting for a pounding, or in my case, a four hour nap!
If you are having a bad day, open a can of Heady and all your problems instantly disappear, seriously!

Pours a very murky, glowing orange color, similar to a hefeweizen. looks very pulpy. The aroma is similar to smelling a handful of fresh hop pellets on a brewery tour. resinous, out of control sharp hop notes of grapefruit, pine, some pineapple maybe and fresh cut peaches. Really great nose. The taste is much of the same as the aroma but with a big juicy feel to it that makes this drinkable. not overly bitter as i would have expected which adds to the drinkability. The mouthfeel is medium bodied since its unfiltered and has a chewy character to it. Really great beer, perfect for all seasons for sure. 652 charactersAugustiner719, Sep 25, 2013

A great beer- I don't do the whole 5 point review- but it's a top-notch beer. Best in the world? That's a really tough claim to validate. Scarcity drives demand, however wonderful a beer it may be. 
People are definitely feeding the demand down south- the demand drives those lines at the stores around here- people are shipping it out/transporting it down to the metropolitan areas (obviously). 
As far as aroma- solid, almost like pot-like. Flavor is wonderful, it hangs in your mouth, rolls off the tongue with weight but not too much. Definitely a fun beer.
As comparison, I'm partial to Lawson's double IPA (yeah, even harder to get). Never tried the Pliny's, but I'm guessing it's a toss up. 
One thing my buddy -a true brewer/connoisseur- more so than myself- pointed out: the whole "Drink from the can" thing is somewhat BS- because the obvious reason is that the appearance/color is, well, pretty mediocre for beer, and somewhat crap for a beer this highly regarded. Who really cares about aesthetics, though? 
I'll take a crappy appearance (don't tell us to hide it, Alchemist) for great nose!
Again, the #1 beer in the world ranking is recognized, at least around here by people that sell the stuff, as somewhat inflated by hype and scarcity- we all love it, but it's almost a hysteria for the stuff...
edit: the girlfriend made a point- 2 cans of heady topper is the max you want to drink- diminishing returns on the pleasure of drinking this scarce commodity of a beer. Two leaves you satisfied. 1,677 charactersnorthbywest, Sep 21, 2013

S- Big, resinous, piney hops are the foremost and only scent on this one. Kind of sticky in the nose with all the hops. Slight hint of underlying mild sweetness.
T- Bitter hops flavor off the bat. Sticky, resinous hops are upfront and foremost on the palate. Towards the middle of the drink, a slight sweetness of the base malts come through. Hops make a comeback at the end with a primarily pine flavor that really stings the back of the tongue. Ends with the lingering hops bitterness.
M- Thick, sticky, and smooth as hell. This thing drinks more like a stout than an IPA, but goes down quite smooth. The weight is on the heavier side, but man it goes down easy.
Overall, do I think this is the best IIPA or IPA I've ever had? Probably not. The hype train oversells this one a bit, but it is a damn good beer. I will seek it out again in trades and savor this one while I have it. 1,068 charactersboilermakerbrew, Sep 20, 2013

Well...the first thing I did was ignore that rule because I wanted to see it and smell it. IT didn't have much head but is the cloudiest IPA I have ever seen. A very peachy color.
Nose is along the pine side with oils and caramel. Very distinct once again. 
Taste: I have had lots of IPAs like everybody else. And I have had all ends of the flavor spectrum. This one falls deeply into the citrus and tropical end in my book. At the end of the drink there is a more west coast hope profile. Very complex and very balanced but yet not with the typical malts. This is really a distinct beer and really enjoyable to drink. Isn't that what matters? Something new and different and not over the edge?
The mouth feel is quite mellow and the alcohol is warming. 
I must say this beer is a nice treat and would buy it constantly if it were available around here. Definitely worthy of it's head of the class rating. 1,044 charactersdaledeee, Sep 18, 2013

One pint can. Mostly consumed from the can (according to instructions on the can), but I poured a small amount into an IPA glass to review appearance. No date on can, but it was fresh...
A - Hazy mango colored liquid with a thick head. Plenty of carbonation. Cloudy, but no particulate. Delicate lacing as beer receded.
S - Intensely fragrant. Orange and some tropical fruit. Honestly, I poured very little into the glass, so I could experience the majority of it from the can. Very likely more scents to detect. Maybe next time if I get a case, I'll spend more time developing this area of the review...
T - WOW. INTENSE FLAVOR. Tart mango, lemon, and pine followed by a delicious hops bath. Significant emphasis on the wonderful hops in every swig. Very well balanced with some bready malts. Orange-rind finish. ABV is not completely hidden and compliments beer very well.
M - Luxurious foamy hop bath (had to say that again). Felt light and foamy in the mouth, but also very filling. Can't imagine it could be improved.
O - I am ruined for life. I will now continuously explore more opportunities to get my hands on more of this sweet nectar. 1,223 charactersDuane_Opfer, Sep 17, 2013

If I drink something before I simply don't enjoy heady as much and if I drink something after I lose the desire for beer. Other then that it is wonderful, But I have to session it by itself have 2 or 3 and call it a night. 417 charactersGsantollo, Sep 16, 2013

4.66/5  rDev +0.2%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance- Pours up a more than a fair amount of head and seems to have pretty good retention. The head is a pure cotton white while the body is a hazy, pale to medium amber with weak grapefruit notes which glows a pale amber with hints of orange when held up to the light. Hazy but I haven't detected any of the infamous floaters. Some lacing is left behind. 
Nose- Not the strongest scent that I've encountered from an IPA/DIPA but still fairly warm and inviting. Rings with citrus- grapefruit, orange, and lemon. Mellow to moldy peach. Cherries, some honey. Nice floral and perfume notes. Some banana. Quite complex but very subtle at the same time. Some papaya after swirling. 
Taste- Reflective of the nose in both complexity and subtlety. Armpit and funk start off with a mixture of citrus and honey following. Some onion with lots of grapefruit and both orange and lemon peel. Very subdued matchstick which borders on sublime. The hops are incredibly fresh (this is a 3 day old can) and well rounded. The yeast and hops lend an incredible spiciness to the finish. Honey and caramel provide a sweetness that blend well with the bold citrus, tropical fruit, and mild pine and resin of the hop profile. This is very mellow and incredibly smooth for the style. Nectar seems to be the one word which bind together the entire description of this beer. Some vinous characteristics- some white grape. As this opens up, it becomes more delightful and boozy. But the booze is warm and inviting and seems to attach the flavors to your palate (or perhaps this is more the mouthfeel which seems to coat your tongue in film). Peaches, melons, banana, orange, and lemon. So many fruits and so much juiciness with the right amount of pine and resin to balance it all out. Makes me think of a less messy 120. Not sure how this ranks against the Plinys but they're all pretty close. Some funk that evokes moldy cheese and mushrooms. A hint of cinnamon. 
Mouthfeel- Incredibly smooth and creamy for an IPA. This is definitely a large part of the appeal of this beer. It's almost buttery, a little bit greasy with somewhat of a dry finish which does cleanse the palate but allows the spice and wood of the finish to linger. Even the middle parts of the profile linger. Good amount of carbonation. There's tons of juice and syrup on the texture- this is pretty heavy for an DIPA. Medium bodied. Somewhat silky as well. The more it opens up, the more you mouth tingles. 
Drinkability- This is extremely accessible for an IPA. I had a Boneyard RPM earlier and thought that was approachable but it doesn't even hold a candle to the near sublimity that defines this beer. 3 bucks a can is a steal for this can. I feel pretty good about paying 60 bucks for the 12 cans I was able to get. 
Overall- Great beer. It isn't my favorite beer in the world but I understand why it resides at the top of the rankings. If you nitpick the flavor profile, you can judge it to be just like any other world class or outstanding IPA/DIPA. However, this beer needs to be considered as more than the sum of its parts. It is constantly involving in the mouth even after a drink has been taken. It never even approaches boring- there are different notes constantly appearing. Definitely worth a try if you can get some. 3,287 charactersartoolemomo, Sep 16, 2013

4.65/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Cracked a can which was about 2 months old. Poured into a tulip glass.
I never mention bitterness in my reviews, my bitterness taste buds are ridiculously under-sensitive.
APPEARANCE : Hazy golden orange, with a reasonably thick, fluffy, pleasingly appetizing head. Looks like those good-weather-clouds over a lazy sunrise, but only briefly, as the head is rather quick to die out almost entirely, leaving some lacing that looks like it won't stick around so much either.
SMELL : First nose is fresh hops, fresh hops, fresh hops and more fresh hops, with a thin but solid malt foundation. Very tightly packed, richly textured but somewhat indistinct. Second nose has some very sharp herbal aromas, tons of citrus (mostly grapefruit) and pineapple and some mango and other tropical fruits. The third nose releases hints of strawberries which, once noticed, become more obvious and extremely pleasing. Some dusty earth as well.
TASTE : Small impression of sweetness, but really, really faint. Almost imperceptible. Definitely honey-like. The mouth follows the nose and releases the strawberries even more, with some mango and even watermelon notes. Some kind of barnyard funk also comes out in the mouth. The whole thing lasts and lasts and lasts. I took a sip when I started to write this paragraph a minute ago and I still feel some aromas.
MOUTHFEEL : Very round, pleasing texture. Carbonation is a touch too active for me, but a few swings around the glass and it's down to something more to my taste. Leaves a pleasing wet tropical fruit punch sensation after swallowing. Impressive.
OVERALL : Among the best brews I've had. I probably wouldn't go so far as to call this the best beer in the world (too much amazing stuff out there) but it's definitely up there, way up there. I bought a 4-pack 3 days ago on-location at the brewery and I'll probably review this one tomorow, for the sake of comparison. And also to give me an acceptable excuse to drink another one. 1,975 charactersFrostBlast, Sep 14, 2013

4.45/5  rDev -4.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.7516oz can, thanks to Phyl21ca for getting this across the continent to me. If we are entreated to "Drink from the Can!", then why does the label illustration show the dude getting his mind literally blown ('heady topped?'), using a GLASS?
This beer pours a cloudy medium apricot amber hue, with three fat fingers of puffy, billowy, and chunky off-white head, which leaves some thickly rendered, sudsy webbed lace around the glass as it slowly ebbs away.
It smells of sharp, bitter grapefruit and orange pith, acrid pine resin, musty forest floor detritus, a crackery sourdough maltiness, and a hint of spicy yeast. The taste is still bitter, but in a more leavened sense, as the grapefruit, tangerine, and other muddled tropical fruit display a modicum of their sugary, fleshy nature, with the pine needles still pleasantly in neutral, the yeastiness going native and ethereal, a caramel essence attaching itself to the steady bready (and, why not - heady) honey-tinted malt sweetness.
The bubbles are fairly laid-back, manifesting mostly in a mild frothiness, the body a sturdy medium weight, and smooth like unfiltered orange juice. It finishes off-dry, the slightly yeasty, and now toasty bready malt faring surprisingly well amongst the hovering hipster hops. Still no alcohol notes readily perceptible.
A DIPA worthy of its stature, but for reasons I did not quite expect - this is a hop bomb, sure, but more of the neutron variety - the attack leaves the infrastructure (i.e. my tastebuds) intact. It's all about flavour here, rather than overt bitterness or astringency, and while my mind remains unequivocally unblown, I can surely admit that this is the best combination of tasty and easy-drinking that I have ever encountered in the style. Oh, and I took a sip out of the can before I poured it - seemed the same to me. 1,832 charactersbiboergosum, Sep 14, 2013

4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Lightly chilled 16 oz. can. Picked up last Wendesday outside Burlington, VT. Poured a couple oz. into a shaker to get a look at it, the rest stayed in the can as per the brewer's printed plea.
Look- Hazy straw, a ~2 oz pour gives me three fingers of foamy off-white head that falls slowly, very nice lacing. 
Smell- Dank, resinous, herbal with a buried citric quality. Whoof. Pungent. Mild sweetness, rosemary comes to mind. In your face, but not astringent or abrasive. Excellent.
Taste- Nothing too flashy, but ready to wow you nonetheless. Fresh, pungent hops explode on the taste buds. Bitterness is low, much lower than anticipated- just gobs and gobs of hop flavor. Herbal, nondescript tropical fruit, fresh pine, ginger, light sweetness that lingers. Light white toast backbone with a touch of honey. Lingering fresh, light feel.
Mouthfeel- Medium-full body, juicy, soft but present carbonation. Goes down easy... too easy? Cool, clean finish, light dryness. Did I mention clean? This stuff begs to be drunk. I could chug this- and I'm pretty sure that's a bad thing.
Overall- Very, very nice. Easy to see how they'd limit it to 12 cans/person even with a year-round release. Not the most flavor-blasted or bold DIPA on the market, but it's... quality. Don't know how else to put it- these guys aren't messing around, it's one of the freshest and most well put-together beers I've ever had the pleasure to drink. Unique mellow-ish flavor balance- perhaps the most "balanced" DIPA I've had, who knew that was a thing? Drool-worthy. 1,542 charactersLawl3ss, Sep 11, 2013

Aroma: explosion of citrus and slight pine on the nose, biscuit notes, clean yeast
Taste: wonderful. Simply wonderful. Awesome balance of citrus hops with solid and noticeable biscuit notes, which are much more noticeable than in most DIPAs. The bitter but not overly so finish completes a great swig. 
Mouthfeel: full bodied, big, but very drinkable. Medium finish which is nice, makes you able to come back for more drinks more often unlike some DIPAs that's are so bitter that you can only really take one sip every 5-10 minutes medium carbonation. 
Overall: without question one of the best DIPAs I've ever had. Very balanced and very flavorful with huge notes of citrus and biscuit balancing each other. Medium finish and drinkable body makes for an incredibly well made beer. 857 charactersdwren89, Sep 10, 2013

Aroma is very hop-forward but in a gentle well crafted manner. There is no obnoxious bright green hop attack, rather, a soft blanket of perfectly picked hop bouquet. There are wonderful notes of fully bloomed flowers and RIPE stone fruit with the citrus quality of the hops rounding out the nose.
Taste is pleasantly sweet caramel on the attack followed by, as they say, "wave after wave of hoppy goodness on your palate." The balance of bittering hops, aromatic hops and malt notes is the best I have ever enjoyed. Absolutely terrific DIPA.
Overall, I would drive 4.5 hours one-way to get this beer again. Awesome beer to share with friends that appreciate well crafted beer. 779 charactersFather_Raybob, Sep 09, 2013

I acquired 2 of these in a trade with abilow33 - I'll be reviewing the first which I'm drinking in the can per recommendations.
A: 4.0 I can't bring myself to give a 5 in appearance when I can't see it... 
S: 5.0 Huge citrus and hop bomb immediately after opening the can.
T: 4.75 Very sweet, citrusy, floraly with pine on the back end. There is a slight dryness on the tongue in the aftertaste.
M: 4.5 Well carbed, smooth, but the dryness in the end prevents this from being perfect.
O: 4.5 Lots of hype around this one, understandable so. I can name a couple beers which I've had recently which compare to this more so than the ratings would suggest. I am very glad I was able to get a couple of these, but it's nothing that I would trade for again - not when readily available are Stone Ruination, FFF Dreadnaught and Bells Two Hearted.
Edit: rereview on 2/21/14
Acquired more via trade. While drinking and reviewing my original review, I can't bring myself to change any ratings. Surprisingly. I can however, and obviously, say that it is worth trading for more than 1 time. Having had more beer than I care to count in between my original review and now, I can say that Heady is one that I have consistently looked forward to. There just aren't any other IPAs that can capture the essence of hops the way The Alchemist does with Heady. Cheers, 'till the next one! 1,394 charactersroger617, Sep 08, 2013

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5General - I was in Albany, NY for the holiday weekend and made my friend drive 4 hours north to VT to get me a case of this before I even arrived. I've had extremely high expectations for this beer since reading all the reviews and never getting to try it. I drank it out of the can, just like the can says to do!
Appearance - I drank it out of the can so I couldn't tell but to get a little measure, I poured some in a glass. Looks like a nice golden color but is super hazy, that's from the unfiltered aspect. Still love it, the head is frothy and slightly off white. 
Aroma - Citrus and a slight smell of cut grass. There is a tangerine hit with it also. I love the smell of this guy. It's awesome. 
Taste - It's like a grapefruit and a tangerine are having a baby in my glass. Pure amazingness. 
Mouthfeel - It has a thick feeling to it with moderately high carbonation. 
Overall - This is a great beer that I would drink more often than I can find it in Southern California. If anyone is heading to the LA area from an area where you can get this, I'll pay you with my first born child! Just kidding, but seriously this is a great DIPA. I still think that Pliny has it beat for my top beer, but for different reasons. The proprietary Conan yeast is really great, it let's the hop flavors come through while enhancing them and not muddling them. I think that the low amount of coagulation that the yeast gives is part of the reason for the creaminess. 1,460 charactersBeerEngineer, Sep 06, 2013

It has a light burnt orange color it. The aroma is strong piney hops. The taste is a little bitter than the citrus comes in. At the end the hops bite your tongue like a rattlesnake. It leaves a bitter after taste and overall one hell of a beer. 337 characterschefhatt, Sep 05, 2013

4.85/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75A - Yellow-orange and hazy. I could care less about appearance, so unless it's really beautiful or really ugly, it will get the average of the other ratings. Who drinks a beer for appearance anyway?
S: Piney, flowery, spicy, and a little sweet which is actually a great balance to the spicy. I have a feeling the sweetness is from the Conan yeast as it supposedly produces fruity esters. Probably the second best smelling beer after Stone Enjoy By (thankfully The Alchemist isn't using Nelson Sauvin to get that aroma though as Nelson Sauvin would put a serious hit on the taste.) Also, it smells better outside of the can.
T - Good bitterness, great malt balance, and of course all the piney, fruity, spicy hoppy goodness you would expect from a beer that claims to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness. And it gets better with age. After drinking a 5+ month old Heady Topper I'm now giving this beer a 5.
M - Good bitterness, very smooth, nice light carbonation
O - Great stuff. Nothing bad about this beer. I homebrew, and if I was going to personally brew this beer I might go with a little less upfront bitterness and a little more over the top late addition/dry hop fruitiness, but I think they did a great job balancing things out with dank hops. 1,263 charactersianmatth, Sep 04, 2013

I poured it into a glass. Cloudy, orange/gold/copper color. A thick, light tan head tops it off. Aroma is supper hoppy. Awesome, big piney and citrus smells. Like a bag of hops. The flavor has a light malt backbone with some noticeable caramel malt in there. This is a very smooth imperial IPA. The hop flavor does have some sour citrus rind notes, but mostly bright grapefruit and some tropical fruit sweetness. Also a bit of floral, vanilla notes. 
Overall, really top notch, of course. 507 charactersAaronHomoya, Sep 01, 2013
4.21/5  rDev -9.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25From the can distributed during the week of August 26, 2013. Sampled on September 1, 2013.
It pours a pale yellow with a humongous white puffy head (on the top ha ha) with a bit of a haze. Moderate carbonation. 
On the nose is a bevy of floral hop sensations with a dash of orange peel, tropics, and grapefruit. Malts are downplayed.
A medium to full body with a slight astringency.
The taste has a slight biscuit feel at first but it does not last long as the hops explode on the palate and linger to the end. At the same time it does not become hops and nothing else like some double IPA's can be. The alcohol is well-integrated. 
I understand why this beer has won praise and accolades from beer enthusiasts all over the world but to me it is about the same as Shipyard Pugsley's XXXX and Smuttynose IPA. 812 characterspuboflyons, Sep 01, 2013

A: Solid with hazy and a dusty apricot colour, the head is bone white with just a micro film that skiffs the top. Do yourself a favour and leave it in the can. 
S: Bright and citrus with floral scents that develop to a sweet malty backbone. Sweet orange and pineapple juice with scents of fresh crisp apples and pears, and a familiar soapy smell similar to floral candies. 
T: Smooth creamy malts wash through up front teasing the palette with rock sugar, but then takes a left turn a runs headlong into delicious bitters, piney resins and grapefruit pith that sucks onto the tongue and palette. A unique and delicious note of fresh cracked white pepper on the finish. The flavours are dialled up to 11, without challenging or taxing the drinker - its enjoyable from start to finish. 
M: A mid range carbonation that supports both the hops and the malts expertly. The smooth creamy malts up front lend way to a enjoyable and bitter pucker on the back end. 
O: Heady Topper truly holds it's own in the upper echelon of incredible brews. The scent and flavours are dialled up as intensely as could be possible, while still offering the drinker a fresh hoppiness and sweet malts. The lingering bitters hold onto the tongue like a drowning man to a life raft. A treat for any hop head looking for a stunning mix of hops and malts. 1,496 charactersFondueVoodoo, Sep 01, 2013

4.92/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big shout out to my fellow Beer Advocate Mikeypnh for the hookup on this one
Appearance - Cloudy dark gold in color, almost verging on reddish orange, a creamy thick white head clung for dear life to the side of the glass and left massive residue behind
Smell - Where to even begin? The smell is just pure raw hops like I have never smelled before. Even at a decent distance from the glass the aroma was still noticeable. This is hops personified and it is just amazing
Taste - Absolutely unreal! Just a massive smack in the face of hops. Then followed up by a huge mango and grapefruit presence but the second half of the flavor experience is what really did it for me. It was almost like drinking hop syrup, as if the resin was slowly oozing through the beer down my throat. I have never experienced that before drinking an IPA/DIPA and it really sets itself apart from any other beer I've ever had. This was perfection in a can.
Mouthfeel - This is easily the best mouthfeel of any IPA/DIPA I have ever had. The cloudy thick profile of the beer itself, not to mention the syrup like elements of the hop resin just made it a liquid dream
Overall - This is without a doubt right up there as the best IPA/DIPA I have ever had. Believe the hype and accolades this beer receives because it deserves every single one of them. What John Kimmich and his crew are able to bring out of hops is something like I have never tasted in a beer before and quite frankly I didn't know was possible. This beer pushes the envelope of not only what an IPA/DIPA can be, but beer in general. This stuff is absolute liquid gold in a can and if you like hops then you must taste it sometime in your life. Amazing amazing stuff 1,710 charactersWiscoBrewsco, Aug 31, 2013

4.9/5  rDev +5.4%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5In short, lives up to the hype for sure. 
Appears cloudy, orange-yellow, this beer is just beautiful. I would say the absolute best component of beer is the floral nose. Definitely the most citrusy, piney, robust nose you can find in an IPA. Taste echoes the smell. Perfect balance with the hops here, not like a lot of big hoppy beers where all you taste is grass. This beer is complex and beautifully built. Did a comparison to Lawson's Double Sunshine, and I felt that the DS was only every so slightly superior with regards to taste. DS has a cleaner mouthfeel than HT ever so slightly while maintaining the same balanced hop amazingness.
Bottom line: This beer is amazing. Worth the $50/4pk it goes for online if you've never had it. Otherwise, find a VT-er who can send you a steady stash for your own great locals. 823 charactersuvajrl, Aug 30, 2013

Pours murky orange with a very thin white head that leaves a thin collar of lace, with some chunky sediment. The nose is intense orange peel citrus, resin bitterness, chewable kids vitamins, caramel malt, and a touch of earthy yeast. The flavor is orange and grapefruit peel, bitter resin, chewable kids vitamins, the same earthy yeast, and just enough caramel malt to keep everything in balance. The body is medium with an oily texture, lighter than average carbonation, and a very long resin and citrus peel bitter finish. 586 characterswedgie9, Aug 30, 2013

Cloudy, yellow orange appearance with an orange tinged off white head. Slightly resiny, piney, organic hoppy, citrusy aroma. Very nice, piney, somewhat resiny, hoppy, tasty citrusy flavor. Awesome! 
Update: This is my third time drinking this beer (courtesy of Glouglouburp. Thanks Dany!) It has an even more intense piney, resiny aroma with a slightly dull citrus element than I remember. Huge fucking resiny, grapefruity, sticky hoppy flavor. Sure this fucker is a little over the top, but it’s fun. My next trip to Vermont I will be getting blasted on this shit. 
Another update: This one comes from nightrider, a friendly trader in California that has gotten me my freshest can yet! This can has traveled 5,000 miles and it’s the freshest one I’ve had, go figure.Super resiny, piney, grapefruity hoppy aroma. More potent that I remember. Soft mouth feel.

Overall heady won the battle.. matter of fact Heady was the best "BEER" I've ever had period and clearly won the whole thing.. plineys appearance as far as color goes was better but heady had a better head and lacing... smelt a tad... just a schmidging better than pliney (pliney was a bit sweeter which i liked but heady was balnced) and blew pliney away on taste, mouthfeel and overall.. if you have not tried this beer yet than shame on you.... and shame on them for not having this beer readily available as they do with bmc product... this is deserving of the best dipa and #1 overall. 724 characterspjkelley82, Aug 28, 2013

I had been shying away from IPA's and there were few DIPA's I really enjoyed. Since having Heady several times over the last month I keep drinking more and more DIPA's only to be disappointed that it doesn't live up to Heady. Some may match it in 1 or 2 area's but I don't think there is an IPA or any style I would rather drink than Heady. 465 charactersOldeBrickHouse, Aug 28, 2013

I'm drinking it from the can, but I've seen it poured before. It's a murky, cloudy yellow bordering on orange that is pretty nice to look at, but won't win any awards for its appearance.
The smell. Oh god the smell. Grapefruit, pine, and citrus mixed into a beautiful cacophony of awesome.
Tastes about as awesome as it smells, and unbelievably smooth. I still can't honestly believe it's 8%. Begins sweet, with an awesome bitterness that builds over time and begs for another sip. Gets fruitier as it warms.
Mouthfeel is light and with decent carbonation, maybe could be a little fuller, but I'm nitpicking.
Overall probably my favorite beer (though I acknowledge my local bias). Definitely worth having if you're in the area. 810 charactersbsm789, Aug 28, 2013

4.1/5  rDev -11.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I often mention how my opinion of a beer can affected even before I drink it because of what I have heard about it before hand. Heady Topper is definitely one that fits into the category. Being the highest ranked beer on this site, this brew was pretty hyped up in my head before hand. I am happy to say it didn't disappoint but I don't think it is quite worthy of being ranked as high as it is.
Heady Topper has a pretty bitter taste but it has just enough smoothness that it is plenty drinkable. The citrusy, piney hops are very noticeable and add a bitterness that make it worthy of being a double IPA. What's nice though is this beer stops just short of being a "palate wrecker". My guess is it is this quality that makes this beer so popular. It is a powerful brew that reminds you that it is an 8% beer but it goes down easy enough that you could drink a few of these without getting sick of it.
If you look at the list of my top rated beers, you will see that my personal preference leans towards bourbon barrel aged beers and stouts. I don't know if an IPA is a style that I would rank ahead of some of my favorite darker beers. That said, this beer was outstanding and I am glad I got the chance to try it. 1,217 charactersmjpolzin, Aug 25, 2013

I go to the cannery if I'm in VT, even if they are out, mostly because of the aroma there. Taste is outstanding. So citrusy, with a very complementing bitterness.

Smells is heavy citrus, orange and tangerine. Taste is very citrusy kinda like the citrus notes in Jai Alai, not overly hoppy. Overall this beer is worth seeking out and unlike any other IPA I have had. 283 charactersJas45678, Aug 24, 2013

Well, here goes nothing. 
Pours an extremely hazy golden yellow. No chunks as I've seen some people say. Poured a little light so I only received a one finger head. But it has nice retention. 
This beer smells so so so fresh. I can't describe how fresh it smells. Tangerine and grapefruit on the nose. I can smell this beer from the other end of my table. No alcohol presence. Smells wonderful. 
Taste is of fresh hops and citrus. Very well balanced. Fruit esters at the forefront. As soon as the beer hits my mouth it's tangerine and grapefruit. Very very fresh. Hops dominate the rest of the taste. The middle and end of the sips are all hops. Very fresh and balanced. Not too bitter. Very earthy. 
Mouthfeel is great. Perfectly carbonated. The carbonation really keeps the flavors alive in your mouth and gives a nice bite on your tongue. 
Overall this is a wonderful beer. Number one in the world? Eh... Not sure. That's something you'll have to decide for yourself. But what I can say is that it's an amazing beer and well well worth the try. If you can get it, get it. Drink it and enjoy. 1,124 charactersdowen17, Aug 23, 2013

4.47/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5So here it is. Never thought I'd get a chance to try it, or if I did I'd have to pay a ton to get it, which I wouldn't at this point, so I guess this makes this a rare and valued occasion, for which I am indeed grateful. 
Appearance: Though I'm trying to drink some out of the can, I'm also pouring it into a North Brewery snifter / tulip glass to get what's coming from all the supposed eye candy. Retention is decent, though not spectacular, but what's great about this beer is the haze within the color of it. Pour at least some in a glass, people. I imagine you are. It's a gorgeous yellow-orange-copper hue, hazed up beyond belief, looking more like a dirty Witbier than a DIPA. 
Smell: An amped up and balanced bouquet of effervescent fruit, being orange, lemon, pineapple, and probably many tropical indigenous fruits I've never had or may never have. There's definitely a good amount of sweetness going on here too. Not sure if that's from any additional sugars or honey malt, but they're there. Really, though, the heady rush of beautifully crafted ingredients is there. Each whiff reminds of this or that or this or that, but either way, this is up there. 
Taste: What gets me most about this beer is how this isn't necessarily a hop bomb, as I maybe thought it would've been. I guess even if the IBUs are up, the point, as with, I imagine, all good beers are, is that it IS balanced. That said, again, there is sweetness, and not the point of being cloying, but man, it's there. But I imagine it's there because of necessity. And again, honey malt? Honey? Brown sugar? Anything else added here to quell the said monumental hops? The finish is insanely long, the good and balanced sweetness is there, and the fruits are monumental without being overpowered by bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: One of the best if not the best things about this brew. Heavy enough, yes. But insanely velvety overall. Not perfect, but close. 
Drinkability: It's impossible to say what's the best, but as far as DIPAs go, this is up there, at least in my top three. Many are, I imagine, saying the same thing, versus some you've reviewed and have in your mind, with matching characteristics and equally good balanced. Don't pay an arm and a leg for this, I'd say, but I'm thrilled I got to try it, and if it comes across again, I'll definitely be one who's ready to crack it open and enjoy it. 2,378 charactersasabreed, Aug 22, 2013

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally trying the famous Heady Topper, thanks to an awesome gift from Ljudsignal!
Poured half into a tulip, drinking the other half from the can to get both experiences. 
Pour is translucent bright orange-yellow, like orange juice, with a fluffy white head that leaves slick lacing. Smells AMAZING. Waves of flowers, mango, pineapple, passionfruit, melon, grapefruit, orange, lemon, lime, pine...best smelling beer I've ever had. Now the taste...
Taste is perfect. Sweet malt backbone quickly bows out of the way to seemingly infinite hops. Tropical fruit, melon, berry, citrus, pine, herbal/leafy, bitterness...it's all perfectly balanced and in harmony with itself, the malt, the mouthfeel...this is a perfect beer. Amazing!
As far as from the can, it's a slightly more concentrated experience and is amazing in its own way as well. It's somehow simultaneously managed to taste complex and amazing while being incredibly refreshing as well. I know now why this is the only beer The Alchemist makes...it's because they've perfected it. 
Thanks again to Ljudsignal for sending me this amazing beer and giving me the opportunity to try the [currently] best beer on BA! 1,170 charactersBurgeoningBrewhead, Aug 20, 2013
4.49/5  rDev -3.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Had at the Skinny Pancake at Burlington Airport
A - Hazy orange body with a thick white cap that leaves great lacing.
S - One of my favorite parts of the beer. Like smelling a hop bouquet. Sweet, floral hops and a bit of orange zest. Just a hint of sweet malt and a smooth alcohol aroma as the beer warms. Piney and citrusy at the same time. Love it
T&M - Tons and tons of hops but I would not say this is an overly bitter beer. A little less than moderate carbonation allows the beer to coat your mouth with each sip. Pine and citrus hops with a sweet malt backbone. Warming alcohol on the swallow but not overly forward; just enough to balance things out. Every time I take a sip I think of aromatic flowers.
O - Insanely drinkable for a IIPA. I had this at 12pm which is usually way too early for me but I couldn't pass it up. Still went down now and easy. The key to this beer's greatness is its balance. All the flavors and aromas meld so well together and compliment each other wonderfully. 1,000 charactersMrIncognito, Aug 20, 2013

I went to the Alchemist's new brewery a couple months back and bought as much as they would let me. This beer is in high demand and in general not distributed very far as they're still a small brewery. But it's definitely worth the trip.
This is extreme hop heaven. But unlike some it is not too overwhelming as it is perfectly blended. The smell and taste are like heaven. 506 charactersThia417, Aug 19, 2013

I poured a few ounces into a snifter so that I could properly rate it - but drank the rest from the can and I must say I enjoyed it more from the can!
Appearance - hazy golden/orange. As i swirled in snifter left some good lacing on the side of the glass.
Aroma - on point!! Burst of hops and citrus, pine/ resinous and floral
Taste - nice hop bite with a bit of sweetness and a good malt backbone. Grapefruit, citrus, pine
Mouthfeel - didn't seem to carbonated. so smooth and drinkable it's crazy. 
overall - just an amazing brew and definitely worth the hype, I couldn't believe how smooth this beer went down. I wanted to have another one right after but with only four might have to stretch them out over a week. 809 charactersmaxcoinage, Aug 18, 2013

4.99/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured a 5 oz. taster just to see the color.
A: An unfiltered golden straw color. Poured a nice thick white head that stuck around for a bit.
S: As soon as I popped the can I could smell the pretty complex hop profile. A little piny but mostly citrus on the nose. Sweet and juicy.
T: Not a hopbomb, it's a hop experience. The flavor is a little piny but overall it is fruity. Crisp and not overpowering I am getting grapefruits and tropicals.
M: IMO the best feature of this brew. The beer completely coats your mouth with the juicy goodness of its complex hop profile. The carbonation is perfect, not too prickly but invigorating. 
O: Overall this is an impossibly drinkable DIPA. If had access to this brew I would pay the $3 a can and drink it every day. Can't wait to have the opportunity to do a blind side by side with the likes of Pliny and a few Alpines. It's the only way to really rank these top contenders. 922 charactersxseanprimex, Aug 18, 2013

Pours a murky orange with an impressive creamy two-and-a-half-finger head. Head fades over the course of two-three minutes to a film of foam atop the beer. Splotchy, cobwebby lacing.
In the nose--well, lean in to within about six inches of the glass and you can smell it. Big dank floral hops with a slightly peppery spice edge, citrus and tropical fruits, wet grass and a faint but persistent sweet bready malt note. Hops for days, man, hops for days.
Taste follows the nose almost to a T. Massive juicy hops from the very first sip--pineapple, mango, tangerine, and grapefruit all clamor for attention. Also present are potent floral notes--fresh-cut grass, a dank oniony note, pine sap, and again that effervescent peppery character. Sweet bready malt rounds out the equation, with a surprisingly clean phenolic bite at the very back. The balance is what really impresses here--no one flavor profile dominates over the other in this beer.
Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, smooth and creamy.
On the whole... "lush" is the word that comes to mind here. From the raw hop juiciness of the flavor profile to the creaminess of the feel, this is a deceptively smooth beer for the intensity of hop flavor it packs. Delicious and well worth the effort necessary to procure it. 1,360 charactersLjudsignal, Aug 17, 2013

M: one of the best parts about the beer in my opinion. the drinkability is on a level i've never experienced before. its almost as though the beer just goes down and then you taste an explosion of flavors that linger on your palette afterwards.

A - beautiful orange-yellow color, completely hazy, with sticky head leaving a ton of lacing.
S - a citrus hop explosion! Grapefruit, pineapple, orange, and mint. This literally smells like heaven. The alcohol becomes more present as it warms.
T/M - oily hops with a surprising amount of sweetness. The hop bitterness is definitely present, but it doesn't overpower the beer. This is amazingly balanced.
O - few things live up to the hype. This does. I have not drank another IPA since first trying Heady Topper. And considering I came back from Vermont with two cases, I probably won't have another IPA for a while.
Other notes:
Obviously the appearance and smell are much better in glassware, however, the taste is strangely enhanced straight from the can. 896 characterslancecenter, Aug 16, 2013

I expected the can to limit aroma, but there is no way! It explodes with a nice strong amount of pine, with some orange. Some nice bitter citrus coming through as well. And just a slight bit of sweetness.
A real explosion of flavors. THe citrus is more present in the taste, as well as a bit of floralness. A bit more malty sweetness here, as well.
The mouthfeel of this is what I think really makes it so drinkable. The nice constant carbonation going back over the tongue stimulates the buds so well to help accentuate the flavors. Just enough bitterness to make you crave more and truly bring out the flavor it seems in some odd way.
Overall is it the best beer I've ever had? Well, probably. THe only bad thing I can think of with this beer is I don't want to drink it (despite the extreme drinkability) because it is like killing a unicorn or something. Honestly, though, when drinking it, it is basically impossibly to say "this" could be better if...

Color: a mix of light orange with a tint of deep golden yellow cloudiness (because its unfiltered).
Aroma: a pleasant balance of sweet citrus and pine
Palate: also perfectly balanced; it is my understanding that the flavor profile changes depending on whether this is consumed from a glass or as Alchemist recommends, right out of the can. For this review, the beer is in a glass. It's a warm, flavorful blend of citrus, pine, with a bouquet of undertones. 
Mouthfeel: smooth and just the right amount of carbonation. Easy drinkability, especially considering the high IBU content.
Overall: the best, most complex and enjoyable beer I have had. So fantastic and drinkable. Even non-craft drinkers would probably enjoy this. 755 charactersCpapallo, Aug 15, 2013

I drank this baby as recommended; she stays in the can. So, it’s hard to note on appearance here… the can looks nice?
Aroma:
Thick, aromatic, resinous pine. The lid of the can smells like a freshly opened packet of hop pellets used for homebrewing. The smell is fantastic, and I needed to remind myself that the beer was meant to be drunk. Here goes nothing… 
Taste:
Bubbles hit first, giving a pleasant prickle on the tongue. As soon as the sensation fades, you get hit with hops. Hard. Not melt-your-enamel-off bitter, like some DIPAs out there, but true hop flavor. Pine is the most prevalent flavor here, and the experience is not unlike what I image a pine-needle tea would be like. The woodsy flavor lingers for a few seconds before it melts into a slight citrusy sweetness. The aftertaste leaves you with an impression of the first sip accompanied by a mellow alcoholic burn.
Mouthfeel: 
Moderate, prickly carbonation, as well as slightly viscous; not a hop syrup however, as it finishes dry.
Overall:
Wow, I’m glad I like piney hops or this would’ve been a letdown. I would not recommend this one to people who can’t handle their beers with a coniferous twist. That being said, yes…This beer lives up to the hype. Never before have I had a beer that tastes so much like a pure hop cone. Heady Topper was a journey and a pain for me to find, but it truly is an amazing example of hop-wizardry; although simplistic, the fresh flavor was worth the effort. 
PS:
 If you do get the chance to try this beer, don’t be like the others who gave it a 5 and wrote nothing. We get it, you had a top-rated beer, congratulations … it was good, we know… Why don’t you do yourself a favor and try to help the community out by describing what you had (maybe you noticed something that others did not). 1,837 charactersSnifterWorthy, Aug 14, 2013

A- Too be honest it looked like a Pilsner in the 4oz sample glass I drank it out of. I really couldn't belive that something so light in color could be considered a Double IPA
S- Hoppy, but overpowering like most Doubles that I've smelled
T- Wow, now I know what the hype was all about. Very crisp, refreshing and hoppy all in the same sip. I still can't wrap my head around how this beer is even possible. It almost defies the laws of brewing (or at least the beers that I've considered Doubles)
M- Drinks like a pilsner, very light and carbonated ...I could crush these all day in 90*F and not feel weighted down by the malts 
O- As stated before....I'm puzzled, I don't know how this beer exists. I wouldn't go to say that it's my most favorite Double IPAs, I prefer Pliny the Elder over this any day. However, I have never experienced beer the way this beer has. I would love to get my hands on a whole can or 2 to understand what it's like to experience 16oz of this masterpiece. 1,082 charactersGatorLCA, Aug 12, 2013

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Shared with a selfless coworker who held on to the can until we could share it.
Appearance: Can has an awesome design. Beer poured a very hazy yellow. My first thought was that it reminded me of Alpine's Nelson (another one of my favorites). Very unfiltered and rustic, but I don't have a problem with that.
Smell: Tropical fruits all the way. This surprisingly did smell more concentrated out of the can, though. I see why they demand you consume it that way. Pineapple, mango, citrus, pine, resin, sticky floral. Pure sweet fruit hop goodness.
Taste: Follows suit with the smell. Amazing. All I'm pulling from it is pineapple and tropical fruit. The taste surprisingly reminds me a lot of Nelson also, minus the rye. Bitter back end that we've all come to love. This stuff is amazing, I could easily tear through a case.
Mouthfeel: Mildly bubbly with a dry finish. Exactly what you want in a DIPA.
Overall: Very, very thankful I got the opportunity to check this one off of my list. At first I sat there with my glass, contemplating if I prefer this or the Elder. I went back and forth only to realize that these are two separate animals. Pliny is the quintessential West Coast DIPA, and this is the king of the tropical fruits. I would be sad having either of these beers disappear. There is no clear winner IMO. Well, except for me, because I get to drink these masterpieces.

A- pours a murky hazy deep golden orange with a thin white lace and a touch of lacing
S- the smell is just incredible pungent sweet citrus all the way, massive grapefruit and orange juice, mango, lemon peel, tangerines, so floral sticky, resiny and dank. 
T- kicks off with a blast of grapefruit, followed by sweet orange juice, mango, just hops hops hops so good finishes with a rise of bitterness that ends with a nice sublte lingering grapefruit peel resin.
M- Medium bodied, soft, light, dangerously too easy to drink, i cannot keep the can from my mouth, low to moderate carbonation
O- This beer lived up to the hype, its hop blend is just absolutly perfect, subtle sweet malt base on the back, just so well put together. Flowery and floral, blasts of citrus, not one single off flavor or feeling, i gotta say this is as close to perfect to a beer that ive ever tasted 954 charactersgabedivision, Aug 11, 2013

I was begging my relatives, clients, Ebay posters and friends to find a way to get me a try since I saw that Heady was the world's top rated beer on Beer Advocate. Finally, one of my friends came thru and told me my prayers had been answered and a case was on its way last week. After inspecting the case to make sure all cans were on hand and in great shape I began my personal journey. I have now concluded that Heady Topper is far and away the finest quality beer made, should be deemed a national treasure and is the best tasting Imperial IPA I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. As smooth as a great brew could be with hints of grapefruit,1st rate hops, blood orange citrus, delicate cream and subtle pine. I am truly fortunate to be able to share my case of Heady with my beer friends and hope you are able to find a way to get a few cans to savor yourself. Please let me know when you have finished your first can, if you feel the way I do send me a personal note. Cheers to all! 1,144 charactersAzureblue, Aug 10, 2013

Appearance - poured a golden yellow, cloudy. Slightly off white head, with nice retention and lacing. 
Smell - Ripe Citrus, mostly pink grapefruit, orange, and pine.
Taste- Layers of citrusy hops followed by some pine, and an almost unoticealbly smooth malt backbone. The hops really shine in this beauty. 
Mouthfeel- well carbonated, the flavors bring multiple mouthfeels if that makes any sense. 
Overall- #1 IPA for good reason. This beer is as described. Not the hoppiest, not the strongest, just a damn good, super flavorful ipa that hits all the senses. The most pungent aroma I've ever sensed in a beer. Pink grapefruit, pink grapefruit, a little pine, and more pink grapefruit. In the aroma and in the taste. Cheers! 839 charactersSterby, Aug 02, 2013

A - poured a murky orange with a slight half finger head. Leaves some nice decent lacing. 
S - intense hop aroma from the can and immediately after pouring, most forward is the grapefruit, backed by slight citrus and grass notes, and a nice malt presence. 
T - even after a month of age, the hop flavor is still amazing. Although noticeably less fresh. Fresh grapefruit, citrus and grass dominant matching the nose well. There is very little Bittering hops present, it does leave a bitterness afterwards but at the finish it is really smooth. There is a nice malt sweetness which provides a great balance that I think really makes this beyond great. 
M - mouthfeel is medium to thick, or at least on the syrupy side, ample carbonation. 
O - with a month of age, it had only lost that brewery fresh wet hop dankiness, the flavor is still huge. I feel this is excellent, but I put it at about the same level of greatness as some other great IPAs such as enjoy by and sucks. Worth the 4 hour drive to VT, but not the be all end all of IPAs. 1,228 charactersMaineBrewing, Aug 02, 2013

Poured into a snifter. (OK, I did drink from the can just to please the Alchemist gods, but it's much better in a glass) 
A: Hazy orange. An off-white, half-finger head that dissipates to foam. Great lacing.
S: Red grapefruit, piney hops. Citrus. Very strong on the olfactory.
T: Follows the nose with a rush of piney hops and grapefruit that shifts the flavor into overdrive. Very smooth, a la Pliney territory. Well balanced. Resiny with a dry finish. Alcohol drops in unexpectedly for a soothing warmth.
M: Medium with medium, frothy carbonation. Let it sit on your tongue for a dance of the hops.
O: Worth the hype. I'm not a big hop fan, but the smoothness of Heady Topper makes it drinkable for anyone. Seek out. Enjoy in abundance. 807 charactersbrewskifan55, Aug 01, 2013

HT is so appealing on so many levels. The fact that it's hard to get outside VT/New England, the cool-as-hell-can and Alchemist credo on the back, ("Don't be douche!") and if that weren't enough, the beer is just mind-blowing.
The aroma is dank and almost sweet, and it tastes exactly as the nose would indicate. It's hazy and beautiful (if you decide to ignore the recommendation to "drink from the can" it would be hard to notice). I usually like to see what I'm drinking, and I do it quickly, so I don't mind losing some of the experience in order to see the product and the lacing in a proper glass.
This is a hoppy, powerful, wonderful IIPA and really the one by which all others are/should be measured. Any time I can get my hands on some, I do, and you should too. 877 charactersCarlosDanger, Aug 01, 2013

Being unpasteurized is a bit of a downer since I am 5 hours away but I will make it happen!

 It hit me in the face with a nose punch! I did drink it out of the can and I was surprised to find out I can actually smell it.. Nice and hoppy with a lot of zest, lemon orange and bitter on the nose.. 
I just experienced the Zombie Dust previous to this Gem, and in comparison I enjoy the fact that its not as skunky and citrus laced.. Yes, there are a lot of factors involved; Where was it stored? Where was it sourced? What temp was it stored at? How many times did the delivery guy drop the cases? Nevertheless, I was taken back by this beer and I can honestly say it had a perfect balance of hoppiness to bitterness to citrus and skunk... Well done.. 
 Super creamy and dreamy, but not what I really expected,.. More effervescence than the "other" I have tried. Im glad it had a nice ZING to it. HOLY SHIT; DRINK OUT OF THE CAN!!! Now it makes sense. Pour in to a glass and lose the effervescence, keep it in the can and get that TINGE!! GENIUS! !! Well done John Kimmich! Well Done. 
 Im glad I am starting my beer journey. A little late in the Scheme of things in my life.. This beer DID set the standard.. Cant wait to see what happens next..

Hazy peach-ornage colour, ring of white head with some spots of lace as well. Smell is all out tropical fruit, orange, peach flesh, light pine and some floral earthy points with a touch of malt in the back as well, nice fruity hop nose though. Taste is a mix of citrus fruit, tangerine, orange grapefruit, a little bit of white grape, assertive bitterness throughout but never tastes to bitter, certainly more hop flavour here as opposed to hop bitterness, a light sweetness present before a long dry hoppy finish. Lightly carbonated, oily and quite slick, medium-full body. Incredible stuff, insanely drinkable and something I would love to have a fridge full of as I could drink this daily and probably never get tired of it. 785 characterspeensteen, Jul 30, 2013

Taste: pine, citrus, some floral notes, and a slight cracker-y sweetness from the malt.  Huge body for an IPA.  The bitterness explodes on your tongue, yet doesn't linger.  Finishes dry.  Somehow easy to drink despite the hugeness. 332 charactersmarkcp, Jul 29, 2013

As can instructs, you have to drink it out of the can, and in turn reminds me of college beer nights while tasting much better. Extremely hoppy to the first taste, smooth but also foamy in your mouth, and finishes with a less bitter than expected after taste. Spoiled rotten to work in Montpelier where almost all significant restaurants carry Heady Topper now. Simply no debate, it is No. 1 for a reason.

A: Pale yellow-orange hazy brew with a finger of creamy off white head.strong lacing left on the glass that lasted for a good 3 hours. Good looking fresh beer.
S: Overwhelming smell of grapefruit and resin hops. Strong enough to make me gulp and suck in extra air.
T: Strong hop bitterness of grapefruit, and slight hints of orange that hit the palate hard and blend into earthy bits of rye, ginger, honey and caramel for a smooth clean finish. This beer is deep and complex and not a mere vessel to display hop bitterness. The tart sweetness of ginger comes on after the hop burst with earthy spicyness reminiscent of rye malts and sweet honey at the end. A very complex profile that gets more flavorful and intense as the beer warms up and the sediment in the can mixes back into the body of the beer.
M: Very creamy mouthfeel. very good for an ipa.
O: Great beer. The Alchemist followed the Dogfishhead model and made an exceptional deep and complex brew that accentuates the hop profile as well as having an interesting malt profile to back it up and make it interesting. 1,184 charactersCrazy4LegMoose, Jul 28, 2013

Please drink this beer out of a glass, not the can. I swear they just put that on there as a joke to fuck with beer nerds who’ll believe anything. This beer smells amazing, and deserves to be enjoyed in a glass. 
And for the record, I bought a full case of it at the brewery. Had it on tap fresh at the Alchemist(WHERE THEY SERVE IT IN A GLASS), then in can’s at bar’s in Burlington, then back home out of the can, and also back home in a glass. After all those experiences I can say beyond a doubt the glass version is 100 times more enjoyable than drinking out of the can. Seriously, don’t do it. Or at least try it both ways and judge for yourself.
Ok, on to the beer…
This beer pours a cloudy tan yellow body with an off-white head.
Nose has a strong citric and fruity hop smell.
Taste is medium to full bodied, and yet surprisingly light for a DIPA. Loads of fresh cut grassy citrus and fruit. A lot of strong orange, melon and grapefruit hop flavors, with a touch of black pepper and some mild lemon peel. The hop taste in this one is really dominated by the fruit flavors, and reminds me a lot of Wormtown’s Hopulance. A nice present malt flavor. I’d say just your typical fresh grain, not a lot of distinction since it’s covered up so much by the hops. Bitterness is there, but well balanced and in fact actually takes a back seat to the hop flavor. Not overly bitter at all, and even ends with a very clean aftertaste without a long hop numbness. Very clean beer from start to finish.
So… the elephant in the room is that this beer is basically the current holy grail, circle jerk, of beers. 
Obviously its rarity and the lengths you need to go to obtain it help the myth. But, and I humbly apologize for saying this, but this beer doesn’t live up to the hype. It is amazing, don’t get me wrong, definitely deserves to be in the top 100 of BA, but no way in the top 10, let alone #1. It’s on par with other stellar DIPA’s like Hercules or Pliny or Hopulance or Kiwi Rising, but isn’t vastly better than any of the others. But as they say, that’s just my opinion. Still an amazing beer, but… the hype and shortage of this beer have made it more popular than it probably should be. Oh well… I’m still going to enjoy the rest of the case I bought. :-) 2,341 characterstaez555, Jul 24, 2013

Pours a murky banana yellow with an orange hue and is not as ugly as everyone said.( I think) It has some floaties in it but no matter. Bone white head of foam that fell pretty fast to some decent lace. Pine and earth. Nose is pounding citrus. Pink grapefruit, and pungent with tropical notes. Stone fruits too, mango, apricot and peach. The malt is not heavy on the nose but there is plenty of honey to tempt and tease. It’s drippy, and sticky with it and I can’t wait to taste it. First sip is powerful grapefruit, enamel stripping hops with a forceful bitter that lays itself in to stay for a while. Pine resin and bitter. All the tropical fruits are flashing in evidence on the nose and on the palate. They all are there. I won’t make a list. The malt is thick with honey and balanced so well that you hardly notice it except for the sticky sweetness and the fact that it lends substantial body. A bit of spice to bite you and an almost imperceptible edge that is sharp like crushed aspirin. That edge is just a little sour.

As we approached the counter to inquire about any rare beers in his store a silver can caught our eye. Needless to say what luck to have walked in on this tasting. 
Pours a dark orange with some haze, medium head that dissipates. 
Smells immensely of citrus -- specifically grapefruit -- flowers/pines.
Initial taste profile was amazing; executed as one of the most balanced IPA's I have come across. Its on the level of Pliny the Elder if not surpassing that. It was a mix of just the right amount of hops, citrus and pines. 
I appreciate IPAs and DIPAs that are beautifully executed as such; I don't partake in IBU pissing contests because sometimes being the bitterest is not better. 815 charactersSlap_and_Pickle, Jul 24, 2013
4.84/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 516oz can; half poured into a Samuel Smith pint glass, half drank from the can
Thanks to EricDu and SammyJaxxxx for sending this beer my way
A: Poured half the can into a pint glass. A very hazy, dark orange/burning yellow color. About a finger and a half of somewhat rocky white head persisted for a couple minutes before dissipating into a thin layer. 
S: [from the can]: VERY pungent citrus and piney hop aromas. 
[from the glass] : I can distinguish the different citrusy hop flavors more from the glass, but the piney, resiny aromas aren’t as pungent or ‘in your face’ compared to the can, and the piney aroma is kind of lost. Mango is the first flavor that jumps out to me, but it’s really a medley of citrusy flavors. 
T: [from the can]: very resiny, piney hop flavors throughout, aftertaste is a refreshing bitterness.
[from the glass]: again, the resin, pine flavors are more muted compared to from the can, with the citrus flavors dominating. The biggest similarity between the glass and can is the aftertaste, which in both cases is a very big and enjoyable hop bitterness. 
M: Medium carbonation, the resiny flavors stick to your mouth, but IMO in a very good way.. It’s more bitter and stays carbonated more in the can, while from the glass it flattens a bit more as you drink it. The alcohol is unnoticed, 
O: An incredible beer. I can see why this is #1 on BA. As someone who prefers and mostly drinks IPAs, this is as close to the ‘perfect hop flavor' as I've ever had. Well played Vermont. 1,523 charactersshamrock071521, Jul 24, 2013

My uncle brought down 6 from Vermont and we compared side by side with Pliny the Elder. I decided to split the experience, half in a dog fish head tulip and the other half out of the can. 
A- hazy orange, reminds me of when pouring a racer 5..unfiltered. Nice finger and a half of white head. Great retention and lacing. 
S- intense citrus, pine needle-resin...grapefruit and tangerine really shine through.
T- hop bomb! Intense grapefruit and piney resin with every sip. From the can, the hoppiness seems to be intensified...good malt backbone but the hops are clearly the star!
M- mouth is left with a reisinous, piney, gooey aftertaste. Seems to linger on...tad bit of carbonation left on the tongue.
O- overall a FANTASTIC double ipa. If you are a hop head this will not let you down. I recommend trying both from a tulip glass and the can....they are both great in their own right. Definitely worth trying to find...it took me a while but worth the wait! 1,041 charactersWarlocks-Passage, Jul 22, 2013

Appearance: I have no idea. I read and followed the directions on the can. So, I drank from the can. In terms of can aesthetic, it is cool. 
S: floral and citrus. Very clean. 
T: I love the taste. The most even tasting beer I have yet had. From the first opening taste, it doesn't let go. It is bitter but not overwhelming. Each mouthful is crisp, even and really delicious. 
M: some doubles leave a resin tar like coating in my mouth. Heady has a full bold flavor but doesn't have that honey like weight which accumulates after each successive sip. Heady drinks easy and smooth. 
O: so, my first heady was great, but not my far and away favorite But a day later after my second, I believe that this is fantastic brew. I don't know if this is the greatest beer ever. But I know if it was available to me everyday, I would pick it every time.

A complex and unique aroma. Redolent of pine, tropical fruit, citrus, and earthiness; the kind of earthiness you experience walking through the parking lot of a Grateful Dead concert (for those old enough to remember the Dead). As it warms, there's a wonderfully faint floral aroma. Through all those hops one can still get a whiff of the sweet malt! Incredibly complex. The taste is very juicy, more fruit than pine. Tropical fruit hits the tongue first followed by citrus, mainly grapefruit, and dried apricot. Lots of caramel and biscuity malt flavors balance this hop bomb perfectly. Full bodied with the perfect amount of carbonation. Overall, this is a top two or three DIPA that is truly worth all the hype (and the aggravation to get it)! 858 charactersJohnG190, Jul 21, 2013

S - Huge nose of bright citrus, possibly some tropical. Mandarin oranges, slightly sour, but very sweet. Slight toast? Absolutely incredible aroma.
T - Sweet, sweet citrus. No hint of the sourness from the nose. The intense hoppy bitterness is smoothly encompassed in the flavor itself. Malts are a definite back seat. From the can, it's even sweeter, with light tangerine and floral flavors, and a bit of a bready malt backbone. Also more of a dry hop flavor, but it's not unpleasant.
M - Medium-light and creamy, with a slight astringent dryness at the edges of the mouth. Slightly oily and coating. No stinging, minimum foaming.
O - Considering this is one of the most hyped beers in existence, it did not disappoint. Absolutely lovely beer. It's intensely sweet, and the massive amount of hops never come across as overkill or unpleasant.
*I drank half from a glass for evaluation, half from the can. I had no legendary floaties, and honestly, this beer looked damn good in the glass. 5.0 might seem high, but it's a balance between what is legitimately a great looking beer, and drinking it from the can.

Taste: (3.5) Hoppy flavor that is pervasive though-out the flavor profile. Not as well balanced between malty and hoppy as I have come to expect from DIPA’s, but still a fresh, citrus flavor that is easily drinkable, not even seeming like a “sipping” beer even though it has high alcohol. 
Mouthfeel: (4.5) Nice medium body with good medium carbonation. Very easy to drink in that sense.
Overall: (3.5) Good beer. Seems more like an IPA than a DIPA, but maybe that is a bonus, more alcohol with the IPA flavor. Regardless, very smooth and drinkable with a long lingering hop flavor on the back of the tongue. 805 charactersBeardcore, Jul 21, 2013

However, I popped the top, and it immediately smelled like I was in the middle of Shenandoah Valley. One of my favorite places to go hiking/camping with my dad. Heady is clean, slightly piney, sweetly floral, and rather bright in aroma. The taste is really light for the 8% ABV. A great hop presence on the tongue, and sweet/bitter combination from the malt/hops. Surprisingly, the piney-ness of the hops isn’t bothering me. I typically don’t like that in my IPAs, and tend to stick towards brighter/more tropical offerings. Short duration on the tongue, which is making me drink this beer faster than I normally would have.

Pours a light apricot, downright turbid, with a healthy near-white head that abates lazily until a raised curtain and lattice remains.
Tropical assault of pine-lime, guava, orange-mango and tangerine held together by a crisp backbone of light and biscuity malts.
Hops are initially so intense I struggle to identify a dominant flavour - just big, green, dank hoppiness. Gradually the palate adjusts and the full array of fruit-salady tropical notes opens up. Hop profile is still predominantly tropical fruits but a good dose of grapefruit joins in.
Palpably chewy and oily but without any hint of heaviness, thanks to silky carbonation which very effectively distributes it across the palate. Finishes with a robust, green, resinous kick.
Brilliantly constructed from the ground up. Probably the best IPA I've ever had, and I've had a few. "Party in your mouth" seems a pretty apt term for this beer. 1,018 charactersspicelab, Jul 17, 2013

Review 05FEB12
Thanks Keith!
3/3.5/4/3/3.5 - 3.53
Pours a cloudy apricot with some off-white foam formation. This falls to a broken sheet of the same. (3) Smells of fruits, resin, pineapple. The nose is a little bit raw and harsh, but not bad. (3.5) The flavor is really nice with a sweetness that is collaborative with the bitterness. There are flavors of resin, pine, mango. Decent enough. (4) Mouthfeel is a bit thin for the style with moderate carb and a dry finish. A little too dry of a finish. (3). This beer is not nearly as wonderful as it was the first time I tried it, maybe it's the fact that I've had it multiple times, or that I'm now immune to it's glory, but it is a far cry from the initial tastes I had. Maybe it's the new brewery, whatever the case is, I will likely not be seeking this out again any time soon. too bad. (3.5)
Review: 21SEP11
Dave, you did this. Thanks man.
Can date: not listed, but I know it to be recent.
A: Pours a hazy apricot ale with no domineering head formation, but a night sheet of honey cream foam. Spotty lace.
S: Oh yeah, pine, resin, citrus, pineapple, tropical fruits with a touch of feline urine. Very complex and the underbelly is a sweet malt foundation.
T: Plenty more of what happened in my olfactory: sweetened honey, aggressively bitter with many, many differing fruits on the palate. There are some wood tones as well. This is complex and refreshing.
M: Medium bodied with moderate on hi carb with a semi dry finish.
O: Well, I can see what all the hulla balloo is all about. This beer is hardcore hops and proves its value in my mouth. There have been some discussions about the comparison between pliny and this beer. Simply put, they cannot be compared, they are both outstanding beers with unique and ingenious characteristics which shine to each's own. Simply put: drink this beer, it will make you happy. 4/4.5/4.5/4/4.5 (~4.5) 2,473 charactersharrymel, Jul 17, 2013

As the can clearly instructs, " Drink from the can", so I did. I tell you it came on strong hitting me with an explosion of hops, however the part that really did it for me was lightening quick way almost like a magic trick the way it disappeared. On mouthfeel and aftertaste alone I'd give this Alchemist production a perfect grade!
Hard not to be swayed by perfect scores and its all time ranking, but one additional bonus I'd give the Heady is its availability. I realize it's not available nationwide but the fact that's its so readily available in Vermont, that combined with how small the northeast is, he'll my friend said it was the easiest prettiest 2 hour one way drive he's ever made. Unlike PtY or PtE which are retry difficult to find, PtY being impossible aside from 2 weeks, Heady can be found. I give it a 99 just because only the Westy 12 i can so far consider perfect, but let me assure you this is a mere technicality, get your hands on it you won't be disappointed 1,186 charactersAbbbp, Jul 17, 2013

4.89/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had this recently out of two cans, unfortunately one was absolutely flat with no carbonation. The beer in general has a lovely little bubbled good amount of carbonation. It is actually one of the highlights of this mindblowing beer.
Poured part of it into a glass as it comes in a super hazy unfiltered orange/gold, maybe a grapefruit reddish too. It's super hazy.
The aroma has a huge brilliant aroma. The best I've smelled from a beer. Pineapple, tropical fruits, mango, grapefruit papaya, almost like a fruit juice, but also this sticky candy sweetness and pine and resinous aroma. Apricot really does stand out from the Conan yeast. It's gooey, huge sweetness. It's so darn juicy, no Double IPA has pushed towards how good the aroma is in this. There also an almost vegetable aroma. Chivey, leafy green, spicy pepper. It's very "fresh."
For some reason, out of the can, the aroma is so much more piney. I guess it's the residue left in the can, but it's almost like air freshener.
Your initial hit on your tongue is just a bouquet of fruits and freshness. It's just shocking how much hop and fruity flavors this IPA packs. You get smooth grapefruit, peach, pine bitterness.
It is so smooth after that hit, but then after that, there's a bitter aftertaste that stays in your mouth. It has just huge strong bitterness that is very dry and astringent. It's of grapefruit pith with that deep bitterness. But it's interesting that the beer itself isn't bitter, it just grabs onto your tongue as the beer finishes. It's a late hit.
The mouthfeel is where this beer stands out. It's almost like an IPA was mixed with unfiltered fruit juice. There is a round mouthfeel that never cuts thin like other Double IPAs.
It is the best IPA/double IPA I've ever had. What stands out is the perfection of hop bomb/drinkability that this beer has. It pushes towards what a hop head wants, but just completes it with this perfect mouthfeel. No Double IPAs will be able to complete with this complete roundness of mouthfeel and flavor, at least so far. It just gives you more wow-ness and complexity that you cannot match it.
(I'm literally having Double Trouble right now, which is a world class beer, and I'm just sitting here disappointed and picking apart how good Heady Topper is compared to it.)
Re-review: Testing this beer 8 weeks old, as Kimmich says the beer holds up as long as it's fridged. Beer changes to a bit more orange than straw yellow. Tastes exactly the same.
Testing it between can and glass, I prefer the glass. The glass lets the carbonation roll around your tongue to outer mouth, which gives it more fruit flavor and creamy mouthfeel. 2,655 charactersdar482, Jul 16, 2013

One of the finest beers in the world with out a doubt.
11/04/13 update: Enjoying a can that is 17 days old right now, and I have to say, its better than a day-of freshie. The flavors seem to have blended a bit and it is FANTASTIC. 472 charactersSpasmWaiter, Jul 16, 2013

A: 3/3 - golden-orange coloration, minimal clarity (can both see or read through), off-white head dissipates into a one finger head that persisted throughout drinking, moderate alcohol legs for an imperial IPA
S: 11/12 - as expected, huge hop aroma right up front: grapefruit, orange/tangerine and lots and lots of pine....some alcohol and malt notes are also present but the hops are front and center; I detracted one point because I recall even more intensity of prior consumption
T: 19/20 - on the anterior tongue, there's a dank bitterness (that I suspect is from an ample amount of CTZ and/or Simcoe), in the middle of the mouth, the remaining hop qualities really kick in (from Centennial, I guess)...big time grapefuit and other citrus fruits; the alcohol is present in the taste with some minor malt characters to hint at balancing
M: 5/5 - full-bodied with thick hop oils coating the tongue, 8% is present but not overbearing (more like a single IPA at times); high carbonation for style/ABV and moderate alcohol legs
O: 9/10 - one of the best imperial IPAs and lives up to the hype; this is a Centennial, CTZ and Simcoe bomb that, with PtE, set the standard for an American DIPA, in my eyes; however, I think that certain other more recent examples may have overtaken it - Surly's Abrasive, Founder's Double Trouble and DC Brau On the Wings of Armageddon

So I picked up a case of Heady, it's cold cant wait to try it, 2 hours later I have to wait while it chills when we arrive at our destination.

I believe he bought them before he shipped them to me. My first impression was not that great for an IPA. It initially tasted just liked steeped hops. Almost like someone just made tea with a bag of hops. Maybe I was drinking it too cold. My second and third cans seemed much better. Maybe I just had to appreciate it more. I still think there are other better DIPA's out there in my opinion. If you love hops then this is the beer for you as it is all hops and nothing else. 565 characterspaulmack69, Jul 10, 2013

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: i poured about 1/3rd of the can into a snifter glass (despite the recomendation to drink from the can) to see the beer I'm drinking (you have to!). It poured with a half finger of bright white head that quickly fell leaving a dusting of tiny bubbles gracefully on the top and a slightly thicker edge around the glass. The beer was a murkey, cloudy pale orange to dark yellow color. Holding it to the light there was a soft glow around the edge, but the center was as dark and murkey as it was without a back light.
S: Tropical explosion of strong lasting grapefruit, lingering strawberry, subtlely disapating caty pine and fresh squeezed orange. Peaking through the complex yet distinct hop aromas is a breadyness that comes out as it warms up. Fruity yeast that intertwines with the tropical fruit hops and a tad bit of alcohol. 
T: Complex hop flavors from begining to end. The same tropical fruit and pine flavors detected in the aroma comethrough on the first sip. The bittering lingers on the pallet with a more pine and bread flavor than was detected in the middle. The bittering is high on the radar but it almost seems less than other DIPAs because of the sheer flavors comeing at you from all angles.
M: A sticky icky tounge feel as it washes over the tounge. A nice dry finish but the malt flavor is still detectable. Low to moderate carbonation dialed in perfect to emphasis the hops in just the right spots.
O: A fully complex hop-afire explosion in your mouth. I will seek more and share with others as much as possible so they can enjoy this as much as I did. Thanks to Ataraxia for his amazing generosity. CHEERS! 1,635 charactersguityler83, Jul 09, 2013

4.49/5  rDev -3.4%look: 5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured with a good bit of head, definitely looks like there is some wheat malt in there. Beer itself is almost an orange color and is completely opaque. If I were to look at this without knowing what it was I would guess it was a hefeweizen. This isn't even a weakish opaqueness, this beer is opaque right up to the edge of the glass!
The nose here is a bit more subdued than I had expected. I get some mild citrus notes and just a hint of bitter hop funk, not much else going on than that.
This beer has a very strong malt backbone (it is an 8% abv afterall, that alcohol has to come from somewhere!) but is well balanced with citrusy hop bitterness. Definitely not the most grapefruity beer I have ever had (that would be MBC Lunch) but its quite good. The hop bitterness really lingers on the palate and is quite pleasant. The aftertaste is the most bitter bit.
The moutfeel here is great. Very smooth, fills the palate, its just wonderful.
This is a great beer, its not my favorite IPA, but it sure is close. Additionally, for the price, this beer is tough to beat. Very tasty IPA with lots of bitterness and moderate citrus. Definite buy if I can get my VT cousin to bring me back more. 1,195 charactersBowdoinbeerboy, Jul 04, 2013

Smells of green onion and wild garlic (Summit hops) with pine and sharp grapefruit pith. Baby aspirin and lemony tropical fruits. Comes across as a blast of very fresh Summit hops.
Tastes sharp bitter with flat oily bitter to complement. Nice malt sweet that blends with the green onion flavor. Juicy hops. Tin, no esters, but nice barley grain flavor. Acidic sour from the hops almost comes across as lactic. Finishes with baby aspirin (Simcoe hops) and a very resiny pine aftertaste. Very grassy rich in cohumulone. Too strong of carbonation. Carb and clean alcohol sting lift the beer from the tongue early. Creamy body is interrupted by rough hops and clean alcohol sting.
A decent beer, but would be *much* better with different hops. I find Summit hops sickening and can't wait for the trend to pass on by. Big disappointment. Judged to style, so scored higher than my palette would offer. The can says "drink from the can!" It was not as good from a can as from a glass. 1,076 charactersmentor, Jul 04, 2013

S- A blast of citrus hops, a lot of grapefruit, resin/piney hop notes coming from the can. 
T- more of the same from the nose citrus/tropical fruits like orange, pineapple, mango, lemons, and resinous hops. 
M- medium body and carbonation. This is very juicy upfront then a slight dryness on the finish. Hops linger on the palate. 
O- This beer is close to perfect, tons of flavor that hides the alcohol and it is super drinkable for a DIPA. I prefer it straight from the can. 635 charactersAdamF625, Jul 03, 2013

4.28/5  rDev -8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.25Drove through Waterbury and stopped in. Monday at Noon there was a line out the door to get cases. Tried the beer first while in line. It was good, but nowhere near as dramatic as I was hoping for (Lawson's Double Sunshine has ruined me). Wife gave the green light for 2 cases, but after tasting opted for 1. Opened the first one later in the evening when home. This is the review.
A- Very light for an IPA. Very little if any crystal in this beer. Cloudy.
S- The overall smell can best be described as this--take a bag of Trolli Peachi-o's Candy, hold the bag about 4 inches from your nose and sniff. Its peachy, but not like natural peaches (I grew up in a family of peach farmers). Its almost like a candied peach (thanks in part to the Conan yeast) with maybe a touch of a green herbal quality (which is very faint). Perhaps a little citrus coming through? Peach is dominant note with a little bit of other subtle smells mixed in.
T- And the peachiness continues. Peachi-o candy, natural peach pit, some pineapple juice laced with a little bit of bitter orange marmalade. Alcohol is not really pronounced. Bitterness was pretty balanced for an IPA (if this is possible) and grassy notes are restrained. Flavor was good and unique. 
M- Its crisp, and light for an IPA. I rather like it. Not syrupy or viscous. 
O- I like it. Is it the greatest IPA ever? Maybe its the hype, but I don't think so. Its a great beer and worthy of an A/A+ rating, but I still think beers like Double Sunshine, Maharaja, and Pliny are more memorable. I will enjoy and share this case with friends. 1,583 charactersTriggerFingers, Jul 02, 2013

Hazy yellow appearance when poured into glass.. of course they tell you right on the can to drink it out of the can but I wanted to see the beer. 
Smell is GLORIOUS!! Pine, grapefruit, citrus... Just gorgeous. I could smell it all day. 
Drinks so smoothly considering the high IBUs. Has a great malt backbone that offsets the hop punch. The hops never seem to overwhelm your palate. They push your senses just to the edge and then back off due to the malt.
I love this beer. I am making a pilgrimage to Vermont later in the summer and I hope I luck into a couple cases. It is truly one of the best brews I have ever had. 833 characterskingston2, Jul 02, 2013

M: Medium body with carbonation on the lower side of moderate, this beer is slightly oily feeling but avoids being watery.
O: A pretty good DIPA overall. Lots of earthy hop characters without being overly bitter. I wish the aroma were a bit more pungent, but what's there is nice. 707 charactersn2185, Jul 02, 2013

4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Okay, so this is my second Heady experience. My first one was during a bottle share with a good friend of mine, and what followed felt magical. I couldn’t believe the flavors I was tasting, and feeling, and comprehending.
Now, 8 months or so later, I got my hands on a second can (thanks to the same friend), and just cracked it this morning. I finally ventured to pour a small amount into a glass (completely against the very big and bold instructions on the can to “DRINK FROM THE CAN”) But, I just had to see what it looked, felt, and tasted like out of a snifter. I was a little disappointed to say the least. I’m glad that it tells you over and over on the can to drink from it, because it was really pale in color, with a light IPA flavor to it. NOTHING like the powerhouse I had remembered… Thankfully I had just poured 2-3 ounces.
So, now that I was following instructions and drinking from the can, my second taste of this amazing elixir was just as memorable as the first. It is an incredibly resin-y beer with just absolutely incredible hop flavor. The resins coat your tongue BUT beg for more at the same time. The flavors dance on your palate for just long enough that you need more. This beer, at 8% is crushable, but also begs to be sipped, savored, and enjoyed. They tell you to drink it fresh because they’re always making more… but an 8 hour drive isn’t in the cards all the time.
The Alchemist, you brilliant, brilliant brewers. You sell over 90% of your product from your own brewery…. And I know that you know you’ve made one of America’s best beers. And I know that you are proud of it… and you should be. This gem is to be savored, enjoyed and drank straight from the can. Do it, don’t even consider pouring this into a glass… just drink it from the can. Lick your lips, say “ahhh” and beg your friends to get in their cars and go buy more. 1,898 charactersbriankrespan, Jul 01, 2013
4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Canned just over a week ago. For this review I poured it into a snifter, I just need the aroma and carbonation release.
Appearance: An ugly looking beer. An orange/yellow color sits with the murkiest body of an IPA I've ever seen. The unique appearance of this beer has some charm and mystery to it. A solid finger of lacing on the pour with an average amount of lacing randomly left on the sides of the glass. 
Smell: Once I popped the can open, the hops explored out. Sitting in the glass, an extremely potent combination of straw and tropical fruits. The grass and pine notes provide a biting bitterness while the fruity accents lighten up the aroma. The bitter tones no doubt dominate but there is plenty else going on here. 
Taste: The sweet tropical fruit lacing hit the palate right away. The grass and straw tones burst through on the front as well and provide delicious bitter front. The bitterness is beautifully matched with bright hop tones and a balanced malt backbone. I really think the malt is key here. Allows the hops to have a bright presence yet keeps them grounded and balanced. The finish is some sticky hops and sweet malt. Not sure if there is anything I would dream of changing about this part of the beer, simply wonderful.
Mouthfeel: Balanced in every way it should be. Not much else I can say, this is what an DIPA should feel like.
Overall: This beer is so much more then just another hop bomb that you continually see today. A beer with truly complex character, balance, and hop presence. I got a case of this from a friend and thought about trading some, but I think I'll just be selfish and keep them all. An all-timer in my book, no doubt lives up to every bit of the hype. 1,711 charactersKFBR392, Jul 01, 2013

Took a sip from the can and found it to be a little malty with big citrus flavors. I immediately have to take another sip. It is very well balanced and drinkable.
After a few more sips I poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint to get a look at this amazing beer. It's a pale yellow with a creamy head and is very cloudy with hoppy goodness.
Overall, I am blown away by this beer. I actually had a friend from work bring me back a case from Vermont for my 4th of July party. Now I have to look at 23 of these sitting in my fridge for the next few days.
Maybe we can get by on 18? 699 charactersmasshops, Jun 30, 2013

Obeyed what the can said and drank this out of the can, but poured a little out to see the color. It was a golden color with a little cloudiness.
Smells of pine, citrus and tropical fruits with a huge wave of hops. It smelled completely different than anything I have had before. The taste followed the smell as it was a complex combination of sweet, sour, bitter hops. That's as detailed as I can get because I can't really explain what it was. From sip to swallow the flavor was constantly changing. 
Overall I don't know if this would be the best tasting beer in the world for me, but it was definitely the most complex and interesting tasting beer I've ever had. 753 charactersMWolverines66, Jun 30, 2013

Appearance: very light straw color with significant haze and chunk; looks a lot like the consistency of cigar city's jai alai with regards to it's floaty fish-food. Significant, firm, head.
Nose: Unique; hops-forward but very earthy, intense hops, pine and pitch/asphalt; biscuit/grainy right behind the hops
Taste: Pine resin, chewy hops, round rotund mouthfeel, up front bitterness smoothed out by a perfectly balance malt backbone; highly quaffable still; incredibly balanced, hops lingers on the tongue in equal amounts with grainy and clean malt flavor
Overall: impressive. hyped to the point of disbelief and still surprised me a little with it's uniqueness. I don't know if this is the "best beer on earth" but it is certainly unique and wonderful in it's own way. 953 charactersSigEp, Jun 30, 2013

Mega hop aroma.... YUMMY! Mainly tropical fruits, with some herbal & tea notes. It is really inviting, it begs me to dive in. (5)
Its flavor is hop forward, but not overly so. Nice balance between sweet, ripe tropical fruits, and its herbal bitterness. (4.25)
Could maybe use a bit more carbonation. Its heavy body, and minimal carbonation are like a hop-syrup. (4.0)
Great aroma, and taste, but falls short in feel. Almost weird: one mouthful has a sweet finish, the next bitter. (4.0)

Drink from the can? I did. But not all of it. I poured about the middle third into a tulip glass. 
I smelled like from the can, since the can insists you enjoy from the can. I just wanted to smell more. Nothing too explosive. I wanted a bit more, but it is probably because I am smelling from a can. Perfect tasting east coast IPA. There are nice citrus and pine notes along with a little caramel creamy-ness. The hops are pleasant and not overwhelming. 521 charactersRuderaven52, Jun 27, 2013

A= Pours a beautiful golden yellow color with a nice two fingers of head that holds some steady retention and lacing.
S= The smell is amazing. Tons and tons of hops. It smells like hop candy to be honest. Waves of flavor and amazingness comes over my nose. Resinous and fruity. I've honestly never smelled an IPA quite like this one before.
T= The taste is similar to the nose. The can says that it's not ment to be the most over the top IPA in the world and it definitely isn't. It's a beautiful mix of sweet and bitter. He hops come through with a pineapple like sweetness and just enough bitterness. I really can't explain the taste besides awesome.
M= Smooth and creamy. They didn't over hop it at all.
O= I wasn't expecting much from this beer to be honest. I figured it would be just another super hoppy IPA. This is a unique beer however. It transcends most IPAs in the way that the hops are so flavorful and fruity. This beer is better than I expected somehow. I can't explain it really. Worth seeking out and trying over and over. 1,111 charactersjjanega08, Jun 27, 2013
4.69/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5We visited The Alchemist's cannery today, and the pair we are cracking for this review were canned today. We will obey the demands from the can and drink straight from the vessel, but we first decant off an ounce or so to assess its appearance. The brew shows a hazy straw coloring, putting up a quick one finger head of lemon meringue colored foam, showing variability of bubble size, and nice retention. Lacing is tight and ridged, snaking the circumference of the glass. Haze is thick, but no outright sediment is noted. Carbonation appears to be moderate. The aroma is pungent, even from the hole in the can, giving fresh pineapple, white grape, apricot tang, fresh earthiness of clayed dirt, raw honey, clover flower, wet moss, cucumber skins, soft plastic bite, and distant farmhouse muskiness. These blend atop a solid base of crisp pale malts and raw barley, powdered sugar, and hop varietals of sticky nectars, citrics, and herbal depth. With warmth the booze comes out as well, but it is sweeter rather than burning and fusel. Our first impression is that the hops are explosive, fresh, and tangy, with drinkability for years, and an insanely cleansing and balanced finishing that leaves your mouth dripping wet with salivation for that next sip. As we taste, the flavor opens with raw honey sweetness, white sugars, sweet pear, pineapple, tangerine, and golden delicious fruitiness, brightly citric and bitterly herbal hops, flashes of lemon juiciness, faint brandy booziness, and pale, lightly toasted and powdered malts. The middle comes to a peak with dill weed, vegetal pepper metallics, biting plastics, and continued pear and blueberry fruitiness, along with the sweetest, most nectary hops of the sip. Tannic lemon teas and those crisp pales also rides high across the palate, pulling us into a finish with a hop profile most similar to the beginning of the sip, when held in the mouth. Here you get that fresh earthy and herbal hop bite, with black pepper and continued dill herbals, dripping pine sap, clove honey, honeysuckle florals, green twig, lemon rind tang, bready pales, faint rye crustiness, coiny metallic yeast, and light parsnip vegetals. The aftertaste breathes of crisp bready toastiness, clean pale malt sweetness, light rye twang, graphite, chalked yeastiness, aromatic mossy and musky rumbles, toasted pistachio nuts, bitter herbal hoppiness, and those sticky sweet nectary and lightly resiny hops. The body is medium, and carbonation is high, but not offensive or overly prickled. Each sip gives soft and syrupy slurp, smack, cream, froth, and pop. The mouth is left foamy, coated, and dripping wet with salivation. There is mild puck from the hoppiness of it all, added to by alcohol, especially as the beer warms. The abv is appropriate, hardly noticed, and nicely contributory, and the beer drinks like water. 
Overall, what we enjoyed most about this beer was its flavoring. The balance that is struck between the hops alone is incredible and beautiful, with sticky sweet fruity nectars and citrus battling, blending, and then giving way to a stronger herbal component through the finish shows variability throughout the sip, punch at each stop, and precise progression along the palate. The fact that it took us over an hour to rate this guy, and across several cans no less, speaks to both its complexity and depth, as well as to its utterly simple and remarkable ease of drinkability. The mouthfeel is smooth, frothy, sticky to the lips, and coating, striking just the right combination to keep your mouth and buds wanting more, more, and more. While every aspect of this masterpiece shines, it is the taste that stays with you the most, and will, at least for the next few nights to come, keep us up at night thinking about it. 3,774 charactersTheBrewo, Jun 27, 2013

Pale yellow, slightly cloudy appearance. 
Great hoppy aroma - hard to beat. Lots of citrus and pine on the nose. 
The flavor is just as good. Nice clean, slightly sweet flavor. Big hop flavor, but not overly bitter and very little aftertaste.
On par with Pliny, but different flavors- sweeter, more citrus in the hop profile. In a side by side tasting, they both stood up well, although Pliny won out on appearance.
Great beer! I'm sad my stockpile is gone.
(note: I also had it on draft ate the cannery and saw no noticeable difference in quality.) 625 charactersjlisuk, Jun 26, 2013

Sat down to do a couple proper reviews of it in the last week or so, so these notes are on cans that have ~3.5 weeks on them.
Appearance: Poured into a snifter (note: I drank most of my case from the can, but I wanted to actually see it at least once). Poured a murky, impenetrable orange-yellow with a sudsy finger and half head.
Aroma: From the can or in a glass, this beer has just an incredible smell. Tons of hops, piney, resiny, dank, a little floral, some citrus. Citrusy notes seemed more prominent when it was fresher.
Taste: Some malt up front, but I don't think I could say much about it, because immediately afterward the hops showed up in force. Serious bitterness with some spiciness gave way to a more balanced finish. Noticeable changes in flavor from malts to hops to finish for me. No traces of alcohol that I can detect.
Mouthfeel: Medium carbonation, medium bodied, tending towards chewy but staying quite drinkable. I liked how this beer felt.
Overall: It was interesting to drink this beer as it got older. The first can I drank, on the day it was canned, was pretty incredible. The last can I drank, just under four weeks old, was a very good, solid beer. Insanely tasty and drinkable, lived up to the hype for me. Glad I was able to try it. 1,383 charactersjhawth, Jun 25, 2013

Poured from a can into my mouth.
A: Silver, black. Picture a guy drinking beer from a glass, but his head is exploding with hops. That's about what this looks like. Clean and shiny. Not really sure how I can even grade this. I'm resigned to just giving it whatever my "overall" is.
S: Sweet, sweet hops. Earthy and citric aromas come strong out of the can immediately upon opening. A little spiciness lingers, almost like the faintest hint of a cologne, but in a good way. Strong citrus aromas of pineapple dominate. I could sniff this beer all day, but I've resigned to drinking it.
T/M: Follows the nose pretty closely. A little more carbonation up-front than through the rest of the sip is delivered... maybe the can, maybe just my perception. Lots of sweet citrus on the body, with a little dank earthiness following. A lingering bitterness follows along with a little more earthy flavor and feel. The bitterness in this emerges almost after all other flavors have begun to die off but doesn't dominate the flavor profile while sipping. Body has nice, sweet malt character that doesn't dominate the beer, but does provide a sweetness to this that is very nice with all of the citrus. Alcohol doesn't show up much at all in the taste. The mouthfeel overall is just about perfect for the style in terms for gravity, but the lingering finish feels just slightly off, like I'm trying to get something out of my mouth rather than keep it there. Still very pleasant. Really drinkable.
O: Really happy with this beer. I will need to try it side by side with Pliny to really sort out the nuances of each, but each is great in its own right. I'm finding myself drinking this dangerously quickly -- I am pretty glad I don't have enough of these to just enjoy at will and open in series, or I could end up very drunk very quickly. I was worried that this beer would be a little too dank for me, but that really hasn't been the case at all. I don't suspect that the beer has "lost" this since canning, so I think perhaps I just had unfounded worries. Great beer. 2,270 charactersjdhowe, Jun 24, 2013

I did venture to pour out some precious liquid for a look and what followed appeared very similar to a Saison. Straw in color, murky an opaque, with a decent amount if head that, surprisingly, did not lace well. No floaties, either. No wonder they say to drink from the can! Aroma is super piny with a lot of passion fruit: mango and pineapple mostly. It's prickly. Even some spice, like allspice but much more mild. Flavor starts off spicy: similar to cinnamon or allspice. I get bitterness from the start, but its mild and inviting. It's also somewhat malty: some biscuit and white bread crust. The bitterness gets more intense and the pine and resin shine through. It's not super bitter. The feel is more watery than viscous. The carbonation is low for the style, but the hoppiness jumps out just like a higher carbonated beer. 
This was a wild ride, but at the end of the day I have to jump through so many hoops that I'd rather just get a Pliny every other week. 1,019 charactersPhilousa, Jun 24, 2013

s) smells like lots of hops, very tasty hops. i also pick up some resinous pine needles mixed with quite a bit of citrus, floral and fruit. smells awesome.
t) gotta say it has lived up to the hype. it is surprisingly citrusy in flavor, with plenty of pine and hops and hints of fruit.
m) it makes me pucker a little bit but not in a super bitter kinda way. it has just the right about of hops and it is so smoothly blended with all the other subtle nuances. feels light in the mouth with good carbonation.
o) fantastic beer. i had been sitting on this beer for 3 nights before i tried it and the anticipation was a bit ridiculous (i mean its just beer) and it totally delivered. 889 charactersmrchrisray, Jun 24, 2013

4.93/5  rDev +6%look: 4.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I recently had a chance to taste the legendary Heady Topper, and it was truly a ground breaking experience for me. This is the essence of what most IPA's strive to be, but come up a bit short. The aroma is floral and fruity in all the right ways, the head is moderate when poured, and the appearance is a thick, luscious, golden color with it's unfiltered qualities lending to it's bold appearance.
The taste...oh the taste. This is an experience to be had. The taste is magnificently hoppy, but unlike many hoppy beers, it is not bitter, does not have a puckery sensation, and has an incredibly smooth, subtle aftertaste. At 8%, you'd believe that this was a tasting beer with the mounds of hops present, but this could easily turn into a session beer (if you're not careful). 
This is beer crack. I want more. 813 characterssupercodes, Jun 23, 2013

4.82/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Pours a slightly cloudy amber color with a stark white bubbly head. The aroma is great. The second the can pops you can smell the hops. The aroma is of piney hops and floral hops. It smells like an earthly flower shop. The taste follows suit, there is no ripe your face of bitterness just a great blended flavor. The malts are there as the backbone, but the hops play out with piney earthy hops up front before a floral and citrus hop flavor comes through at the end. The mouthfeel is perfect. Overall this beer is as good as advertised. A great beer a must try. 562 charactersgoblue3509, Jun 22, 2013

A very cloudy but love it. 
S pine and grapefruit dominant but complex. Not as pungent as i was expecting 
M very nice malt backbone compared to some ipas and still very drinkable
T excellent. Maybe perfect. Reminds me a lot of fff permanent funeral but with more citrus
O this actually lives up to the hype. Im only docking slightly b/c it didnt improve imo as it warmed. Also i think ill drink the next one from the glass as the can did nothing for me

A) Pours with a big head. Tight, big bubble head slowly settles to a thin lacing at the edge of the glass. Slightly hazy body copper in color. Semi-sticky lacing on the drink down.
S) Crazy aromatic - could smell the hops as soon as I cracked the can. Orange. Pink grapefruit. Hints of pine. Bright floral notes.
T) A great blend of hops and malts. The malts are subdue midway through by the hops. Pine resin. A lingering hop bite in the aftertaste. 
M) Medium body. Tannic, slick tongue feel. Dry leafy finish.
O) A delicious IPA. I'd have another ... If I had another. 583 charactersu2carew, Jun 22, 2013

Thanks Dan for the share on your extra. 2 oz. into a tulip so I could mark the visuals and aroma, another 3-4 oz. straight from the can on June 14th, 2013.
A - Lightly cloudy, murky medium-golden color with an enormously bubbly head. Good retention and lacing.
S - Deeply resinous, pine-sol, rouge, slightly burnt caramel, touch of peach and herbs.
T - It's really better balanced than I thought it would be. That being said, the hops are sharp, overly-acidic, and disappointingly simple. Grapefruit rind, toasted almond, and lemon peel.
M - Light body, moderate carbonation, very dry (even sour-like) finish.
D - I'm a bit stunned in a bad way. There are scores of other IPA/DIPA's I would choose over this particular can. Another revisit? I don't know. 844 charactersAuracom, Jun 21, 2013

Thanks to Jackie for the opportunity to give this one a go.
Enjoyed directly from the can, as recommended by the brewer. This was chilled to optimal temperature.
A) Poured about an ounce into a sampler glass to get a look at this brew. A hazy golden amber, with a small white head. Looks nice...
S) Very impressive... I've opened quite a few beers in my time, but this was something new. Upon cracking this one open, there was just an explosion of hops aroma. I'm so accustomed to pouring a beer into a glass, and getting my nose in there, but that is simply not necessary with this beer. Plenty piney/citrusy , and some tropical fruits too. 
T) Very nice balance... The hops is the main attraction, but it is never overly bitter. Layers of hoppy goodness, piney, grassy, grapefruit, mango, a little lemon zest. Absolutely no indication the ABV is 8%. 
M) A solid medium body, with light carbonation. A good jolt of hops, yet remarkably smooth. This is easy drinking, and finishes so clean. 
O) Glad I was finally able to board this hype train. It took a long time to finally get the opportunity, but this one is worth seeking out for any hop lover. Only got one can, so staring at it now completely empty is a bit of a bummer. Anyone in Vermont looking to get their hands on some New Glarus beer? 1,331 charactersRoamingGnome, Jun 20, 2013

Yes, I gave it a 5 for appearance, because I don't see anything wrong with the hazy, sediment filled brew. I would rather that than have them filter it and alter it to make it more 'aesthetically appealing'. The aroma is pungent hops, juicy grapefruit and light toasty malts that all work together in total harmony and synchronization. Flavor is smooth and glides gracefully along the palate. It's such a pleasant and soft mouthfeel, giving it dangerous drinkability. 
I can honestly say this was a perfect beer for me. Everything worked together and nothing was over or underpowered. Simply amazing. 737 charactersironchefmiyagi13, Jun 20, 2013

The can has some pretty cool artwork
The smell was nice and hoppy, with a fantastic aroma of tropical fruits and grasses
The flavor was what sealed the deal for me, really crisp, clean, with a slow rolling bitterness that led to a lightly sweet finish the hangs with you for a while.
All in all it is a great beer, too bad they dont distribute more of it, because i would buy a case 586 charactersJackals, Jun 19, 2013

4.86/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75Reviewed from notes. Finally getting around to typing it up. Full disclosure, I drank a lot of Heady over a several month period and so my review ultimately takes into account my judgments across many samples.
A. Orange with a modest creamy white head. If drank from the can (which is wonderful and in many ways I prefer), then the appearance is simply a lovely can which immediately provokes a Pavlovian response from me...
O. Candied grapefruit, citrus, sweet and sap like, some fresh pine. Not overwhelming, but mildly abrasive. Not too shabby indeed.
T. Now we come to the sledgehammer. Taste is where this beer winds up and lays the smack down on most all other DIPAs. Holy mother mountain of grapefruit! Pungent hops, astringent, tangy, abrasive, piney, puckering. Use whatever words you want; it's bliss in a beer. But its not just the hops! There is a breadiness that is ever so delicate. It's not your standard syrupy malt, but a wonderful crisp yeast and acid balance that leaves you always wanting more. It's the unique signature of this beer.
M. Resinous and creamy, without feeling heavy. This is everything you want from a DIPA. Drinking from the can or from the glass is a true joy.
O. What more can be said about this gem. It's a true hop monster. When absolutely fresh, it's an untamed beast. When several months old, it remains a marvelously balanced DIPA. The utter lack of a classic malt profile is the real kicker here, and it's what makes this beer stand out against other well known DIPAs. 1,517 charactersTychoNDC, Jun 18, 2013

4.73/5  rDev +1.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5A: Golden honey brown colored body with a bubbly, rocky and creamy looking head. A nice retention ring is left behind, along with sticky lace on the walls. Unfiltered floaties are unmistakable in the body, as mentioned there might be should you pour this out. Really, they're just ugly and kill the looks of the beer. I can't help but think this is part of the reason they recommend drinking from the can (other than the hop aroma retention).
S: Piney and earthy hop notes rocket from the glass. Hop resin and oils, orange and lemon bitter peels are next. Towards the end is a crisp bready element and caramel & pale malts. Touches of bitterness dance around the entire nose.
T: Bitter hop resin and oils wrestle the palate with a gentle nature. Pine and earthy hop notes again come through. Mid-palate are sweet orange and pink grapefruit oils, a generic citrus and rich sweet caramel malts. Finishes sticky and bitter.
M: Bubbly and creamy, perhaps a bit thin for a medium-bodied beer, though. Sticky bitter pine and sap on the palate in the linger.
This is easily in the top five Imperial IPAs I've ever had to date. It's extremely balanced, flavorful and never lets up on the delicious hop abuse. 1,204 charactersShanePB, Jun 17, 2013

A: Pours a hazy yellow to orange to beige color forming a small think bubbled creamy head. Low retention and only few lingering lacings left in the glass
S: Hops bomb, of course. Refreshing and delicious. Strongly tropical fruity profile with strong notes of green mango (I've grown up in Brazil and we've had some mango trees in our backyard. So, believe me, green mango smells pretty much like this). A bit lemony. Malts and some sweetness
T: Excellent taste. Again, of course, giving emphasis to the hops. But the malts profile is also very good. Pale malts, mainly, something between Maris Otter and Perl, Slightly sweet upfront but with an overall, dry and crispy malt profile. Intensive hops bitterness, however, very well harmonized. Notes of citrus lemony hops. Green mango, tropical fruits. Light notes of brown sugar
M: Medium body and carbonation. Strong citrus hoppy aftertaste
O: Very drinkable. Excellent experience. I was expecting an excellent IIPA and that's exactly what I've got 1,121 characterseduardolinhalis, Jun 16, 2013

The nose offers a lot of complexity and very malt forward. A nice citrus forward aroma with notes of orange mango and lemon. Some minor grapefruit, more comes out as you taste it. Some piney and hint of herbal undertones as well but more citrus forward. A hint of bready malts but no off yeast notes.
The taste is a bit one dimensional. Hoppy flavors up front with good citrus and orangy flavors. The grapefruit comes out a bit more versus the nose. But the bitterness is a bit lacking and the malt/body is hidden. Some piney and over resiny notes come out as well into the finish. But I would have liked a bit more complexity in the taste.
The body is moderately light. Has more of a single IPA character instead of the DIPA complexity. Carbonation is good.
I do feel like Im nit picking this beer, and there are some fantastic hop notes that really come out, but I am really looking for a bit more character here. Well it's a good thing no one really reads these reviews anyways. 1,151 charactersOxymoron, Jun 16, 2013

Although it clearly states to drink straight from the can I opted instead to pour this one into a tulip to scope it out. Very hazy burnt orange in color, minimal head and lots of "floaties" that anyone whos done any research has been warned about. 
The smell is everything I would ever want out of a beer in this category. It smells so incredibly juicy. Mango/pineapple/tropical hop notes, some orange/grapefruit/citrusy notes, touch of resiny pine, touch of malt. You can tell its got a little touch of alcohol but I wouldnt guess it clocks in at 8%. 
Here the alcohol is a little more present but blends SO WELL with the juicy hop explosion it delivers right off the first sip. From the second it touches your taste buds all the way through the finish this ones an A+. Im getting all those mango/tropical hop notes with a slight bitterness as well. The flavor seems to saturate your entire palate but not in an immediate/ assaulting way, its like a soft blanket of perfect IPA flavor that covers your palate completely. So good. And SO DRINKABLE. Very flavorful yet very smooth, super addicting from the first sip and very easy to put back. I'd definitely suggest against buying a single can unless thats your only option.
Mothfeel....hmmm....some noteable carbonation but not crackling or stinging if that makes any sense. Goes down super smooth. Medium to full body. Almost an oxymoron because right as I start to notice that almost drying grapefruit bitterness most IPAs have the juicy tropical notes come through and wash that away. Very slight alcohol warmth is noteworthy too but its just the right amount and fits in perfectly with the rest of what this beer has to offer.
Worth the Hype? Idk, it depends on what you have to go through to get it. After all, it IS still a beer...but in my opinion, if you've been questing for this one, keeep at it. I lived in MA for most of my life and spent the last couple years trying to track this one down to no avail. Moved all the way down to NC and within the first 2 months got it as a random gift from a boss at a new job. The irony. Easily one of, if not definitely my favorite of all the IPAs/ DIPAs I've EVER had. Its just got the total package. The drinkability on this one is UNREAL despite being so incredibly flavorful and semi high in alcohol. IPAs arent normally "my thing" these days but if I had regular access to this beer theres no doubt id be buyin the shit out of it each and every chance I had. 2,508 charactersRyanLigeia, Jun 15, 2013

A - Yellowish, light golden color and very hazy with minimal head. Not all that appealing if the aroma didn't hit me as fast as the visuals.
S - Wow! This thing cranks out aroma like nothing else I've had. Wonderful notes of pineapple, orange, grapefruit, ...
T - This is my kind of IPA. It's all about the hops and specifically late addition hops. There's enough malt there to prop it up but it gladly takes a backseat. The hop flavors follow the aroma closely. There's also a firm fruity flavor and a mild bitterness. The 8% alcohol is completely unnoticed.
M - A moderate consistency with a low carbonation. Nothing special but it supports the flavors nicely.
O - Wow, what a brew. As for the Pliny vs HT debate, no comparison in my mind. They're two different but very special things. It's like trying to say which one of my kids is my favorite. 917 charactersGJ40, Jun 13, 2013

4.75/5  rDev +2.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Appearance- Poured about 6oz into a snifter before drinking the rest from the can. Pours a hazy yellow-orange with an inch of head that quickly fades to a film of bubbles on the surface. Some sediment but this pour was off the top of the can so it isn't bad. 
Smell- If my world could smell like one thing it would be Heady Topper. I get some pine up front then just waves of juicy tangerine and a little alcohol.
Taste- Again, waves of hop flavor come through to the point where it is hard to pick out individual notes. The bitterness is pretty subdued which is amazing for the amount of hops used. I don't get pine in the taste just more juicy fruit and a little sweetness.
Mouthfeel- Medium to full mouthfeel. I get stickiness that allows the flavor to linger but not necessarily the resiny mouthfeel of some other DIPA. Moderate carbonation..
Overall- I don't think there is anything quite like this. I would describe it as liquid hop extract without the bitterness. Just juicy and delicious plus with 16 ounces at 8% you have a nice little buzz afterwards. Can is right, it is so drinkable it's scary. 1,110 charactersJfriz25, Jun 13, 2013

Nose is juicy citrus and tropical hop aroma. Bubblegum dank with pineapple and mango. As Borat would put it - That's a very nice!
Pretty amazing they can pack this much hop flavor into a beer these days. Lots of bitterness here too. You can tell there is malt in there, but good luck finding a flavor description to attach to it. Just a massive tidal wave of hops - citric, tropical, piney; you name it hop-wise, its here. ABV is well hidden and the flow is nice from the hop flavor to the bitter finish...not halting at all. Definitely a world class beer, good enough to say that if I was transferred to Vermont for work, regualr access to this would be one of the first things to pop into my mind. 839 characterstwiggamortis420, Jun 12, 2013

But Heady Topper has that x factor that keeps you wanting more. Not sure if it's the well-rounded mouthfeel or supremely fresh taste. It's just infinitely drinkable.
First you get juicy hops and it's almost a little too bitter. Then after a couple sips the bitterness mellows out a bit, yielding to a wide range of fruity hop flavors -- citrus, grapefruit, mango and apple. There's also a big, green piney/grassy/herbal hop presence. The mouthfeel is big, round, creamy and balanced, but also resinous and sappy at times. Combined with the tangy fruit profile, it's somewhat reminiscent of a sophisticated cider or champagne. Really dry, bitter finish.
It's a thoroughly American IPA and there is a distinct lack of nutty/biscuity/malty characteristics that you might find in more internationally-inspired brews. That's the only negative thing I can think of to say. But it's surely better off as is.
This beer just keeps giving and giving and it's difficult to pin down why you enjoy it so much. You just keep reaching for cans until you realize that it's still an 8% abv brew and you should probably not kill that precious 4-pack by yourself tonight. 1,324 charactersMongrel, Jun 12, 2013

It is definitely a standout beer. Just the hype surrounding it makes it difficult to be impartial. In a few words, it's a very well balanced DIPA with a massive citrusy blast . In my opinion the citrus is what makes it unique. Would I put it @ #1?... not sure, it's definitely up there. In any case, it's definitely worth a try. Massive hype aside, this beer will not disappoint even the most picky beer snob. 648 charactersDavidBart, Jun 11, 2013

I had this from the can, but would love to try it on tap. The on-can instructions to drink it directly from the can are a little disconcerting for the average beer snob. We like glassware!
In short, it is a very tasty beer, but a bit single-faceted to be rated as high as the Plinys. This is more of a grassy hop bomb like Anderson Valley Hop Ottin' than a full-bodied, well-rounded palette pleaser. 469 characterschutch15, Jun 10, 2013
3.96/5  rDev -14.8%look: 2.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4This is quite the beer with the only downside being the appearance, which is probably why the brewer suggests drinking it from the can. 
Pours a nice light golden/yellow. But the uneven haze and murkiness just don't look appealing. The absence of a nice fluffy white head makes it worse. Lacing is splotchy
From there things look up. A nice mango, citrus, grapefruit pairing of hops in the nose. Not all that juicy as some dIPAs, but certainly above average. Light biscuit malt
As this one warms it gets a bit buttery, although butter isn't quite the right term. Pithy? Not sure, but the sharpness of the hop flavors (citrus, grapefruit, pomelo) loses a bit after a short while. The biscuit becomes doughy. Still, the flavors are really enjoyable and quenching. 
Feel is dry and sparkly. A nice summer time dIPA that hides the abv well. 840 charactersMebuzzard, Jun 10, 2013

The head dissolved into a think film pretty quickly. The little bit I poured did leave moderate+ lacing on the glass. Looks unfiltered, as there are some particulates in the ounce or so that I poured.
S: From the rocks glass: Floral and hoppy. Smells pretty balanced. From the can: harder to smell, but I pick up more fruity sweetness. Pineapple is the fruit I'm most reminded of.
T: Lots going on here. A moderate/moderate- sweet and slightly spicy start. Mild malt mid-taste; perhaps just a bit biscuity. Finishes with a medium dose of clean citrus hops. It's strength is in its balance. I don't notice any alcohol at 8% abv.
M: Medium- body; enough body to respect but not so much your tongue gets tired. Much closer to how an IPA should feel than a DIPA. Carbonation is great. If I could find them, I feel like I could have a couple of these on a summer afternoon. 
O: Great brew, though it resembles an IPA more than a DIPA. I'm fine with this beer defining the smell, taste, and body of what an good IPA should be. I'd prefer it be a bit darker and clearer in appearance, but I'm not willing to sacrifice its smell, taste, or mouth-feel to get there. It's a great beer, and if they weren't so hard to get ahold of, I'd sit outside and enjoy a few of them on a summer afternoon.

Appearance - A hazy golden orange-yellow with a white fluffy head.
Aroma - Fruity, hoppy, and fresh. Citrus fruits like orange and grapefruit can be smelt. Also, a floral and resinous hop flavor comes through as well. A light malt flavor can be detected in the back ground.
Taste - A fresh hop blast hits you with every sip. Orange, grapefruit, pine, and resin. A malt backbone is there too.
Mouthfeel - Easy drinking and super smooth. Not overly bitter. A perfect balance for a DIPA.
Overall - Always a favorite of mine and I love being close to getting it when I have the chance. Easy drinking and very flavorful. Can't get enough! 729 charactersChrisL24481, Jun 07, 2013

A - ?
S - Smells alternately nice and piney and something sort of chemical-y sweet, partly like sunscreen. Not bad but unusual.
T - That sunscreeny/piney element carries through on the palate. It seems a more green and planty overall now, with the sunscreen aspect leaning more toward something buttery sweet that you'd find in baked goods. It's a very pleasant and smooth taste overall. It's definitely an accomplishment in fresh tasting flavor. It pops. I'm glad the bitterness isn't stunt-grade. It's just enough to give it substantial bite to this fairly lupulin-tolerant palate of mine without becoming that distracting kind of bitter that must be partially tolerated while being partially enjoyed. This bitterness was all enjoy and a pleasant complement to the flavors.
M - Nothing special. Just sort of normal beery, a bit sharp. Leaves some mild hop abrasion on the tongue afterwards for a good while.
O - I knew the hype on this one but have trained myself to go into these things now just expecting a very good beer instead of ecstasy and in that respect I was not disappointed. It's a very good beer. I'll try the next one out of a pint glass and adjust/refine this review. A tornado was coming when I drank this and I figured I'd better go ahead and try the top rated beer in the world before I maybe died (didn't). So next time will be calmer. 1,421 charactersBrownNut, Jun 06, 2013

A - Medium yellow, very light in color for a DIPA. Lot's of carbonation visible, and some fizz stayed for the duration of the sipping. Nice, large head with lot's of residual left behind. 
S - Lot's and lot's of quality hops! Such a strong aroma. Very fruity, immense amounts of grapefruit, also some lemon, lime, and even an ever-so-slight hint of pineapple. Some dankness as well, but in the good way we all know and and love. Also hints of pine and MORE hops. DANK with hops!
T - It lives up. I was partly expecting this beer to be incredibly bitter, just for the sake of being able to say "there is a ton of hops in here." Not the case. The hoppy taste is there in abundance, sure, but there's more to it than that. Huge amounts of flavorful hops. Big blasts of grapefruit, and a good amount of lemon. Hints of pineapple and lime, plays off the heavy grapefruit flavor so well. So much hop taste present, that it almost has a "nutty" taste. People have said this beer is so hoppy it's almost juicy. That's 100% true. So much fruitiness going on, (although I know this isn't the case) that I wouldn't be shocked in the least to learn fruit was actually added to this beer during fermentation. An outstanding tasting DIPA. Editing here - I've noticed once the beer is a couple weeks old, the nutty taste is more prevalent. Not a bad thing by any means. I enjoy when a beer ages and different tastes can be noticed.
F - Dangerously drinkable. Does sting a bit, slightly dry (but not as dry as many IPA's, so that's a plus), but the "juicyness of the hops make up for that I think. I liked that it seems to have a bit more carbonation than most IPA's, which helps with the dryness. This stuff is so easy to drink, I could easily picture myself drinking several in a short time, then being more buzzed than I planned!
O - It lives up the reviews. One of the best beers in the world, and my 2nd favorite beer of all time. So much hoppy taste, but not just for the sake of being big and bitter. The hops are full of flavor, they make you want to drink this fast. So tasty, yet so dangerously drinkable. Certainly a world class beer, it deserves all the praise it gets. 2,307 charactersstella77artois, Jun 06, 2013

DRINK FROM THE CAN! , eh?
So I did, at first... drank around 1/3, then poured...
A - cloudy pineapple juice. Minimal head.
S - hops, mango, pineapple. I noted less intense than others have.
T - wallop! Pineapple, pink grapefruit, mango/peach as sweeteners, sublime and integrated. Malt backbone is solid. Citrus hops follow but do not overpower. Just the way I like it.
M - medium weight, well carbonated but not overcarbonated. On the money.
Overall - world class brew, and amazing I got the chance to try so fresh. Real downside is it goes down just so easily, you would never guess it was 8%. One day I will go to Waterbury.
Dunno about this can lark, tho.... :-0 ....having said that - it does accentuate the pine notes and makes for an overall less sweet (and maybe more archetypal) DIPA experience. I'll go the glass, thanks. 920 charactersheygeebee, Jun 06, 2013

Believe this is two weeks or so old? Would easily have been close to my number one want.
Upon cracking the can, pine and mango pervade the room. First sips were taken from the can.
Pours into the glass a slightly cloudy pineapple juice colour. Appearance-wise, the head does dissipate a little quickly.
Smell is as mentioned: pine, mango, lots of citric fruit: oranges, mandarins, lemons. Also get a slight herbal quality, perhaps ginger/ginseng. Just such potency and solidarity in the aroma.
Taste is more pine and mango and primarily citric fruits. Taste lingers and carries an almost Tripel-esque mango sweetness in the mouth, but this is balanced by a dry hoppiness. I would say this is well balanced- it does have a lingering bitterness, but the sweetness is also easy to detect. Herbal quality grows over time.
Mouthfeel features moderate body and above average, tingly carbonation.
Could I call this the best DIPA I've had? That depends on tastes. It's certainly the freshest-tasting, with the most pronounced tropical/citric fruits aroma I've had. Similar but better version of Surly Furious, although to be fair when I had Furious my palate was a little muted.
Sadly although I am amazingly glad I've had this beer, it makes me wish I had more. Amazingly drinkable. Hopefully I am merely saying au revoir, rather than a permanent goodbye. I hope to one day meet it again.
NB: When I drank from the can, I found the pine flavour more singular and concentrated. It also seems a little maltier somehow. I find drinking from the can to be a valid alternative for this beer, and worth experimenting with. 1,690 charactersdanieelol, Jun 03, 2013

The first few sips were from the can. I then poured the other half into a stemless glass so that I could comment on the appearance.
A - Bright orange with a bubbly white head. No sign of hop resins or "floaties". A fantastic looking beer.
S - Strong citrus hops, sweet, slight dankness, and resin/pine. This, in my opinion, is the best smelling DIPA. The aroma/smell was noted immediately after opening the can.
T - First few sips from the can. A strong (but not overwhelming) taste of citrus/grapefruit, bitterness, and sweet malt. Everything from the aroma is there. A superbly well-rounded DIPA.
M - Medium body.
O - Outstanding, lives up to the hype, and dangerously drinkable! This is the gold standard for DIPA's/IIPA's and the finest craft beer that I've ever had. Beg, borrow, or steal to try this!
I agree with the recommendation to "drink from the can!". Sips from the can did capture more of the amazing aroma in each sip, in my opinion. 996 charactersBobaFret, Jun 03, 2013

4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 516oz can, huge thanks to Chris for sending this out here. Canned 15 May.
Murky appearance, really light milky golden orange colour. Nothing much to write home about. Nice white foam on top that gradually reduces over the time of drinking but always staying at a level just above film. Nice lacing as it slowly recedes.
Brilliant aromas of pine, pineapple, mango and grapefruit. The pine is temporary and the grapefruit and other fruits take over. Lots going on. Well integrated and a delight to smell. 
Tastes of the grapefruit and pine with a touch of the mango and pineapple there as well. Even a little bit of apple oddly as i get to the end of it. Very impressive, but probably a touch below what is delivered with the smell.
HIgher carbonation than most. Doesn't get gassy, nor does it get harsh with the higher levels. Solid bitterness throughout and finishes with a bit of a kick and this is just enhanced with the added carbonation. Very drinkable, 16oz disappears all too soon. 
Brilliant. Amazingly drinkable, beautiful beer. I can see why people grab their full 6 case allocation at the cannery. The 8% ABV isn't noticable until you finish it and get a bit of a glow. Really impressive beer! 1,207 charactersMrKennedy, Jun 01, 2013

4.59/5  rDev -1.3%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Ok so this beer says to drink out of the can, so I am reviewing this beer drinking one from the can and one poured into a glass on a separate session. So the look isn't good. Tons of grainy sediment but to be fair they do tell you to keep it in the can for smell reasons, but after seeing it in a glass I call BS and say this is why they don't want you to see it. The smell is a hoppy citrus explosion. Might be the most citrus I've ever smelled in a beer. Most importantly the taste, and the taste is pretty good and smooth on some tastes and others a little more harsh. Never bad but kind of inconsistent taste through the beer. Overall, it's a good beer but not great, or for that matter the best rating on advocate. Double IPAs is perhaps the most competitive class of beers and I have definitely had better than this.
Update: had a third now out of the can, and it was a hell of a lot better than I remember. Extremely smooth and consistent. Now I don't know what to think about this except that I need to get a 4th to see if its as good as this one. It's very smooth but interestingly enough it lacked the citrus explosion like the last one had. Still can't say it the best double IPA. Yet.
Ok, now an update on the update.  All I can add is the importance of beer date labels. I've now had a few more and you have a Heady and it isn't quite consistent throughout drinking its probably old.  The fresher the better.  I finally admit its world class when fresh, but can't say the best.  Personal preference.  But now I'm just not picking.  
Side note, to all brewery's  please put beer dates on your labels that are easy to see.  Why would you want anyone judging you beer if it's old and we don't know its old? 1,719 characterssjones5045, May 31, 2013

3.96/5  rDev -14.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 3.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Have to give a shout out to ffOpusx for sharing this brew. Great, multi-dimensional fresh hop nose that unfortunately doesn’t carry over into the flavor. The floaties are also extremely offputting, and simply suggesting that the beer be drunk out of the can doesn’t get Alchemist off the hook for such a shoddy presentation.
From the can, obviously but poured into a tulip. Huge, overwhelming aromas of fresh pine, peaches, citrus pith & spicy hops; you could seriously sniff this all day long and not get bored. Poured a cloudy amber orange with a thin head, that dies to a fine lace. Well, I wasn’t expecting this...the taste is just so one dimensional with fresh pine, spicy bitter hops...and then nothing. No linger, malt was a bit high, no hint of sweetness, nothing, nada, zilch. There is just no finish!! It’s like drinking a stripped wine. I just don’t know what all the hype is about...oh wait, I do...it’s just hype and everyone is on this train. Your better of drinking O.G. and/or the standard of D.I.P.A.’s i.e. Russian Rivers Pliny the Elder or even Alpine Beer Company Pure Hoppiness a muh more balanced approach to the style. Maybe it was old but I was hoping to be blown away and I wasn't. If I come across it again I'll give it another shot and do a comparison of HT vs. PtE vs. Pure Hoppiness. 1,327 charactersUncleserg, May 31, 2013

4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A - Only because I poured the first can, I can report that the Heady Topper pours into a chalice the color of straw, hazy, and an ample white head.
S - From the freshly opened can...grass aromas, fresh...just harvested hop aroma, JUST CUT, mixture of oranges and other citrus...grapefruit.
T - It's such a fresh hop flavor that you would swear that there are buds IN THE CAN. The most unique hop taste I have ever experienced, and, I was skeptical at first, but, there is ABSOLUTELY a discernible difference in the poured vs. can tasting option. In my opinion, the fresher "rawness" in the hop flavor is NOT as present if poured. The hop flavors tend toward bitter. It's not a grapefruit bitterness, it is the first time I'm going to say...this is a hop "extract" bitterness. It's not hops masquerading as an orange, a tangerine or a grapefruit. It's a mashed hop plant in your beer. Hop nation!
M - Medium-heavy. A little sticky. Plenty of carbonation.
O - Well. I would advise everyone who is fortunate enough to get ahold of the Heady to try it by the pour, and compare it to "straight from the can." I'm sure anyone who has had at least two cans in their possession has done this anyway. Delicious. Unforgettable. 1,221 charactersMVotter, May 31, 2013

4.86/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Drank from the can, per its request. Having had it both ways, however, I can attest that my evaluation remains a perfect score regardless.
A: (from a previous experience) golden orange and cloudy.
S: Powerful citrus hops, a bit of pine.
T: Initial overload of citrus and tropical hops with a bit of pine under there. Faint malt that is certainly there but not overwhelming. Not overly bitter and extremely refreshing.
M: Thick and satisfying.
O: Full disclosure, I am firmly placed within the Heady camp of the great DIPA wars. No doubt, having regular access to Heady is one of the greatest joys of living in Vermont. That said, I recognize the danger of the hype surrounding a beer like Heady. I have not drank nearly enough beer--let alone DIPAs--in my life to claim to know what is and is not the best beer--or IPA--in the world. What I can say is that, before first trying Heady Topper on my 21st birthday thanks to a couple generous friends, I absolutely loathed anything IPA, having preferred stouts and the maltier side of the beer spectrum. I never understood the so-called "hopheads" when all I could taste was overt bitterness and strange combinations of malts and hops. I suspect the primary culprit is the inability of lesser breweries to achieve an ideal hop-malt balance. To this day I still cannot finish most IPAs and DIPAs. Regardless, the perfect score I've given is due to the fact that Heady made me love hops and IPAs. It is undoubtedly the best beer I've had in my short life of drinking and it would be my choice for the only beer to drink for the rest of my life. I plan on staying in Vermont as long as possible to realize this possibility. That said, don't listen to the hype, try it for yourself. Even if you don't think it's God's gift to man, few can discount that its a treat to enjoy at least once. 1,835 charactersBTVflatlander, May 30, 2013

I have tried to consume more available IPAs but nothing has compared, even other world class beers such as Double Trouble and LagunitasSucks. So today I went up to VT with some friends and picked up 6 cases. No more worrying for me. Its a shame more cannot try this great beer. 540 charactersputnam118, May 27, 2013

Appearance: Pours a hazy light amber, huge white head. Yes, I poured into my IPA glass despite what it says on the can. Beautiful look to the eye. Can't wait to sip.
Smell: So much going on here. Hops, hops, and more hops. Also smell the grapefruit, orange, and citrusy aromas. Even out of the can, this beer brings a lot right to the nose. This is a DIPA that's for sure. I could smell this forever...
Taste: Just what I would expect. A ton of hops, but balanced well with the malt. Very citrusy on the tongue, so much flavor to compete with the hop abundance. Just a joy to drink and my tongue begs to go back for more.
Mouthfeel: Not too heavy, not too light. Somewhat bready, but not too heavy. Very easy drinking and enjoyable for the ABV and the amount of flavor.
Overall: I was a bit unsure about the hype and somewhat figured the high rating was due to the rarity of this beer. Now I know that it is for real. The taste, aroma, and overall character of the beer beg me to come back for more. Thank God I've got three cans left.
Absolutely worth seeking out if you can. I do hope their distribution expansion plans come to light and we see this in the Boston area soon. 1,287 charactersMikecap, May 27, 2013

4.5/5  rDev -3.2%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.25Bought from a Charity Auction with the proceeds going to "Open the Taps": A grassroots organization of Texas craft beer consumers.
Even though the can says to drink out of the can, which I did with the first can, I poured this one into a duvel tulip glass so that I can see what it looks like. Now I know why they want you to drink it out of the can . . . it is a murky nasty yellow. It's just not an appealing looking beer. With that, it does pour out with a good three finger white head with good retention and great lacing.
The scent is amazing. I have a bad nose and often can get any scent off a beer. After pouring I set this glass down next to the computer, walked away, and then when I came back I could smell the aroma of green hops. If my nose can catch a scent without putting my nose in the glass, it gets a 5.
If we're grading this off the style . . . then I have to say this, I don't know if this is an true Double / Imperial IPA. I would expect the best of the style would have to be a well put together hop bomb. This isn't a hop bomb by any measure . . . but it IS well put together. There is the hop punch, but it's well balanced by orange flavor and pine. The bitterness finishes the flavors very well.
The mouthfeel is well carbonated. I would have to say I'd like the body to be just a tad heavier. There is a noticeable alcohol burn for only 8%.
Overall, this was well worth the extra money I spent for three reasons: this is a high quality brew, the rarity of it in Texas, and for the GREAT things orgainizations like Open the Taps has done for Texas Craft Beer Consumers during this Legislature session. PROSIT, Ya'll!!! 1,649 characterswhoneeds8, May 26, 2013

It's not, however, the beer beer I've ever had, nor even the best recent-vintage IPA. The hop profile is wonderfully vareigated and citrusy, but also gets a bit unpleasantly heavy in the back end. The malt is totally subordinate to the hops--as is customary for this new style of IPA--but in order for this to work the hop profile must balance itself perfectly. Heady's doesn't. It comes close, and the beer is still a joy, but it's not quite perfect.
In sum, very good. Excellent, probably. But Zombie Dust beats it. 610 charactersmynie, May 25, 2013

Big thanks to wyatt13 for sharing a can!
Appearance - Hazy, light yellow. Nice and fresh. Light head that disappears fairly quick. Didn't pour much in the glass. Just enough for a quick look. Drink from the can!!!
Smell - Big. Lots of pine. Background grapefruit, and a little bit of orange peel.
Taste - Massive hops, as expected. More of the citrus comes through in the taste. Astringent pine as well. Big bitter aftertaste that lingers. Packs one hell of a wallop too. Halfway thru the can, I was already buzzed.
Mouthfeel - Heavy body (for a DIPA), medium carbonation, semi-dry, semi-sticky finish
Overall - A damn fine beer, yes. #1 beer ever? Probably not. It tastes very natural, very raw and overall, very nice. If you love hops, you'll love this. Keep your expectations in check though. It's simply an awesome DIPA. Nothing more, nothing less. Don't compare it to Pliny. Two totally different beers, in my opinion. And both are great! 960 characterssbxx, May 25, 2013

A - Pours a very hazy golden yellow color with 1 finger of white head that hangs around for a while.
S - Smell is pure hoppy goodness! The majority of the hop smell is of the tropical fruit variety... mango, passionfruit.
T/M - The taste of citrus is very dominant on the first taste. On second taste, I get the mango and papaya. Get combination of flavors, and a great resinous hop flavor left on my tongue. Medium mouthfeel, really good carbonation.
O - Winner winner, chicken dinner! This beer is the real deal for any hop head out there. This brew hits all the right notes with me, and I have a hard time finding any flaws with it. Great smell, amazing taste, no alcohol burn. If I could only have 1 IPA to drink for the rest of my life, this would be the one.

A: Tall, aluminum can, perfectly sized for an adult male hand. Good graphics, and distinctive black pull tab with large mouth opening. Drank from can, as demanded by can.
S: Hop smell upon opening is intoxicating. You can smell it from feet away, literally. Very citrusy, very heavy, almost overbearing. 
T: Extreme hoppiness is a shock to your mouth on first sip. Gives way to a more mellow hop flavor after a few seconds. Tons of citrus and bitterness, offset slightly by some malty bread notes.
M: Thick, due to the hop overload. Pleasant though, as the coating it leaves has a beautiful aftertaste.
O: 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. 5. Great beer. 735 characterstittymcj, May 24, 2013

4.41/5  rDev -5.2%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516oz can, poured into a glass for the purposes of reviewing in comparison to other DIPAs, even though they say to drink it from the can.
Cloudy, cloudy tangerine body with a thin, white head that fades to a layer of foam atop the ale, leaving a little lace on its way down. Super fresh aroma, with orange rind, grapefruit, juicy fruit gum, mango. Taste is super fresh again here, with loads of mango, orange rind, mandarin, bitter grapefruit juice, grassy, a little nutty as it warms. Creamy and smooth medium-full body, lower carbonation, finishes bitter but not overly - more like grapefruit juice. Insanely balanced and drinkable. I'll need to get a hold of this again....for my wife. First ever IPA or DIPA she liked! I'll have to try it directly from the can next time. 774 charactersbarnzy78, May 24, 2013

S: Massive, dry citrus. Pine sap, fresh hops, freshly cut grapefruit. Huge citrusy, American hops. Don't know what else to say other than...Breathtaking. Unbelievable. Brings a smile to your face. Begs you to take a sip. 
T: H-O-P-S! Huge, dry, resiny, piney, citrusy, earthy hops. It's honestly just a heavy hop rush. But never too much. A beer like this isn't supposed to be this smooth and balanced. It's supposed to be too dry or too cloying. But it isn't!
M: Incredibly smooth and drinkable. Everything a beer and a DIPA should taste like. Just crazy.
O: The hype is absolutely real. I don't want to stop drinking this.
Edit: had on draft at Prohibition Pig in Waterbury, VT. If you didn't think Heady could get any better...try it on draft! WOW! Absolutely unbelievable. The pinnacle of a hop journey through craft beer. 934 charactersGatch, May 22, 2013

A - would have gave it a 5 and actually had no standing to give a rating but just the mystique and the can itself deserves praise.
S - wow hop nectar and resin galore. I feel like music is playing in my head to the beat of this beer. Frank ocean to be precise.
T - not overly bitter just perfect piney hop taste. does it taste like I thought it would? even better somehow. the bottom of the can held the greatest depth of flavor but the beer is never bitter. Bravo. 
M - frothy dry hop slime. almost feels oily its so hoppy but the carbonation adds a maturity to it. 
O - thank god I finally tried this beer just enjoy it if you can. worth going to Vermont for. 821 charactersJordanPhraczek, May 21, 2013

4.89/5  rDev +5.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Review from notes accumulated while going through a case of HT over 4 weeks. First can was 4 days old, last can was right around a month. Mostly poured into tulips, but had a few straight from the can, too.
A: There's no two ways about it, guys -- the floaties in this beer are ugly. I don't care much about them, and I guess it gives the beer a rustic characteristic, but I've got to ding HT on the pure appearance score. Perfectly attractive beer otherwise. Nice golden amber with a big, puffy off-white head and lots of lacing.
S: The aroma of fresh HT is just wonderful. A complex and unique hop blend. Big pine, tropical fruit, citrus. A bit of caramel malt provides sweet balance. I'm almost having trouble describing it because it's basically perfect (to my own taste). A month in, the aroma is a bit less intense, but no less complicated or outstanding. I'd rank it a 5 after 4 days and a 5 after a month.
T/M: Incredibly juicy. More fruit-like and less pine compared to the nose. Tropical fruit is dominant -- pineapple, mango, what have you. Some of the more traditional citrus -- grapefruit mainly. Also getting a distinct apricot flavor, which somebody once told me was from the proprietary yeast but I'm not sure. Decent amount of caramel and biscuity malt to balance. Like the aroma, it gets a little less intense over a month but no less wonderful. Mouthfeel is slick. Carbonation's a little on the high side. Decently bitter but insanely drinkable. Not a hint of the ABV. 
O: This is not going to be my highest rated beer, because of the appearance score, but I think it's my favorite. It's worth every bit of the hype. Make some good friends in Vermont, kids. 1,680 charactersCharlatanSin, May 20, 2013

A - Pours an off color amber, 2 finger white head, minor lacing. Lots of yeast floating around.
S - Very dank hop aromas, some pine & spruce, citrus peels, grapefruit, white grape juice.
T - Those dank hops are intense, lots of white grape flavor, pine, spruce and earthy tones, tart apple, and a little sweet malt.
M - Full and well carbonated, easily drinkable.
O - While I'm not on par with the appearance, everything else is solid about this beer, though its not my favorite, nor do I think its worth all the hype. Compared to Pliny, its a no-contest situation, its thoroughly better. This actually delivers, lots of good aroma and the taste is solid, love the big grape flavor in this. Its a shame Alchemy is being too hipster to expand and make other things, or even distribute more. 811 charactersOmnium, May 20, 2013

4.72/5  rDev +1.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5I've been lucky enough to have this both right out of the can (as suggested) and poured into a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Huge thanks to my buddy Doug and my co-worker Zach for hooking me up two separate times with this gem. This review is from a 5 day old can that was consumed half in a glass and half in the can...
A - Pours a very murky, honey color that is quite obviously NOT filtered in any way. It's a slighlty darker color at times than I would've thought. An eggshell white head forms about 2 fingers thick and hangs on for quite a bit befre it recedes leaving gloriously sticky lacing on the glass.
S - The aroma is strong the second you crack the can! HUGE hits of juicy, citrusy fruits. Mango, pineapple, orange, and strong aromas of grapefruit jump out of the can. I LOVE how juicy this smells! Bitter notes jump in and out as the citrus really has me entranced. As it warms a bit, there is an undercurrent of buttery malts that really rounds out the aroma here.
T - The taste is superb. Sae juicy citrus flavors all mixed together perfectly. Orange, grapefruit and pineapple stand out the most with mango and some lemon zest coming through as well. The favor is so smooth and buttery it is almost unreal. Bitter, piney hops come through and onloy add to the onalsught ofhop perfection. 
M - Smooth, even carbonation on the tongue making this one extremely pleasant on the tongue. The body is medium bodied, but because of the richness of the beer, it can feel full at times. A bitter, dry fnish rounds things off nicely.
O - This beer is SO FREAKING DRINKABLE!! That is really what stands out the most to me. It doesn't overpower with hops, but puts them on an evenly mixed display that allows you to enjoy every single sip. There is a reason this is on the top ofthe food chain (on this site anyway). Either way, this reallh does deserve the accolades it has received thus far. 1,901 charactersKAP1356, May 19, 2013

Drank 1/3 from can, then rest from pint.
A - Cloudy, nice full head. Very foamy head with lots of lacing.
S - An amazing aroma, with tons of citrus/grapefruit/lemony and herbal smells. You could find yourself just sniffing the can or glass for . . . minutes. But then you have to drink.
T - Without a doubt, the least hoppy and bitter DIPA I've ever had. Extremely smooth. Not too carbonated. While this isn't my favorite style, if this were the only IPA I ever drank, it probably would be a favorite style. Almost tastes like a sparkling beverage that's been spiked. But better.
M - Rich, creamy, and very smooth.
O - I can understand why people rave about this beer. I found myself saying several time, "Mmm, this is quite good. I'm really impressed" I rarely say that about IPAs. I'll happily drink this again. And again. 934 charactersBeer-A-Lot, May 18, 2013

Appearance: Pours beautiful pale with a red/orange hue. In my opinion the best color for an IPA, the word majestic comes to mind..
Smell: As soon as I cracked it open it was like some smacked me in the face with a pine tree. Incredible amounts of pine. Reminded me of sitting in the forest.
Taste: lots of pine, not too bitter, balanced well in my opinion. Starts piney sweet with some orange with a small bitter aftertaste
Mouthfeel: Nothing remarkable, what you'd expect from an Imperial IPA
Overall: This is probably one of the best DIPA's I've had, perfectly balanced, and a beautiful experience. I'm in the process of securing a case from a friend of mine now.

4.56/5  rDev -1.9%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Managed to get 2 cans of this thanks to the kindness of another BA. This is a quick review based on drinking the first one straight outta the can, as directed by said can. I'll review again out of a glass with the next one. No discernible freshness or 'drink by' date to be found.
UPDATE: Had the second can on 7/16/2013 and poured into a 22 oz snifter glass
Appearance - Can't really rate this in fairness, since I drank it straight out of the can. I do like the image of hops literally blowing a guy's mind, but alas I cannot judge the beer's appearance. That being said, I have to score it something, so I'll dock it just a little bit from the overall. UPDATE: Tons of floaties. It looks like extra pulp orange juice--not joking. I love a good unfiltered beer, but the particulate here is just too much and gives a slightly unpleasant impression of the beer. Lowering score to 3.75 because it's just not a pretty beer, as tasty as it is.
Smell - I will be interested to see how this one smells in a glass, because even out of the mouth of a can, it's intoxicating. Pine, grapefruit, citrus zest, herbal. UPDATE: the appearance of pulpy orange juice is fitting, because the smell is so aromatic and citrusy. A bit more orange and balance now that I'm getting to inhale fully with my nose. So floral and aromatic.
Taste - Delicious and balanced. Grapefruit, pineapple and more resinous pine characteristics. Bitterness is almost absent, until the beer is gone, and there is an lingering essence of hop bitters. Refreshing in spite of it's high gravity and pronounced hop presence. UPDATE: no appreciable change in taste out of the glass. Bitterness comes on a bit quicker perhaps.
Mouthfeel - Medium-bodied with pronounced but not overpowering carbonation. Finish is clean, with lingering but faint bitterness.
Overall a highly drinkable and flavorful beer. I was admittedly skeptical given the level of praise surrounding this beer, but I was pleasantly surprised. The beer was pretty damn close to the hype that preceded it. UPDATE: in the future, I would follow the advice on the can. The taste suffers little to none, and even though the aroma is a little more restrained straight out of the can, looking at the floaties is more of a negative than the lack of smelling out of a glass. 2,295 charactersLambicPentameter, May 14, 2013

A- Considering I drank it right from the can (as it so boldly suggests right on the rim) I cannot comment on the appearance. The can is large and silver with a quirky drawing of a mad scientist on the front. It also says "Don't be a D-bag, recycle this can" on the back which I found amusing. 
S- Great nose on this beer. Huge citrus hop aroma, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, mango, pine, all mixed together for a lovely bouquet of smells. 
T- WOW. Even better than the smell leads on! Fantastic resinous hop flavors, citrus notes, lots of tart grapefruit and pineapple in there as well. Moderately bitter finish, extremely refreshing as well. 
M- Amazing mouthfeel on this beer. Moderately carbonated, thick, resinous, oily feel on the tongue. 
O- I have had many of the top 250 beers in the recent months and in most cases they did not live up to the hype. This is not one of those cases. Amazing from when you first pop the top to when you take your last sip. Absolutely outstanding beer and it deserves its #1 rating hands down. I had one when I first got to the tasting and then went beer shopping and had to stop and have another on the way out because it makes you crave its deliciousness. Easily my favorite beer that I have had to date. 1,352 charactersZbyler, May 11, 2013

4.6/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5I had a customer give me a can of Heady last year. Split it with one of my coworkers and we both just looked at each other with mouths open before both exclaiming how good it was. I picked up my share at the brewery little over a week ago and now it's time for a full review.
I know it says to drink from the can, but for this review it will be poured into a Sam Adams 'perfect pint' glass. Later I'll have one from the can and if I notice anything different enough to comment on I'll edit this review.
AP: Colour like a dark shade of apricot or orange marmalade. Can't really see through this when held to the light, it's pretty damned thick. Foamy dense white head, about 1" that settles to 1/2" with moderate lacing.
AR: Like fresh green pine needles after a rain. Fruity hop aromas of orange, peach, grapefruit, mango and guava. Bready cereal grains from the malts.
T: Just very well balanced between the malts and hops. The hops are there and prominent but don't overpower and take over. The hops are lush and juicy, which to me is the mark of a really great IPA/DIPA. On the finish it's soft green pine with the rinds of orange and tangerine. I love how it's flavourful from start to finish. So easy to drink and a moist long aftertaste.
M: Creamy with a fairly hearty full body, low to moderate carbonation, crisp clean finish that though the juicy hops leave a moistness behind that coats your cheeks/gums, it's off dry on the tongue. 
OV: An exceptionally well done brew. Flavourful, balanced and a bit chewy for a DIPA, which I like about it. Good lingering flavours that make you want to keep drinking and the ABV is well hidden. At this point, I would say Heady Topper and Lawson's Double Sunshine are the best DIPAs I've had so far. I'm not going to say which I think is better as I like each for different reasons and am just glad I got to try them both. In a perfect World, I'd have access to both whenever I wanted instead of having to drive 7hrs to Vermont to get a limited amount. 1,999 charactersGuinnessAtRogerWilco, May 11, 2013

4.53/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516oz can with about the first 1/4 drank out of the can, the rest poured into a FFF teku glass and consumed today 5/10/13. Thanks to shagens for the opportunity to drink this 1.5-2 week old Heady.
Aroma: Holy smokes. Soon as I pop the can: tons of sweet honey, toffee, caramel and biscuits.. followed by quite a bit of tropical fruit- mango, papaya with a bit of grapefruit. Big, big whiffs of tropical fruits. If it drinks anywhere as good as it smells, it's a winner. (4.75) 
Colour: Can't tell when it's in the can, but once I pour it into the teku, it looks good. Burnt orange, like the University of Texas' school colours. Pours with a nice thick 2cm white head that slowly fades into a bubbly collar that persists. There are bits of lacing that doesn't really stick around, but otherwise a good looking DIPA. At the end of the drink, I poured out the last ounce of the can to see what the floaties looked like- and its nasty. I see why they recommend drinking it out of the can. (4)
Flavour: I get a big malt kick up front, with caramel, toffee, honey and sweet bread. But that only sets the stage for a nice-sized blast of tropical fruit which eventually fades away into a bitter citrus finish which is also accompanied by a mellow backend that balances the hoppiness. Nice complexity to it, very hoppy and tasty. (4.5)
Mouthfeel: Definitely not lacking in the department. Thicker side of medium body, excellent carbonation, resinous and coats the palate pretty well with the bitter finish- which is mostly citrus and a bit of tropical fruit. I don't feel any heat at all drinking this. (4.5)
Overall: I think the hoppiness quotient is where it needs to be- which balances out the sweet maltiness that predominated the older can. It does come together in a better way which I definitely appreciate. It's hoppy as hell though in a very non-subtle manner, though not as much as Abrasive is. Pliny is hoppy in a more subtle way- mainly in the aroma and flavour (intense grapefruit and citrus), but not so much the bitter aftertaste like Heady gets that starts burning off my palate. Very excellent DIPA, just a bit behind Pliny and Abrasive in my book. (4.5) 2,166 charactersStevedore, May 11, 2013

A: Orange color with medium haze. Solid finger of white head on top. Quite a bit of spotty lacing.
S: Tons of citrus and sweet-smelling tropical fruit. Such a nice mixture of hop aromas. Couldn’t be more inviting.
T: First few sips from the can were very flavorful, but I preferred drinking it from a glass. Mostly citrus (grapefruit) and tropical fruit (mango). Some residual sweetness and finishing with a nice bitterness, but not too strong. The bitterness does linger on your tongue for a while. Just awesome.
M: Starts sweet and then finishes dry and biting. Hop oils coat your mouth. Medium carb.
O: To be honest, I didn’t want to bother with this review. Just wanted to drink the beer. I was afraid that I wasn’t going to love this, but no worries....it’s delicious. 882 charactersmjtiernan, May 10, 2013

The beer is slightly hazy when compared to other world class DIPAs as noted by it being unfiltered with a foamy white head.
The beer explodes out of the can. So much citrus and pine in every drink. Effortlessly drinkable with no sign of the 8% alcohol. Juicy but balanced with the piney bitterness. Full flavor while completely chilled as well, which can be rare for some heavily hopped beers.
Simply put, this is the best DIPA out there. Do what you have to do to get some if you haven't had it, and if you have had it I'm sure you're acquiring trade bait to get more. Find a trade partner in Vermont because this stuff is unmatched. 728 charactersPHBoiler, May 09, 2013

SIck aroma. crazy hop flavor. literally tastes like the hop storage room at the brewery i work at smells like. great mouthfeel, feels like such a light beer. almost a different experience drinking straight from the can. same mouthfeel but a bigger hop blast. this beer is obviously insanely hyped and for good reason. i could drink a case. even at 8% it feels like a sessionable ipa 639 charactersschnarr84, May 09, 2013

My expectations were really high to finally try this. Split it with my brother who was also trying it for the first time.
Poured into a pint glass out of can.
Grapfruit and citrus hop aroma jumped out of the glass which was awesome.
Taste followed the nose extremly hop forward, which was to be expected. Citrus notes stood out the most to me. Hard time tasting the malt. Very fresh with extremly long aftertaste.
Overall, I was not that impressed, maybe because my expectaions were too high. Still a great beer, especially if you love this style. Need to try directly from can.
For what it is worth my brother absolutly loved it.
 ---
Edit: Tried a second time from the can.
THis time I purchased straight from the brewery so the freshness was insured.
This beer is very good, I think having it in a glass and getting it third hand had effected it the first time.
It is easy drinking for such a hoppy beer, I would almost call it juicy. Really kicks ass. 1,052 charactersIrishKevin, May 08, 2013

4.75/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I'm so glad that angrybabboon could provide me plenty of these for the coming weeks. I've already had this once, but I'm reviewing it today 15 days since canning day - about the widely considered perfect time to drink this. For this review, I got a bit experimental. I love how this is in the can, but I poured it alongside in a glass and reviewed both side by side - half in the glass, with the other half in the can. Poured into a teku glass.
A:
Can: Has a silver label with a fun, delightful illustration showing what could be the brewmaster himself demonstrating the wonderful hoppy things to come. Not having this in the glass is the only downside of drinking this out of the can, but I can live with that.
Glass: Pours a sunset orange amber complete with a frothy as hell, bubbly head. I left the sediment in the can, so it looks slightly hazy with a good deal of floaties. Patches of carbonation streak the glass's edges, as does lacing. Head eventually vanishes, with very frothy bubbles remaining at the sides. Slightly hazy without the extra gunk. Looks very pretty and rustic, and very much near perfect in its presentation as a full-bodied, rich DIPA.
S:
Can: Huge, earthy, hoppy citrus rind zest immediately captivates my nose, with slight tropical fruits to boot. Guava, papaya, oranges, limes, lemons, hop vine mineral-y characteristics, as well as a pungent, floral finish. This has everything you'd expect in the style, only incredibly well spread out and balanced. No metallic aftertaste from the can. Yeasty phenols are all out here, in in a way that's delightfully funky yet sharp and robust. Cannot smell any alcohol, although there is a slight sweetness underneath. No malts or grains here - the hops are completely victorious. Absolutely unlike any DIPA I've ever had.
Glass: It's incredible how much this loses a lot of the hoppy, resinous profile when poured in the glass. While there's still a strong, sharp flavor of well dried citrus notes, and maybe some apricot and grassiness, a lot of the tropical flavors are pretty much gone, and the malty flavor is far more present, in a classic East Coast, caramel/toffee profile. Slightly funky and rustic for sure, but a lot of that initial earthy flavor has definitely been lost.
T:
Can: I think the first time I ever took a sip of HT straight out of the can, my head exploded. This is unbelievably good and lives up to every bit of hype. Right at the front of the tongue there's a juicy, creamy, completely refreshing cascade of hoppy and fruity flavors, ranging from oranges to lemons to mangoes to papaya and pineapple in a way that seems to last forever. TONS of grapefruit. However, rather than feel sweet and overwhelming, these fruity phenols are immediately followed by a pungent, dank, earthy flavor in the sense that takes you to the core of the hop aromas in a fresh, lively, and robust manner. Some slight butterscotch, maybe even toffee aromas follow, but the hops do their job and finish in a ridiculously astringent manner to the point of nearly tying up the tongue in knots, only to release and reveal the smoothened creaminess from the well carbonated feel of the beer, thickness of the malts and oils, and well accentuated alcohol bite that goes down well and warms up the throat in the long run. Thick, hearty, juicy, and pretty much fabulous. It's not balanced, but it's flawless as far as great drinking experiences go. Never thought I'd ever say it, but here we are.
Glass: Out of the glass, it's delicious as well, although you get far less of those earthy flavors, as expected. The only difference otherwise is it feeling a little bit more balanced and allowing the malty syrupy feel to meld with the remaining hop oils, which still gives it the impression of being a full-bodied and well integrated beer. Less tropical notes too, although there's a delightful grassy flavor that sticks around and combines very well with the citrus. Definitely more mellow than out of the can, but still world class.
It's clear that the full experience of this beer lies in the can, and it's definitely how I'll be drinking my Heady Toppers from now on, regardless of how pretty it looks to me. This is really an experience unlike any other, and while it remains an world class beer in the glass... Out of the can, it's utterly mind blowing with all of its flavor, earthy nuances, and scarily drinkable qualities. Do seek it out. It's simultaneously glorious and humble. It's super flavorful but never overwhelming. It's designed for anyone to enjoy of any background, if they enjoy a good beer. Absolutely brilliant.
UPDATE (1/6/2014): I pitted this against some other DIPAs of similar nature (no Pliny), and this was the loser overall. All were about 2 months old. This is really good, but best consumed fresh - it becomes more piney and funky over time, and loses a lot of its fresh squeezed juicy flavors that I enjoy in the style. Worth seeking out, but make sure you know the date! 4,973 charactersmagictacosinus, May 08, 2013

4.92/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75My homeboy Javier at Vendome Wine and Spirits in Placentia had a can of this. He knows to go to the backroom where he keeps all his exclusive collection when I arrive. He brought a can of this out and I asked him what he would trade for it. He said he would take $4. What a steal! I shared it with my other homeboys at Art and Craft Brews (and homegirls). They all got excited when I showed up with it. You should have seen their eyes open up and mouth the words Oh My God! So here is my review, trying my very best not to be biased since I'm west coast and the west is the best...
It poured out a bit murky- I expected it to have been filtered, but the color was a nice golden orange. The aroma was a prelude to nice balance. Exactly what is to be expected from an exquisite IPA- rich pine, citrus and apricot all in a perfect blend- and in that order! The taste was very smooth. I only had two gulps so I had to make them count! Like I said the aromas were a prelude to the taste and it tasted very predictable (which is good) and inviting. The rich flavor profile and dynamic masks the alcohol which is very nice too. I just wish it was filtered to get a more acute, pure flavor without the murk masking anything. The aluminum in the can added to the brightness of flavor. Very close to Pliny the Younger, which nobody could help but compare it to. What makes this slightly inferior was that it is nearly 4% less ABV than Younger and not as smooth. So there. Can't wait for another can! The hunt is on. 1,505 characterstastyville, May 07, 2013

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Having had this beer on multiple occasions...I can not say enough about Heady Topper. When compared to the other top DIPA's I've had there is a few traits that set this beer apart from the rest. The main two are its balance and drink-ability. It is an unrelenting wave of hops across the palate yet still has you coming back for more. 
A - Appearance on this beer is perfect. Hazy, unfiltered, and loaded with yeast. While some may count such characteristics against the beer I prefer unfiltered beer. Makes the beer feel less refined and more what it truly is, just a beer.
S - The smell you pick up as you crack a can is an assault of grapefruit on your nose. It never truly fades and if drunk from the can the aroma lingers for days after consumption.
T - Grapefruit and pine, a mixture of citrus and hop bitterness that bombards your tongue with flavor but never goes overboard.
M - I chill my cans to ice cold before drinking and I like to let it warm as I drink it, the mouth feel from a heavily chilled can comes off as crisp and refreshing and it thins as it warms with a growing bitterness.
Overall - While I can understand why some people do not regard Heady Topper to be the best beer in the world or even the best double IPA, I personally enjoy Heady Topper in any and all situations. I give this beer a perfect score because no matter my mood, location, or food pairing I can always enjoy a can of HT. John Kimmich is also a super friendly hands on brewer who truly cares about the beer he brings to market. 1,525 charactersBenTenison, May 07, 2013

4.95/5  rDev +6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5This is one well hyped beer. Usually that would make for some disappointment, however this one lives up to the hype... Almost. I had a friend from NH ship out a 4 pack about six months ago, of which I distributed 3 and drank one. I have just had a case shipped out, and am enjoying the rare nice weather here with this beer.
Great complete hoppy nose, like the best imperial/double IPA's the hops fill the full spectrum of smell and flavor. I disagree with keeping it in the can. I think it is better served in a chalice where you can appreciate the plethora of smells.
In my opinion, the Northeast style of DPA is too malty. This one is more malty than Pliny, but not too much and is still about right to balance the bitterness of the hops.
The single most unique characteristic of this beer is the drinkabililty. Despite the strong flavors, after you are finished, you want more. It should be leaving a strong aftertaste, but it doesn't. In that respect it is a 5/5. 971 charactersJerryG, May 06, 2013

So you're supposed to drink this from the can, but I wanted to try some from a glass too so I poured a little out.
This pours a very hazy golden orange with a finger of off-white head.
The aroma is very floral, there is some pine, grapefruit and some citrus as well. Not really any malt that I can detect. 
The taste is very hop forward with a good amount of floral, pine, grapefruit and orange right up front. There are some sweeter tropical fruit notes like peach and mango too. There is a bit of caramel malt, but not too much and to just add some balance to the beer.
The body is medium and the mouthfeel is crisp and clean, but leaves some hop residue on the tongue. The alcohol is extremely well hidden and it's very, very easy to drink. 
You definitely wanna drink this from the can because it really does enhance the hop flavors compared to pouring it in a glass. This is a great DIPA, but certainly not my favorite. It has very nice flavors, but I prefer a more intense DIPA and more tropical, juicy fruit notes too. Definitely worth trying, but nowhere near perfect in my eyes. 1,134 charactersJohnnyMc, May 06, 2013

Appearance: From the small portion served in the glass it's a semi-cloudy gold with a thin white head rising to 1/3" settling quick without touching the glass. 
Smell: heavy citrus skin, strong wet hops. I admit it disappears quick but it's super unique. 
Taste: Strong bitterness, hardcore citrus does it live up to the hype...really depends on your palates. If you life floral this brew delivers. On top even more grapefruit, coming off a hint sweet. 
Mouth: Heavy carbonation, with bubbly texture all over. Best move on this take your time, letting it sit in the can still after minutes upon minutes carbonation still there with a heavy floral finish. A rarity, a beer when served unto the glass; it actually loses property...I compared this to the small portion I had sitting here in the glass and the glass was much "flatter". Doesnt hurt for you to try the same method. 
Overall: Awesome...is it my favorite ipa? Definitely not but probably maybe my top 10 but considering what I want in DIPAs. Thank you to Tap and Barrell here in Smithtown for carrying this gem. Salud! 1,185 charactersBlurryVisi0n, May 06, 2013

A - Nice cloudy burnt orange colour. Three finger white pillowy head. Good carbonation, good spotty lace with lot's of rings and a full finger of retention.
S - Great juicy hops. Pine, orange, mango. Boozy pineapple. Hops, hops, hops. Lot's of hop oils, trees. Smells outdoorsy. Mango and pineapple juice.

M - Good carbonation, medium body, strong bitterness with lot's of citrus. Goes down insanely easy, especially from the can.
O/D - A great DIPA. Worthy of the hype IMO. I dunno if it's the best out there at the moment, but hell, it's good. No hint of alcohol, and a beast of a hop monster. Insanely drinkable.

Poured into pint glass.
Pours a gorgeous golden orange with a lot of floaties. Smell is BIG on grapefruit/citrus/pine, lots of good stuff going here. Taste is dead on with the aroma, with more pine/resiny flavors coming through. There's almost too many wonderful flavors to mention, but everything is balanced and so well crafted.

Appearance is a murky dishwater color with sediment. Aroma is uber hoppy. Big grapefruit with sweet citrus and tropical fruits. Outstanding. Taste mirrors the aroma. Lots of hoppy goodness. Plenty of grapefruit along with citrus peel and hints of pine towards the end. Tropical notes as well. Pineapple. Dry, oily mouthfeel. Bitter and delicious. Highly drinkable. Amazing brew. Overall, hype warranted.
Note: Appearance rated from a separate time where I poured it into a glass. 559 charactersPicoPapa, May 04, 2013

4.87/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75I was able to have this on-tap at the brewery when I went to pick-up some cases, and have had a couple directly from the can as well as in a snifter. 
A - Very cloudy orange haze with a head that lingers (when poured). I know people knock it for the appearance but I actually find it pretty appealing.
S - Incredibly aromatic (especially from the can). Strong scents of citrus (particularly grapefruit) and fresh hops.
T - I love the balance. There is a strong hop profile but it's not over the top. The citrus scents follow through on the taste as well. The finish is dry with a surprising bitterness.
M - Very well carbonated that makes it incredibly easy to keep drinking.
O - It's amazing how well-balanced this DIPA really is and definitely deserving of the hype. However, I'm not sure if it is the best beer in the world (even in my limited experience, PtY holds that spot for me). Having said that, I will definitely be enjoying the cans I have left and mourn them when they are gone. 996 charactersakang, May 03, 2013

Drank 1/3 or so in a tulip glass, the rest from the can.
Poured into the tulip, there's a nice golden, straw color, that pours a rich and frothy two-finger head that takes a bit of time to settle down; lacing is very nice. Smells immediately of citrus, and a hell of a lot of hops. The taste...yum! The hops are even more pronounced, but not in an overwhelming fashion. They certainly linger on the tongue, but it's evenly balanced enough to not become tart or bitter. Maybe grapefruit, very light floral and spice notes that provide a nice balance to the hop-fest that is this Double IPA. Also getting a bit of passion fruit and tropical fruit notes. Mouthfeel is great, solid carbonation and doesn't attack one particular part of the palate. 
If you're lucky enough to find one, it's well worth a taste! 930 characterssmooth_aleing, May 01, 2013

 It didn't feel like 8.00% and as a person that doesnt care for needlessly high ABV I love it. 
The aroma on this beer is by far the best part. It smells of grass and happiness. Its white head is thick enough for a mustache. But feels light. You could sip or slop this beer and both would taste great. Although it isnt as complexe as I had thought for a Rate 1 beer it is, by all accounts, excellent. 430 charactersBuckKY, May 01, 2013

Poured into Sierra Nevada/Dogfish's IPA glass
Appearance: Pours a breathtaking hazy sunset gold with a thick, tight bubbled 2 finger white head that sticks around forever, leaving plenty of sticky lace as it recedes at a snail's pace. You can actually see raw hop particulate floating around in the glass. Awesome!
Aroma: Woah, an absolute tropical hop monster; Overt aromas of Pineapple, mango, passion fruit, lemon, grapefruit juice, light notes of pine and just a touch of catty astringency. While the hop aromatics are of some of the usual suspects, they really take on softer, yet very raw characteristics; The hops smell very potent, yet they aren't abrasive at all like a lot of imperial IPAs. There is a soft clean malt presence in the background that becomes more apparent as the beer warms. 
Taste: HOP BOMB! Absolute gigantic waves of tropical goodness hits your palate right away; Juicy pineapple, grapefruit peel, resinous pine, passion fruit. There is a ubiquitous yeast presence that manifests itself in strong essence of peach; I've never picked up that note in a yeast before. The beer has a dry, assertive bitter finish that leaves raw impressions of grapefruit, pineapple, kiwi, pine needles, and a nice bready maltiness to help balance the beer on your tongue. 
Mouthfeel: Very robust, oddly creamy and oily with moderate to high carbonation. 
Overall: A truly mind blowing and unique IPA; Its like John Kimmich at Alchemist took the best attributes of West Coast and East Coast IPAs and combined them; Birght fruity, citrusy hops (west coast)and a sizable slightly chewy mouthfeel(East Coast) but without the super malty back bone. I've never had a beer that really harnessed raw hop character as well as this beer. Smelling this beer is really like sticking your head inside a dry hop bag after home brewing. Alchemist's house yeast "Conan", really shines with it's peach forward esters. Truly magical stuff. While I don't prefer this beer over Pliny(mainly because Pliny is just so damn balanced, crisp and refreshing), this still is a beer every Hop Head should experience. Plus it's in a can! Highly, highly recommended. 2,267 charactersflayedandskinned, May 01, 2013
4.3/5  rDev -7.5%look: 3.75 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25A: Pours a rich orange color, with a nice inch thick white head. Tons of sediment floating in the glass. Gives the appearance that they're suspended in a jello mold. Not the most appetizing start.
S: A tropical paradise. Loads of mango and pineapple right off the bat, with a faint piney aroma in the background. Very sweet smell.
T: A nice bitter hop bite on the initial sip. Nice juicy sweetness follows, with mango being the most noticeable fruit flavor. Really nice balance between the sweetness and bitterness.
M: Rich, creamy, full bodied DIPA. Carbonation is very subtle. Much thicker than you'd expect. Almost chewy. Alcohol is noticeable, but not overpowering.
O: Extremely tasty, flavorful brew. Doesn't jump out as the "best beer in the world" to me however, as the ratings show. Very good, but visually unappealing, and heavier than I'd prefer, but that's just nitpicking 887 charactersbrydeen, May 01, 2013

I'm a huge fan of both the fruitiness and pine mix so this is perfect for me.  Fresh Heady is great but it gets better if you wait a month or so to consume. 412 characters2Xmd, Apr 30, 2013

A golden orange with a shitload of sediment but not many visible bubbles but a two finger head that hangs out long enough to leave a couple partial ring of lace
S tropical notes of mango, sweet orange, pineapple, grapefruit, and tangerine, lots of pine with just a little caramel giving some balance even though its pretty lopsided, some Flintstone vitamins as it warms, smells great 
T even more pine and more rind then the fresh flesh I was smelling, other then that it mimics the smell and that's a good thing for sure 
M has a nice weight to it, big bitter snap, a little grit left behind on the gums and a very strong and long finish of rind and pine 
O gone in seconds, very drinkable, a great example of the style from start to finish, I want more 
one of those beers where even your burps taste good after drinking it, I don't know if its the best in the World but its one of the best DIPA's I've encountered in recent memory and would go far out of my way to acquire more. 1,090 characterswordemupg, Apr 29, 2013

"Heady Topper is an American Double India Pale Ale. This beer is not intended to be the biggest of most bitter. It is meant to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness on your palate. Tremendous amounts of American hops will creep up on you, and leave you with a dense hoppy finish in your mouth. So drinkable, it scary. 
Sometime I wish I could crawl right into the can. Fresh ness and control have always been my main concern when it comes to our beer. We are committed to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from the can? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful, hop experience. The act of pouring it into a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop aromas that we have worked so hard to retain. If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom --leave them in the can when pouring. This beer is perishable, and at it's best when young, fresh, and hazy. Keep it cold but not ice cold. Drink this beer immediately we are always making more. --John Kimmich, The Alchemist, Waterbury, Vermont."
Bullcrap, it's going into a glass, because I MUST. 
It's a hazy one, a deep orange/apricot color, not bright, not golden, but clearly it's own thing. It is what it is. The head is a gigantic, prodigious, brogdignagian thing, mushroom capped, blooming with chalk white froth, lace-leaving and slow to leave. Gorgeous look on it.
Aroma: funky, musty, wicked, and weird. I'm at a loss. Thinking about Belgian yeast, thinking about putting a mare to bed. And then the typical hop aromatics creep out, some orange, some mango, grapefruit. None too bitter, either, not too brash, bold or out of control. Juuust right. A delight for the nose.
Taste: Jumps on the tongue and spills out brilliant hoppy flavor. Tingles the tongue in all right ways. Trickles over the palate, leaving happy hop deliciousness everywhere. …"from the can!"…not as complex, not as …gosh, is there a difference? or are we fooling ourselves? From the can, you get the hop blast, you get the flavor, you get the buzz, it's creamy and palatable…but you don't get everything. It's like having sex with a sock on your man, it's just not bringing it all home, if you know what I mean. I wonder why The Alchemist wants to cover this beer up, hide it in a can? Are they trying to elude the look of the brew, do they think people will dislike the chaos and disarray, the multitude of floating particles, as if it's unnatural and ugly? 
Full-bodied, long bitter finish. Really tasty, very satisfying and delicious. Best IPA of all? Naaah… 2,703 charactersfeloniousmonk, Apr 27, 2013

I live in NY and decided to take a road trip to get some at 4+ hours away. To find out they were sold out. Sold out. What brewery sells out? One that has great beer! Had a sample, it was good, went home. Returned a month later, bought a couple of cases, sent some to friends, all are happy. I've tried from both can and glass. From the can, it has a bit sharper taste/feel. What I didnt like from the can is that you couldnt smell it as well. From the glass, a bit less carbonated, much better smell, and an excellent drink. Color? Who cares? Cloudy, very little sediment. You dont look at it, you drink it! You CANNOT have just one to make a review. Give your palette time. Have 3 or 4 (yes, its ok!!) and then review it. This beer gets better each and every time. As someone else said, its like biting into a grapefruit, and like the can says, its wave after wave of hoppyness. Hands down the best beer I've ever had. Be patient, get a 4 pack, and do an informed review. You wont be disappointed! I can't wait for my next road trip! And... they are compassionate! They are donating some beer to my tribute race to a late friend. I will never forget that. Nothing like a company with a heart and compassion and PASSION! 1,303 charactersDforbes, Apr 25, 2013

A: Pours a super, super hazy dark golden color, a deeper brown around the edges. A 1/2 finger foamy white head shows good retention.
S: In a word- amazing. Mango, papaya, pine, mint, biscuity malt, pine, and juicy grapefruit all jump out. Sweet, but with a piny edge. 
T: So....good... Hits you with a big hit of citrus and pine, then that fades into some bready malt. Then some resin, grapefruit pith and more pine. The mouthfeel is almost chewy, but the carbonation is perfect and keeps the flavors popping. I can feel the hop resin on my teeth after each sip. An absolute experience. Perfectly balanced and well deserving of the hype. 681 charactersnotchucknorris, Apr 24, 2013

A: A pour from the can the day after it was canned is a bit murky, not surprising. After a couple of weeks, the particulates really settle down and a pour is much clearer.
N: A very approachable blend of citrus, light pine, and a touch of sweetness. I'm not a fan of the aggressive hop in some IIPAs, so this is a very pleasant mix.
T: Fantastic, for being a stout guy, this really takes the cake for me in terms of the genre. Grapefruit, general citrus, and light pine. Acceptable malt profile lends to a good balance.
M: There isnt an offensive aftertaste that many IIPAs exhibit. Perfect carbonation, crisp and clean.
O: The best of the genre in my opinion. This will certainly be my go-to on a hot day sitting on the deck. I really wanted to dislike it, because its a 6-hour round trip to the cannery, but alas I will be making some return visits. 1,003 charactersMattXT, Apr 23, 2013

A - It means what it says. Drink it from the can! It's not that it looks bad, but it's not what you expected. I did drink this from the can and then just poured some out at the end for a peek. Hazy as hell, but still a nice light, sunrise orange. 
S- Tropical hop bomb! This smells so good, that you won't want to move your nose away from the can. Massive pineapple, mango, citrus. 
T - So smooth and tropical. The flavors are blended so incredibly well. No real hop bite at all. Everything you would expect from a great DIPA.
M - No real alcohol kick or any type of bite from all the hops. Slight astringency. 
O - A beer that I want again soon! Incredible beer that has yet to be duplicated or overtaken. If you are any type of hophead, get yourself at can! 885 charactersASXL41, Apr 23, 2013

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was a sucker for the hype of this beer. I had tried a full gamut of attempts to acquire it from Wisconsin, but alas all of my attempts failed. Until roughly a month later my wife let me know she had a friend whose family was in Vermont at the time and that they were willing to pick some up and drive it back for me. After visiting 3 liquor stores that were completely sold out they found the miracle brew and brought back 16 cans in a cooler of ice they repeatedly replenished to ensure it never got warm. When it arrived my wife, my friend and I took a moment to enjoy the moment and shared 1 can. Despite being directed to drink it only out of the can we each poured a glass and were in awe of its hazy golden body. The first sip told us everything we needed to know. The rich full bodied taste was complimented with a smooth finish for an IPA bragging a bold 8.0% abv. I won't get into the specifics because there are many others more qualified to do so, but what I will say is that everyone who can appreciate the complexities and flavor of real beer needs to have this at some point in their life.

4.8/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75This particular can was sent to me by JSBILK, after he picked it up at the cannery six days ago. Poured from a 16 oz. tallboy can into a tulip glass. I know I know, I'm supposed to drink it from the can, but I never was very good at following directions.
A - Pours a beautiful hazy peach color. Two and a half fingers of yellowish white head explode off the top of the beer & almost spill out of the glass. Energetic bubbles all around, leaving behind sticky lacing through the entire can. People always give this beer grief for its appearance, but I don't get it.
S - Absolutely immense peach and mango notes; incredible sweet fruit character here from the hop blend. Some aromas like melon or maybe a fresh coconut water as well. This smells absolutely divine. It would be dangerous if someone designed a perfume that smelled like this.
T - As soon as it hits the tongue there is a giant hop bite, but that is quickly brought back to Earth with a surprising amount of balance. All of the fruits that come through in the nose assert themselves even more in the taste. Mango, passionfruit, grapefruit -- like a Hawaiian fruit salad.
M - Fuller mouthfeel than your typical DIPA, and also not very sweet; rather, it is pretty drying and compels me to drink it much faster than I would like.
O - Incredible beer, and I'm very grateful that I was able to try this (and fresh too!). Drive to Vermont, trade for it, do whatever you need to do. This is something every hophead should try at least once. 1,500 characterswyatt13, Apr 23, 2013

A- Light golden honey, thick fluffy white cloud head, medium retention; lacing has good legs. 
S- Dirty sock lemon (not a bad thing, seems impossible not to think bad), then malt backbone; but not too harsh with the malt. Some piney hop characteristic. 
T- I guess the best thing that I have to say about a fresh Heady is that it is very sessionable. Nothing outstanding to my palate, but my palate may not get what everyone else's is getting on this one. Some lemon zest, some piney qualities. 
M- Very creamy, best part of this beer for me is the M. Nice carb fluffy feel to this brew. 
O- My palate does not get why this is rated so high, not that I am right or anyone else is wrong, I just don't get the high average score. 799 charactersgueuzedreg, Apr 20, 2013

The first I poured into an English pint glass and followed directions for the second (drank from the can). I understand now why they are so adamant about drinking from the can - such a difference.
Appearance - beautiful, hazy gold with no floaties since I didn't swirl the last little bit to get the dregs. Looks very nice.
Smell - amazing citrus and pine: honestly, I could sit and smell this beer all day long. I also detect a hint of sweetness underneath the hops.
Taste - follows the nose. Fantastically balanced and rich: it has the perfect amount of sweetness and bitterness with a nice amount of citrus thrown in. As John Kimmich says, "I wish I could crawl right into the can."
Mouthfeel - oily and smooth - very pleasant
Overall - I wasn't sure about this beer in the glass, but after drinking it out of the can, I can honestly say that it is the best overall IPA that I have ever had, and I have had quite a few. I understand the hype now, and it is well deserved. 1,028 charactersdouginromeo, Apr 20, 2013

The feel is extremely smooth and polished. Along with it comes great notes of guava, grapefruit, hops, and some papaya.

Completely opaque due to dense haze - the color is a beautiful blend of sunshine and orange juice. A nice, slightly off white head coats the top of the beer and leaves great sticky lacing.
S: Holy shit - has so many layers of flavors. I have never experienced an aroma fly out of the bottle/can before like this - smacks you in the face. Incredibly clean and fresh. Sweet pink grapefruit, bitter grapefruit rind, outrageously fresh pine and a touch of resin. Some orange juice and mango that blends with the sticky astringency. So much going on, I am not able to do it justice through my description. Just overwhelmingly fresh and clean, balanced with bitterness and astringency. 
T: Huge, full, intense, completely fulfilling. I actually find drinking from the can is notably better, just too bad you can't look at it that way. A blast of fresh pine, sweet pink grapefruit and bitter grapefruit, much more astringency than on the nose and decently bitter. Incredibly balanced and outrageously flavorful.
P: Hard to say this, but almost the best part. Smooth and creamy - fullest bodied IPA I've come across, and one of the smoothest beers in general. 
O: I, as all who haven't had this beer before, have had this on the top of my wants. Almost always this type of hype gets in the way of truly enjoying the beer as an unreachable mark has been set. Well, this destroyed any mark I could have imagined for myself. Truly an amazing beverage and one of the best tasting anythings I've ever had. 1,531 characterstimc100, Apr 20, 2013
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5After several cans, time for a review.
Pours a murky, chunky orange. For those of us who like pulp in our fresh squeezed grapefruit juice, it's perfect. 
S: Explodes out of the can with juicy fresh citrus fruit, grapefruit dominant, with pine sap weaving into the citrus rinds. Some peaches there too. Bitter, sweet, fresh, all intermingled.
T: Bright, zesty, fresh, popping citrus and pine. I can't decide who's in charge, but it doesn't matter. Jordan and Pippen. Hetfield and Hammett. Farrar and Tweedy. The sweetness (peaches!) works with the resin which works with the bitterness which works with the pine which works with the fruit. Intense flavors bouncing around, all settling in their proper places on the tongue. A wonderfully choreographed dance on the palate.
M: Sticky, sweet, bitter, fresh, and clean (yes, all of those). Lingers just enough as it sticks to enamel. OK if you want to drink slowly, but I hate drinking this beer slowly.
O: I wouldn't change a thing. 984 characterscaskstrength, Apr 19, 2013

A- A hazy Apricot color. Not too much head. 
S- A sweet hoppy aroma, not too bitter on the nose
T- A lot of things going on. Fresh Hops, and a lot of them! Grapefruit, a mild citrus, finished off slightly bitter.
M- Very crisp, good amount of carbonation, a little bit of bitterness on the back end.

A - yeah, it's godawful looking. Of course, if the instructions on the can were followed, to drink it straight from the can, repeated emphatically around the top, then I'd have nothing to say in this category. Two sips from the can, not much nose, so into the glass it went. Opaque, murky, pissy, orange-yellow with some lingering foam on the forced pour. Sediment is pervasive and really disgusting, but not unprecedented (thinking specifically of Weyerbacher Insanity). My score would be lower, but as I drink it, I realize that the appearance really doesn't affect my opinion, but as a monolithic category, it deserves the hate. The brewery should really take it as a compliment that it's so highly rated despite this. 
S - the first thing that pops up is honey, followed by some resinous, floral notes. Fruit comes at the very end, but it's weak on the nose, more prominent in the taste. 
T - not a great balance, as I've heard it described. The bitterness overwhelms the fruity flavors, including the citrus. Bitterness recedes to resin, resin to stickiness, and things are capped off by another lingering bitterness. Points for a progression of tastes, but the hop profile isn't to my liking.
M - bitter and sticky, but not totally unpleasant. Can't find any alcohol, but I didn't expect to at only 8%.
O - worth the hype? Not at all in my opinion. I know how often this comparison is made, but fresh Abrasive really blows all other DIPAs out of the water, including this one. Very glad I got to try it for the tick (I'm not a ticker, I swear!), but I won't be seeking it out regularly. 1,770 charactersJamesShoemaker, Apr 15, 2013

This may be the most hyped beer I have ever tried. The can instructs me not to put it in a glass. I put some in a glass anyway, because I want to compare. It tastes great in both, but the glass reveals the true reason for the warning. This is one ugly beer. But seriously, who cares?
Back to what matters. It smells great, both in and out of the can. It tastes like it should be the IPA reference type. As I drink it, I can't imagine a way to improve it. Carbonation is good, it's not a sticky mess -- in short, this lives up to the hype.
Just don't look at it. 644 charactersDaveAnderson, Apr 14, 2013
4.08/5  rDev -12.3%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.25 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4"Grapefruit Bomb" is a highly overused term, yet it pretty much nails the flavor of Heady Topper: so many of the super hopped-up ales have a strong bitter aftertaste.HT has just the right combination of pleasant bitterness on the palate and carbonation, making it a superbly brewed DIPA, one that is very drinkable,and most enjoyable from start to finish. 
The unpasteurized unfiltered Heady drinks like a meal, is chewy and not suited to chugging, but is completely satisfying
If you are lucky enough to get your hands on a 4 pack, you may well find yourself enjoying each can more than the last one (like myself), especially after making the rounds with other DIPA offerings in between tastings. Wait until at least can #3 before writing a review, and try other DIPAs in between: you may agree that Heady Topper comes out on top!
HT has become one of the few elite DIPAs by which all others are judged, worth the legendary Pliny status (though completely different in character). This top notch DIPA is readily available to me fresh from the "cannery" and I am looking for someone with fresh Hopslam and/or Zombie Dust to trade. 1,133 charactersHendry, Apr 14, 2013

A: Golden honey color with a white head. Pretty typical for the style. 
S: A remarkable achievement in the aroma department. This is the beer that I will use to judge all others on aroma. Pungent, stinging hops, with a balanced biscuity, bready backbone. Pure citrus hops, and dense pine. A pleasure for the senses.
T: You know, being from Southern CA, I see a lot of IPAs come and go. We have quite a few to chose from after all. Most don't live up to the hype, but a few do. This is one of those few. I haven't experienced grapefruit bitterness like this in a beer before. It's honestly like biting into a ripe grapefruit. I love my IPAs bold and pungent, and this delivers more than any other. A bitter assault. 
M: Again, this is average for the style. Medium bodied and good carbonation helps to scrub the palate, but in the end, the hops win. Leaves a hop coating.
O: yeah, it's as good as they say, and maybe even better. And I still have a can left. 1,047 charactersSeaOfShells, Apr 09, 2013

So, I poured 80% into a glass and left the rest in the can. After it hit the glass, I understood the desire for the can. The unfiltered, resin-floating view was less than flattering. But, I figured, two million people can't all be wrong. So I took a whiff, and enjoyed the crisp, apricot notes coming back at me. Nothing piney, no citrus, just clean. Next was where the rubber meets the road - the taste. My wife summed it up best, when she said "wow, an IPA I wouldn't have to pair with food to drink!" I absolutely agree. It's perfectly brewed, and is surely the best, most balanced IPA I've ever had. First taste threatens to turn into piney hops in your mouth, yet never does. It just slides away, leaving you with a tasty, refreshing treat that doesn't stay past its welcome. Now I know why this is such a revered brew, and why people love to have more than one at a time. It's just that inviting, and one I wish was closer to me in availability. 1,065 charactersyankeepride, Apr 07, 2013

Appearance: Quite hazy unfiltered orange-ish color. Plenty of sediment. Medium sized white head. Decent retention. with some sudsy lacing.
Aroma: Good blend of citrus and pine lead it off and carry all the way to the finish.
Taste: Juicy hops, Mandarin oranges, grapefruit, and a tropical blend followed by layers of pine resin. delicious well done DIPA. Fresh flavor. Pretty much perfection. Delivers on hops, bitterness and flavor all while being completely drinkable.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with an exceptional drinkability. Never comes across as too bitter. Carbonation is soft though perfect for what this beer needs. Glad & thankful I finally got an opportunity to try this one. Something I would look forward to drinking for years to come. 916 charactersnimrod979, Apr 07, 2013

A - A beautiful golden copper hue. It liberated a 2 finger width white head, that slowed disappated and left a sparse crown of lace. Plenty of protein floating that eventually settled at the bottom of the glass. 
S - A great hop blast, with citrus and pine. I just keep wanting to smell it. Awesome.
T - Damn, the hoppiness that you expect, but very well balanced. Bitter, but not overly so. Fantastic hop dose with a tasty citrus component to it. 
M- Smooth, light/medium bodied. Finishes crisp and delicious. 
O - Man, what a beer. I love my D/IIPA's and this is the best I've had. It certainly had a lot of floaties, but that didn't bother me, but I can see how it might be off putting to people. I got this in a trade and I'm glad that I have 2 left, but I would love to taste this on tap. Amazing beer, one you must try. I can see why it is numero uno. 917 charactersdrrone, Apr 07, 2013

In the nose pungent grapefruit, citrus, mango and other tropical fruits dominate. There's a bit of biscuit-y malt underneath.
On the palate the hops are very bright; layers and layers of hops barrage the palate. Grapefruit upfront then a bit of pine in the midpalate, then citrus with nice clean, sweet malty finish. The sweet malt balances out the hops and their bitterness excellently. It's dense and extremely well rounded on the palate. 
Absolutely incredible. Best DIPA I've ever had, hands down. It has a hop profile like no other, its so vibrant and juicy. 583 charactersTallSaint, Apr 06, 2013

A: Drank the first half from the can like they recommend, the can is a sight for sore eyes but hard to judge a beer's appearance on that. When poured into a snifter....my god what a sloppy looking beer. Solids all over the place. Color of orange juice with tons of floaters. Didn't want to dock the beer too much, but honestly it's not an appealing looking beer. 
S: Holy shit, its literally like smelling a bag of hops. I opened a bag of hops next to it to make sure my mind wasn't playing tricks on me. It's a hop bomb, like no other beer I have ever smelled in my life. When poured into a snifter, the aroma gets more floral and closer to other DIPAs on the market. In the can though, wow. Citrus and pine, along with some sweet tropical fruits, but they're all sitting backseat on Mr. toad's wild ride to the hops. Bam! Hops in your face. 
T: A bitter assault on your palate. This beer is a palate wrecker like I've never seen. Bitter hop finish, pine crisp bite, along with some sweet fruit to help round it out. 
M: Had side by side with a 2 day old Pliny. Made Pliny seem thin and watery by comparison. Thick, full bodied with a long lingering bitter finish that changes with the amount of breathes after a sip. 
O: This beer lived up to the hype in that it blew my mind. It reminded me of the first time I had a sip of beer when I was about 10 yrs old, except that I liked it. As an avid IPA fan, I've been around the block the a few times and this was like the first time I had an IPA. Literally have tasted nothing like it before. However, my goodness, this beer made me full and bloated. Anything but drinkable. I got through the can just fine, but I did not want another. Also, the appearance of the beer in my glass is one of the worst I have seen. Even a shaken up belgium beer isn't this bad. Not sure if that's necessary to achieve the hop profile or not, but seems a bit sloppy to me. Def worth checking out and a fantastic world class brew, one like I have never experienced before. Big thanks to SanFranJake for hooking me up with 4 cans. 2,153 charactersCommanderOfAwesome, Apr 04, 2013

This can of Heady Topper is 5 days old from the cannery. I truly wish this wasn't a Vermont only beer.
A - Bad assery, silver can that has instructions on it explaining why you should drink it from the can. The aroma burst you get from pouring will let out too many essential volatiles that should stay in the can. I have no problem drinking this beer straight from the can as the Alchemist Brewery suggests. Though if you pour this baby out, it isn't very pretty given its unpasteurized, unfiltered, and pouring it stirs up the sediment from the bottom of the can. Lets be honest, this is best left in the can.
Smell - Grass after a morning rain, fresh hops, pine. This aroma is ridiculously awesome. Best smelling IIPA I've ever had the privilege of smelling. 
Taste - Almost indescribable... It is so balanced, it is hard to pick out individual flavors as they've melded together. Then again, if I focus on the flavors hard enough, it is the taste of multiple hop varieties, pine up front and a deliciously smooth dry citrus finish. This is hands down my favorite IIPA. The west coast may have Pliny the Elder but the East Coast has Heady. God damn this is one tasty beer.
Mouthfeel - As good as the taste and aroma are, the mouth feel is almost nitro tap like, but slightly more carbonated. Think of foam from a beer but with more consistency, almost creamy. Its extremely smooth and light to medium bodied, which blows my mind given the flavors and aroma. 
Overall - This is the most deserving hype beer I've ever had, and hands down my favorite IIPA and beer. If I had access to this, this would be my go to beer. I cannot praise this beer anymore, the orgasmic aroma, perfectly balanced taste, and amazing mouthfeel make this way to easily drinkable for 8% abv. As I end this review, I have already finished this pint in a can. Wow! Looks like the wife and I are going to need to plan a trip to the east coast and hit up the cannery. You should seek this beer out at all costs. 2,026 charactersSynergy87, Apr 03, 2013

4.63/5  rDev -0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.5Finally got around to writing the full review of this guy. I'm glad I waited; now I have a full mode of comparison after trying some of, what I consider to be, the best iipas out there (DS, S&S4, Ephraim, and Abner). Beer pours hazy amber into a Duvel tulip. Has a slight red glow.
Heady is certainly aromatic, but it doesn't quite stack up to the others in this regard. For some reason, the nose is a tad muted. Notes of pineapple, mango, honey, and candi sugar. A bit of pine, but mostly citrus. I can almost smell that this is a Vermont ipa. What is it about these damn Vermont beers!? What's the secret!?
Taste is rich and just as delicious as the others. Where it falls sort is on complexity. I get a lot of sweetness from all of the tropical fruit flavors, but it isn't quite dry enough for my taste. I think it could be a tad more balanced with a bit less sweetness or more bitterness (which is such a ridiculous thing to say! This is Heady Topper!) Nonetheless, the flavor is brilliant and so tasty. 
Mouthfeel ranks up there with the rest. Creamy, medium-full bodied (especially for an iipa). Extra-drinkable. 
Overall, this falls just short of the aforementioned brews for me. However, it does edge out Pliny in my book. I get the hype and I love its [relative] accessibility. It's always a treat to drink this, and I plan to have some in my fridge as long as it's being brewed! 1,392 characterslunarbrew, Apr 02, 2013

5/5  rDev +7.5%Had it first from the can in VT, once more in PA.
As commonly stated, it doesn't look that impressive. Very pale and cloudy, decent head. For a beer this good, who cares?
Smells fruitier than some beers with actual fruit in them.  If this was sold as an air freshener, I would buy it.
The fruit comes through just as strong in the taste, very tropical and sweet balanced by steady bitterness throughout the whole sip. Some crisp, snappy malt comes through later in the glass after your tongue has numbed to the hops. 
Mouthfeel isn't terribly thick, but very oily, coating the tongue and leaving the flavors to chew on. Way, way too drinkable for an 8% beer, or for a beer you know you won't have again for months/years. 
I've had a number of beers that didn't live up to the hype. This one does. 796 charactersRichardMNixon, Apr 01, 2013

A - Aggressive pour into New Glarus Fat Squirrel pint yields a strong three finger head. Cloudy, peachy color persists.
S - Love the nose on a fresh IPA and this one about knocks me over. Intense floral nose. Grass. Something sweet. Just fantastic.
T - And there it is. I get sweet at first followed by a nicely balanced bitterness and perhaps a little alcohol at the end. Delicious. Though I do get a little alcohol I get the feeling I could drink quite a bit of this on a hot summer day. Subtly different from many of the IIPAs I've had. Not sure what that taste is but it's delicious.
M - Full. Almost a little creamy with just the right amount of carbination.
O - Fantastic. Very well balanced. Not overly hoppy. Just very well done. As advertised. 927 charactersZaximus, Mar 31, 2013

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I made it up to Waterbury last weekend and had my first (and 5th) Heady Topper on that visit. I went into the weekend figuring it couldn't be as good as all the hype. I also doubted whether drinking anything out of a can would be one of my best beer drinking experiences. I was blown away by how great this tasted and by how drinkable it was. I had a game plan to try the first one in the can (per the instructions on the can) and then try one in a glass so I could see what I was drinking...I scrapped this plan after tasting how good the first one was in the can. The rest of my tastes were directly from the can. Apparently there are only two places that serve this beer on draft (the brewery and the Prohibition Pig)....the rest of the places in town serve it in a can (when they can get it). 
Warning: we went up on a Friday night and it was very hard to find any stores (including the brewery) that had any for sale...only places that had it were bars and the rest of the places were waiting for the next release on Monday. Therefore, plan your trip for mid-week if you want to ensure you take some home.
I'm hoping the expansion of the cannery makes this beer more available....looking forward to the next one. 1,219 charactersmsondel, Mar 30, 2013

A: 1/2 finger of off-white head with good retention. Hazy/cloudy greenish orange. I'd like less cloudiness, but could it be as hoppy without this?
S: Juicy citrus and tropical fruit. Man Candy. Papaya, a lot of pine, slightly dank. Slight sulfurous allium. Slight esters in the finish are the only sign of alcohol in this beer.
T: Brilliant hops are quite bitter up front but stop shy of soapiness. Middle of the taste into the aftertaste is citrus and fruit from hope. The end is not punishingly bitter but is assertive. Delicious. New waves of hops cascade over each other, as opposed to many other DIPAs that build in estery quality as they warm. Perfect.
M: Bright, bitter, full but not chewy. Not hot or boozy at all for its 8%
O: A very good to great DIPA. Assertive hops and bitterness, little to no maltiness but full feeling. Fresh hop flavor with bold American character. 913 charactersdfillius, Mar 30, 2013

It's almost comical and whimsical if I had to think of fundamental words to describe it. When you first crack open the can, you get hit with a sledgehammer of aroma; notes of citrus and pine hit you hardest. With every sip, the bitterness provides for a lingering complexity that makes this beer unique.
I found myself laughing at the experience of the entire first can. Not sure how much of it was the reputation that preceded it, but I enjoyed every sip like a fat kid knee deep in chocolate cake. I only wish it was more easily accessible in NYC.

A- Pours a very hazy, luminescent orange liquid with a thin and creamy white head that settles to a splotchy covering. This would be perfect with a little more meat to the head.
S- Pungent fruits (mango, pineapple, tangerine), grass, mint, honey, and herbs. Astounding.
T- Bitter, fruity, sweet. All the aspects of the aroma are picked up in the flavor. Enough malt backing to keep the extremely bitter hops from spiraling out of control. Money.
M- Starts out exceedingly creamy and smooth but then the hops take over. This is one of the most bitter beers I can remember having.
O- Tastes extremely fresh, bitter, and fruity. Tastes "hand-made" without feeling even the slightest bit homebrew-y. I love that the alcohol content is kept in check. This is what it is all about. 818 charactersgordavidson, Mar 29, 2013

A- (I only poured a little at see what it looked like but most was enjoyed from the can, as instructed) Heady Topper pours a glowing, cloudy yellow/ orange with a nice, bubbly white head that is leaving moderate lacing. 
S- Big bursts of citrus in the nose! Lots of grapefruit and lemon with fantastic pine resonating. Not much malt to speak of here. The nose is pretty much exclusively dominated by the hops, and I'm perfectly okay with that. 
T-Holy shit! Huge wave of citrus in the beginning! It's crisp and biting and lip-smacking. There's an unexpected smokey character as well. It's faint but it's noticeable. All the hop resins are incredibly present and I can clearly see why the say to drink it from the can. The finish is resinous, tart, and bitter... but not overly bitter; it's just right. 
M- Just like the can says, so drinkable it's scary. I'm trying not to drink it too fast, as I only have one, but damn, this is so good. Medium to full bodied but still drinks with incredible ease. 
O- So good, just, just so so good. This beer has lived up to the hype for me. It is incredibly well crafted and incredibly delicious. Heady Topper is a powerful brew that doesn't over power you. I am so glad I got to try this and i absolutely cannot wait to have it again. 
Serving Type- 16oz can. Thank for reading. 1,390 charactersDoc_Hops, Mar 29, 2013

4.86/5  rDev +4.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5After much searching I finally got a can of this at The Churchville Inn. Poured into a tulip, a very hazy golden color with alot of hop sediment at the bottom of the glass. Left a nice two finger heading with soapy rings left over after every sip. A non-stop fizzing action from the bottom of the glass to the surface.
I'm getting alot of mango and tangerine at first. Solid piney hop notes with really no sugary or hot alcohol aroma's. Finishes with a pineapple touch of zestiness.
Taste is explosive... Hoppy resins attack the palate immediately, a second wave of a more tropical fruit and juicy flavors come into play. A final wave of a bitter hop lingers on the palate for a big green finish.
Medium bodied, excellent balance. Dry finish.
Not bad...not bad at all. A great balance of bitter hops,fruitiness and light malts. Not a heavy IPA and the alcohol is extremely well hidden. This rates in my top ten for IIPA's but numero uno in all styles ??? I don't know that's for you to decide.
Re-review 7/29. After a friend recently visted Vermont he bought a few cases of heady and wasn't all that greedy and let me have some. Anyway this stuff very fresh is amazing. I left it in the can a big no no for you beer geeks. LOL. All I can say is yes this is the best IIPA on the market today and yes beats my beloved hopslam. Embrace the hype !Tremendous beer. 1,364 charactersTheFightfan1, Mar 28, 2013

4.84/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75After receiving this in a generous pre-wedding gift-box of beers from a friend, I too neglected the bold warning to only drink this straight out of the can. I really wanted to see the beer I was drinking so I busted out a frosted mug for the occasion.
Appearance: A very pleasant golden-wheat color, not the alarming looking orange associated with some less subtle IPAs. As others have noted, there was quite a bit of particulate floating through the beer but I'm assuming that is part of its charm (and flavor).
Aroma: As much as a smell can be crisp, this was. Very up-front, fruity notes and you could sort of smell the bubbles over the top of the glass like you might with a fresh glass of champagne - speaks to the great carbonation of a can.
Taste: Oh man, oh man. After the first small sip I was really tempted to take a backyard PBR-sized gulp of this stuff - that crisp, pleasant hopped fruit taste was really the first wash of flavor and it had an excellent mouthfeel. I'll drink anything, but the IPAs that leave a bubblegum film aren't my thing; the Heady Topper does not have that. It's a clean flavor burst that then leaves you, as I said, ready for a nice big follow-up gulp. So many high-end beers aren't necessarily drinkable, this one is. In terms of other flavor notes, you could really pick out a dry, honey-ish malt flavor throughout and a not-quite lemon peel zestiness on the hop. It's quite possible I just made that up, but that's what comes to mind...
Great beer and, having grown up in VT, I can attest that Waterbury is a very worthy city (aka small village) of an IPA so great. Will look forward to a chance to sample again! 1,657 charactersluckyluke1184, Mar 28, 2013

I can see why they wanted me to though, because there was a ton of gnarly looking sediment in my glass when it was all said and done.
Aroma was really nice, but not quite as strong as I was expecting from reading all of the reviews and hearing from friends.
Great tasting IPA for sure, but not nearly as aggressive as most of the West Coast styles that I am accustomed to like Pliny, Green Flash, or Alpine.
Certainly a decent IPA, but it definitely doesn't deserve the hype it receives. I bet it would be far better on tap than in the can, but since I live at the complete opposite side of the country from where that could happen I will just settle for the little taste that I got.
Overall, there are far better IPA's and DIPA's out there, but this one is definitely worth a try! 893 charactersJRoth420, Mar 27, 2013

But all in all, most of the positive stuff you'll read and hear about it is true, so get up to VT and get you sum.
Aroma: hoppy, good mild cheddar cheese, pine. 
Froth: massive and abiding, beyond the empty glass. 
Color: cartoonishly gold, cloudy. 
Taste: hops balanced bitter to sweet, mild cheese, perfectly bittered, and balanced with malt. 
Texture: rich full balanced mouthfeel. 
Let's talk hops. They don't disclose what they are using, but there are several, which in combination, like 36, 24, 36, makes a winning hand. It tastes as packed with them as they claim. 
If you like hops, The Alchemist is making one Brick House of a beer-- it's the winning can, right on par with other hopped monsters, such as Tall Grass' 8 Bit, Half Acres' Daisy Cutter and FFF's Zombie Dust. 879 charactersEthanol4one, Mar 27, 2013

Poured a little into a glass for appearances. More caramel than anticipated.
Smell: sweet hops, grapefruit, floral.
Taste: definition of what and IPA should taste like. Citrus hop, slightly bitter but fades fast to a clean finish. Sweet like honey without being dominant.
Feel: smooth, light to medium-light. Great carbonation, not to the point of champagne or a Duvel by any means.
Overall: Has the right to hold down the top spot. Beautifully crafted, makes me want to plan a trip to Vermont so I can more. Simple but the complexities keep coming the more you drink it. More you drink, more you love it. 628 characterskguard, Mar 25, 2013

Poured into a snifter (will drink from the can next time)
Appearance: beautiful golden copper in color with a fairly large amount of sediment. A good amount of lacing as the sediment sits rather still during the session. Slight haziness. 
Smell: as soon as I started pouring it into the glass, an array of aromas hit me like no other beer ever has. Pineapple consumed me followed by grapefruit, lemon zest, tropical fruit, pine, and every citrus scent imaginable. Too complex for words!
Taste: all of the aromas above were ever present on the palate. Fresh hops and pine explode across your tongue after each sip. A very delightful bitterness and sweetness together follows each time swallowed. Wonderful to say the least!
Mouthfeel: light carbonation with a medium-bodied, viscous feel. Lighter in the mouth than I would expect from a DIPA which I thoroughly enjoyed. 
Overall: Surely lives up to the hype! I could only imagine what this tastes like on tap fresh from the brewery. I will have to consume the other three I have soon as not to lose any complexity this beer has to offer. 1,114 charactersCubatobaco, Mar 23, 2013

Reviewed live directly from the 16 fl oz can:
S - Vibrant fresh fruits including pineapple, mango, orange and grapefruit. The tropical fruit notes are fantastic. Light pale malt body. Juicy. It's moderate in strength but I'm certain there'd be more if I poured it. 
T - Fresh, raw floral hops notes open, followed by the juicy citrus and tropical fruits notes I'd found on the nose, though the grapefruit's the most dominate. I wish more of the pineapple was present. Woody/grassy hops on the finish provide a touch of bitterness. Caramel malts provide a sturdy backbone, but it's far from sweet. Impeccable balance, and the layering of the hops is superb. The alcohol's never present. This one's a real treat. 
M - Oily. Medium bodied, crisp, and a little thick. Pretty much perfect. 
D - The best IPA I've had, hands down. I could kill a few of these easily. Definitely a treat and I'm glad I was able to try it. 954 charactersblakelive784, Mar 22, 2013

A: Poured a hazy, copper color with two fingers of rapidly receding head. Large bubbles. This beer is a hazy mess with tons of floaters, but then again, with the amount of hops they use...
S: Amazing. Its a grapefruit and citrus explosion on the nose. If you think the beer smells good, you should walk into the cannery. It's like high diving into hop nirvana.
T: Again, I could list a single word to describe it. Amazing. Its all sexy citrus, grapefruit, and mango that dominate your tastebuds. A pleasant hop bitterness finishes it off.

Nose was citrus - grapefruit, mango and pineapple along with some pine, grassiness and floral elements. Taste followed with big citrus flavors, especially grapefruit and orange, but with a biscuity, caramel malt for balance. Bitterness was there but not overwhelming. It predominates in the aftertaste as well, along with pine oil and honey. Mouthfeel was medium and mildly carbonated. There is little to no alcohol burn. I can understand why so many people love this beer…it was great…just not my all-time favorite, as it is for so many. 625 charactersregspeir, Mar 17, 2013

T - I would like to use some of the descriptors that I've been seeing in other reviews, but this doesn't really taste like any of the pine/citrus/dank/floral combination that I've seen before. It's unique among the IPAs that I've tasted thus far.
M - Again unique among what I have had so far. Even a small sip seems to fill my mouth with waves of goodness.

If you were to break the rules and not "drink it IMMEDIATELY out of the can" you end up with a foggy IPA with chunks of hop pellets to chew on while they add to the hoppiness. As it sits, the trub gathers as gravity wins the battle to the bottom of my glass. Don't get me wrong, the hop particles that are suspended add a decent profile to the beer, but at what cost? I think it would be great as a "harvest IPA" if vegetal matter was the intention but there are another 11.5 months to use your hops in that case. 
To me it seems like an unkept hop room. Interesting, nice, and Hoppy with some funkiness growing somewhere. I know from reading the can before I drink it I need to follow rules. I broke them all. I think that any homebrewer can create an equitable beer with a draft keggery and one weeks time. 
J&J's Robust Porter in their restaurant was much better for my dollar and I just don't see what all the hubub is about. I think they should concentrate on making beer instead of money but I appear to be in the minority here. I do like the beer but know for a fact that there is more talent behind the curtain. 1,204 charactersmindfulmead, Mar 16, 2013

The appearance is, well, ugly, but with a certain sense of unique beauty, if that makes sense. I can see why they tell you to drink from the can- the beer has little floaty particles moving in suspension all around. It looks straight up rustic and earthy, like I am looking at pure liquid hops.
 I poured half the beer into a glass and drank half from the can- it really does taste better from the can!
The aroma is mind-blowing. This is the best smelling beer I have ever had. It's like an orange, a grapefruit and a tangerine punched me right in the face.
The taste was just as good. It feels like I'm drinking a liquid joint dumped into a glass of orange pineapple juice. The hops just keep coming in strong waves of flavor- it just never stops. I've only had this super-fresh, I can imagine the hop flavor lasts a while here.
The body is full enough to match the hop assault (hopsault?).
A truly amazing beer. 1,077 charactersGreesyFizeek, Mar 15, 2013

A - Golden orange and very hazy with a big 3 finger white head that went to the very top and peaked over my tulip. Great retention and loads of foamy lacing cling to teh glass. Who says this doesn't look perfect!?
S - So you like big juicy hops? Piney and bitter citrus hops are the show of this beer. I get some tropical and light sweetness. The smell is incredible. 
T - Yum, yum, yum! Waves and waves of hops coat my palate. Pine hops, bitter citrus hops, and even slight notes of tropical hops. A subtle sweetness peeks in every now and then, but the hops push it back. This is a dream to drink. 
M - Full bodied and sticky with awesome carbonation. It is insane how easy this is to drink!
O - It is fantastic and worth seeking out IMO. I'll score it as a perfect, because I enjoy it so much. 835 charactersRi0, Mar 14, 2013

This can was poured into my new Heady Topper glass ("Drink from the can", my ass!). This beer always pours a nice hazy, orange-ish color, with a bit of sticky head -- but you shouldn't worry about this, as you will most certainly be enjoying it from the can :)
The beer literally smells like fruit juice. Think of a grapefruit/pineapple/mango concoction, or something of the like. You will notice nothing more than this and the resinous, piney hops in the nose.
There is a distinct earthy, organic quality to Heady, but the more up-front flavors are the citrus & hops (obviously). It is juicy on the tongue, with light carbonation and a very clean finish. Tons and tons of grapefruit and pine in this one. I know reading this review makes it seem somewhat two dimensional, what with all the citrus and hop flavors. But really, are you looking for anything else in a DIPA? If you are looking for a malt bomb, GTFO.
Overall, this may be the best DIPA I have tasted, although I am not sure I will ever make that decision concrete. I constantly waver when it comes to my favorites, but this is definitely one of them. If you like hoppy beer and have the opportunity to try Heady, do it. You will not be let down, as it is one of the best examples of its style in existence, in my humble opinion. 1,411 charactersbrother_kenneth, Mar 14, 2013

Can't say much about the appearance because I drank it out of the can (like you are supposed to) but I could smell a plethora of earthy spice, as well as crisp grapefruit and dank moss all at once. 
The first sip really throws you on your ass, so I recommend sitting down. I can't even explain it really, its just a beautiful array of almost too-much goodness, but crafted in a way that expands over your palate and changes and grows as you drink the beer.
I recommend getting it fresh - which is really the only way you can get it, they sell out at their cannery the day of canning usually!! I also can't contain my pride and excitement that it is from Vermont. 836 charactersktblue22, Mar 12, 2013

A: Clearish, milky, hazy, with light white head and sticky lace. But I suppose it's irrelevant since most of it is in the can.
S: Fresh-cut grass, tangerine and honeysuckle, rich and sweet and delectable.
T: Okay. Yeah. It lives up to the hype. If I could get this regularly, I would drink it almost exclusively. It's perfectly balanced...complex, fresh hops; sweetish, alluring, honeyish malt; crisp, clean, lingeringly citric-bitter finish. There is nothing bad to say about this beer, but it's not overwhelmingly delicious.
M: It's so creamy! Rich and luxuriant and rewarding.
O: If you can drink this beer, absolutely do so. It's maybe the best IPA I've ever had (though the first batch of Mikkeller's Invasion IPA could give it a run for its money). Not as fruity as perhaps I'd like, but it avoids any 'off' quality that hugely popular (D)IPAs (e.g., Pliny the Younger) seem to share. 1,032 charactersAgentMunky, Mar 12, 2013

While bot were outstanding beers they were very different. I'll focus on the heady as we just couldn't believe All the hype. Smell out of the can was amazing couldn't believe this was a can, poured a bit, sunshine orange you expect from a unfiltered ipa not that dark. First sip begs another. Holy Moly this was good . Was expecting a letdown after the hype nope outstanding. Big citrus up front, wow second sip brought the earthiness pine grass, not nearly as big of a hop blast as expected. Was very impressed. I like unfiltered beer, my stomach not so much. But wow just wow 750 charactersRockinhippo, Mar 10, 2013

Pours a very light straw/orange color with a finger of white head. Sticky walls of lace.
The nose is full of dank, oily, hop resins. Pineapple, mango, apricot, guava. In-your-face with a V8 Splash of tropical fruits. The ABV comes in modestly with a big quaff. 
Yes! Absolutely living up to the hype here! (completely ignore the review below. Must have been an old can). The cornucopia of fruits noticed in the nose explodes on the palate and really is more like a fruit juice. There is only a bit of sharpness towards the end of each sip which makes this one easy drinking. 
The mouthfeel is crisp with medium carbonation. Clean and refreshing.
Overall, this was worth the wait and has all of the components I look for in a DIPA. Seek it! 753 charactersChugginOil, Mar 08, 2013

S-the smell of Heady is just gorgeously perfect, smells of piney citrusy freshness, Nuff Said!!
T-The taste of Heady is not what I expected but more, Taste's of citrus, pine, and even a faint taste of honey. Very refreshing and palatable and not dry or overly bitter by any means
M-The mouthful is great for a beer of this ABV, I honestly can't believe its that smooth. First tastes are of pine and earth with a sweet aftertaste of citrus fruits and I still get a honey taste!
O-This beer definitely deserves all the hype! I have tried multiple double IPA's and none go down quiet as smooth as this one, but some are very close! 829 charactersCOWHAWK, Mar 07, 2013

Overall: Really happy to have found this. When I think of the best IPAs I have had, I think of Pliny, Hill Farmstand's Double Galaxy, and Mama Masala. I personally would choose any of those over this one as my favorite IPA. That said, the shear raw hoppiness of this one merits that it is in the discussion of the best. This one is a delightfully hoppy beer, but not one that kills you with high intensity, more like a gradual roll up of juicy flavors. I appreciate the complexity and quality flavor without the excessive bitterness. I would get this again if I can find it. Well worth the hype. 976 characterstigg924, Mar 04, 2013

Smell is out of this world. Freshly opened bag of hops. Tangerines, mangos, and lemon grass.
Taste follows the nose but emphasises the citrus and grassy notes instead of the tropical aromas. Sweetness gives way to a dry finish.

I sampled this a few weeks ago, and really wanted to NOT like this beer so much. But that is impossible. Anyone who likes beer would fall in love with this...
From the can into a tasting balloon glass. Thanks to monitorpop for this beer!
The beer is a muddy unfiltered ochre color topped by a massive off-white head that stays around for a long time and leaving its scarred lacing all over the glass. Not the prettiest of beers, but what's appearance when you taste this good right?
The aroma is just overwhelmingly filled with fresh hops. It reminds me of when I was on a tour of Victory Brewing Company, and walked into their hop cooler. It is just fresh, juicy hops in every direction. Filled with notes of fresh pine, peaches, and mango.
The flavor is of hops thrown in a blender and pureed. Mild bitterness, like a pale ale, but with more hop flavor that expected in a double IPA. Solid solid beer. Floral, citrus/tropical fruit, pine and lightly sweet malts in the background. But the hops just dominate the flavor and aroma. There is zero hint of alcohol in this beer.
The mouthfeel is smooth, almost creamy in nature. Robust body, but not too heavy. This beer does an amazing job of covering up the alcohol. Only a slight bite midway through the sip indicates any abv at all. 
I can't believe how tasty this IPA really is. As a DIPA, I think this does so well because the abv is not crazy high and yet it delivers just a fresh punch of hops. I would 100% purchase a case of this beer. In fact, I will probably now make that trip north this month if possible. I mean, what a fantastic beer. I wanted to hate it because no one likes the hype train, but this beer has earned its stripes in my opinion. Highly recommended...thank you again to monitorpop for the chance to review this beer!! 1,925 charactersMusicaleMike, Mar 02, 2013

Appearance: This time around, it's N/A. BA obviously wanted this field filled in above so I did so accordingly.
Aroma: The aroma on this bad boy is very floral and fruity. I get hints of pineapple, mango, and pine. This beer smells AWESOME! 
Taste: This beer is just as it is described on its label. It's not super over powering, it just provides you with unrelenting hoppy flavors. This beer is well balanced and just like the can says, very drinkable. After each sip, it leaves you with a slight bit of dryness with lingering hop flavor.
Mouthfeel: The mouthfeel on this beer is solid. It's also very smooth and refreshing. 
Overall, this beer is out of this world! It's no wonder that this beer has 100 scores on BeerAdvocate. Cheers! 962 characterstroegaarden, Mar 02, 2013

The label is that of a bearded scientist chugging a beer with his hair bursting with hop buds. It's something you need to see for yourself. The back of the can has a lengthy paragraph about the beer and the Government warning. A brewed on or canned on date would have been very helpful. Poured into a Cycle Brewing Snifter. 
Out of the can came an Imperial IPA that was pale golden amber in color with a small tint of lemon yellow at the bottom. There's gold in this beer. Not the precious metal. Hop gold!There was a ton of hop particles floating around this beer. The writing on the can warned me of the hop particles, but toward the bottom of the can. This is from the top of the can and there is already a huge amount of hop particles. I didn't get much a head of foam on this beer. I got a small skim of foam that was about 1/4 of an inch in height and paper white in color. Fast retention that left behind a miniature string of rings along the side. If I was lucky, maybe a spot or two around the glass. The head of foam wasn't much to look out, but I loved the hop particles. 
As soon as I popped the lid, the strong aroma of pine came pouring out. It was so strong that I almost thought I popped the cap on a bottle of Pine Sol. It's drinking time. Not cleaning time. Not only was the pine strong, but the fruits as well. It had a wide range of citrus and exotic fruits. I smelled grapefruit, mango, lemon, orange, pineapple, and even tangerine. Smelled like a top notch fruit punch. The hops in the aroma were on the grassy side with a whiff citrus hops. No malt backbone in the aroma. The pine and the wide variety of fruits covered it up. I could live without the malts in the aroma. I loved the pine and fruits. Nice! 
The taste came out swinging! The strong taste of pine and grapefruit comes washing in like a hurricane on my taste buds. It was all of those hop particles in the appearance that did that. The front of the taste housed all the pine, grapefruit, lemon, orange, tangerine, and grassy/citrus hops. Then all the hops and fruits settled down and the beer then finishes up with a nice malty backbone. The malts were kicked out of the aroma, but they made a nice appearance in the taste. No doubt about it. This was a great taste. Not overly hoppy, but hoppy enough to keep hop heads entertained. If they didn't like the hops, they were sure to enjoy the malt backbone. Not much more you can ask for from an Imperial IPA. 
It was light to medium bodied with a nice not overly hoppy aftertaste. This hoppy aftertaste doesn't linger. You won't need a gallon of water to get rid of the hoppy taste in the back of your mouth. Despite being an 8% ABV Imperial IPA, this is a highly drinkable beer. It also helps that it comes in a can and it's a year round beer and not a once in a blue moon type of beer that you need to trade your first born for. Would I drink it again? I would if I could find a steady supply of it. I have to thank my good friend Vince for hooking me up with this treat. 3,068 charactersAltBock, Feb 27, 2013

This is my last can from my first Heady haul, so I finally am reviewing this! I poured a small amount into a snifter for appearance and aroma purposes, but it drinks better from the can IMO.
A- Pours a hazy orangish yellow/straw color with a medium sized white head of tight, sticky bubbles.
S- The aroma is wonderful, with loads of thick, dank hops assaulting your nose! There's tons of rich nectar and pine resin present, tropical fruits, tangerine, and fresh cut grass. Some malt backbone can also be detected, which is a bit more bready than caramelly.
T- The first, and most interesting thing noticed about the taste and mouthfeel is how juicy it is. It's almost as if they made "hope juice" rather than beer! The flavor mostly follows the nose, with pine and tangerine dominating, though not in an unbalancing way. I do wish there was a bit more tropical fruit in the flavor, but this is only a minor complaint!
M- The mouthfeel is medium to thick, and again juicy, almost pulpy. The oily hop resins coat the mouth and leave a moderately bitter aftertaste.
- Overall this is an outstanding beer, and one of the best representations of the style! Just be sure to drink it within ~2-3 weeks of canning. 1,245 charactersSadMachine, Feb 25, 2013
4.78/5  rDev +2.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Pint can, 1/2 drank from can, 1/2 poured into a tulip. Probably about a month old, so could be fresher.
A - golden/orange with lots of sediment bits floating around. Man I hope things go well tomorrow.
S - Floral/piney dankness that you get from most double IPAs, Some slight tropical fruits and mango from the can. I let the tulip warm up a bit, and more of the fruits come out. 
M - Medium bodied with good carbonation. Crisp and clean, with a slight dryness. The hoppy bitterness comes out followed by the fruits. Fruity sweetness but not the malty sweetness that turns me off of a lot of double IPAs.
O - Great double IPA, which is my favorite type of beer. First east coast IIPA that meets its hype. I guess I'm more of a fan of the west cost IIPAs. It is different from the bigger pure hop bombs, and I would say have more character. Not sure that its tops, but its probably in my top 3 that would take turns with each other. 935 charactersgrrrah, Feb 25, 2013

Incredible aroma hops hops hops, most aromatic beer I've ever smelt.
First sip and...nice...not too bitter, not too floral, just the right balance of sweet, citrusy hops. 
Nice finish, but as I progress into the can, the bitterness begins to build up a bit.
Overall, I loved this beer. Do I think it lived up to the epic hype? Probably not, they never do. It was an incredible IPA, maybe not the best I've ever had though. Does make me wish I lived in VT. 623 charactersbeagle826, Feb 22, 2013

Left some lace behind.
S: mostly hoppy (as expected): floral, herbal, citric, resinous; sublte pale malt in the background
T: again, hop-forward: lots of bitter citrus (is that a contradiction in terms?) and resiny pine; a little tart; bitter not sweet - some undercurrents of honey'd malt; some medicinal notes
M: crisp, slight tartness, bittering, light-to-medoim weight, moderate carbonation on the tongue
O: a good DIPA, but the best, #1 ranked beer on the site? I don't agree. I've had too many great DIPAs and IPAs to jump onboard here (*ducks the hurled vegetables and garbage*). I'd say its a good buy, a MUST try, but nothing to lose sleep over if its not available in your area. 961 charactersGreywulfken, Feb 19, 2013

Great appreciation goes out to SatlyMalty for this excellent surprise! Poured into a snifter (screw what the can says). The code on the can is apparently not a freshness date.
A- Pours a hazy amber color with a 1/2 inch beige head that retains well before becoming an 1/8 inch ring around the edge of the glass and a light sheet of surface foam. Semi-resilient lacing slides down the glass. Once the can is emptied into the glass, little specs of sediment are suspended in the body. 
S- The hop aroma has a remarkable balance of citrus and pine but mostly citrus with bursting notes of pineapple, mango and guava. Also has a sweetness from the malts making this pretty perfect, smell-wise.
T- The flavor has much of the same: piney, earthy bitterness with a tropical fruit kick to compliment. Alcohol is well-hidden but still present and there's a graininess to the relatively sturdy malt backbone. The bitterness is stronger than I expected but is also welcome. Good hop burps. The sweetness of the malt is picked up more as the beer warms. Incredibly drinkable, even when warm.
M- A bit dry and prickly from the hops. Medium carbonation and a solid body.
O- Not as amazing as Zombie Dust IMO, but still easily one of the top 5 IPAs I've ever had. I really must say that it's a travesty to encourage the buyer to drink this from the can since the aroma is so sublime. Oh well, he has his reasons. 1,453 charactersImmortale25, Feb 15, 2013

*First and foremost, Raul has to grade this review with an asterisk because Raul was sicker than a hound dog after eating a fried peanut butter and banana sandwich for 10 days or so, so the Heady's sat in the fridge for awhile. So without further ado...
Good, but not great. Raul was simply reminded of a Racer 5 - and Raul likes him some Racer 5 - but he don't get Cialis excited over it like he was for Heady.
Smooth, but it had a slightly astringent aftertaste. Raul does not approve.
Raul is pumped on life, but not too much on Heady.
Peace!
*Overall, Raul graded this a 3.79. But then he tried it out of the can which changed things and made it necessary for a re-review.
Quite simply: boom went the dynamite! All of a sudden, more flavor came out; the beer was tastier, smoother, and overall, insanely drinkable.
Mass props to the Maple State. 881 charactersRaulMondesi, Feb 14, 2013

Type: 16oz. Can
Glass: Southampton Large Tulip (I know this is against the rules, per the can!)
Canned: 01/15/2013 *Pretty fresh, but not uber fresh.
I cannot believe it took me this long to get around to sampling the mighty Heady Topper! Ranked #1 in the world on BA, only one way to find out the truth. Thanks to BA ajfa531 (Joe) for providing me this 16oz. can to sample.
Poured this brew from the can into a Southampton large tulip glass, breaking the rules written on the can, in order to give a more accurate review of appearance and nose. Future samples will be consumed straight from the can in accordance w/ the rules.
Poured a burnt orange to light brown mahogany in color w/ a skim coat white head that produced light lacing. I did not realize this brew had huge amounts of remaining yeast in the can that soon entered the glass due to me pouring it too quickly. Aromas of pine, grapefruit, and citrus fruits (mandarin orange, cantelope, and nectarine). The flavor started off w/ big, sweet citrus flavors of mandarin orange/grapefruit in your face, transitioning to a blast of piney bitterness, finishing with floral notes. Medium bodied and lush w/ moderate carbonation that suits the beer well. Drinkability? I was done with the 16oz. can & starting the 2nd before I even finished writing out the review. Insane!
Overall, this beer is the truth! What can I say? This is dank, hoppy, awesomeness in a can! I now understand why this is currently ranked #1 in the world in all style categories. Take Pliny The Elder as good as it is and kick it up a notch & you have Heady Topper. The only reason it is not possible for this beer to attain a perfect score is due to the fact that it is by far the ugliest DIPA one will ever encounter. However, the ugliness grows on you and it works. Not only does the brew taste like all of the flavors that could possibly be extracted from a hop flower, but it is brewed so well that there is not very much bitterness at all. Crazy stuff! 2,005 charactersmikeyv35, Feb 14, 2013

s: wow, this pops with juicy hops. like being in an orange grove at harvest time. maybe some mango or other tropical fruit along with some fresh green notes ala citrus leaves. despite what the brewer says the aroma cums thru way more via proper glassware than from the can. i forgive him for this.
t: follows through. juicy, juicy, fresh fruity hops. not the overripe kind either-like peeling a great orange. honey sweet malts provide just enough to support these beautiful hops. finishes somewhat clean and definitely more-ish.
m: just over medium-bodied but very crushable. i want to pound this but restrain myself to small sips. carbonation is perfect. so, so smooth for a dipa. hardly any astringency and no sharp bitterness.
o: lives up to the hype. will continue to trade anything for this. em me w/trade offers anytime.
update: this fades fast for being in a can-the little floaties get bigger and darker. the fresh hops quickly turn to the overripe fruit/banana thing. still good but a different animal after a few weeks. 1,236 charactersMrMcGibblets, Feb 14, 2013

And... This beer looks bad. Everyone knows this. Turgid, beyond cloudy dull light orange color. Visually, looks like a bad homebrew hefeweizen.
But... Also as anyone who has had Heady knows... That's really the only thing wrong with this brew. Passing the appearance, one gets to the nose. The big, loud, glorious hoppy nose. Loads of sharp, bright citrus notes all over the place. A nice earthy resinous character to the aroma as well. All hops and loads of them on the nose.
As soon as you're done taking in the nose- which can be a while- you move on to the flavor. The payday. The real deal. And what a deal. The promise of the aroma is entirely and completely delivered on. Hops, hops, and more hops. Hefty, rather aggressive bitterness that starts right up front and lasts to the finish. Loads of citrus on the flavor... with a good bit of pine resin and dirty sharp earthy action. Nothing significant in terms of malt sweetness to distract from the brilliant hop profile. 
mouthfeel... Yeah, it's fine. Clean enough, big bitterness that sticks on the finish. Moderate carbonation. Enough weight to make this beer noticeable without being overbearing.
Overall... Superb. What a DIPA should be... But with a more interesting and unique hop character than most. Shit, give it a quick filter to clean up the appearance, and you've easily got one of the absolute best DIPAs brewed now. 1,607 charactersjacksback, Feb 13, 2013

Appearance- orange-ish in color, large amount of floaties in the glass. Not the prettiest beer in the world.
Smell- Pure citrus hops, mainly get simcoe on the nose
Taste- More citrus, grapefruit up front with a lemon lime aftertaste
Mouthfeel- Kinda numbs the tongue a little with the hop blast, alcohol is pretty much completely hidden.

This is a hoppy beer, but not one that makes you choke. John Kimmich, the brewer, has somehow taken an extremely hoppy beer and made it so palatable that even people who don't typically like IPA's can enjoy it. I miss the Alchemist of old (Wild Child, Holy Cow, Ouroboros, etc) and hope that Kimmich decides to can those in the future. You can't go wrong with the Alchemist. 459 charactersdevilheels, Feb 08, 2013

The beer pours a dark and cloudy orange with white head. The beer leaves some nice white lacing.
Smell:
Orange and grapefruit hop notes strongly dominate the nose with bits of caramel malt coming up.
Taste:
Strong hop taste upfront and leaves a bitter aftertaste. There are also slight hints of malt to balance out the hops and keeps it from being too overwhelming.
Mouthfeel:
Medium bodied with biting carbonation. Also the feel is a little bit syrupy.

A very good Double IPA. My only regret is not drinking this fresher. 547 charactersHattedClassic, Feb 08, 2013

Smells fantastic, looks good enough, but it just doesn't taste as good as other IPAs I've had. I hope to give it another shot soon. It probably tastes better than I'm giving it credit for, I think I just got my expectations too high...you know for the #1 rated beer here. 384 charactersraydogfresh, Feb 06, 2013

Free the hops snifter
A- golden light amber. Hazy but massive dry hopping causes haze. Small head
S- wonderful hop burst. Definitely pickup american hops citrussy resinous but balanced by earthy maybe piney background
T-awesome. Hop heavy but not overly bitter as many others are. Malt backbine to support hops but not overpower them. 
M-good carbonation not excessive but enough to be effervescent and release the hops.
O-wonderful beer. Top iipa i have tried. Unfiltered is the only way to do iipa's. Will love to get my hands n more. 555 charactersnedvalton, Feb 01, 2013

A: cloudy and resiny amber liquid and very minimal cream colored head. A ridiculous amount of solutes floating around and settling at the bottom of the glass.

T: the taste came in three waves. First wave of lemon, grass and aspirin. Second wave of earth, leaves and grapefruit. Third wave of lemon and oranges.
M: thick resinous viscosity and a medium level of carbonation.
O: a religious experience. I keep coming back for another palate wrecking sip of wave after wave of citrus and forest hop flavors. 583 charactersDaftCaskBC, Feb 01, 2013

Canned beer with a message "Drink from the Can" on it and you know you have a brewer with a sense of humor. If I did that than how do I know what the true appearance is? Pour it into a glass and see the beautiful iridescent orange and a bright white head.
The scent is pungent, strong and pure hops. 
The taste is so incredibly interesting that I truly can't articulate what I found. No citrus, just pure hop flavor. No complexities, per se, but the hops flavors are diverse within themselves. It's as if you taste each and every hop variety yet its perfectly blended. If my palate were talented enough I believe I could name each hop variety this is so distinct. This is a truly special IPA! 727 charactersKYGunner, Feb 01, 2013

A: I poured this once and remember it being really cloudy and not very pretty. It says drink it out of the can so I am doing it, therefore I can't see the beer. The can is beautiful though.
S: Smells of citrus and fruit initially and finishes with a pine bite. 
T: A great piney flavor at first, followed by an amazing assortment of tropical fruits. 
M: Good even carbonation that helps aid in the piney bite you taste. 
O: Currently ranked the #1 beer in the world and I can not disagree. There are a few beers that I would consider perfect, and this is one of those. Perfect example of a delicious DIPA. 657 charactersDavihaw, Jan 31, 2013

4.7/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75Thanks to Ataraxia, I finally get a chance to slay this one! The directions say "drink from the can" but, at least for the first one, I have to pour it out and get a good look at it. Pours a golden-orange color, some straw around the very edges - mostly opaque and hazy. Many people bring up the unadulterated, unfiltered look of Heady Topper, though mine doesn't have the liberal amounts of sediment that would showcase this. Rather it appears quite clean, with maybe a tiny bit of very small particles that have seemingly vanished five minutes into this one. Either way, a nice looking beer with a super foamy, just-off-white head that leaves pretty tremendous lacing atop the glass. 
The aroma - simply fantastic. It's fruity, all right. Huge amounts of grapefruit, mango, pineapple, citrus. Very interesting - the fruit has a nice, pithy aroma along with the typical component of juicy, tropical sweetness. Despite being so vibrant and powerful, it's almost difficult to say the fruit component "stands out", seeing as how the hops are nearly just as amped up. Heavy, heavy pine, super slick and resinous oils, grassy and floral, with a dank weed aroma following it all up. The bitterness can be spotted from the nose, but is combated by the fruity goodness. Definitely one of the most unique smelling beers out there, the aroma is doing nothing but getting me excited to finally bring this one to my lips.
HT glides through my palate; across my tongue and against every corner of my mouth, with a medium, slick body, pumped full of carbonation. The flavors explode all at once, like a time bomb of hop-filled citrus fruits going off inside my jaws. From the fruit-side of things, you've got the intense grapefruit, pineapple, mango, and some other tropical fruit that is hard to identify, but clearly stands out - I want to say maybe guava? Either way, very tropical and exploding with fruit. "Juicy" would be a good way to describe the fruit profile. Mouth-watering juiciness. 
But it doesn't stop there, just like in the aroma, the hops match the fruit on the palate as well; thick and heavily resinous hop oils cascade over your taste buds, pine needles left and right, wet, dank weed, grass, flowers and intense floral flavors. Bitterness is abound and definitely resounding far into the aftertaste. The malts bring a bready and somewhat sweet character to the table, but don't do much else than that. From a DIPA this highly acclaimed, though, you don't really expect much from the malt, do you? Super bitter, piney, resinous, and citrus peel-y aftertaste. 
Guuuhh. Well all you people certainly weren't kidding. Heady Topper is a delicious fucking beer and if I was in Vermont, it's probably all I would drink. How does it compare to my other favorite hop monsters, like Pliny the Elder, Hopslam, or DRIPA? Well, it'd be hard to say whether I like HT "better" than any of them, because despite being a Double IPA, it is still vastly discernible from the rest. Nevertheless, the acclaim Heady Topper receives is deserved - this beer is fantastic. A true hop-head's wet dream. Next time, I will drink from the can. 3,127 characterstectactoe, Jan 31, 2013

Flecks of barley and vegetable matter float all around the beer. Juicy grapefruit with some pine on the nose. ONce the beer settles, sweeter fruit breaks through. Grapefruit up front then grass and pine emerge. But, the flavor suddenly falls of a cliff for an abrupt finish. Alcohol and unami get picked up right away and pervade throughout. The mouthfeel is a little thin for the style. It dries a little toward the finish. Pretty big disappointment. Pliny, Abrasive, Sucks, all way superior in my opinion. 584 charactersDocJitsu, Jan 31, 2013

O: Many have questioned recently if Heady is still worthy of being mentioned in hushed tones and revered as an exemplar and progenitor of the most dominant current substyle. Let it be known that Heady is everything it ever was, and revisiting it has only solidified its laudability for me. It is a different style than the Trilliums and Treehouses of the world, but it is no less impressive, and in general is even better put together and complete. It has every aspect one could ask for from hops: juicy tropical fruit, pine resin, dankness, spice, and earthiness. The mouthfeel is its main stumbling block, but everything else is brilliant. For me personally, Focal is better (though it is a single IPA to Heady's IIPA). Heady is also just a little sweet to my palate personally, but it is right where an IIPA should be. Long live The Alchemist. Long live Heady Topper. Pair with Gorguts "Colored Sands," which of course stands slightly in the shadow of "Obscura," but excels in different ways. 4.75/5
The Alchemist Heady Topper
A: This quasi-legendary brew pours a pale, almost pilsner-like golden orange but much cloudier. The beer is almost entirely opaque and the yeast floaters are everywhere. Upon the initial pour there is a finger and a half of nearly pure white head. It has decent retention, but nothing spectacular. The lacing is spotty and there are no alcohol legs. I have never seen such plentiful sediment in a beer before. It is not a perfect appearance, but it is extremely close.
A: Outrageous. This is everything it should be, based on the hype. Grapefruit is incredibly pungent, backed up by a cornucopia of tropical fruits. Orange, pineapple, mango, tangerine, peach, lemon, rinds of all sorts, there may even be a bit of pear here. The diversity is astounding, and is backed up by a slight malty sweetness and a ton of yeast, which should be expected based on the visual. The hops are, as evidenced by the can art and the reputation that precedes the beer, the star of the show, and are juicy to the point of impossibility. This is perfection.
T: Follows the taste to a “T”, with a clean, slight, and sweet malt bill. The yeast shows up just slightly as well, but it only supports the brilliance of the hops. Every tropical fruit imaginable with brilliant hop bitterness and astringency, plenty of rind, and outrageous juiciness. Taste-wise, this could be a tropical fruit smoothie, and blindfolded, the drinker would have no idea. The aftertaste is so perfectly clean and evanescent that the drinker must constantly keep drinking to keep the taste in his or her mouth. Again, perfection.
M: Perfectly carbonated, just syrupy and thick enough to keep from being watery, but thin enough to be ridiculously refreshing, and with great astringency. The 8% ABV is slightly warming. This is the height of IIPA (and beer in general) mouthfeels.
Overall: Why…Why God? Why must The Alchemist be based in Vermont and have an extremely small distribution range? The drinkability and refreshment paired with the brilliant hop profile and clean, sweet malt bill make this the stuff a hophead’s dreams are made of. The necessity to continue drinking to keep the taste in my mouth makes this akin to meth. This is beer meth. Get addicted. 19.5/20 3,276 charactersTHANAT0PSIS, Jan 30, 2013

Fresh 16oz can poured into a tulip (what's the big deal about all the "DRINK FROM THE CAN" stuff anyway?) a super hazy, almost totally opaque pastel orange with an initial 2 finger bright white head that recedes quickly to a ring that leaves moderate lacing. A little hop sediment is visible floating around. Great looking beer. 
Basically a tropical and stone fruit hops explosion in the nose. Big grapefruit and grapefruit rind, blood orange, mango, peach, and some earthy, dank herbal hops with a slight hint of sweet caramel malts. Truly remarkable aroma...I wish they made Heady Topper air fresheners. I could just smell this all day. 
The dank, piney hops give a nice kick in the mouth in the front, but quickly gives way to huge, juicy citrus; mango, grapefruit, orange, pineapple, maybe even some slight apple and pear, a little lemon zest. Sweet caramel malts kick in towards the finish, giving this nuclear hop bomb great balance. Leaves a beautiful, sweet, juicy hop aftertaste with just a touch of bitterness. There's so much citrus that there seems to be an almost tart-like note to the beer, like fresh grapefruit dusted with sugar (which also happens to be one of my favorite fruits). Just straight up delicious. 
Smooth, creamy mouthfeel with moderate carbonation. Velvety and inviting. 
I'm always interested in seeing if the beer lives up to the hype when it comes to "whales" like Heady. In this case, Alchemist deserves all the praise it gets. Enjoy By DIPA by Stone has just been replaced. Beautiful hop bouquet, great looking and even better tasting. Amazing hop depth with just the right amount of bitterness (which is quite low for a DIPA). Alchemist really needs to start distributing outside of VT! Best beer in the whole world? Not sure about that, but best DIPA and one of the best beers I've ever had? Indeed. So glad I have 4 more of these. 1,941 characterscjoc83, Jan 28, 2013

A - The can says to drink it straight from the can, and I'll agree that tuis is the best way to do it. But I've poured it into a glass as well, and the appearance is a murky orange semi opaque appearance with a medium density head. Looks like somebody blended up some orange slices in a beer.
S - best smelling beer I've ever encountered. Tropical pineapple mango citrus goodness. Smells like a juicy bunch of tropical fruit.
T - largely follows the nose. Pineapple is a dominant flavor. First and only beer where I've really been able to pick that out. Lots of tropical and citrus notes. Tangerine, mango, orange. Just the slightest hint of bitterness. Perfect.
M - medium carbonation, nice presentation of oily hops, leaves plenty on the palate for copious amounts of aftertaste.
O - the best IPA I've ever had, period. 899 charactersBeerandboards, Jan 28, 2013

I do not really know what to say or explain the comparison. Heady Topper is a magnificent massive hop bomb that is amazingly balanced. This brew is World Class and lives up to the hype. I will now travel to Vermont to get more!!! I could drink these one after another enjoying every sip....really just an amazing beer! The bottom line is this is a World Class, top notch, killer IPA that leaves you wanting more.
I drank it from the can as instructed and WOW! just crazy good! The alcohol is so well hidden that Waldo couldn't find it.

L. Pours a dense hazed yet bright yellow/gold body. Very bright even for an IPA yet there's clearly a LOT of yeast left in here. This looks big and dense, it looks wonderful. Though I guess I should be looking at a silver can according to said can.
S. Tropical fruits are just blowing this one up. There's a slight and I mean slight alcohol note in here, but beyond that this is one of the smell well balanced aromas I've ever smelled. It hits the line between sweet and tropical fruits in a way that neither seems too strong nor too light. You really have to experience this to fully grasp how perfect it is.
T. Best hoppy beer ever made? Well, that's always a hard one to claim, but we're talking upper upper level. Head-topper doesn't attempt to blow you away with bitterness, instead it nails once again a perfect middle ground that is simply out of this world. A mix of citrus hops with intense passion fruit and pine apple all pushed to perfection with a malt bill that dreams are made of. 
M. 8% is so perfect for this kind of beer. Strong enough to give it intense flavors, but no so strong that an over abundance of hops and malt are needed to balance it all out. This one goes down like the liquid candy it is. 
O. I love deadnaught. I love Pliny. I don't think either are this good. This is easily one of the best beers ever made and without a doubt proof canned beer works. Seek this one out, even if a weird guy at a bar asks you go behind the bar for a surprise....maybe it'll be Heady-Topper, it was for me! 1,634 charactersbobhits, Jan 26, 2013

4.65/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 516oz can poured into a pint glass. HUGE thanks to kingcrowing for this MAJOR want!!! Reviewed side by side with Pliny the Elder
A: Darker orange than Pliny and hazy, Pliny was super clear. One finger off white head with great retention and lacing.
S: Huge citrus hops with dominate grapefruit. Tangerine, and orange zest. Just a touch of caramel malts coming through. Would be nicer if the grapefruit was more subdued.
T: Huge grapefruit bitterness with a slight orange zest in the middle. Caramel comes through in the end to mellow it out. A touch acidic in the finish.
M: Light to medium bodied. Slick. Very very dry. Nice.
O: Definitely an exceptional DIPA. Not on par with Pliny, and I'd have to do a side by side with Dreadnaught and Double Trouble to really classify all these tasty beers. But yes, TOP notch. 820 charactersdoughanson78, Jan 24, 2013

4.94/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had this in a glass at lunch and in the can for dinner. Since the brewer recommends drinking directly from the can, that's how I'll rate it....although I will say it's coppery and cloudy in the glass. First off, the aroma is BRILLIANT. This is an awesomely hoppy-smelling beer with notes of candy and tropical fruit (maybe even peach?). The first thing I tasted was the roasty, nutty malts followed by a bitter punch in the mouth! The finish is fruity, falling somewhere between papaya and peach. What I found most surprising was the creamy, soft mouthfeel. This is to date the best beer I've ever had. It's well worth the hype and the drive to VT (since you can't get it anywhere else). 689 charactersbabbules, Jan 21, 2013

Starts with a hazy belgian blond hue with a slight finger of creamy white cap that quickly dissipates leaving just a few small islands of foam. Nose brings bright juicy citrus (mandarin, grapefruit) pineapple, slight floral pine, very juice and a hoppy earthiness. This beer reminds me alot of Nelson - big tropical notes and juicy with pine dankiness play a small secondary roll. The taste brings bitter papaya, lime rind, light caramel malts and some pine needle covered forest floor - as it warms almost an herbal, minty licorice note comes out. The mouthfeel is creamy and lush but is quickly balanced by a strong hop bitterness. Best beer not sure about that but at least top 3 ipa's i have ever had and well worth trading for. 808 charactersTrilogy31, Jan 21, 2013

Poured from a can into a pint glass
A: Cloudy orange brown with hop resin through out. Little head but I tried extremely hard to pour with no head so I could divide a can between my glass and my girlfriends glass. 
S: Lemon, grapefruit and HOPS! Lots of hops. 
T: Water up front molds into a nice hops character that become full bodied and leaves a hop note on the tongue for a long time.
M: Lots of well rounded hops all throughout the mouth.
O: Great, wish I could get this as a regular everyday beer. 516 characterscodysjb, Jan 21, 2013

S- so complex. Hops abound, wave after wave of aromas, spicy, fruity, earthy. Slight bit of malt sweetness.
T- a simple grain bill leaves a little to be desired. The hop complexity strikes again, the citrus strikes last after the spicy grassy notes have made the first advance.
M- slightly thick, but very drinkable.

Pours clear amber with huge chunks of hop matter floating everywhere. Reminds me of egg drop soup. Minimal head. 
Aroma is HUGE. As soon as I crack the can, citrus hop aroma fills the room. After pouring and taking a deep whiff, I am overwhelmed with hoppy goodness. This is crazy.
First sip is a rush of hop flavor. Very citrusy, with a very smooth and not bitter finish. This is like the perfect vessel to showcase hop flavor... so oily, slick, and bursting with pine and citrus flavors.
I can understand the hype surrounding this beer. It is amazing, and I wish I had a way to easily get more. 754 charactersFickleBeast, Jan 20, 2013

Beer is a very cloudy orange/yellow. Small white head, dissipates quite quickly.
Wow, the nose is huge and juicy. Mango, orange, pineapple. Pine as well. A real hop monster. Terrific scent. 
Taste does not disappoint the lovely aroma. Pine is more upfront than in the nose, although the citrus and tropical fruit flavours are in full effect. The citrus comes out a bit more than the tropical, whereas I found the reverse in the nose. Grapefruit, orange, some pineapple. Aftertaste has lots of citrus and tropical fruit. Quite bitter. Very drinkable at 8%- the alcohol is there but not aggressively. Very, very good.
Medium bodied, moderately carbonated, oily. Really nice feel. Not overly heavy, goes down very smoothly, but still has a real heft to it.
Overall, truly terrific. Does not disappoint a bit. My wife tried it, her eyes went wide and she remarked "this is delicious!"... and she is not even much of a beer fan. That says it all to me. 1,013 charactersjrenihan, Jan 19, 2013

A: Dark yellow/orange/amber opaque color with 2 fingers of fluffy thick white head with great retention and lacing. They say that Alchemist recommends drinking from the can to avoid having to see the beer poured, but I think it looks very nice. Almost identical to Abner when poured into a glass.
S: Citrus, citrus, citrus. Lemon and lime dominate, with some orange, pine, and grassy notes. Nice nose.
T: Follows the nose perfectly and builds on that note. Citrus, bitterness, piney and grassy, just a great hop-forward taste. Just enough malt to balance without dominating the flavor. Perfectly balanced flavor with great bitterness and overall taste. Gold standard for IPAs.
M: As good as the taste is, the mouthfeel is even better. Medium body with moderate carbonation and dry finish, with a wonderfully smooth feel throughout. Just awesome.
O: Lives up to the hype. Get it if you can, trade for it, travel for it, don't pass it up. Better than Abner, and a touch better than Pliny. Just really great. 1,159 charactersMCain04, Jan 19, 2013

A: I'm only giving it a 3 because I didn't pour it into a glass, as demanded on the can. If I can't pour it, it must not look too good. Average
N: The nose on the other hand...amazing! The aroma is straight resinous hops. Glorious hop aromas can be detected even from a few feet away!
T: Sweet mother of God! Resin, pine, some bitterness, not overpowering but instead perfect. This can not taste any better. 
M: Medium bodied, I believe I got some sediment or hop nugget pieces in mine but I don't care. No improvement needed.
O: The only thing that would make this beer better is pouring it in a glass. I am standing by my 3 score on appearance. However, based on everything else, this beer is a perfect 5/5 in my book. 767 charactersklaybie, Jan 18, 2013

A: White scattered foam which vanishes fast in order to leave a ring of lacing on the glass. The colour reminds me of apricot marmelade, it's quite murky and has some bubbles playing around in the delicious liquid.
S: Pine needles, cat's pee, tropical fruit such as mango, banana and passionfruit. There is also sweetness which again brings me to think of marmelade.
T: At first it's pine needles, cat's pee as in the smell. Allthough the tropical fruit is slightly different from the smell and the taste adds a dry bitterness to it. The aftertastes are at first tree sap and pine needles but after a while there is some apricot marmelade there as well.
M: Leaning more towards medium than thin. Probably the leanest mouthfeel I've got from a DIPA ever. The carbonation is light and the feel is very dry. Ace!
O: They really managed to combine a hop bomb that would satisfy most hop heads around the globe with sweetness which creates a great balance. A wonderful DIPA with great body allthough the appearance lacks some sexiness because of the lack of head. You won't notice that if you drink from the can though. 1,334 charactersLinusBohman, Jan 14, 2013

Smells like a bag of hops. Citrus, pine, passion fruit and candy.
Taste is fairly complex with notes of citrus, pine, juicy fruit and light earthyness.
I'd like a bit more hop flavor but that's a minor point. Quite bitter, dank and lingering.
Medium bodied and fairly high carbonation keeps this one quite drinkable for an 8% hop bomb.
Overall this is a fantastic beer. I love a touch more hop flavor and nothing more. The beer drinks very easy for such a high hop load and high abv. I'll easily order this again next time I'm in the area.

Smell: Great aroma with a nice piny kick that lets you know that these hops mean business.
Taste: Great residual taste that stays with you for nearly fifteen minutes after you've completed the can. Certainly has a ton of hops but what i love most about this beer is it seems to have a yeast strand that i both love but am unfamiliar with.
Mouthfeel: Great mouthfeel with alot of yeast sediment which i personaly am fond of however i know not everyone feels the same sentiment. 515 charactersKELPAK, Jan 12, 2013

The first I think might have been less than fresh or didn't travel well (?) - I guess I really don't care now.
Thanks to RandyKemka for hooking me up with this one.
I have to give an average 3 for appearance - although I'm drinking from the can, I owe it at least a par score for that.
The smell is what I expected - pungent grapefruit hop citrus...very nice
The taste kind of took me by surprise - a biting hop resin up front, and then WHAM...it did a disappearing act on my tongue, as if my mouth was a cloud drawing little droplets of water and nothing else. 
Then just as I was focusing on the amazing nothingness - the hops came back and gave my mouth a little hop resin kick (or should I say re-kick)
The mouth feel is nothing short of amazing...medium to full body on an IPA? WoW!
Overall, I would say I will have to bow to the hype on this one. A+
It reminds me of an AIR Abrasive (if they made such a beer) - except Abrasive doesn't have the magic trick in the middle of the show. 1,044 characterslonewolfcry, Jan 11, 2013

(A)- Pours a cloudy golden orange colored hue. Produced a light layer of pure white froth.
(S)- A really nice big burst of bright citrus: orange, pineapple, and peach. Finishes with some nicely dry pine bitterness.
(T)- A bit backwards from the smell, but rewardingly so. The big pine bitterness is all up front in your face. What really helps this is the jump back to the juicy citrus in the finish. Quite complex and dynamic with the play between bitter pine and vibrant citrus fruit.
(M)- A great carbonation level and balance. Its a rewarding beer to experience due to how it jumps from bitter to crisp fruit and back again as it warms. The bitterness is actually quite intense, but is met with an equally intense citrus fruit body.
(O)- This is absolutely fitting the deserving of the reviews it gets. An absolute classic for the style that is easily up there in the top for for the style for me. A nice treat since I have been kind of bored with this style for awhile, but this one is very rewarding. 1,123 characterssweemzander, Jan 11, 2013

4.96/5  rDev +6.7%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Heady Topper. This is it. This beer in my hand is truly the best DIPA, and maybe the best beer period. Pouring this beer into a brand new tulip glass seems blasphemous given the clear instructions to drink form the can, but I've done that enough, and can't miss an opportunity to enjoy the full sensory experience of HT. 
A: Just gorgeous. Sunset orange with a bright white head that dissipates quickly but sticks around for the whole glass. Unfiltered to the max, which IMHO is a plus, especially when we're talking about DIPAs.
S: Smell is off the charts. Massive citrus and pine notes assault your nasal cavities from the moment you crack a can until the moment you take your last glorious sip. If only they made HT air fresheners...
T: 120 IBUs never tasted so good - a hopheads wet dream. Once the initial punch of hop bitterness passes, you are left with bright, cleansing grapefruit and overripe orange which fades into a subdued but present malt sweetness that leaves the beer tasting rather balanced (although this beer is not mean't to be balanced, so I'm puzzled as to why so many people criticize it for being too hop forward)
M: Brilliant. Smooth, almost creamy carbonation that pops the palate open and readies you for the onslaught of goodness. 
O: Those who find themselves disappointed by HT, IMHO, simply do not possess the necessary knowledge of the DIPA style or the requisite love of American hops. This beer fires on all cylinders and I feel truly blessed to be able to drink it regularly. John Kimmich & company really have it figured out and I couldn't be happier for the heady people that make this heady beer come to life. 1,653 charactersHeady978, Jan 11, 2013

4.84/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5It just hit #1 on BA yesterday, and today he local shop sold out in two hours. Jmscowcroft was able to get a four-pack and set me up but when I went at lunch it was sold out. 
A - Supposed to drink from the can, but poured a bit to see. Cloudy burnt orange color. Good head of a finger and a half. Can tell that it is unfiltered but looks great. 
S - Smell is amazing. Really adds to the taste in a big way. Floral like a bouquet of smells and really hoppy. Also a piney fragrance towards the end. A little citrus at the very end. 
T - This one tastes great. Obviously very hoppy but surprisingly smooth. Definitely a citrus taste, it seems bitter but ends so smooth. This beer is so evolving across the palate its hard to put a name on it. 
M - It feels very smooth and buttery, but has a way to remind you it's their, it's very "sippable" however. The aftertaste doesn't dominate as some can, but you can taste it in your mouth in a good way. 
D - Drinkability was its only downfall. As far as taste, it was great, but I personally didn't want to have multiples. Great for enjoying it smaller quantities. But overall very drinkable. 
O - Overall a great beer. The way the smell and taste mingle is artistic. It confuses and makes sense all in one sip. It deserves the efforts to obtain it. 1,292 charactersda_beers, Jan 10, 2013
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Heady Topper - 1 Pint - Can
First off it took me three weeks to get my hands on some even though I live in the area. Exciting to see such high demand for local product! This brew gets better every time you have it! (Editing this review again because it REALLY does get better every time you have it!)
Look - Hazy golden unfiltered (also unpasteurized) with an average amount of carbonation. Full, frothy head. I only poured an ounce or so for evaluation purposes, I enjoyed the rest right from the can. I have found through several reviews that I actually prefer pouring this into my Dogfish Head IPA glass, I love getting the aroma while drinking and seeing this beast in all its glory.
Smell - Hopsimus maximus with earthy, floral (piney) overtones. Quite unique smelling compared to other, similar brews. Almost has a spice tang to it. Again using my DFH glass I am able to get much more out of the aroma than from the can.
Taste - Wave after wave of hoppy goodness is how they word it and that is EXACTLY how it is. There is a resonation but it is pleasing compared to other hoppy beers that sit on top of your tongue. Smooth.
Mouthfeel - Surprisingly drinkable but one needs to be careful primarily due to alcohol content but also so as to not over-abuse the palette. This brew has a way of masking the 8% but at the same time hitting you like none other, it must be super concentrated hop juice!
Overall - This is one of the best brews I have ever had. I am proud of Vermont microbrews and this just makes me even prouder. Time and time again I go back to this brew and it just seems to get better and better. 1,621 charactersJMScowcroft, Jan 10, 2013

Anyways. It's Tuesday and this can was canned last Thursday, picked it up at the brewery. I had one that day but wanted to focus on the mindblow. 
It's great out of the can but I poured this into a bourbon snifter to review, it had the smallest mouth opening of any glassware I had.
A- Pours a hazy beautiful orange with a quick fading white head
S- smells like straight hops but not in a sharp way, I get a lot of lemon, I get tropical fruits. 
T/M- this is pretty unique, it's so freaking balanced for DIPA and its goes down almost buttery. Needless to say you get a boatload of hops but its sooo smooth, I don't even get it. As it goes down you get a lot of lemon and tropical fruit, pine, some subtle caramel. even the the aftertaste is great, very earthy
O- I honestly never thought I'd get to buy fresh heady, and I'm so glad I did. This is not overhyped if you like DIPA's, I can't believe this is 120 IBU's. is so smooth and it leaves you waning more after every sip, good thing it comes in 16oz cans. Almost makes me want to drive 12 hours to buy more. 1,138 charactersbrewtus, Jan 09, 2013

4.66/5  rDev +0.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: The beer is hazy yellow in color and has some hints of amber hues. It poured with a finger high off white head that quickly died down, leaving a thin film of bubbles covering the surface and a collar around the edge of the glass. There is a slight amount of carbonation visible along with some fine particles floating in suspension.
S: There are strong aromas of citrusy hops in the nose along with some hints of pine resin. As the beer warms up, the piney hops become replaced by aromas of mangoes and other tropical fruits. I poured a little from the can into a snifter glass to give due justice to evaluating its appearance and aroma, but the smell is so strong that you can get most of it by simply sniffing the mouth of the can. 
T: Like the smell, the overall taste is dominated by flavors from the hops—grapefruit really stands out in particular and contributes a moderate amount of bitterness that lingers into the finish. There are also some interesting hints of tropical fruits such as mangoes, which lend to the complexity and become a little stronger as the beer warms up. The hops also taste extremely fresh and seem a somewhat reminiscent of a wet hopped beer.
M: It feels medium-bodied and very crisp on the palate with a moderate amount of carbonation.
O: Despite being an Imperial IPA, this beer is a citrus hop bomb that drinks more like a regular IPA and has no traces of alcohol whatsoever in the taste. If I could find a four pack of this, I would have no problem knocking back each one of the cans in a single sitting. 1,545 charactersmetter98, Jan 08, 2013

Appearance: Very cloudy yellow near opaque, short initial head of about 1" which receded to abut 1/8" cap. Nice lacing.
Smell: Floral hops, big, big citrus, over some pine.
Taste: Massive grapefruit hoppiness, the most dominant flavor by far. Any pine resin flavors are subservient to the power of the citrus. This is what a "hop-bomb" should be. No hint of alcohol. The finish is (pleasantly) bitter tasting like you just finished a glass of grapefruit juice. 
Mouthfeel: Very creamy and smooth albeit with the strong bitter finish. In fact I found this to be the creamiest IPA/DIPA I have ever had, unique and well done.
Overall: I can see why this beer is so loved, extreme flavor, excellent mouthfeel. Not highly complex and verging on one dimensional. Still a well crafted beer and a very good example of the style 860 charactersBobZ, Jan 07, 2013

Pours an amazingly thick pine colored syrup with tons of floaties. This looks like crystallized pine sap and I'm surprised it even moves when you tilt the glass. I wouldn't call this "pretty" exactly but it's pretty damned impressive in its own way.
Smell is ridiculous. Just a wild bouquet of every imaginable fruit. Pineapples, mangos, oranges, peaches, bananas, candy sugar. Almost no bitterness or pine in the nose, smells pretty sweet really. This smells as good as any IPA there is.
Taste is a but different. Plenty of fruit still, but focused on pineapple and orange and somewhat less variety. Definitely more bitter than the nose suggests, and hints of line that weren't in the nose. Aftertaste is mostly bitter. Great beer obviously, but not as mind blowing as the nose would suggest.
Mouthfeel is interesting, very thick and syrupy but still pretty drinkable.
Excellent IPA. Not the best in the world IMO, but damn good.

Appearance- Looks like a witbier it's so cloudy. Can't see shit through it!
Smell- Just hops. Not floral or fruity. Just straight up hops.
Taste- Hop bomb! Straight hop bitterness (in a great way). Very vegetal and drinkable. Don't know how else to describe it.

4.7/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had on tap in VT and from cans. Review from both glass (tulip/large wine glass) and also from the can. Was canned around 2nd week, December 2012.
As always, after 800+ reviews, I think everyone knows what to expect from this beer but just for reference here's my review. Thanks to papat444 for the 4 pack :D
(from glass)
A: Pours light straw colour, but extremely opaque, possibly do to hop resins. (if you pour out the end of the can into another glass it is even more cloudy.. with resin?)...not chunky at all, just a fine mist. Light bubbles and light head as well that doesn't build up too much but leaves a slight lace around the rim of the beer as it goes down.
S: Floral, more in the range of sweeter hop smells, some citrus fruit... I don't get as much pine/resin type of hop smell as with some out DIPA's/IIPA's. Otherwise just a lot of endless hops. When you stick you nose in the tulip you get hit with a wonderful green bouquet and know what you're in for!
T: As others noted, aromas lead right into flavours...more floral hops at the start, citrus, and what you don't get so much of in the nose, bitterness and resin, which comes out as it rushes to the back of your throat & explodes back into your mouth...superbly balanced compared to some other super hopped beers. Bitter enough to be a IIPA but not over the top... it just keeps going and because it is so well balanced you just want to keep going...where as some super hopped beers keep piling on the bitterness to where you can't taste anything afterwards for days... this one is like a clean slate each sip....and just a note, if you are savouring it, it will get more resin/bitterness as it warms but still no hint of malts really.
T / M: (from can): Almost like a nitrous injection of hops. As you drink from the can you get both the beer and the hop aromas at once, which is nice. Out of the can it seems to carry a bit more resins and more intense hops... you might also not get as much bitterness because you get a bit more carbonation on your tongue than from drinking out of the glass, so it is more sparkling and refreshing which makes the flavours jump around a little more, but does emphasis the hops for sure... overall it was interesting drinking out of the can.... not sure I'd say it tastes all that much different to be honest, (and I didn't do back to back in 1 shot), but it certainly doesn't diminish the quality of this beer. I'd say glass is probably fine, but you're good either way. Drinking out of the can might be a little closer to what you get on tap (minus the Guinness toys..) but again, didn't do that comparison either.
M: Pine resin stickiness...you'll be tasting this all night on your palette... incredibly balanced... like a hop oil slick, smooth upon entry and as it goes down, no hint of the ABV at all. Perfect amount of carbonation to keep it fresh but not attacking your tongue to distract.
O: What can I say that hasn't already been said before. Best IIPA ever? I haven't tried all the other ones. Best one I've tried so far? definitely. Drink-ability for this amount of hops is outstanding. Hard to get to all the hop flavours in such a complicated hopped beer, but that is ok, this isn't about sipping an Imperial Stout till you get to the bottom of the complexity.... the Alchemist set out to make a perfectly hoppy, drinkable IPA and have surely succeeded where many others fail. For a IIPA this is near perfection. I don't go back to a lot of beers but I would drink this often if I lived in VT... 3,519 characters4ster, Jan 05, 2013

A: Poured from the can yielding an opaque dark gold beer with about a finger of bright white head (I made sure to leave the sediment in the can as best I could). I have never seen a beer of this color so opaque, l could not see anything through the beer! My only complaint about this beer, which in minor, is that the head retention was poor. 
S: This may be the best beer I have had the privilege to smell. Liquid hops. Huge grapefruit and tropical fruit notes dominate the smell. No malt or alcohol that I could detect. 
T: Amazing, the taste follows the smell. Huge grapefruit and tropical fruit tastes. I did not taste any alcohol or malt in this one. A bitter beer that fades nicely into pineapple and citrus rind sweetness. 
M: Medium carbonation with a sticky mouthfeel. Slightly astringent. 
O: This is absolutely in the top three IPAs for me. I am about to retry some Pliney here in a couple of days and once I do that I think I will be able to place it. If you like IPAs then this is a must have beer that is worth seeking out. 1,176 charactersTheChiefBrews, Jan 04, 2013

Ah yes, Heady Ticker...Thanks @blackie for the CANS. I'm sorry folks, but I just couldn't get myself to drink this from a can, despite their wishes. That just doesn't make any sense to me - drank from some nice glassware with no issues! If they had told you to drink it out of a shoe, would you? Bright hop profile - oily, fragrant citrus, tropical, tangerine, pineapple. Really liked this - deserves most of the praise it receives. 485 charactersdirtylou, Jan 04, 2013

Pours a hazy amber/straw in color with a pretty standard white head and pretty good lacing, points for the cool can as well. The smell fills the room even from the can resiny, piney, and citrus hops with tropical notes, pretty much any hop smell you can think of rolled into one. Taste of pure hop juice for me, not overly bitter but the can describes it best "wave after wave of hop goodness", there are also some malts in there if you try really hard to notice them. The mouthfeel is not all that heavy, the 8% abv is not noticeable at all and if you have access to this one it can be drank can after can. This can was exactly 1 week old. 716 charactersdickieb, Jan 03, 2013

A - Cloudy copper hue
S - HOly $hii! Huge tropical tones overwhelm the nose pineapple resin sticky hops very pungent
T - This has to be one the best IPA i have ever tasted. The bitterness hits down hard enough to be an imperial but then vanishes and becomes delicate tropical fruity flesh and pit rinds. I want to bathe in this heavenly beer.
M - Huge sticky resin balance is something that cannot even be mentioned. Its flawless. You cant ask for anything more.
O - Picking up 2 cases of this was the best investment ever. One of the best IPAs i have ever had and im sure it will be for a while. Drink it fresh!!! This one degrades FAST and tastes better than most also when its a couple weeks old. DRINK IT FROM THE CAN!!! 792 charactersJohnnyhitch, Jan 01, 2013

A: Pours a murky mustard yellow with a 1 finger off white head. Decent retention and lacing.
S: Faint smell of grapefruit, mango, pine/resin and floral.
T: Very close to the nose, bitter floral and citrus hops up front, followed by some pine/resin and dry finish.
M: Medium body and carbonation. Some heat trails down at the end.
O: Excellent DIPA. Very well balanced and super drinkable. It's fairly faint in both smell and taste, not bad but I prefer more. 495 charactersWesM63, Dec 29, 2012

Smell: Grapefruit, hops, oranges, grass, floral, and piney.
Taste: Wow this one just gives and gives flavor. Lots of the floral tastes mixed with the bitter hops and citrus notes. everything balances really well. Swishing this around in your mouth is like a resiny hop and citrus explosion and then you start to taste the other flavors at play like a mild caramel. The best part is the aftertaste. It just goes on an on. Wonderful. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied a little stickiness but not too much. The carbonation is the perfect amount to tingle the taste buds but without overpowering anything.
Overall: Wow. The hype is real. This can got delivered to the store and I am drinking it only 5 days later. I hope my friends in VT will continue to ship this out to me ocassionally because I am addicted! 962 charactersstereosforgeeks, Dec 24, 2012

Smell: Bursts with citrus, pine and pith; rather tropical, with orange, pineapple and mango
Taste: The intense bitterness jutts forward from the get-go, with the tropical citrus flavors featuring prominently in the middle, bringing orange, pineapple and mango flavors, along with ruby red grapefruit; the sweetness from the malts builds into the finish, balancing the bitterness
Mouthfeel: Medium to full body with moderate carbonation
Overall: A great DIPA; while it is big on the hops, there is a lot of malty sweetness, too and that is necessary to balance the intense bitterness

A: Hugely turbid gold with a close to a finger of white head and some lacing...hey, its supposed to be drunk out of a can right? Who cares what it looks like...
S: Huge tropical fruit and pineapple nose right up front. Fruity and citrusy for sure. Moderate bitter notes, no pine or pungent resiny notes, just fruity goodness.
T: Big-time floral taste; tons of papaya and mango, tangerine and loads of pineapple. No malt detected here, but the bitterness is still very manageable. That floral taste blends so nicely with the ripe citrus and tropical fruit.
MF: Medium bodied, with perfect carbonation, perfect subdued bitterness, and moderate dryness - just the right amount of everything in my book.
O: Taste and smell are both extremely fresh on this beer - Kurtis said it was a week and a half old and I believe him. Mind-boggling fresh floral fruitiness. Great DIPA and something I could drink a TON of if I had access to it.
Thank you so much Kurtis! 1,063 charactersScotchboy, Dec 17, 2012

A: Cloudy amber in color with two fingers of off white head. Good retention and heavy lacing.
S: Big, big nose that was heavy on pine. Other scents included grapefruit and tropical fruit. 
T: Very similar to the nose with an earthy character as well. A good amount of bitter hoppiness but it is so balanced and drinkable.
M: Medium heavy body with a light to medium carbonation. It is pretty oily and sticks to the palate pretty well.
O: There are many beers that could have the same looking review, but very few like Heady Topper. All of the parts do not equal the whole here. For a DIPA, I could drink these all night and that is a good, but scary thing. It is simply one of the best beers I've ever had. 895 charactersmpedara429, Dec 17, 2012

Big Piney, Citrusy, Hoptastic DIPA. With some malt. Dont forget the malt
A fantasic brew that plays on the montra; "If you can only do one thing, at least be the best at it"
All in all, if you are a IPA/DIPA fan, and you do not enjoy this brew, you may want to look into your past... remember that licking a cheese grater moment as a kid, dont you!?! 507 charactersrareif, Dec 15, 2012

Appearance: A lovely honey color that leaves a finger or two of head that lingers a bit. I think the beer has a great look to it, and I see a number of other benefits to pouring this one into an appropriate glass, rather than drinking straight from the can such as better enjoying that fantastic aroma...
Smell: Grapefruit, citrus, tropical fruits and hops. Absolutely heavenly scent to the nose. I could smell this one all day. Not overpowering, but the perfect levels of fruitiness and hops, a bit piney as well. Best-smelling beer I've ever had.
Taste: The taste does not exactly match the nose, but is very pleasant. Fairly complex, not just a "hop-bomb". Plenty of hops for sure though, some pine and earthy tones, and some citrusy, fruity flavors that are hard to nail down but very tasty.
Mouth-feel: A good amount of carbonation. This beer goes down very smoothly - it is uncharacteristically smooth and balanced for its ABV.
Overall: A beer that belongs in the top tier of DIPAs and IPAs. Very well-balanced and that smell....just incredible. The Alchemist does a great job with this brew and I highly recommend it to hop-lovers everywhere. 1,333 charactersResuin, Dec 13, 2012

4.84/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a 16 oz can into an oversized wine glass. Thank you Surge1311 for hooking me up with this in a trade. 
I know the can says to drink straight from the can, but I feel that I'd be missing some key aspects of the review process (aroma, appearance, lacing, head). I don't see any bottled on date. Allowed it to warm as I sip for the full experience.
A- Pours a honey colored hazy body with a thick, bubbly off-white head with high retention. The head reduces to an uneven chunky cloud of foam. 
S- Extremely inviting. Fresh baked bread, fresh citrus, clementine, grapefruit, tropical fruits, pine, resin, slight booze in the background.
T- So drinkable and sip demanding that I'm having a hard time putting it down to write this review! Grapefruit, mango, citrus, passion fruit on the start, transcending into subtle but tasty pine and resin notes. Creamy, smooth finish that I just can't find in any other DIPA on the planet, which is why this one gets a 5/5 for taste. Sweet and raw, but in a good way. 
M- Medium-light body, medium carbonation. Leaves a sticky hop bitterness on the tongue. 
I'm happy to say that this beer did indeed live up the the hype that surrounds it! It's huge tropical, fruity character and smooth creamy finish is in my opinion what gives it the edge over it's competitors. Hopefully Alchemist will expand it's production line so more people can experience the deliciousness of Heady Topper! 1,434 charactersgcamparone, Dec 13, 2012

I drank 3 of these from the can and poured one into a glass... Very hazy and full of yeast particles, this definitely isn't the most attractive brew... Now I know why they want you to drink it from the can...
Probably the highlight of the beer... Very pungent citrus hop aromas... Pineapple, orange, lemon... the aromas coming out of the can are ridiculous... They are deep and juicy and dank... Crazy aromas... Not much in the way of maltiness in the background but that's ok to me... 
Hop flavors are citrusy in nature with the pineapple and orange holding the forefront... The flavors are good but don't really hold up in measure to the pungency of the aromas... I don't detect any booze whatsoever so that's a good thing... This is a good Imperial for sure... It's not overly boozy as some are and the bitterness is held in check quite nicely..
I liked this beer a lot and would buy it if available locally... Would I trade for it again? I'm not so sure about that... It was good but just not world class level... at least to me... 1,121 charactersTilley4, Dec 10, 2012

4.88/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Have had this several times, attempting my first review of the renowned Heady Topper.
I cheated and poured less than a shot into a small glass, just to get a sense of what I was dealing with. HT pours a pale and hazy yellow/gold color, with a thin bright white head. The color is unspectacular, but the beer has a general texture to it that lends it a particular quality. 
Sweetness, malt, and grapefruit citrus aromas explode from the can the second it is cracked. It seems to be balanced perfectly. The smell fades somewhat as the beer is consumed, but never disappears entirely.
Taste is amazing. I get everything on the nose, plus some pine, all in an explosion of hops, hops, and more hops. On top of that, it's smooth as can be, with refreshingly crisp and somewhat biting body to it that wreaks of balance. The hops "creep up on you" and stick around for awhile, as declared on the label. It really is an excellent, excellent beer.
Overall fantastic. Everybody needs to try Heady Topper. 998 charactersrodlavers, Dec 08, 2012

A (last 1/4 of the can) - Surprisingly super clear, dark gold color. Small head disappearing quickly without leaving much of lancing.
S - Very intense herbal, fresh, piney, mango, citrusy aromas. Extremely aromatic and quite balanced by some malt.
T/M - Big hops flavors. Lemon zest, piney, grapefruit, tropical fruits sustained by a lively carbonation. Very juicy. Leads you to a nice fruity bitterness at the end that lingers forever.
O - Definitely one of the best DIPA I was given to try! Tons of flavors and complexity. A must try!! 610 charactersduracell, Dec 06, 2012

Heard the hype for months and finally picked one up locally in SoCal. Yeah, imagine that. I bought a can of this in L.A. at retail. 1 pint aluminum can served into a New Belgium stem-goblet in me gaff in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, California. 8.00% confirmed. Consumed in celebration of completing my grad school applications. I don't see canned-on date, but my local beer store guy informed me it was two weeks old when I bought it yesterday. 
Served straight from the refrigerator and allowed to warm slightly over the course of consumption. I went back on forth on whether to pour this one into a glass because the label advises me not to. I'm compromising and taking my first sip from the can, but then pouring some of it into a glass and leaving some in the can for later consumption. Side-poured with standard vigor as no carbonation issues are anticipated.
T (Early):On the first sip I get delightful grapefruit and citrus esters, with pale clean malts and lovely floral hopping. Oily hops abound, with hints of pine. Boy, this is going to be interesting. 
A: Pours a one finger beige colour head of nice thickness and cream, and decent retention for the high ABV. Body colour is a fairly vibrant burnt orange-auburn. Nontransparent. No yeast particles are visible. No bubble show. Not the best IPA appearance I've seen, but pleasant.
Sm: Grapefruit, pale malts, citrus esters, floral hops, and heavy oily hops - but surprisingly little pine. Quite light in strength, but appealing. 
T: Perfectly balanced; never too bitter. Grapefruit zing but not in an overbearing way. Floral hops and heavy hop oils (a component I think is rather unique and special to this beer; I've never experienced it quite like this). Citrus, tropical fruit on the back end. I even get pinapple and mango. Maybe apricot too. Passion fruit? (I'm never sure; I've never had an actual passion fruit). Pale malts a are a perfect complement to the hop choices. No alcohol or yeast comes through. That's tasty stuff. I'm shocked at the lack of bitterness; I don't even remember Pliny The Younger (let alone Elder) mitigating the bitterness this well. There's some (very very little) on the climax, but just enough to add a welcome dimension. Well layered and quite subtle. It doesn't beat you over the head like most beers in the style. No metallic taste despite being from a can. Perfect sweetness to suit its hoppiness. 
Mf: Smooth and wet, with perfect crispness and coarseness to coax out the subtler flavours. Fresh, refreshing, and perfectly carbonated. Oily. A bit buttery.
Dr: This is probably the most drinkable IPA (not just Double IPA, but IPA as well) I've ever had the delight to consume. It's refreshing as hell, the 8% is nowhere to be seen, and I imagine it would pair brilliantly with any food. A master class in balance and what an IPA should be. I hate to buy into the beer versus beer debates, but in my book this is clearly better than Pliny The Elder. I expected something different based on the hype, but this surprised me with its balance and sophistication. Wow. This is definitely one of the best beers in the style that I've had. I look forward to trying more beer from the Alchemist and to one day having this on-draught. If you see this, buy it. I'm not a big IPA fan and I'm loving this stuff. Brilliantly built. I could easily down this one all night. If there's a better IPA out there, I have yet to find it. 
This beer is nearly perfect in its style. The main thing holding it back is its appearance. 
A+ (4.6)  [3 / 3.5 / 4.75 / 4.75 / 4.75]
Serve cold. Drink cold. 
Would pair well with anything. Even chocolate.
***
10/01/15: I've had this at least 7 times since my initial review, and significant batch inconsistency has forced me to lower my rating from an A+ to an A-. Some batches have been as low as a High B, whilst some have remained an A or A+. Unfortunate, but true.

HOPSSS, and such an incredible punch to the mouth of amazing flavors. This is everything a beer should be, and more. Others have written much better/professional reviews.

A: Yeah I poured it in a glass. So what. Very cloudy, dull orange color. Lots of crap floating around in there. Great head, excellent retention though. Lacing covering the glass as I drink more.
S: Pungent aroma. Freshly squeezed orange juice, dank piney hops, grapes. It fills the entire room with hop aroma. Ridiculous.
T: Hop flavor on this one is ridiculous, in the best of ways. Waves and waves of it (quoting the can), and it never gets too bitter. Perfectly balanced. There's malt in there, but it stays behind the scenes and does its job.

Even though it says to drink it from the can, I prefer it from the glass. The first thing you notice as you pop the top is the wonderful aroma, ton of oranges, citrus, pine and tropical fruit. It pours a deep orange, moderate white head, big chunky floaters. The flavor is fresh citrus, tropical fruit, bitter pine. IMO the hoppiest beer I have ever had the pleasure of drinking. The body is medium, some noticeable booze, decent carbonation. Great DIPA, pretty much lives up to hype. 557 charactersbonkers, Nov 25, 2012

4.92/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5As good as it gets, this beer makes you smile from ear to ear. As soon as it gets close enough to your face you know something worthwhile is about to hit the fan; shit the golden goose would be envious to produce and all the hyperbole I can write in the name of an awesome beer. From the smell to the initial taste on your lips, it's a fall in love experience that very few beers can replicate. I advise you to seek out this beer and have at it. Unfortunately, i've only had a few to the head but i've sampled it a often enough and it's always the same reaction--Good, good god, it's good. 
The appearance if you defy the makers and pour it into a glass is nice and expected with a great DIPA like the Dow chemical company and a Bangladeshi Theravada Vipassana teacher. Golden, slightly hazy and with big porno head it looks inviting. One thing you'll notice are white snowflakes floating abound as if this were the ghost of Christmas present's snow globe. You will be compelled to drink it now and save it never.
The smell is a sweet bouquet of hop, pine and fruity citrus. Oh, it's fresh too, like the wet morning dew on a blade of grass. Each whiff is getting in close with the incarnation of Carmen Miranda. The aroma is memorable.
The taste is what will reel you in big fish. It's hop, it's floral and fruity, it's bitter yet sweet. Bitter sweet since living in Florida keeps me forlorn from its ambrosia. Citrus and fresh grass swirling in a vortex of hop is what I get, maybe a hint of vanilla in it. A splash of orange flavor, and you can throw in a grapefruit taste too. It's welcome to the jungle with guns of the Navarone.
Great drink ability is the lovely conclusion to a great tasting and fragrant beer. I feel this beer will make true believers out of anyone fortunate to drink it. I'm usually a stout guy, I love the malt, the semi-sweetness with coffee and chocolate flavors, the thick hearty nature of it's character and yet I find myself thinking this beer is easily in my top three beers ever. It's drinkable, it's drinkable now, later and between, in any pocket of the multiverse and moment in the time continuum; but i'd drink it now... what are you waiting for? 2,187 charactersBeerTheater, Nov 25, 2012

Notes from 11/10 after drinking blind pig and pliny previously
A: Golden deep orange with a small fluffy off white head. Awesome lacing that clings to the side of the glass. 
S: Easily the best smelling beer period. Lots of herbal pine and resinous hops mixed with fruity tropical citrus. The cans still smell great weeks after being drank. (Yes I some times keep cans around that long)
T: Easily the smoothest tasting hop juice you can imagine. Tons of hop flavor. Crisp with lots of pine, resin, and grapefruit/orange hops up front. Slightly bitter at first that transitions into the best tasting sweet tropical citrus hop flavor that stays with you after your done drinking. Slightly sweet malt profile balances the hop bitterness very well. 
M: Crisp with a medium-full body. Really smooth with a nice syrupy consistency. Perfectly carbonated. If I could I would drink this every day of my life. 
O: This is the standard for me in comparing other beers. This is my DIPA benchmark and very few beers come close to this with the exception of IPAS from HF. Easily the best beer made to date and can't wait for it to become more accessable in the coming years. 1,221 charactersomniscientcause, Nov 21, 2012
4.72/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Poured (partially) from a 16-oz. tallboy can into a tulip-shaped Relic Brewing Co. Belgian snifter.
A: Poured a hazy, golden yellow color with an amber tinge and a thin veil of wispy lace that settled to a fine coating. Leaves a nice, sticky ring of lace on the glass.
S: Holy hops; sweet, fragrant tropical fruits, orange rinds and grapefruit juice, backed by spicy, herbal, grassy and catty hop aromatics. This DIPA really has it all.
T: Light, juicy malt sweetness up front primes the palate with some fruity esters before digging the hop sickle into the tongue. Truthfully, the bready and juicy hops lay a nice foundation for the waves of hop complexity that roll across the palate. It begins light, with lemon and orange zest, segueing into a grassy, peppery complexity before melding into the somewhat hot, prickly resins that wash the brew back with sticky, grapefruit rind and hop oils. The bittersweet, juicy and hopped out aftertaste is icing on the cake.
M: Medium-bodied and super-smooth for such a bitter brew. The hops tingle, burn and resonate their way throughout the experience, all the while retaining a high probability that you'll go back soon for another sip.
O: A very tasty, smooth and bitter hop bomb wrapped in the juicy, malted arms of an extremely well-crafted, 8% ABV DIPA. Heady-Topper is that beer you lust after when you want to satiate your desire for complex hop acidity but don't want rubber-tongue the rest of the night. That's not to say the hops won't burn you, because they will. It's just that this beer offers so much more and balances things well with light, delicate, yet effective, usage of malts. Won't you come to Waterbury, CT, Alchemist? 1,689 charactersGambrinus1184, Nov 21, 2012

4.52/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Well I am following the instructions and drinking this one from the can. I did previously have one poured into a glass.... which the apperance is hazy gold with hop leaves floating around and white sticky head. Sicne I'm reviewing this from the can, I will be generous with appearance since the can has a pretty cool look. The aroma is bright and citrusy with loads of apricot, grapefruit, lemon zest, and pine. The aroma emanates freely from the mouth opening which gives me a nice bit of aroma (which I was expecting to be restrained from the can). The taste is delicious... the hops all come together and features a nice fruity/citrus profile. Notes of mango, apricot, and grapefruit come through with minimal bitterness. A touch of cream even comes through which really unifies the flavors. Almost no bitterness on the finish. The 8% ABV is dangerously undetectable. The mouthfeel is mildly carbonation which makes for a smooth mouthfeel. Overall, a delicious IPA. I recently had a less than fresh can...and I must say the fresh can really shines and pops with flavor. Well worth seeking out. 1,096 charactershomebrew311, Nov 20, 2012

4.56/5  rDev -1.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Finally get to do a full review of this. I did pour it out of the can however. Body is cloudy and some brown/orange in the amber. Head is maybe a finger tall any only slightly off-white. Smells amazing like citra hops. There is a sweetness to it, but that blends in so well with the hops that you almost miss it. Lime and grapefruit. For flavor, it is very similar to the aroma. Nice lime and pine. A little white sugar. Mouth is great with strong carbonation and decent body. 
Overall, this is an excellent beer that cures your hop fix (which could come back at any time between a couple minutes and a couple months). So smooth and delicious. 644 charactersRuckusDu, Nov 15, 2012

4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5So after a few years, I wanted to give this beer the full review it deserves. 
Poured from a 16 oz can into a snifter. The pour is a hazy, bright golden orange color with a large fluffy all-white head. The head leaves some beautiful cobweb lacing around the glass as it dissipates. 
The aroma is incredibly deep and complex. I get juicy notes of grapefruit, mango, and orange, with some more subtle lemon notes following close behind. Then the earthy, dank pine resin kicks in and knocks you on your butt. It's a wonderful mix of tropical, sweet fruit and bitter, piney hops that really make this aroma legendary. A subtle, bready malt provides the backbone to this absolutely mind-blowing aroma. It's impossible to keep your nose out of this one. 
The flavor packs a similar punch. Lots of juicy grapefruit and lemon, with some more sweet notes of orange peel and pineapple leading the way. But just like the nose, the earthy, piney notes burst through with reckless abandon, and leave your palate in complete disarray. The doughy, peppery malt is well-hidden, but always present, ever lurking in the back. Calling this beer a "hop bomb" does not do it justice. It's far more complex than that. 
The mouth is full-bodied with good carbonation. It's incredibly creamy and smooth, and whatever bitterness is brought forth doesn't last long on the tongue. The alcohol is nigh undetectable, and if you aren't careful, you can down 3-4 cans of this in a session without really thinking about it. A DIPA doesn't get any more drinkable than this. 
Overall, not much else that can be said for this incredible beer. It meets the hype and even exceeds it on many levels. And while many other popular beers see their prices skyrocket with exceeding demands, Heady Topper has always remained a great value. While there's no such thing as a perfect beer in my eyes, this is as close as it gets. I've had this straight from the can, as well as in a glass and I don't notice a significant change either way. It's simply an amazing beer no matter how you drink it. 2,054 charactersScaryEd, Nov 10, 2012
4.3/5  rDev -7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Can from unknown production date:
Smell: Strong smell of orange and some pineapple. Stronger smell than most brews.
Appearance: I started drinking this out of the can as recommended, but couldn't help myself and finally poured it in my trusty beer glass. There is a ton of shit floating around in this beer! Damn! A nice two finger head with shaving cream thick foaminess is prominent. The head thins as you drink the beer, but this is more than made up for by the awesome lacing that lines the glass till the beer is gone.
Mouthfeel: Somewhat chewy with a bit of weight to it, yet this is a good thing for me as I will drink a lot of any beer, be it light or heavy, long as it tastes good.
Taste: I honestly must say, this is unlike any IPA I've ever had. It has this unique, sweet thing going on in the beginning that I can't quite put my finger on(combo of grapefruit, orange and apple?) and then balances itself out in the end, with a slightly bitter finish that is expected of an IPA.
Overall: Definitely a unique IPA. The beginning of this thing's taste is what sets it apart from the rest for me. It starts off with that unique flavor, then finishes with it gently, and fades out nicely. Give credit to The Alchemist for producing a unique brew that leans toward the heavy side but is definitely drinkable. Good stuff. 1,330 charactersPsilohsaiBiN, Nov 10, 2012
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5First of all this is my favorite beer definitively. Its in the top 5 best things about living in Vermont for me (I still lovermont) so take this review with a grain of salt if you must 
Can to HFS sniffer but I went ahead and drank one straight from the can because the paragraph on the back tells me to.
A:Pours like an DIPA should hazy cloudy orangey honey with plenty of hop floaters and completely opaque with a nice fluffy white head. 
(rest of review is direct from the can)
S:citrus hop smells are more powerful then any beer I've ever smelled its overwhelming and fantastic at the same time. There is definitely hints of pine resin from the blast of hops but other then hops there really isn't anything else but in a DIPA thats all i need.
T: This stuff is liquid hop juice there really just aren't many beers that can even compare. There is just a massive amount of hop flavor (citrus orange pine resin) and bitterness with a wide range but they do not overpower one another and still maintain balance. This thing is the hop bomb of all hop bombs and it still tastes balanced. WTF?!?!??! 
M:Oily and dripping with resin you can feel it in your mouth for a long time after just a single sip. It is very pleasant though and I consider it the proper bitterness feel as it is good and matches the tremendous amount of hops used
O: LIke I said I love this beer, I don't know what I will do if/when I leave VT it really is that good it makes my day every time I pick it up and never lets me down I can't recommend it enough. Get it if you like ipa's it is the top of the mountain. 1,590 charactersPinknuggets, Nov 10, 2012

S- Huge aroma of hop resin. Tons of citrus fruits with grapefruit coming through the most. Definitely a pine and herbal note in the nose as well. Tough to get better than this aroma.
T- Hops, hops and more hops. Grapefruit up front that gives way to huge tropical fruit flavors like pineapple and guava.
M- Medium to high carbonation levels with a huge bite. Flavor allows it to be very drinkable.
O- Certainly one of the best IIPAs out there. Surprisingly different from Pliny and Hopslam in a good way. 693 charactersstephenjmoore, Nov 08, 2012

Smell – I would have liked to smell this in a glass, but the smell of hops and citrus jump out just sniffing out of the can. 
Taste – Huge hops are incredibly well balanced with a sweet malt. A little bit less piney/citrus than a Pliny. More of a slightly toasted hop than the Pliny as well.
Mouthfeel – Perfect amount of carbonation. Medium body.

S - Grapefruit and citrus. Very clean. Not over the top but prevalent. Overall it has a great aroma and it's not about the intensity but rather the completeness. 
T - If you don't like it, you are just wrong. It is a very balanced blend of bitterness and sweetness. It isn't sweet, but it is balanced in the sense that the sweetness is not ever overpowering. 
M - Very smooth and perfect carbonation. This is not up for debate. 
O - There is the magic that is heady topper, but there is also the facts. The facts are that even if you want to be hater you cannot. It is a very balanced, hoppy and smooth IPA. It is hard to imagine that this is the best beer I will ever taste, but it is harder yet to imagine a beer being superior.

Huge hoppy smell. Orange, pine, pineapple, bit of peach, strong citrus. Some sweetness, too. No sign of malts. Really just a giant hop bomb.
Taste is similar. Ridiculous amount of hops, piney, grassy, then some citrus, a bit of orange, lemon, some light sweetness. No sign of malts at all. 
Mouthfeel is great, medium thickness, decent carb, but not a ton. Might be better if it was just slightly thinner, but still excellent. 
This thing is a hop monster. A top two DIPA for me. Will definitely be seeking this out again in the future. 702 charactersrodkin, Nov 02, 2012

Luckily a local pub had it on tap and all the travelling was well worth it. Appearance wise it is cloudy with a grainy foamy head. Not overly pretty but i know this is meant to be drunk straight out of a can, so i wont hold that against them. Hops hit the nose straight away in a big american way, citrusy, piney, tropical, but underneath it all is a reasuring earthy malt base. Tastes a lot like it smells. A bunch of wonderful things coming together in a way that isnt completely cohesive, but complimentary enough that you can enjoy everything together or pick out the various delicious elements, like a farmers market salad. Really, really like this. its got a nice oily mouthfeel, lively carbonation and finishes clean and moreish. taste well rounded, complete, refreshing a little raw, but in a surprisingly endearing way. Would drink a lot of these, but i dont live in Vermont so i can't. 964 charactersjmaharaj, Oct 31, 2012

I'm drinking from the can as I am instructed to by it...
Appearance - can art is awesome. The dood's head is exploding hops!!!
Smell - I was worried I wasn't going to be able to smell the full aroma through the can, but I can! A lot of hops filling my nose through this small can hole.
Taste - really does live up to all the hype for me, an amazing representation of hops in this beer.
Mouthfeel - great
Overall - very very good. I hope everyone has a chance to try this beer. 595 charactersBills453, Oct 28, 2012

4.64/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I am reviewing based on a 16oz can poured into a pint glass. I regularly drink this right from the can but made the pour for purpose of this review. I've had it on tap as well.
A-Pours a very hazy light golden with a hint of orange or light copper. It is definately not amber. This pour produced a 3+ finger head, white and fluffy, that slowly tapered to a film. There is clear evidence of sediment floating about, colloids. A little lacing.
S- Wow! A citrus hop punch in the kisser! Grapefriut to me, tart. Call it lemon, orange, tropical if you want to, that's ok as well. No matter, the aroma could fill an arena as soon as the top is popped. I cannot get enough!
T-Citus hop on the lip, tongue, taste buds, etc. I pick up a bit of oily pine., but hops rule.
M- The hops just keep on coming, but they never overrun, overstate, or overpower. This is a bold, yet drinkable body, nicely carbonated, too. Smooth as well as tart, with bite without bitterness. There's a drop of pine resin. It's just right.
O- This beer is not sold in NJ, nothing's perfect! 1,060 charactersNiceTaps, Oct 28, 2012
4.69/5  rDev +0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Very hazy amber color, dirty juice look with a lot of particulate, with just over one finger of head that had excellant retention. The head eventually settles to a thick cap. Surprising lack of lacing is left down the glass. The beer is nothing great to look at.
All hop aroma with mostly tropical fruit and citrus smells. It is a very good hop aroma, but not the best of the style.
Not the best aroma but it is the best tasting DIPA I have had. It is bitter but not brutal. Hop dominant but malt does add some sweetness and flavor. Alcohol is warming but is not too hot or distract from the hop goodness. This goodness comes in the way of tropical fruit, citrus, and herbal flavors.
Wonderful texture thanks to a solid body and perfectly matched carbonation. It is lively but not harsh and far from dull.
Arguebly the best DIPA out right now. Even if I had ready access to this beer I am not sure I would want to drink more than one can at a sitting. But I would love to have more than one can a year of this great beer. 1,025 charactersmorimech, Oct 27, 2012

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally, I got my hands on this. Here we go. I'm going to drink from the can, as instructed on the can, but I will pour a bit so I can comment on the appearance. Aromas on popping the can are strong and abundant. Beautifully balanced oregano-spiced hops roll out, with a strong resiny background and malty sweet backbone. Smells amazing. I poured about a half a tumbler so I could see any head formation, and boy is there. The beer is a slightly hazed, unfiltered, goldenrod coloring with a tall, frothy, big bubbled, off-white head that is an inch and a half and doesn't appear to be going anywhere. Flavors are roasted in the backbone, with a rich, resiny, bitter hops presence that just overflows the palate. The hops spicing is more subtle than the nose was, which works out very well in the total package. Citrus characters roll out across the palate the more you drink, with an undertone of grapefruit tart and bitterness. Delicious. Wet hops flavors are abundant from the initial taste across the board into the aftertaste. Rich, full bodied, and extremely smooth, which supports all of the flavor profiles. The finish is bitter and slightly drying, with a clean overall feel. This beer is fantastic. The more you drink, the more layers of hops flavor reveal themselves. Amazing. This is a tremendous brew! 1,313 charactersGarthDanielson, Oct 23, 2012

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap in a snifter at the cannery in Vermont.
A: Cloudy golden orange with a small fluffy off white head. Awesome lacing that clings to the side of the glass resembling a spider web by the time you are finished. 
S: One of the best smelling things on earth! It might have helped that the tasting room at the cannery was filled with sweet hoppy scents. I verified that the nose was as good as I remembered when I cracked a can later. Lots of herbal pine and resinous hops mixed with fruity tropical citrus. 
T: This beer is no joke. I would classify it as the smoothest tasting hop juice you can imagine. Lots of late kettle addition hops. Tons of hop flavor. Crisp with lots of pine, resin, and grapefruit/orange hops up front. Slightly bitter at first that transitions into the best tasting sweet tropical citrus hop flavor that lingers. Slightly sweet malt profile balances the hop bitterness very well. 
M: Crisp with a medium-full body. Really smooth with a nice syrupy consistency. Perfectly carbonated. I could drink this every day of my life. 
O: Honestly, this beer meets all the hype. There are a lot of rarities out there that are really sought after that do not live up to their hype. This beer absolutely does. Easily the best DIPA out there that I have tried (I haven't had younger). 1,302 characterssilentdonkey, Oct 23, 2012

About halfway through opening the can mango, grapefruit, and honey filled the room and that's before the damn thing was even open! The aroma is just outrageous. The flavor is incredibly tropical, filled with ripe melon, pine, lemon and more candy-like grapefruit juicy sweetness. Ridiculously unique and delicious. Some serious craftsmanship went into this shit. Bone dry finish beckons you for another sip.
Mouthfeel I found a bit flat; I guess some people like that, but I prefer lively carbonation and I think this would benefit from that--again, a preference thing. Overall I'm blessed to have had the #2 IPA on here and feel it's worth the hype. Bell's Hopslam is very similar to this and is another excellent beer that will suffice quite nicely til The Alchemist and I again cross paths. 978 charactersHossMcGraw, Oct 20, 2012

Of course they were out of cans, luckily on my way out of town they were restocked and I picked up some (definitely not enough).
A - I drank a little from the can and poured there the rest into my Duvel glass to get a good look at it. It was hazy/cloudy light orange color with pieces floating in it
S - A big, fresh aroma of bitter citrus and piney hops. There is also a hint of orange and grapefruit.
T - Wow. Very similar to the aroma. Dry and piney with a rush of citrus hops. Bitter with a semi-sweet malty balance
M - Good carbonation and medium bodies. It drinks relatively smooth for the ABV and hop content.
O - Definitely recommend this beer if you can get it. Definitely recommend driving to get this beer if needed. I enjoyed it. I didnt mind the fact that deliciousness was floating in the beer when poured out of the can, probably why the recommend drinking from the can. Awesome stuff either way. 1,037 charactersBeerTwigs, Oct 17, 2012

A- A murky golden flow cascades from the can, creating a formidable head of about two fingers length. The lace clings to the glass like snow crystals upon a frosted window-foreboding and glorious.
S- We dip our noseys into the glass and are enveloped into a miasma of tropical fruit. The perfumed citrus beckons us onward. We heed its call and take our first sips of this delectable concoction.
T- A hoptastic journey, notes of citrus balance the hop sensations
M- A dense body caressed our cheeks and raised our spirits. The carbonation was sheer perfection.

S - Lots of flavorful bitter citrus and piney aromas, orange and pineapple, herbal, heavenly. Literally smells like raw pellet hops.
T - Piney bitter explosion up front mostly piney and semi dry up front, malty sweetness briefly kicks in followed by another more intense burst of citrusy hoppyness through the finish, straw/grassy finish. I've eaten a few whole hops before and its slightly reminiscent of that.
M - Medium bodied or so. Very drinkable and quenching as I find all aggressively hopped brews. Appropriate carbonation.
O - Finally, I made it to Central VT to pick up a few 4packs. It met all of the hype. No idea what it looks like but I dont care, based off of everything else this beer is perfect so its getting a 5. I have a feeling if I poured this into a can there would be a lot of hop reminents mixed in. Raw flavorful hops 925 charactersMacQ32, Oct 16, 2012

First gulps from the can an then poured into a standard pint glass. 
Poured an opaque light golden with tons of bits floating all around, totally unexpected. Less than a finger head leaving light tracing as it was drank. 
Smell was overpowering of grapefruit hoppiness with slight pine nose. Seriously could have smelled this all night, someone at Yankee Candle make this a fragrance!
Mouthfeel was slightly thick and resiney that perfect for the taste that was to follow. 
Cannot believe how stinking good is. Grapefruit wallop with other citrus flavors following, most prominently orange. Solid malt backbone that stays out of the way but providing the necessary balance to make this every bit as deserving as its ranking. 
Overall this is one of the best beers I've had. Pliny the Elder was somewhat of a disappointment to me so East Coast wins this round. IMO that doesn't happen often in the hop realm. 953 charactersharperman69, Oct 15, 2012

Smell is of abundant hops. Smells of pinaeapple, mango, grapefruit and a little peach.
Starts with a grapefruit resiny hop flavor. Finishes with a big hop oil, grapefruit bitterness. Quite bitter but the bitterness is well incorporated. Taste from the can comes in waves. Poured it is a little less dynamic.
Mouthfeel is of course resiny. 496 charactersPowderhornphil, Oct 13, 2012

S - Wow. Burst of grapefruit, mango, orange, and balanced off with some honey sweetness, some pine and grass. Very nice.
T - Incredibly drinkable, and the nose follows through in the taste here. It provides a ton of sweetness up front with fruity hop character, but remains incredibly balanced. Finishes with just a tinge of bitter, piney hop.
M - Crisp, full, and smooth. As I said, it's incredibly drinkable. Solid amount of carbonation.
Overall - Incredible. Lives up to the hype. And absolutely delicious beer. An experience every beer drinker needs to have. 691 charactersBeerBuckeye, Oct 13, 2012

A: Didn't get to see what was inside but the can is a gorgeous pint with a sweet black/grey color scheme. Definitely one of the coolest designs i have seen.
S: This thing just reeks of fruit, getting some mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and passion fruit all combined into an orgasmic aroma.
T: Holy cow, one of the most refreshing, fruity, drinkable IPA's i have ever had. Loads and Loads of Citrus on the palate along with notes of mango, pine, and orange apricot. Has a sweet malt backbone in the middle that leads to a fruity bitterness aftertaste. Wow.
M: Mouthfeel was surprisingly light, with medium carbonation. This beer is extremely drinkable. One of the smoothest beers i have had, and enjoying it from the can certainly helps.
O: Well i would say this is the best DIPA i have had, and i have had a lot of the top competitors offerings of this style. I was most blown away by the Citra hop presence, balance perfection, and drinkability. This is a must have! 1,128 charactersmnphish, Oct 12, 2012

A - on the lighter side for DIPAs with nice 3/4" inch foam that recedes over time and continues to leave a 2mm lacing
S - fresh citrus fruit, sweetness (malt?), a hybrid of orange and grapefruit, hint of pine but not as much as most IPA/DIPAs I love
T - Perfect balance for a DIPA. Minimal bitterness, while still somehow maintaining the integrity of the hops. A nice malt backbone without making it seem bready and sweet
M - Juicy. Each sip made my taste buds release juices making me think I was hungry. Probably just my subconscious hungry for the next sip
O - A fantastic DIPA. One that if available locally, would become my go to beer. Unfortunately Vermont is not near enough and my penchant for wanting to try new beers, makes me trade half of what I bring back each trip. 882 charactersjuliusseizure, Oct 05, 2012

A: drink from can (but I had an extra one so I poured it into a glass... and the appearance is a murky/light brown with a tons of crap floating around... its actually not all that appealing looking) But since this one clearly states to drink from the can, I will grade the appearance based on the can's appearance. 
S: awesome explosion of piney hops, deep tropical fruits such as mango, grapefruit, slight peach, and mega orange peel.
T: like the nose, this has an awesome balance of tropical fruits and piney hops. Orange peel, mango, grapefruit and peaches all are very well balanced together and there is a slight honey note that sits along side of this drawing away some of the piney bitterness. 5.0
M: fairly light bodied and quite light on the tongue. It leaves an awesome bitter hop note on the tongue and it finishes with a quick creaminess that quickly becomes more dry, but it is quite delightful.
O: well, this one most definitely lives up to the hype. I would love to try this side by side against PtE, Zombie Dust and Hopslam to see how they each compare to each other. But overall, I find this one just simply awesome. The big tropical fruits are very well balanced with the big piney hops aren’t overwhelming on the palate. The brew is quite refreshing and has a very high drinkability. And the bitterness that is left on the palate actually creates an urge to take another sip. 1,468 characterstut2528, Oct 03, 2012

A - hazy bronze, like a yellow Post-it note left in the dash and faded by the sun. 1 inch head, but that settles down after a bit. 
S - citrus and pine all around. Mango / pineapple / grapefruit. Also a yeasty and slightly musty hint as well. Did I leave anything out?
T - Pretty much perfect. Smooth hop roller-coaster with malty loop-de-loops. Bitterness is present, but not overbearing...more of a whiffle ball bat than a Louisville Slugger. Bread and biscuit. Sugary and sweet. Hints of honey and maybe some lemon for good measure as it warms. Overall, terrific.

4.68/5  rDev +0.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Can thanks to juliusseizure. Enjoyed from the can, because my mother taught me to follow directions.
Appearance: Yeah, yeah... I know. Its just a can, But I truly enjoy the way this can looks. The glossy metallic with only black is pretty badass in my opinion.
Smell: Tough to get a whiff out of that little opening, but what does come out it so inviting, Huge grapefruit, pineapple, and mango. A little bit of pine, but just ever so slightly. Nice honey sweetness supports.
Taste: Incredible grapefruit, orange juice, and pineapple. A pretty supportive caramel sweetness bolsters the juicy affair, but lets the hops shine. A light resin and citrus lingers on the palate.
Mouthfeel: This is so utterly drinkable. Incredibly juicy, with a wonderful prickly carbonation. A pretty substantial bitterness that I don't remember the last time I reviewed this. 
Overall: I have no idea how old the can I reviewed the last time was, but this one blows it away, and I know it was less than a week old. Incredible stuff, lives up to the hype, and blows Pliny out of the water in my opinion. 1,085 characterscfrances33, Oct 02, 2012

It is great that we can zip up to Vermont and bring a couple of cases home for sharing over the summer. Of course, the warning "drink from the can" does make a difference. I did pour some in a snifter, but you lose some of the smell and the creaminess.
Appearance (4.5). The can hides the yellow color of the beer -- which isn't all bad. Can't tell about lacing, and the change of color over time.
Smell (5.0). Citrus explosion, with some hints of mango-like sweetness.
Taste (4.5). Hops, citrus tickles the tongue. Mmmmm.
Mouthfeel (5.0). Love the creaminess of the beer. Not too bubbly.
Overall (4.75). A world-class beer. It is no surprise that this beer has been moving up the charts over the last year. 736 characterssbrotschul, Sep 30, 2012

The beer has a finger tall dense and creamy off-white head that slowly reduces to a mottled thick film covering the entire surface of the beer and a thick ring at the edges of the glass. Moderate amounts of lacing are observed.
S: Huge aromas of citrus and tropical hops - lots of citrus/grapefruit along with pineapple, mango, and peach tropical aromas. The smell of this beer makes me want to drink it, and want more and more of it.
T: Just like the smell, the taste of this beer is completely dominated by the hops. Moderate to strong flavors of grapefruit/citrus, pineapple, mango, and peach hops with a light amount of bitterness that does not linger. Upfront there is a light amount of malt sweetness.
M: Light to medium bodied with moderate amounts of carbonation. Extremely smooth and creamy.
O: Poured half the can into a glass for my review and drank the other half from the can as recommended on the can. This is definitely a world class DIPA, great aroma and great flavor...and it comes in a can to top it off. This beer is super easy to drink but I think it could really sneak up on you because the alcohol is very well hidden. Delicious! 1,278 charactersdbrauneis, Sep 28, 2012

The brewers at The Alchemist are forthright in why Heady Topper should be enjoyed from the can. While the beer pours a gorgeous ruby-amber, tan chunks of what I believe to be yeast and hop resin spread throughout the beer. They do not affect the mouthfeel in or out of the can, though. If you can stomach the visuals, I highly recommend pouring the beer in a large snifter to experience the explosion of citrus and herbal aromas from the hops. The taste: it's like an orange was cross-bred with a hop and squeezed into the can. There is a perfect bittersweet balance at play here. I could drink these one after the other if availability allowed me to,
Simply put, this is a world-class IIPA. As far as I'm concerned, it's the new flagship for the style. I'm glad I got it when I did as I'm sure future releases will reach Pliny the Young levels of insanity. 895 charactersJimsArcade, Sep 24, 2012

4.39/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Reasonably fresh can, as fresh as I can get them in Europe. Thank you PaulMcConnell, been dying to try this hype monster since I first heard of it. Canned September 5th, had September 23rd. Poured a small amount into a glass for the appearance.
A: A muddy yellow attractive looking DIPA. Foam dies down very quickly: is this intentional because of the can drinking gimmick, or is there just not enough attention to details like PH levels during brewing?
S: O... M... G. This is where this beer shines. Waves upon waves of citrus. Pineapple is predominant, followed by overripe peach. Slight lemon and orange zest. Some honey and even a tiny bit of booze. Every time you take a whiff off this, you get something new.
T: Everything you get on the smell is what hits the palate first. After the swirl and swallow, it magically turns into a dry bitterness that cleans the palate completely. I might have enjoyed some more fruitiness, which is why it scores lower in the flavor department for me than i.e. the Three Floyds Zombie Dust. It beats any other IPA I've had in the smell department hands down, but the taste just turns overly dry and bitter for me. Not disappointing, but a lot different from what I expected.
M: Nice medium carbonation that befits the style beautifully and makes this beer insanely light (and dangerous) to drink. You need to drink this fairly fast though, as mine went almost completely flat after a good ten to fifteen minutes.
O: Wow. It's hard to say this considering there are so many different styles, each with their own distinct smell and taste profiles, but this is probably the best smelling beer I've ever had. The pineapple and peach aroma is simply divine and one of the easiest 5/5 I've ever handed out. I would drink this by the case-load for the rest of my life, if only it wasn't damn near impossible to get here in Europe. I'm very thankful to have tried this, and it was very interesting to taste a non-West Coast IPA that's still considered one of the world's finest.
A true honor and a reminder to how very humbling it is to be a part of this great community. Thanks again Paul! 2,128 charactersDennoman, Sep 23, 2012

4.09/5  rDev -12%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a can to a nonic pint
A: Well the first thing you notice is the dank appearance and a s$%t-ton of suspended yeast...I'd assume this is why the brewers have all-cap instructions to drink straight from the can - they don't want to scare you off!
S: But without a proper pour, you're not going to experience the bold, robust bouquet, which will result in an improper review, IMHO. Orange rind meddled with various ripened fruit teases your senses up-front. Booze and piny, vinous hop-essence surround the bouquet, with lingering sweet, bready malts.
T: Ripe citrus meets vinous hop astringency at the front of the palate. Orange pith blends nicely with toffee-sweet malts. There's a unique dank element (unique to the IPA's that surround me in San Diego) to the brew, I suspect from the yeast, that cuts through the malty sweetness, accentuating hop astringency. Finishes long and bitter.
M: Chewy for the style; as oily-slick as I've come across.
OK...there's no question that this is a good beer. A damn good beer. But #3 in the world? I can name 5 or 6 new imperial IPA's I've tried locally that are better crafted than this (Super IPA, The Pupil, this year's batch of summer YuleSmith to name a few). And they don't need to hide in a can. This points to a geographical bias that I've suspected of BeerAdvocate for some time...I'm sorry, but there's no way this is better than Pliny the Elder or any number of Alpine's IPA's. That being said, this shouldn't be reviewed against expectations. If I was handed this blind - say, in a keg cup so you don't see the crazy complexion - I'd be talking about it all night. It delivers on all the levels a fan of imperial IPA's expect (other than appearance). But given that this was pretty hard for me to come by I'll probably stick with more local treats. 1,814 charactersrand, Sep 23, 2012

Smell: This is not an overpowering hop explosion like I was expecting but it does have a well designed blend of hops that work together.
Taste: I have drunk quite a few IPA’s over the years and this maybe the best that I have ever had. The hops dominate the flavor but that isn’t all that I can taste the malt does make an appearance but it isn’t a long appearance but it does make for a well balanced beer that still has all the makings of one of the best IIPA’s in the world. 
Mouthfeel: This is a tasty medium to heavy bodied beer that isn’t as easy drinking as some IIPA’s but a world class IIPA shouldn’t be able to drink like a BMC. The hops of the beer should stick around for a while. 863 charactersraznug, Sep 22, 2012

Smell: Whoa. Very strong citrus burst as soon as the can is cracked. Pineapple is the dominant aroma. Almost overwhelming.
Taste: Grapefruit, pineapple, obviously incredible hops. It lingers and doesn't let up for a good 20 seconds. Expands in your mouth. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth like Miles Davis at his Kind of Blue peak. Toes the line of having a creamy feel but doesn't quite get there. Pretty much perfect.

I could smell big tropical fruits upon opening the can. Pineapple sweetness, juicy hops, mint, really intense fresh hop aroma.
Taste doesn't disappoint either. More ripe tropical fruit, more citrus than the nose, incredibly clean bitterness and finish. An explosion of hops but insanely balanced and drinkable.

The can is always a wonderful site and I rarely pour it out into a glass unless sharing. 
Smell is juicy and big. Like cutting into a fresh grapefruit, notes of mango, tropical rinds and touches of pine. It's BIG. 
Huge juicy citrus sunshine fruit explosion. Yeah, whatever that means, it's what it is. It walks the line of having some of that boozy burn you sometimes get from a double but it's pulled back by the pulp and pine bitterness that cleanly finish it off. 
Great balance in the mouthfeel of juiciness and a clean dry punctuation.
It's probably my favorite beer right now. It's worth trading for to try at least once and any time I can I have people pick some up for me or get it myself. It's drinkable, great flavor and gives you the right buzz. If you're an IPA drinker, get some. 987 charactersPhoptos, Sep 18, 2012

Poured at fridge temp into an opaque ceramic mug. Peering down in there, it looks like a good murky orange color, and I vaguely recall that it looks good in a glass.
Smells like tropical fruit salad laced with honeysuckle, honey, thai iced tea, and caramel malt.
Massive tropical fruity, floral hop flavor, and deep earthy, rooty bitterness. Fairly dry, just enough sweetness to make it even more delicious. Some caramel, and a long bitter finish.
Squishy, fine carbonation, with the texture otherwise driven by mouthdrying bitterness.

Pours a light golden orange with 1 finger of creamy white head. Reduces to thin film which clings to edge of glass, good lacing. 
Best smelling beer of all time! Gobs of tropical fruit, Mango, Passion, orange citrus balance with some pine hops. A touch of grapefruit too and a faint bread chocolate. 
Taste is a tropical fruit paradise balanced by a chalky restrained bitter. Juicy mango, peach, passion fruit balanced by lemon juice turns to a grapefruit and pine hop finish. Juicy flavors throughout balanced by a light bitter.
Fine champagne like bubbles fade away to a pine hop finish and lingering juicy grapefruit peal with no trace of alcohol. 720 charactersWillytee3, Sep 17, 2012

Appearance:??? Enjoyed from the can. 
Smell: How can this smell so incredible from a can? Huge pine and citrus hop coming from the mouth of the can in sticky sweet waves. There is grapefruit, orange, pineapple, mango along with some piney hop. I'm getting the sweetness that's bringing forth a caramel and maybe a brown sugar. 
Taste: Unbelievable amount of citrus with grapefruit and tangerine, mango and pineapple, an unripe orange peel and a honey sweetness. This is followed by a pine hop bite that does linger well after the sip and swallow. Phenomenal aftertaste on this one with no alcohol present. 
Mouthfeel: I'd call it creamy and drying with a light body. Don't seem to get too much carbonation but just enough to round out the feel. 
Overall: My first ever experience with this beer is one that is memorable to say the least. Simply an intimidating beer with the warnings on the can but in the end the beast is not as scary as you'd think. A surprisingly easy drinking DIPA that I'm delighted I got to try. 1,112 characterssleuthdog, Sep 17, 2012

Just beautiful fruit on the nose. Loads of orange and assorted tropicals. Certainly some pine, but it's restrained. 
Huge juicy fruit up front. Orange, mango, pineapple (you know the drill) with a sugary undercurrent. Bitter finish, but stops short of being brash. Lip-smacking finish makes it hard to savour this one. 
I'm a contrarian, so I like to think when I say something is worth the hype, it's worth the hype. Moreover, I/IPAs aren't always my cup of tea, but this is just a fantastically brewed beer. They deserve all the praise they've gotten. 706 charactersCanuckRover, Sep 17, 2012

A- It does look good, don't get me wrong. Pours with a dark honey hue and a decent head. A bit of hop particle floatin around, I personally don't mind, but it ought to be accounted for in the review.
S- Blows most IPAs out of the water. A wonderful combination of dank, earthiness and a blast of mango, passion fruit. A little bit of everything, all rolled into one. 
T-More of the same. For me, the Mango, Passion fruit citrus notes dominate but I can still recognize some of the earthy qualities noticed in the nose. Dangerously drinkable for the ABV

S- This beer has a nose that I wish every beer had. To me it seems like guava, passion fruit, citrus all in the front with a slight bit of that nice DIPA malty goodness you would want from a DIPA of this stature. It smells like everything I dream of and then some, probably one of the best beers I've ever smelled.
T- HT is one of the best balanced beers I have ever had. I get grapefruit in the front with those tropical fruit notes guiding to the goodness at the end. HT's are lighter then you expect and go down very smooth. It's way to easy to drink more of these then you thought you did.
M- HT starts out creamy and smooth, almost malty but finishes dry. Amazing mouth feel. Much smoother then most DIPA's
O- My fav-o-rit beer by far. This is my go to on a weekly basis. Being that the brewery is only 6 miles from my house, it's a no brainer on what I'm going to drink. Other then some small batch home brews by a few local VT brewers, this is the best beer I've ever had by far. Looking forward to more releases from the Alchemist in the future. I miss the wide range of Alchemist beers at the old pub. 1,308 charactersvtscooter, Sep 11, 2012

It smells like the tears of beer nerds who demand this be drunk from a glass.
Unknown appearance.
I get aluminum, nickel, and other polycarbonates. I think I can taste the black ink from the screen printing, and the dirt left over from transportation around the rim. Quite interesting, really.
(glass)
Big pine and citrus coming off of this. It’s dank, sweet, glorious, and un believably enticing.
Very hazy and straw yellow in color and there are little floaters in it. It has a gorgeous fluffy white head with lacing that sticks to the side of the glass. Not the best looking beer, but one of the best looking heads I have ever seen. It is my hope that they want you to drink this out of the can due to the appearance being hazy and somewhat unattractive.
A tidal force of hops washes over my palate.. This beer is essentially hop juice. I think those floaters were bits of hop particles (after reading the description on the can, I think I’m right). Big big pine, citrus, pineapple, guava, and papaya. It has a smooth, creamy mouthfeel with minimal carbonation and a medium body. This beer is a pure delight to behold, and absolutely is a work of art.
Note: The can review was a joke, I drank half from the can, then poured the rest into a glass to enjoy for comparison. I did find the flavors stronger when drinking form the can, it was interesting. 1,369 characterstlazaroff, Sep 09, 2012

Wet resiny sticky hops dominate the nose. Flavor follows the nose and has a great meaty malt backbone to back it up. Medium mouthfeel. This tastes amazing. Its worthy of all the praise it gets.

4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Pours very cloudy light orange with a huge 2 finger foamy snow white head that was full of bubbles and faded slowly, leaving very good foamy lacing. 
Smells incredible; the pine and fresh citrus is like sticking your nose in a hop and then a tangerine. Aroma is sweet and hoppy, with grapefruit, orange, pineapple, tangerine, mango, citrus hops, fresh piney hops, caramel, floral hops, toasted grains, tea leaf, herbs and light spices like pepper, coriander and brown sugar or cinnamon; just enough malt and grains to make this a perfect smelling IPA – literally perfection. 
Tastes is equally as awesome, sweet and hoppy with grapefruit, orange, pineapple, lemon, tangerine, mango, citrus hops, piney hops, caramel, floral hops, toasted grains, tea leaf, herbs, sweet malt, tart sour apple or pear, and spices like pepper, mint, coriander and brown sugar. Good God this is amazing, with such juicy citrus flavors that ooze orange and tangerine with a slight grainy feel that allows the hops to shine and seem fresh picked with enough malt balance to flow down like a pale ale and hide the ABV completely. 
Mouthfeel is light and crisp, with a medium chewy body, average carbonation and a very bitter finish like you just drank a glass of grapefruit juice, yet it was still incredibly smooth and easy to drink. The citrus flavor that lingers almost tastes better than most other beers. The only shame of drinking it was that you could no longer smell it, but the total experience was worth it. 
A hop lovers dream, this was almost as impressive out of a glass as it was out of the can where there is some mystique in play and bold instructions to drink it that way listed on the can. Get some if you can as this is one of the best beers on the planet. The focus that the brewery puts into brewing this beer perfectly has paid off as this could be the best beer that I’ve ever had.
2/3/13-thanks to my friend Jim for hooking me up with a 4 pack of cans...I cracked one today and it was so fresh and hoppy that this re-confirms that this is the best beer that I've ever had. Drank it from the can and the piney and floral hop flavors were so strong yet so smooth that I had to force myself to slow down so I could savor every sip. 2,237 charactersCHickman, Sep 07, 2012

4.58/5  rDev -1.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Had two glasses of this on my birthday. If this even wasn't in the afternoon and I didn't have to drive myself home I'd have had quite a few more.
A - This thing looks like a cider really. Dark orange and copper highlights with what also looks like pulp. Very cloudy and opaque. The head consists of what you would expect on a latte, literally it looks like there is cinnamon in it. Lacing caked all over the glass. Perfect looking DIPA.
S - Suprisingly I actually picked up pale malts on the first whiff. But really this thing is hopped to the hilt. Grapefruit, flower petals, and a bit of honey. 
T - Mango and grapefruit overload. Orange peel, honey, and some subdued pine flavor. There's a wave of bitterness on the end of flavor with no drying effect that some hop bombs can do. No booze tasted at all.
M - Saturating. Mouth coated with the amazing fruit flavor and stickyness of the hop. High carbonation and low to medium bodied. Could easily drink 4 or more of these until the booze would start to kick in.
O - This is a heady DIPA for sure. Incredible fruit profile and bitterness. Taste more fruit than hops but nonetheless it was a pleasure to consume. Cant think of a much better beer to have on my birthday. 1,225 charactershaazer, Sep 07, 2012

A- Pours a honey gold, with a nice 2 inch head, slighly murky with sediment which is why it gets a 4 and not a 5, although i could care less about the floaties in there.
S- WOW this this beer has a nose and a half, guava, passion fruit, citrus all in the front with a slight bit of that nice funk you would expect from a DIPA of this stature. It smells like my dreams and then some, probably one of the best noses I've ever smelled.
T- Man this thing kills other DIP's without even trying, i'm getting grapefruit in the front with those tropical fruit notes guiding to the funky goodness that lies in the end. It taste so good i even enjoy belching it out. Finishes slightly bitter but it doesn't sit heavy in your stomach, you could drink a few of these and not notice how fast they go.
M- Creamy almost malty but finishes dry, outstanding once again!
O- Amazing beer, one that i intend to drink for the rest of my life. 984 charactersNicolay3535, Sep 06, 2012

Thanks immensely my friend! Served from can into an oversized wine glass. Poured red-orange with a half finger white head that subsided to a minimal amount quickly. Maintained decent lacing throughout the glass. The aroma was comprised of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, fruit, and fruit hop. The flavor was of sweet malt, citrus, citrus hop, onion hop, earth, and fruit hop. It had a medium feel on the palate with medium-high carbonation. Overall this was a fairly great brew. I am so excited I was finally able to try this one now that they can it. Wow! What a beer it was… It had some aspects that reminded me of Gubna, but had a huge amount of balance going on to keep your palate nice and happy so it did not succumb to a palate hop onslaught. Very well balanced and inviting after each sip. You know what… Notre Dame is playing Navy right now as I’m typing this up on my laptop, I think I will have another one of these right now straight from the can!

4.86/5  rDev +4.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5My deepest thanks go out to Urbancaver. Because of his thoughtfulness and good nature, I was given the rare opportunity to try this beer. I'm told it's about 5 days old at the time of this review.
I did NOT pour this beer from the can into a glass. I suppose it's a decision every beer drinker makes for him or herself, but I decided to respect the brewer and drink it the way they want me to drink it. Therefore, I simply had to give it an average rating on appearance (well, slightly above average since I liked the look of the can so much). Trust me, it was the only thing ``average'' about this beer.
After popping the top I took a whiff of the contents and was treated to a powerful salvo of ripe tropical fruit notes. The nose is dominated by oranges, peaches, pineapples, and grapefruit, all supported by a cake-like richness. There are also faint traces of lemon and pine. It simply smells awesome!
The body seems full for this style and the mouthfeel is firm and somewhat creamy. Almost syrupy. The flavor is simply off-the-charts good. If there's one thing I don't like in a big IIPA, it's excessive sweetness. For me, sweetness and extreme bitterness combine to create a medicinal flavor that I find unappetizing. This beer seems to have ZERO sweetness, even as it warms. There's just barely enough malt sweetness to smooth out the hoppy bitterness.
As for that hop bitterness, the flavor starts off as a smooth apricot-like taste and gradually builds in hop intensity. There is no place on the palate where the flavor just dies on you. Instead, it just keeps growing in intensity all the way across the palate, developing so quickly that I can hardly process it. To the best of my ability, I detect soft floweriness up front, crisp citrus-like notes of orange and grapefruit at mid-palate, and stringent pine-like notes in the back. There is no trace of booze on the back of the palate either. There is just a lingering finish that seems to involve every hop flavor you've ever tasted. The drinkability is amazing for such a flavorful IIPA. You KNOW it's very bitter, but it tastes so good that you don't care. You just sip it and marvel at the flavor.
What can I say? This beer is amazing and, as usual, I can see why beeradvocates love it so dearly. Truth be told, it doesn't taste all that different than, say, Stone Ruination. It is just so damn perfectly dialed-in. There is no excess sweetness, a perfect balance of hop flavors, and it pushes every button on your palate. How a beer this bitter can be this drinkable is beyond me. I wish I could somehow do a head-to-head comparison between this and Pliny the Elder (it's been so long since I've had it), but living in Kentucky makes it nearly impossible to get both beers fresh at the same time. Heady Topper is probably one of the 3 or 4 most enjoyable beers I have ever had. 2,850 charactersdeadonhisfeet, Aug 31, 2012
4.5/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A - Pours a hazy orange, sunset with snowflake particles swimming around. A big 3" froth comes after the pour and stays around like your annoying uncle on the holidays. 
S - Pine hops with a citrus zest. Just a nice combination of those 2 scents and not much else. Which is quite nice for an IPA. 
T - Citrus hits first and then the pine comes in. A really nice blend but the pine wins the overall fight. 
M - Sticky with solid hop aftertaste and medium carbonation. 
O - A very good IPA. I highly recommend it. 515 charactersbrstls4drmrs, Aug 30, 2012

Appearance: This beer poured a one finger head. It is a pale orange yellow color with some clarity and signs of carbonation coming up through the glass. Super nice lacing on the glass as the beer was drank too. 
Smell: Lots of citrus on the nose. Plenty of grapefruit and tangerine aromas from the hops. Bready and caramel notes in there to balance it off as well. 
Taste: Super citrus flavors. Tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, mangos, etc. The breadiness and caramel malts balance this beer out well where there is a subtle lingering bitterness and the alcohol is not at all detectable.
Mouthfeel: silky smooth, medium to full bodied, medium carbonation, some nice subtle bitterness, and easy to drink.
Overall: Pretty solid DIPA. This is one a person should not pass and order one at the bar or buy a can or four pack. Very delicious and loved by all. 1,022 charactersFlounder57, Aug 27, 2012

A: Very cloudy honey orange with a cream colored head. Good retention. Very nice lacing.
S: Lots of sweet tropical fruits, mango, papaya, pineapple. Simcoe hops? Sweet malty backbone.
T: Follows the nose. Again, all those kinds of hop flavors I love and nice bitter bite in the finish. Not overpowering though. The sweetness helps balance it out as does the carmel malt backbone which I feel is bigger than it really tastes. Finishes fairly dry, maybe a little too dry. That would be only real complaint in the taste department. 
M: Medium body. Average to lower carbonation. Feels really slick with all the hop oils.

4.88/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I was able to buy a couple 4-packs of this cult legend during a recent trip to Stowe, Vermont. No buyer's remorse at all! I enjoyed Heady straight from the can–as recommended by the brewery right on the can–but I did have a single serving decanted into a wine glass (I do prefer drinking it straight from the can). 
Appearance (5/5): Emblazoned right on the top rim of each Heady tallboy are the words "Drink From the Can!" The rationale is explained on the back of what I think may be the coolest looking can I've ever come across: the Heady Topper graphic, depicting a rosy-cheeked man downing a can of the brew whilst hops seem to be steaming from the top of his head, has such a classic look. Really cool stuff. If you pour the beer into your favorite glass, you'll find that Heady is an excellent looking beer: it is peach-hued, opaque (unfiltered and unpasteurized), and is topped by a pillowy, two-finger, white head of foam. Beautiful stuff, whether you decide to drink from the can or decant it. 
Smell (4.5/5): The nose on this beer is very good: notes of pine, mango, pineapple, apricot, and, of course, grapefruit spring from the can. Floral. A little sweetness is mixed in there, too, and is reminiscent of dried tropical fruit. The nose isn't perfect, though; this being a canned brew that should be consumed from the can, it's a tad harder to smell the bouquet. 
Taste (5/5): The flavor is super, super hoppy. Dominant flavors are: grapefruit, mango, pine, pineapple. It's fairly dry, but fruity hops lend a nice juiciness and mild sweetness. While heavily hopped, Heady isn't super bitter or abrasive; the bitterness comes on slowly and builds as the resinous hop oils–strong in this brew–coat the tongue with each sip. Though strong, alcohol is not noticeable at all in the flavor.
Mouthfeel (5/5): Heady's a remarkably smooth brew. Medium-light carbonation and medium body seem to suit the flavor profile perfectly. The superb, mildly creamy mouthfeel makes a high-flying hop journey as smooth and clean as possible. 
Overall (5/5): An incredible hop experience, I must say. Big, big flavors all over the place. The most serious hop head will appreciate this beer the most and likely will be in a state of hop nirvana. Non-hop heads won't know what hit them. 2,289 charactershagbergl, Aug 22, 2012

4.89/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Yes I have enjoyed it straight from the can, but today I am reviewing in a glass.
Pours a straw colored gold, mostly clear with a little bit of haze. Foamy white head on top begins to fall quickly. Decent lacing.
Intensely pungent grapefruit aroma explodes out of the glass. You can smell it from 5 feet away. All citrus here, rich and thick in the air. Just a hint of malty sweetness underneath reminds me this in not in fact a freshly sliced grapefruit.
Sweet malt on the palate with sharp grapefruit citrus dominating the taste buds. Smooth even though my mouth is drenched in sweet citrus. There is hop bitterness in there but I forget all about it as I swim through the rich grapefruit flavors.
Slightly dry finish, crisp grapefruit aftertaste. Clean citrus lingers on the palate long after the previous sip.
There is an underlying sweetness to this beer that keeps it from being a straight up grapefruit bomb, but it finishes dry and it is not cloying. Extremely refreshing and nearly overwhelming with hop flavors - if there was a flavor I would want to drown in this would be it. 1,092 charactersneophilus, Aug 22, 2012

A-Two finger head dissipated quickly back into the beer. Not to much lacing going on either. Unfiltered beer with a off amber brown color. Looks heady for a unfiltered double IPA!
S-Earthy grapefruit aroma dominates. Mild lemon/citrus notes with the caramel malts behind it all. Smells great!
T-Get hops throughout the whole palate. The hops arent too overwhelming however. Everything is cohesive until the end where the hops hit the back of the tongue. Leaves great after taste. Get all that earthy citrus hops found in the nose. Has a nice caramel malt profile to help subdue the hoppiness in this beer!
M-Has great mouthfeel. Love unfiltered beers. Slighty chewy. Good carbonation in this.
O-Great beer. Has everything you are looking for in a double IPA! Only thing that its lacking is in the appearance with the minute head retention. As long as the beer smells appetizing and taste good I am happy so nothing to worry about in this beer! 1,061 charactersmikem0487, Aug 21, 2012

4.55/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Rob for acquiring this one. Really cool can, by the way, although I didn't heed the advice to drink from it.
Poured a very hazy orange with a big billowing head that receeded slowly with ample lacing.
Pine and ripe tropical fruit in the smell, and that's where the ride started and it didn't end until the glass was emptied, or nearly emptied sans the heavy sedimentation that had settled into the bottom of the glasses. Smells of pine, tropical fruits, peppery even..almost like the faint cordite that lingers in the air after fireworks.
Flavors of tropical elements, also mint, sap resin, canteloupe, star fruits, watermelon rind..this fella is chaotic, but oh it's flavorful. Hints of the alcohol poking through. Mouthfeel is firm and zesty, excellent carbonation, very well crafted.
This one takes you for quite a ride but in the end it's simply refreshing and tasty. 
Very nice. 898 charactersJackieTH, Aug 14, 2012

S - Amazing smell. Rich and full of fruits. I immediately get pineapple (SImcoe?), mango, and pine. THe smell is luscious almost. 
T - Same as the smell, with just a bit of hop bitterness, and a little bit of alcohol warming. But all very well balanced, with hop flavor taking center stage. The malt sweetness is there to balance it out also. This almost like eating a slice of peach pie - but also nothing like that. Frankly, it's delicious. There are no flaws at all. 
M - Medium, definitely low carbonation, I would have preferred the carb just a tad higher; but maybe that would have masked the flavor. 
O - If you can, please try this beer. I live on the right coast and don't trade, so I haven't been privy to Pliny, but it would be hard for me to imagine it being any better. 857 charactersmattbk, Aug 13, 2012

IPAs are my favorite style of beer, but I usually find DIPAs to be too strongly tasting of alcohol. This beer is incredibly smooth and drinkable despite its high alcohol content and potent hopping. The smell of the heady topper alone is delicious, and the taste is even better, with passionfruit, mango, and piney hop aromas. The heady topper delivers the ultimate hops experience! 474 charactersAriRock, Aug 07, 2012

A - pours a light orange with a one finger eggshell colored head that dissipates within minutes. It's really cloudy and looks more like chill haze cloudiness than non-filtered cloudiness. A fair bit of sediment apparent. 
S - this is where this beer shines in my eyes. A hop explosion filled with tropical notes dominating(mango, pineapple and grapefruit) with a touch of pine. Oranges. A fair amount of alcohol/booze detected in the aroma.
T - hop dominated/hop forward as apparent in the nose. Same hops(appears to be lots of Simcoe) in the taste as in the nose. A fairly clean, firm bitterness lingers. Slightly boozy. A little letdown compared to the aroma, but still an excellent hoppy beer. 
M - on the medium-light side. 
D - not as easy to drink as I expected. The hight bitterness and boozy aspcect hinder the drinkability.
Overall, a very fine beer. I think the hype factor drives up the ratings of this guy a little, but it's very very good. A little more boozy than I liked for the fairly low IIPA 8%abv. The appearance turned me off a bit - it's almost like the brewery knows they hit on all the other aspects and got lazy with the visuals. Glad I got to try it and will pick some up when I have the opportunity. 1,340 charactersbeesy, Aug 06, 2012

A--the first time i had this beer it was actually on tap at blind tiger several months ago. 
i was meeting a friend who works up the street from the tiger, and i had been at some museums all day fucking around.
i had no idea that the tiger did VSK on mondays; that is, a very special keg--had i known, i would've had my ass in there a lot earlier.
i was five or so minutes late to meet my buddy for 6pm, so when i entered he was already there, set up close to the door as it was crammed in the joint.
entering i noticed two things: 1) it was SO PACKED. it's near a happy hour of sorts probably, and everyone is still in here drownin' a glass or five, i thought. and 2) everyone, i mean EVERYONE, was swirling, smelling, even quaffing, what looked like a flame held within a lantern. it was, however, a tulip of some cloudy, intensely bright orange liquid.
my friend, as well, was holding one, and before salutations, he just stuck it in my face, "drink!"
i could not, however, get over the color, which really looked like a flame lantern. 
i did the obligatory swirl and sniff. and drank. it altered, startled me. he said, "heady topper!"
NO WAY.
i tell this story, because, since that day, i've had a lot of this beer, yet each of those subsequent experiences were from out of the can. 
i have not viewed the appearance of this beer ever since, and due to that amazing experience and the brewers' directions, unless it's tapped, i will not ever again. 
S--MANGO. mangoes gone mad; over-, over-ripened lemons and oranges; the earthy rinds of oranges and lemons; grass and grass; the hop madness of chinook, simcoe, centennial. potent.
T--it's like juice. it's so unbelievably refreshing. i'd have this after a run. not too bitter, earthy, piney, biting, aggressive, yet it is all of those things at the same time. it is one of the most pleasant IPAs i've had despite being one of the most hoppy. citrusy, like lemon, grapefruit galore, orange. the mango, tropical flavor profile rocks your shit, too. 
M--Smooth. so refreshing. not a hop milkshake, which is the definitive separation in comparison with the west coast DIPAs. they are so thick, they're fatty--i have found this to be true with MAINE BREW CO., LAWSON'S, etc also. this is smooth as silk despite its profile. amazing.
O--and out of the coolest tall boy i've ever seen. 2,348 characterspatm1986, Aug 02, 2012

A: a very hazy body that is a pale orange color. head is white, but not bright. big bubbles. good retention and lacing. almost too hazy, but i guess it must be fresh then. 
S: pine. grapefruit. very inviting. kiwis. melon. but mostly pine. lots and lots of pine. very good. 
T: a very american hop profile is thorough. the palate is actually sticky. enough sweet malt/caramel flavor is back there, but just detectable towards the finish. a little vanilla? bitterness lingers into the finish but is not over-cloying. 
M: mild carbonation on a full bodied IPA. 
D: like the can says, dangerously drinkable. hands down top 3 DIPA's i can just pick up and enjoy several without being overwhelmed. just lovely. 816 charactersJimmys, Aug 02, 2012
4.92/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5This is incredible stuff, this beer was drank mostly from the can... only poured a sample of it out to enjoy the orange yellow color of it with a nice looking white head on top. Had a nice unfiltered cloudiness to it also. The smell of the beer is very hoppy, lots of pine aromas in it with the delicate floral and citrusy notes in there as well. The taste is probably worthy of a 5.5 honestly. There is no doubt that this has some of the best transitions of flavors I've had from any IPA. There is a huge rush of floral sweet citrus notes on the tongue in the very beginning, as the liquid settles there is a very subtle burst of malts on the tongue right before the aggressive pine resin starts to claw away at your taste buds. The mouthfeel is smoothly carbonated making this beer very easy to drink, it's medium bodied and has a nice dry finish to it. Overall this is something very special, The people up at Alchemist aren't screwing around here, they are setting out to make the best IPA in the world and I would say that they just might have it. This is a beer I would drive to Vermont to get cases of. I thoroughly enjoyed this beer. Looking forward to drinking the next 3 in the pack. 1,193 charactersKnapp85, Aug 02, 2012

Nice frothy snow white head, leaves brief sheets of lacing down glass. Opaque orangish hue with a charming rustic feel to it.
WOWY WOW WOW WOW! This is a citrus bomb in a can, me likey. Orangey pineapple mango piney resony goodness.
This like an adult version of a creamcicle, abundant sweet orange grapefruity goodness. Packs a wallop on the bitterness too. Touch of booze (in a good way) gives way to a hint of grainy malt. Long citrus finish and smoooth bittering.
Creamy smooth with excellant carbonation.
Loved it, ranks up with the exsellant boyking batches and the pliney I had last fathers day. I need a friend in that part of the country to ship. 706 characterswelldigger888, Aug 01, 2012

And I have to say that the alchemist brewery did an exceptional job on this unique beer. For those that can handle the heady topper, maybe you should try the walden. That is a brew made by the alchemist and hill farm brewery together. Very similar to heady topper but much lite. I wish the alchemist made more then 1800 cans of week so that other stores closer to my house would be able to have them.

3.83/5  rDev -17.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Sorry, I had to pour into the glass despite the can's pleading to drink directly. Thick, slowly receding head. Leaves plenty of chunky, blanketing lace. Cloudy, dark gold color.
Very strong evergreen hop smell. Prickly with a touch of citrus rind. Like smelling a bag of hop pellets.
Extraordinarily bitter. Starts off fairly neutrally with a bit of mild pale malt. Still this is a bitter, bitter hop bomb. Be prepared to pucker up. Hop heads shall rejoice, but I think this might be too much of a good thing (and I lean towards more hoppy beers). The body is predictable and appropriate for the style. 
I was very excited to find this beer in Boston, but its hype exceeds my expectations. 692 characterssmcolw, Jul 29, 2012
4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5As instructed, I drank this AMAZING beer directly from the can as well as from a tulip glass. Hands-down, no-doubt one of my Top 3 IPAs of all-time...
Appearance - 4.5 only because the beer does show a lot of sediment that settles at the bottom of the can/glass, but I actually love a beer that has a little "meat on the bones". After pouring in a tulip glass, there was a 2 finger, slightly off-white, tight bubble formation head.
Smell - OUT OF THIS WORLD! There are huge wafts of pineapple and grapefruit to this beer. Heady Topper has an uncanny ability to perfectly mesh the fruit scent with fresh, piney hops. If I were a Genie, I would love to live in this can as my bottle.
Taste - Explosion of hops that resonates in your mouth, perfectly balanced by the slightly-bready malts. And when I say "balanced", I am generously favoring the highly-potent fruity hoppy goodness of this beer. A MUST have. I forgot to mention, one can't even taste the whopping 8% ABV from this beer due to its' heavenly hops.
Mouthfeel - This unpasturized beer has a medium-bodied mouthfeel. Certainly not as light as your typical APA/IPA or as heavy and thick as a Porter/Bock, etc... but it does feel semi-dry after drinking. Mouthfeel and Appearance are overwhelmed by this beer's IMMENSE smell and taste.
Overall, in my opinion, any beer connoisseur needs to add this beer to their beer-"bucket list"... ESPECIALLY for hopheads. 1,421 charactersGeckoPunk, Jul 29, 2012

Utterly blown away that a beer can be this hoppy, this alcoholic, and this smooth and easy to drink. The first sip almost made me cry. There is not a lot I can add after 750+ reviews that hasn't been said. Is there such a thing as perfection? I don't know. But if perfection means a beer can't be improved on, this might be perfect. I don't know how you improve on it....except to relocate the Alchemist to Minnesota so I have easy and frequent access to it. 
A day later I'm still thinking about this beer and trying to figure out how to get some. I suppose this is the way junkies feel about heroin. I wonder if that stuff's any good....
I'm agnostic, but if there is a (non-Mormon) God, may he bless the Alchemist, and watch over them so they can keep making this incredible beer. 1,010 characterslurpy1, Jul 29, 2012

Could not help, but to pour it for a review.
It has a cloudy medium gold color and builds a creamy white head, witch leaves good lacing.
The smell is full of citrusy, fruity and flowery hops.
The taste is an incredible abundance of hop flavors, yet balanced be just enough malt, not to be overpowering. Great mouthfeel and drinkability makes this one probably the best I have tasted yet.

A - Since I've had this before and poured it into a glass, and I'm forced to give an appearance score, AND I'm not inclined to base an appearance score off of can art, I recall it being good as far as head, color, and lacing, but a bit cloudy, likely since the can makes it hard to see when to stop pouring to keep the sediment out of the glass. 
The rest of this review is from the current can. 
S - You get a hint of complex hop aroma from the mouth of the can that smells quite good, but it is obscured by the metallic smell of the can. Points off for that.
T - Whoa. This is the best tasting IPA I've had. It manages to be dank, resiny, citrusy, bright, and with enough of a backbone to not have the hops overwhelm. The hops linger for a minute or so, and then they give way to the honey malt flavor, which lingers a good while longer. You can't really peg a particular hop flavor on this one; the hop profile is far too complex, but it melds together so well that you get all of the flavors without anything sticking out as unbalanced or out of place. Truly remarkable.
M - Nice carbonation, not thick by any means. Perfect mouthfeel to deliver the experience.
O - This is a wonderful beer, head and shoulders above any other IIPA I've had. It loses points for the can thing not really being my bag, and because the amazing flavors don't quite translate to the nose, but this is still the IIPA that beats all the others. Totally worth the hype, and worth seeking out. This beer was painstakingly crafted to not be too boozy, nor too hoppy, nor too malty, and they've absolutely nailed it. The taste is incomparable for the style. 1,738 characterskdb150, Jul 28, 2012

A- Cloudy orange appearance with some good head developed. Looks like grapefruit juice that has settled and is sitting out.
S- Tons of tropical fruit smells in the nose. This is a very good smelling DIPA.
T- Love the fact that there isn't too much of that caramel backbone in most DIPAs that I avoid and that the hops are in the forefront of the beer's taste. It's a tad bit unbalanced but I don't mind it if I'm drinking one can but I would have to stop after the 2nd can because the alcohol isn't completely hidden. 
M- Heavy, almost syrupy beer. Love it. 
O- This isn't the perfect beer to me. The only issue I have with it is the fact that I can taste the alcohol prominently due to the fact that they put in less malts to balance. It would have killed if it had no alcohol trace like the Pliny but at the same time the taste and nose blows virtually all other DIPAs. But it's still damn tasty but I will stop at only drinking one per session and then focus on a more balanced IPA or DIPA such as what Hill Farmstead occurs. 1,094 charactersChicagoJohn, Jul 25, 2012
4/5  rDev -14%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4This beer was kind of hard to review. The can is stamped all over with "Drink from can" so that is how I had it. Very hard to rate appearance with a beer in a can. So, I'll give it a 4.0, assuming from the rest of the characteristics that it would look good in a glass.
Aroma coming out the can was almost all grapefruit.
Taste was full of hops, yet had a nice caramel base underneath that really added balance. Very citrusy, some pine and cut grass.
Mouthfeel was very thick. Lots of hop-oils that left a lasting sticky, dry feeling. 
Overall, I liked this beer a lot - not sure about drinking from the can instead of pouring into a glass, however that is how the brewer recommended so who am I to argue? 709 charactersdoppelmeup, Jul 25, 2012

But for review sake, I poured half of it in a glass to look at it. Appears pale yellow, light orange, cloudy, low carbonation, slight lacing, the way I envision an IPA, like it should be, not deep orange.
Smell: a bouquet of hops! This beer has an incredible blend of flowery, aromatic hops, bitterness is there but at a minimum. 
Taste: not too bitter at all but the best blend of hops I have ever had. There's a veiled sweetness, but the palate is completely enticed by the hop, citrus, and floral profile. If I didn't know any better I would say it has a "cannabis" flavor.
Mouthfeel: for it's style, excellent. Low carbonation lends itself to an astringency. But there's also a classic lager maltiness that keeps it down to earth. If there's ANY downside, just a wee bit hoppy, but I'm not complaining.
Overall: hard to argue that Heady Topper is the best Double IPA I have ever had or will have. I've had good one's but I have to agree with my fellow beer aficianados out there...WOW! 1,065 characterschimaylvr, Jul 23, 2012

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My first review of a beer I choose this one, kindly sent fresh from the northeast. I preface, this offering is being tasted on an afternoon where, sometime following this review i will be trying my first Pliny TE (having arrived simultaneously).. Heady Topper: As a lover of American craft brew for 3 years and having tried, in my mind, a good deal of DIPA's (considering I didn't become a craft beer advocate until relocating to Texas oddly enough), I am more than enthusiastic about this tasting.The hop bouquet is blowing my mind, and in a well-balanced way. Expectations of this beer are met and slightly exceeded (they were phenomenal expectations prior to sampling). Pineapple/ citrusy greatness abounds. With this beer it seems as if I've never appreciated the mouthfeel of this style until now. There is no drawback here. Tasty beyond belief. Balance is impeccable, yet i need to stress how the hops flourish here... is this Simcoe and Citra? Well i dont know, that I wonder though. Anyway out of curiosity I poured a bit less than 1/4 of the can into a Chimay chalice for a visual. I really appreciate an unfiltered IPA made well (prior to this my affinity was for the now-shelved DFH Squall). Im liking the look of murky golden when I know everything else about it is sublime. The lacing with Heady is incredible, and again lacing is something I continue to appreciate but with this beer in a glass it was sticky city (and this from a beerman who spot cleans his glassware well). But yes I have to agree with the brewmastery of Alchemist where the recommendation is to drink from the can. Yes you will surely love it in glassware, but if you love true hop heaven, you will be best to press lips to aluminum. 1,717 charactersTBoneJones, Jul 20, 2012

A - Unfiltered and unpasteurized is, I guess, what makes this beer so cloudy. But yeah, it's basically an opaque amber kind of color with a substantial white head that leaves a thick film. Really good looking.
S - Tropical fruits, citrus (orange), grass. It's a complex nose and very dynamic with temperature. 
T - A good fruity flavor that has just a perfect amount of balancing bitterness. It's sweet (pineapple), for sure, and like the nose, different characteristics come to the fore as it warms. A really well balanced and complex drink
M - It's definitely got a full body to it, but it's not too thick. It's very smooth, and a touch drying
O - Look. My memory's not great, but this is one the best hoppy beers I've had. I wish I could stock my fridge all the time with it. It really approaches perfection as much as you can reasonably expect something to. It's a benchmark kind of beer. 912 charactersColdPoncho, Jul 19, 2012

4.94/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I had heard alot about Alchemist in the beer world and had yet to try any of their beers. The other day I was in Waterburry and decided to find their brewery. Apparently the brew pub was flooded badly during hurricane Irene along with the rest of Waterburry. Luckilly their new 15 barrel canning brewery was not damaged and now produces Heady topper exclusively. I went into their store and they were selling Heady Topper for $12 a 4-pack as well as a Glutein-free saison, but I was only interested in the Heady Topper, which is fairly hard to get a hold of unless you are in the Waterburry/Burlington area of Vermont. I live in north eastern Vermont and I hadn't seen it around, but have heard it can cost alot more than $3 a can in some gas stations. 
 I have allready drank the first 3 cans on a camping trip so iv'e decided to review my final can. The can says not to pour it out into a glass because it releases the essential hop aromas that they wish to retain. I decided to pour about a 1/3 of it into my 16 oz Long Trail pint glas just to see what it looks like. It has a light brown oily look to it with a good amount of head when poured quicly but it then disipates to just about a quarter inch or so. There is no comparison in smell between the can and when you pour it into a glass. When you first open the can and you put your nose to it and strongly inhale, it gives off a fantastic potent citrus piney smell that is boarderline orgasmic. If I could live in the can I would. Its similar to when I home brew and I take a big whiff of a bag of Cascade Hops, but you can smell the different layers of Hops, which is quite complex. 
 I am a big fan of IPA's and this double IPA does not disapoint. The taste is fantastic, at 8% you don't taste any alcohol that you would expect at a 8% ABV. The reason is the hops, you definitely taste hops, very crisp clean taste of citrus and pine, but very fresh at the back end, it doesn't have the bad sour after taste like some IPA's. I definitely do recomend you listen to the brewer and drink it out of a can, you just don't get the same experience out of a glass, which makes me wonder if I would order it at a bar, but probably I would because even out of a glass you would be getting a fantastic beer. I was skeptical about all the hype that this beer was getting, but I have to say this product definitley lives up to it. I'm never good at picking a favorite anything, but this would definitely be in my top 3, an absolute must try. 2,488 charactersmiddletonman2001, Jul 17, 2012

M- This is were this beer shines. Its so unbelievably smooth and well balanced
O- This is a perfect beer. Nothing else comes close. Was lucky enough to have side by side with Lawson's 'Double Sunshine', Hill Farmstead 'Galaxy' and 'Society #3' and Heady is better hands down. 550 charactersgonzowestwood, Jul 15, 2012

I was so excited for the arrival of these, that once they were chilled to perfection, they disappeared quickly. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a murky dark orange/gold with a thick lustrous off-white head on top. 
Slick yet heavy feel. Lightly oily on the back end. Big bitter pop of juicy hops. Full of lush flavor of bitter fruits, semi-sweet syrup on finish. White peppery "burn" in the midst, but this is bitter all out. Surprisingly an easy finish with such a boisterous profile. Great beer. Not my top IIPA, but by the far the best from a can. 610 charactersOnenote81, Jul 11, 2012

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Let me tell you about the mythical adventure that this beer bestowed upon me....
After trolling for this beverage, I was luckily blessed with the notification that an coworker (who will remain nameless but will never be forgotten) was traveling north for vacation. I politely asked if he would be traveling through Vermont on his trip and gave the coordinates of the location where this beverage could be obtained...My expectations were low but I remained hopeful.
Today at work I asked if he struck out. To my delight he informed me that not only did he not strikeout, he hit the motherload. He had 40 16 oz cans on ice in the back of his chariot. After work, we met in the parking lot with trunks open to exchange cash for services rendered. I immediately rushed home, called my delinquent brother who had been previously informed about the intricate details of the spoken beer. 
Now for the review....I cracked my first beer at 17:36 EST. Initial waft was heavenly and I achieved 1/2 a stock. For those that don't know that is a semi...First sip and holy hopness my 1/2 stock had turned to full blown chub. I called my brother immediately and found he was in route. Sip after sip it got better. I chose to drink from the can as recommended and the swill sucker punched me with a full hop slam to the face. I thought best IPA I ever had....
I waited for my brother to arrive and cleansed my palet. He arrived and I handed him a cold can and cracked my second. First sip and the same thing happened to him (1/2 stock for those keeping score). The reaction continued through his 1st can. 
Honestly I can say this is the best beer I have had. I am a big IPA fan, and this blows them all away. Highly recommended but difficult to obtain. Sell your children if needed to obtain a case. 1,787 charactersatrain0187, Jul 11, 2012

Pours an extremely hazy orange, cloudy with chunks of unfiltered deliciousness. The appearance and posture of this beer is something really special. I have yet to come across an IPA that's looks this raw.
The smell is powerful with dominate c hops, floral, citrus, and pine are extremely noticeable. The aroma is just as intense as the appearance.
The taste is smooth yet incredibly hoppy, surprisingly drinkable for such a complex beer. The hops are very forward initially and then the it ends with that amazing dry hoppiness that I love ever so much.
One of the best beers to ever come out of a can and I can't wait to get my hands on some more. 817 charactersTheHopMonster, Jul 10, 2012

Not overly hoppy (as warned by the outside of the can) and has a great maltiness to it that most IPAs (specifically double IPAs) are missing. Delicious aftertaste.. I can see why this has such a high rating. Felt lucky to try this beer, definitely worth seeking out if you get a chance.. one of the better imperial IPAs I've gotten to try. 456 charactersoriolesfan4, Jul 08, 2012

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5What more can I say about this beer? Drove 7 hrs from PA to the brewery. People were very nice there. Bought 3 cases, only trouble is you have to keep it cold because it is unpasturized I believe.
I had one beer out of the can and one poured out. The poured one is very cloudy like a hefe. Put it up to your nose and it may burn your eyebrows off it's so hoppy. First sip, pungent, piney hop flavor, balanced with the sweet citrus, but also tastes creamy like a hefe, whereas a lot of IPAs taste thinner. Nice thing about this beer is that some IPAs lose their hoppiness the closer you get to the end of your glass. Not this one. As the advertising says, wave after wave of hoppiness till the finish. Very very enjoyable, if you have a free weekend and don't mind road trips, go seek this beer out. Bring some coolers to keep it cold on the ride home! 852 charactersdashmartino, Jul 07, 2012

Following the advice of a friend, I poured some in my Half Acre Tulip and drank the rest in the can. The pour was a hazy beautiful orange color with very little head that disappeared rather quickly. I Swirled it around in the glass a little and noticed that the lacing was not as much as I expected.
The smell was an awesome smack in the face with freshness. The hops were bursting with pine and maybe some peach and grapefruit.
The first sip was pretty great and as I kept drinking I noticed a lot of the flavors developing. Being an 8% abv beer, I am very surprised how easy this was to drink. Their was a slight bitterness from the hops, but the aromatic hops cut right through that creating an extremely well balanced DIPA. Though the hops are definitely the star, I really appreciate the malty sweetness of this beer as well. An amazing beer and I can't wait to get another can of this ale. 960 charactersisawpalmetto, Jul 07, 2012

4.59/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5The verbiage on the can states that you should drink this right out of the can. Sacrilege to most beer geeks, but the request comes from the brewers and I understand why. I tasted this out of a snifter since it was being shared with a really good beer guy I met at the Cloverleaf Tavern in Caldwell. He brought a few cans in with him and he was sharing, so I was gratefully drinking. 
Rating the appearance on this must be hard for those who heed the brewers' advice and drink from the can but in the snifter is was a nice golden orange, pretty darn clear with a half finder of foam. I would have liked for the head to stick around a little, but it didn't and no lacing was left behind.
The smell bursts with citrus and floral hop notes, with a biscuit malt backing. This is one of two beers that took me quite a while to actually drink since I was very content to just sit and sniff at it (Rochefort 10 was the other). The freshness of the hops is about as close as you're going to get to that smell you get crushing fresh cones in your hand.
This is where I fully understood why they want you to drink it from the can. The first sip delivers what you get in the nose, an amazing burst of fresh, citrus hops with wonderful floral notes. The biscuit continues to act as a great balance and the bitterness you'd expect never exerts its dominance. This is truly an extremely drinkable IPA. How they deliver the aroma and the flavors of the hops as successfully as they do without ratcheting the IBUs into the stratosphere is incredible. I'd love to see more IPAs built on this blueprint. Don't get me wrong; every now and then I want something that will destroy my palate, but I know that I can only drink one or two of them and then not much of anything else. With Heady Topper I imagine I could finish can after can...all day long. 1,834 charactersNaugros, Jul 04, 2012

Dark orange-yellow in color, looks like dirty orange juice, and murky. Poured with a short white foam that quickly reduced to a sturdy white cap that left sheets of sticky lacings on the glass.. Pungent citrus pineapple aroma with solid sweet, sticky malt and orange beneath and just the slightest hint of booze. The aroma almost has a feel to it. Like hop resin and dust in the sinuses. Amazing. Thick and chewy feel with dense, rich carbonation that lazily rolls through. Pungent citrus hop flavor from start to finish that are propped up by a strong sweet malty backbone.. Finishes with a lingering pine hop bitterness with a touch of citrus bitterness and booze. 747 charactersIronLover, Jul 03, 2012

Drinking out of a Pipeworks Brewing goblet. Pours a cloudy golden hue with a fingers worth of bubbly white head. 
Smells great. A nice balance of resin and citrusy fruit. 
Speaking of balance, wow. First taste knocked me on my butt. Sweet and bitter tangoed on my tongue both getting a turn at lead. 
Not too sticky on the mouthfeel, but leaves behind a bit of hop to bring you back for another drink. Carbonation tickles the throat as she goes down. 
Overall, fantastic beer that completely lives up to the hype and well deserving of my first review. Hope I didn’t let it down. 744 charactersUnderJoath, Jun 30, 2012

No date on the can but I purchased in myself from the brewery two weeks ago so I know it's still fresh.
Serving suggestion is straight from the can so I'll try it that way to start.
Opens with a soft hiss and almost immediately I smell the fresh citrusy hops. Big notes of grapefruit with secondary lemons and oranges. Beautifully bright and crisp.
Flavor is big and intense with more grapefruit, bitter blood orange, citrus pith, rind, zest... You name it! Almost like whole fruit was thrown into a blender and then into the boil. It's definitely bitter but without being overwhelming. At least not for us hop heads. 
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, a little heavier than some, with a good level of carbonation. Reasonably balanced and drinkable for the style. Obviously not a session beer but one where the can is easily consumed solo.
Overall an excellent beer and a wonderfully enjoyable big citrus DIPA. If only I could get this in Colorado.
P.S. - after a few good sips from the can, I poured the rest into an imperial pint glass. Very hazy golden yellow color and thick white head that settles to a rocky top with great lace. Nothing much lost by pouring it into a glass but there's something a little rebellious about drinking one of the world's best beers straight from the tall boy! 1,323 charactersGilGarp, Jun 29, 2012

The aroma from the small opening of the can is very pungent with lots of citrus. If you love hops, you're going to want to smell this thing. 
Couldn't tell you what this thing looks like but I do know this thing is all about the hops on the first sip. Right away you can taste that citrusy, grapefruit. It's got some sweetness and a little bitterness to cut through those hops and it's all a wonderful concoction. Truly my favorite IPA.

Two cans both served chilled, one in an over sized wine glass and one straight from the can as recommended. 
No canning date (WHY????)
Appearance: Murky, golden-orange body topped by a large white head. The head displays good retention and leaves some great looking lacing as it slowly recedes. 
Smell: Thank the pope, this smells fresh!!! Wonderful juicy fruit aromas (orange, peach, passion fruit, mango and tangerine) combine with grapefruit, pine resin, and a dank leafy character. 
Taste: Mmmmm, this is absolutely delicious! Sweet, juicy citrus (orange and tangerine) dominates, with mango, peach, grapefruit, resiny pine and a dank herbal character all well noted. With this much hop flavour, the beer is surprisingly balanced - moderate bitterness and sublime drinkability. 
Mouthfeel: For my personal tastes, this is just about perfect! Medium bodied and quite oily, with a medium-high level of smooth carbonation. 
Overall: Heady Topper certainly lives up to the reputation! This is a phenomenal IIPA that (unlikely as it seems) DOES taste better out of the can than out of a glass! Initially the difference between can and glass is quite small, however as the beer warms the can certainly comes out on top! 1,243 charactersThehuntmaster, Jun 27, 2012

S - Wow. Big citrus, dank, wet hops. Got even better as the can warmed a bit. One of the best hop aromas I've ever smelled.
T - Strong hops, citrus, pine resin. Good bitterness without being completely overwhelming. Sweet malt comes through just enough to keep everything together. To me, this beer is all about the hops though. 
M - Not as syrupy as many DIPAs I've had. Medium mouthfeel that comes across as "fresh" in my mind.
O - Rough around the edges in all the right ways. The type of beer that grows on you and leaves you wanting more when the last one is gone. Worth the hype in my opinion, and something I'll seek out again. 767 charactersanichols70, Jun 26, 2012

4.54/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - I know it says to drink from the can but I wanted to see it. It's a hazy, orange with hints of lemon near the edges. Light carbonation near the bottom. Had a few inches of white head that slowly disappeared 
S - What a nose on this. Tons of resin, wet hops come forth of this as I get hints of grapefruit, pine, and lemon. There is also a slight sweet orange and pineapple that comes forth. It just smells great without being overpowering 
T - First, there is a sweet tangerine and orange. Then, you get grapefruit and pine hops on the middle. Near the end of the beer, there is a stronger grapefruit hops that comes through without being overpowering. This is one of those beers like Pliny that bring multiple hop flavors with each sip and manages to never be overpowering. It has a nice malt backbone that brings nice sweet flavors as well.
MF - Medium body with light carbonation. Actually not too heavy for a DIPA which makes it easy to drink. Slight resin near the end that lingers on the tongue
O - This is one heck of a DIPA that I wish was available locally as you could drink one after another. It is well balanced and brings a ton of hoppy flavors without being bitter or overpowering. Definitely one of the best DIPAs out there. 1,247 charactersjeonseh, Jun 25, 2012
4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I did not go into this with too big of expectations. Most of the highly rated IPAs I've had have not lived up to my expecations and I was disappointed. Maybe going into it with open expectations is the way to go, because this floored me. I am so sad it is gone. 
A- A bit mirky. I know they said to drink it out of the can, but I just couldn't. Cloudy gold with white lacing 
S- never smelled anything like it. So hoppy, citrusy, skunky almost. Smell really sticks with you. I know it probably does not make sense, but it just has a clean smell to it
T- It is one of the hoppiest beers I've ever had, but at the same time, it is not a hop bomb. Don't know how they do it. Most beers this hoppy are a mess. This is perfect. citrusy. velvety. 
M- great body. Good carbonation. More carbonated than I like, but it works perfect with this blend. Oily. Stays with you for quite a while 
O-perfect. I'm so sad its gone. Better than any big IPA Ive ever had 955 charactersStoryOfTheGhost, Jun 24, 2012

pours a golden / medium amber tone with some haze to it while yielding a finger and a half of a creamy, off-white head. excellent retention and lacing. nose offers a nice, fragrant bouquet of hops, heavy on the tropical / citrus, some floral and some grass notes and a hint of sweet malt. 
flavor follows the aroma. lots of tropical / citric hoppiness - lemon zest, grapefruit, and mango among others - with a little malt in the background. medium bitterness. nice, medium bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation.
overall an outstanding beer. i'd probably be enjoying it even more had my expectations not been so incredibly sky high. and while it's not the best IPA/DIPA i've ever head, it's certainly up there - it just works. world class brew.

4.99/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served in a nonical pint glass just for appearance. Drank 1st from the can, the way it is meant to be drank.
A - Pale amber slightly opaque with 2 finger frothy white head with excellent retention and good lacing.
S - One of the best smelling beers out there. You almost feel you are smelling the true essence of grassy, citrus, peach, grapefruit hops with a touch of bready malt, but not much. It is all about the hops here.
T - Once again, I cannot believe the level of hop aroma and flavor this beer has resolved. All the presence of hops in the nose is here from the beginning and develops even further with chiefly citrus and grassy hops but also a touch of spicy and piney notes. The alcohol is present, but just barely for balance and that is just how big the hops are in a beer with 8% you really don't notice the EtOH. This is simple, unadulterated hops fun.
M - Medium body, moderate-high carbonation. Smooth and creamy.
O - I think this is easily my favorite beer in a can and among the best ever. I like this as much as Pliny the Younger. Where that beer was complex, rich, and subtle at the same time, this beer just does one thing, but does it PERFECTLY. It captures the soul of the hops. 1,207 characterswilliamjbauer, Jun 22, 2012

4.64/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - pours a slightly hazey marigold color. A fingers worth of froathy white head which quickly dissipates to just a white ring around the rim. No lacing. 
S - the aroma just permiates from the can as soon as its opened. The nose is bright and intoxicating in itself. Bright grapefruit, orange and lemon peel lead the charge followed by a basket of tropical fruit filled to the brim with candied pineapple and fleshy mango. The nose is rounded out by notes of fresh cut grass, and crusty bread. 
T - taste follows the nose for the most part. At first it seems more on the dry side but seems to get sweeter as it warms. Dough and bread crust are first detected on the tip of the tongue. Lots of sweet fruit and malt character aid in keeping the grapefruit bitterness balanced. Pineapple and banana peel seem to be the predominant tropical fruits while the grassy flavors keep the flavors well rounded in the middle of the palate. A strong bitterness in the long finish as well as a touch of lemony acidity. 
M - slick textured medium verging on full bodied with a light bubbly carbonation. 
O - excellent. Almost everything I love about IPAs in a single can. Alchemist really hit the nail on the head with this one. 1,217 charactersTeleweizen2, Jun 22, 2012

tall boy can into duvel tulip.
Appearance: yellowish/orange opaque bodied beer with alot of white floaties. 2 to 3 fingers of white head that drops down to a small thin cap with some decent staying power. Spotty thin lace everywhere that the head touched the glass. I love how it says to drink the beer out of the can; I did not follow those orders. 
Smell: This smells amazing! Big dank resinous hop oil upfront. Big citrus notes mostly oranges. Some mangos and peaches too. Also has a little bit of sweetness in the nose, similiar to honey.
Taste: This beer tastes very hoppy without being over the top bitter. Thats a great trait for any hoppy beer to have; I dig it for sure! Very nice balance between the malt and hops! The hops have a fairly complex profile here, probably the best that I have ever tasted. Oranges, tropical fruits(mango and pineapple), melon, grassy, herbal, hint of pine resin, and all the hops taste really juicy. The beer finishes with a mild bitterness. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer with moderate carbonation. Not a hint of booze at all...very nice! Semi-dry finish, yet still juicy and dank thanks to the hops!
Overall: Fantastic DIPA that lives up to its name. The only DIPA that I have found to be better is Lawson's Double Sunshine. 1,335 characters4DAloveofSTOUT, Jun 21, 2012

My gentle Glug still produced a finger of fizzy, bone-white head that turned to wisps pretty quickly. Color was a hazy Golden-Amber (SRM = > 5, < 7). Nose had a grapefruit tartness underlain by a tropical fruitiness. Mouthfeel was medium. The intensity of the hops immediately began an assault on my tongue, eroding all of those weak or dead taste buds and leaving the defenses wide open for the second wave. Now, it was like hydrofluoric acid, worming its way into every pore and burning like hell. Finish was super hoppy, very dry.
Unbelievable! 537 CAN reviews with my CANQuest (TM) entry as # 538. I CANnot remember any other craft CANs with this many reviews! Impressive.
From the CAN: "DRINK FROM THE CAN! [x3 for added emphasis]"; "Heady Topper is an Ameri[CAN] Double India Pale Ale. This beer is not intended to be the biggest or most bitter. It is meant to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness on your palate. Tremendous amounts of Ameri[CAN] hops will creep up on you and leave you with a dense hoppy finish in your mouth. So drinkable, it's scary. Sometimes I wish I could crawl right into the [CAN]. Freshness and control have always been my main concern[s] when it comes to our beer. We are committed to providing you with an unfiltered and unpasteurized hop experience. Why do I recommend that you drink it from the [CAN]? Quite simply, to ensure a delightful, [sic] hop experience. The act of pouring it in a glass smells nice, but it releases the essential hop aromas that we have worked so hard to retain. If you MUST pour it into a glass, you may find that some of the hop resins have settled to the bottom - leave them in the CAN when pouring. This beer is perishable, and at its best when it is young, fresh and hazy. Keep it cold, but not ice cold. Drink this beer immediately, we are always making more. [Undersigned] John Kimmich, The Alchemist, Waterbury, Vermont"; "Don't be a D-Bag, recycle this [CAN]!".
My apologies to Mr. Kimmich, but a basic tenet of The CANQuest (TM) is to deCANt the beer into a glass. I do not tell him how to do his job, I would appreciate if he did not tell me how to do mine. I hear from too many people that "CANned beer tastes metallic", mostly because they are French Kissing the goldanged CAN. I may pour some and drink some from the CAN, but how CAN I review it without seeing it in all of its glory, which is another tenet for inclusion in The CANQuest - review only, no "Hads". The last tenet is to drink it all, no matter how vile. This is to separate the men from the boys, hear me, Minhas?!?
At last, after all of that transcription, it is Crack & Glug time! Anticipation, it's makin' me wait! Man, but Carly Simon was a babe in her prime. Still in all, I would not kick her out of bed for eating crackers in the sack, even today. It's like I was telling the young honey honey the other day, we all age and if you think you will be the hardbody you are now in twenty-five years, you got another think comin'. But I digress, as I am often wont to do.
Wow, but the room smelled dank! I had just under two fingers of dense tawny head that was creating the kind of lacing that would require a jackhammer to remove as it fell. The amber liquid was hazy, dense, viscous and I wanted to dive into it just to see where it would lead. Nose was resinous, if that adjective may be applied to a liquid. Pine, wintergreen, menthol, green, baby! Holy overwhelming, Batman! Mouthfeel was sticky and in the way that napalm was sticky. Man, you get that burning craziness on your skin and you start running down the road stark naked. Phan Thi Kim Phuc, I feel your pain. I suddenly got the urge to strip down and run up the street with my tongue lolling out of my mouth in the hopes of some cooling action. It is a good thing that people are used to this sort of thing from me or there might have been real trouble. I'm back and to great applause as the late-1960's and early-1970's are making a comeback and streaking is again fashionable. This is some groovy weed, I mean, beer. Finish was so gaspingly dry that I am reaching for my asthma inhaler. Let's do this again, real soon. No, really, man, how soon CAN I score some more? I mean, you're always growing, I mean, making more, right?
Now directly from the CAN: Oh yeah, it's an epiphany! I CAN rap with my late Pops while going bowling with Jesus. Dude, you CANnot pick up the 7-10 split to save your life, CAN you? That, and now I got this metallic taste going on that was not present before. Wow, baby, wow! Groovy. 
Hey, dig this, hep cats, this is what'll send you (and I don't mean via FedEx, in fact, the less the feds are involved, the better). Stamp help out. Lenny Bruce is not afraid.

I decided to pick two up to see what all the buzz was about. Brought these devils home and put them on ice for a rainy day. 8 hours later I decided it was close enough. 
On the can it says that you should drink from the can to keep all of the hops aroma and flavor in the can. Of course, I had to pour a little into a glass to see what it smelled like. It had a very hoppy but fruity smell. Very aromatic like a good IPA should be. Drinking it from the glass made for a good hoppy IPA. Drinking this beer from the can made for a completely different beer. Much more of the hop character seemed to stay with the can and as for drinkability.... It was almost unfair. This is easily the most drinkable IPA I have ever had. Incredibly smooth and fresh with hints of hop "bite" that won't overwhelm. The one characteristic that supercedes all others is easily the drinkability of this beer. I have yet to try PtE or PtY but this goes down easily as the best IPA I have ever tried. 1,079 charactersSteelCityBrewery, Jun 19, 2012

A: pretty clear golden color, a tad cloudy
S: Really nice, with smells of resin, oranges. Smells like fresh hop pellets.
T: This is hoppy, with intenity and greath lenght, but wow, it's so balanced. It's bitter indeed, without being austere. This is pretty drinkable for such a hoppy, high alc. ale.
M: pretty smooth, nice carbonation. Looong aftertaste, with total balance.

Every aspect of this beer- down to the clear instructions to drink it straight from the can (cant truly rate the appearance because I drank em from the can)- make it a very special beer. After having three and checking the reviews I was not surprised to see that it is so highly rated.
Smell is delightful with hints of mango. 
Taste is not over the top hops. They are there and you are expecting it but I think the amazing thing about this beer is that the taste is over powered by the hops.
I could go on but many others have done it already with some very elaborate and detailed descriptions. 790 charactersusurping, Jun 19, 2012

This is the second of two. I drank the first from the can as instructed. But, I figured I'd pour the second one for the review. 
Poured from a 16 oz. can into my CBS snifter. 
Appearance: Incredibly hazy honeyed colored pour. Totally opaque. Thin layer of wispy white head. Not much in the way of head retention but very nice lacing. 
Smell: The hops aroma just pummels you with each whiff of the beer. Huge grapefruit, mango and peach aromas along with some herbal notes. As a hophead, this is an incredibly pleasing smelly beer. It's over the top for certain but it works 
Taste: Not nearly as bitter as I expected. It's rife with tropical fruit tastes including grapefruit and mango. It's dank, juicy and delicious. Dry finish with a mild booziness. A super tasty DIPA though I could stand a little more balance. 
Mouthfeel : Thick and extremely resinous. Mildly boozy but quite drinkable. 
Overall: This is an excellent beer but it's a little green around the edges particularly when drank from a glass. It's a taste bomb from a can. Enjoyed it very much. 1,148 characterspburland23, Jun 16, 2012
4.87/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5I drank the first sips from the can. Wowza! That's some insane hoppiness. As a force of habit, I had to pour 3/4 into a pint glass. The pour revealed a hazy golden blonde liquid topped with a big bubbled, chunky head. A few chunks of lace cling to the glass and the head recedes a bit but never disappears. A dusting of coarse sediment lays at the bottom. I'd suggest putting this beer in a glass if only because it looks so nice. 
The aroma is potent, unrestrained hops. Luscious, perfumey hop flavors abound. The taste reveals a great diversity of hop flavors - in concentrated form. Tangerine, pine, green melon, aspirin, soap, grapefruit rind all abound. Malts are detectable under the din of hop insanity, but they never even approach balance with the hops. The mouthfeel is thick with resiny, mouthcoating hop oils. Carbonation is moderate. The finish is very hoppy and the bitterness lasts an eternity. 
This stuff is crack for hopheads. extremely hoppy, no hype or marketing, just a very raw and concentrated hop flavor. I highly recommend this to the discerning hophead. I'd say it might be a bit much for anyone but. 1,128 charactersCAMRAhardliner, Jun 16, 2012

I've heard a lot of great reviews about Heady Topper from a few of my homebrew club members and quickly drove out to pick some up. Needless to say, the beer easily surpassed my expectations.
The IIPA poured hazy, with visible hop material that settled to the bottom of the glass. The haze makes it impossible to see through the beer, and the color is similar to that of caramel candy (dark gold).
The aroma is hard to miss, and it hit me as soon as I opened the can. However, the smell is not overwhelming, but instead very smooth, inviting you to drink up. The hop aroma reveals the complex hop character of the beer.
The hop flavor creeps up on you after swallowing. However, it doesn't have that drink-with-caution bitterness that can overwhelm the palate. It takes all of the tastiness one would love about hops while leaving some of the bite behind.
Medium body, leaving some bitterness laying on the tongue and throat, but still enjoyable.
It's one of those beers that everyone should drink at least once! 1,058 charactersSeanGC, Jun 15, 2012

The aroma is great, a soft papaya like tropical fruit nose, with tangerine and grassy notes playing their part. More dry then juicy on the nose. well done.

 one of the best tasting and smoothest ipa's i have ever tasted... my fridge currently has bells hop slam, pliny the elder and just finished the last of the hoptimum, but this is now the can i reach for!
first can i poured, despite the cans instructions, in to a tulip glass. the head was a nice off white, but nothing too heavy. color was exactly what you want in an ipa, orangish amber. the smell was really fresh and lovely! even my wife said it smelled good! :) 
it's all up hill from here... the first taste lets you know your drinking something special. your second drink assures you you weren't delusional, and by the third your already checking if you have more! 
buy this beer! buy it by the case if you can! keep this beer in your fridge all year round! 832 characterspowder245, Jun 14, 2012

I've had a couple more cans that were even fresher (without the yeast floaties), and I have to upgrade this review. Although cloudy, it pours with a nice head. Despite the amount of hops, body is incredibly smooth. Best thing in a can? 982 charactersDerek, Jun 11, 2012

A: Drank it right out of the can like it says to. The dude next to me drinking it had a cloudy honey straw color with a little bit of sediment. No time for a glass for me. Right down the hatch it went.
S: Holy monkey fuck this smells amazing. Take a really nice piney/citrus/grapefruit IPA and times it by a hundred. Smells like freaking heaven. I still have the can and every time I walk by it I give it a whiff and it still has a potently delicious aroma even though it's all gone.
T: Instant punch of citrus and grapefruit with a hell of a hop punch, but without the bitterness. Although the people next to me didn't agree with this, I got a slight bready aftertaste. Not overwhelming, just soft and pleasant. Like the can says, this is dangerously drinkable. I could drink this stuff all day it's so damn good and it goes down so easy. Pounding a pint in 15 minutes was no trouble at all. 
M: Hop resins stick to the palette like glue and linger long after the sip is finished. Super smooth.
O: I've always been afraid of trying whales like this sometimes, because they never seem to live up to their names. This definitely lives up to its name. I'm so happy I got a chance to try this. This is probably the best beer I've ever had. 1,421 charactersLordquackingstic, Jun 10, 2012
4.82/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5There's quite a lot of hype surrounding this beer, and it is my favorite style, so I was very excited to finally be able to pick some up while in Vermont recently. I drank my first one last night from the can like it says, but this time I'm pouring a whole can into a 16 oz Sam Adams "Perfect Pint" glass for the review (and yes I will drink the remaining two from the can!)
A - Pours a very hazy golden orange with about 1 1/2 fingers of foamy off-white head. Some very small but noticeable particulates floating in the glass. Much cloudier than your typical DIPA.
S - As soon as the pressure inside the can was released, the room was enveloped in an amazing hop/tropical fruit aroma. Diving further into the head you'll notice TONS of grapefruit and sweet bready malt. Peaches, mango and tropical fruit are also there. A nice earthy, grassy hop aroma comes through as well but the fruits dominate.
T - Initially sweet and fruity, it rides out to a spectacular grassy and piney finish. There is so much citrusy hoppy goodness packed into this can. The freshness of the hops is really unparalleled, it is by far the "juiciest" DIPA I've been able to track down. The hops are complimented by a sweet bread malt backbone and it is extremely well balanced. Dry, bitter, and slightly boozy aftertaste. Very little booziness in the taste however, just loads of super fresh and pure hoppy goodness.
M - Chewy and full bodied with somewhat low carbonation, but it's spot on. A little oily and sticky on the lips, as expected. 
O - Are there more insane DIPAs out there? Of course. But this has to be one of the freshest and "purest" tasting DIPAs I have ever had. It's near flawless and quite remarkable, and totally warrants the $12 price tag for the 4 pack. If you're a true hophead like me, you really have no choice but to seek this out. It warrants the hype and I'm hoping it will propel this brilliant brewer to future success and more releases. 1,949 charactersBeerPhan86, Jun 10, 2012

A-N/A, Drank from the can
S-Piney and herbaceous but without pouring it out, definitely underwhelming in my opinion
T-Hops on hops on hops, so much so that it obscured the hoppy nuances I was hoping for. Bright, fresh pine sap overwhelms at first, it followed by a pleasant bitter finish. There are other notes of citrus under the sappiness but my pallet was overwhelmed quickly by hop-power before I could pick them out
M-Viscosity trumps its carbonation and it feels sticky, like a liqueur. I didn't really like it, especially towards the end.
O-I could not find this beer's finesse, there were TONS of hop flavors but they didn't sing in symphony. I would buy it again, but I would not seek it out. 745 charactersleftde18, Jun 10, 2012

The aroma on this beer is incredible. I found myself just sticking my nose down to take another sniff. Unbelievable piney notes, grapefruit notes too.
Taste is just wave after wave of citrusy piney hops that coat your tongue and linger pleasantly.
Mouthfeel is incredibly smooth, low carbonation with hop bitterness that dance on your tongue.
I can't recommend this beer enough. If you are a hophead and haven't tried this one, you are missing out! 495 characterstheo871, Jun 09, 2012

4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Mielbeer for these 4 cans!
Drank mostly on the can as per instructed, I did pour a little of my 2nd can into a glass to be able to judge the appearance. Poured a very cloudy, floaty golden color. Fun to look at all the carbonation.
The smell is great, very grassy and hoppy...smell sort of makes me feel like I'm at an all jam band outdoor festival, if that allusion is properly created. The smell opened up and was EVEN more enjoyable for me when in the glass, which goes against what the can says but hey...they made it, they can make guidelines.
Taste is an explosion of hops, very grapefruit-y although the reviews prior made me expect a little bit more of a fruity smell/taste to it...I may be off on my fruits though, admittedly. There is a slight malt sweetness after the initial hop explosion. Nicely done.
Mouthfeel is where the beer takes its only turn I have a little trouble with, both from a can and glass(though glass helps a bit with this) its just a bit too carbonated for me. Which may be a good sign as I think these cans would go a 15 minutes faster if I could drink them any easier.
Overall: This is what I was expecting and it merits the hype. I'll also have it be known this is the first or second 'hard to get' beer that I've got my hands on that was truly, truly worth it for me. Pliny was a much harder got and for 2 years spent longing for it, wasn't what I wanted it to be(though great)
This is more of an DIPA up my alley...punch you in the face hops, with what I consider a better backbone or foundation.
Try to get a hold of 2 or x amount cans of these and you won't be let down. Great stuff. 1,639 charactersmwrecording, Jun 09, 2012

I resisted the very strong urge to pour this into a glass, it was so tough. So the appearance can't be a 5, but I thought it was a cool looking can and gave it a 4.5
What an amazing aroma! A sweet/piney/citrus aroma, that begs you to drink it down.
All these smells are transformed into taste when you start to drink this beer. It is very smooth, with a great balance of citrus bitterness.
The mouthfeel is nice. Not a strong carbonation, I would say medium to low in that area. There is a lingering bitter aftertaste after each swallow.
Overall, I would say this beer lives up to the hype quite well. I like how dry of a finish it is, makes you keep coming back for more! 721 charactersMichPaul, Jun 09, 2012

Pours hazy gold with a peachy hue and loads of chunky flakes of yeast. Seriously, a beer of this caliber should have a far better presentation! Beyond the murky, sedimentary body there is a very nice display of tattered lacing and a partial skim coat on the surface for the duration.
Aromatics lead off with fresh peaches, mango, pineapple, and sugar-dusted apricots. Very tropical in nature with lots of lush, ripe fruit.
Just short of medium bodied with a smooth but crisp mouthfeel. A bit lush and velvety.
Fresh, juicy tropical fruit start the palate. A drying, smooth bitterness quickly follows. Peaches, pineapple, mango, and melons aplenty. 
Finishes with lingering fruit and a smooth bitterness.
The beer is bone-dry, extremely fruity, and has a very low bitterness for the style. The result is an insanely drinkable treat of which I wish I had a keg of. 934 charactersbrewandbbq, Jun 08, 2012

A: Pours a wonderful cloudy yellowish pink. It reminds me specifically of grapefruit juice. There is a full finger of pure white puffy foam that settles fairly quickly. Some lacing as it drinks.
S: This beer has some serious citrus, a good amount of pine, and a mild underlying sweetness. There are some fruit notes and herbal tea in there as well. It's really pleasent.
T: Mmm. This is awesome. It's juicy citrus, herbal tea, and pine. Wow. I'm amazed by how smooth this beer is. Tons of flavor, but very little harsh hop bite or booze. It's really enjoyable.
M: Medium bodied beer. The citrus and tea envelop the palate to start, but it fades in the middle as the pine comes on strong. The finish is bitter, and it lingers for a bit, but it's never overwhelming.
O: This beer is pretty fantastic. I was expecting a lot, and it delivered. I only have one can left, and I want more immediately! Road trip to VT... anyone?
Side Note: I never took the "drink from the can" seriously, but it's legit. Maybe it's just mental, but it tastes better straight from the can. 1,138 characterstrxxpaxxs, Jun 07, 2012

a- the haziest ipa i've ever seen. extremely murky and lots of floaties. Has with a nice, fluffy head. a bit of lacing.
s- out of this word. has a huge wave of piny hops and grapefruit and orange, and every other delicious thing you can imagine. 
t- the juiciest ipa i've ever had. this is mind-blowing. i can taste and smell this beer even after i put it down, and putting this beer down is really difficult. this is like the biggest citrus orgasm in a beer ever. the hops in this are delicious, but the maltiness in this beer is equally insane.
m- incredibly well balanced. the perfect carbonation. i can't say anything else. But at 8%, this is the most drinkable beer I'eve ever had. 
o- This is for Mark: Heady Topper...How do I begin to explain Heady Topper? Heady Topper is flawless. I hear a case of this stuff should be insured for $10,000. I hear Heady does car commercials...in Japan. Heady's favorite activity is knocking people senseless over the head with its awesomeness.

4.66/5  rDev +0.2%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks Hoppypocket for the opportunity to try this bad-boy!
Appearance. Pours a very murky straw-orange (maybe just a little blue-green??)with a massive, frothy off-white head that lasts forever, but doesn't leave much for lace. I know it says to drink from a can but c'mon, let's be civilized here ;-)
Smell. Pine needles and citrus rinds, some good toasty malt, a little floral soap-like smell as well.
Taste. Big bitter floral, grassy hops with a splash of citrus juice. Some great roasty malt is there and there's a bunch of bitter citrus rind and grass in the finish that stays on the tongue. 
Mouthfeel. Just below full body with medium-low carbonation. Very nice. 
Overall. Had this side by side with my (previously) favourite dipa. I still have a great love for the other one, but this has to be the best tasting dipa I've had to date. Looks kinda' iffy, but a guy gets over that after one taste. 910 charactersRutager, Jun 06, 2012
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from the can into Harpoon Limited Edition snifter.
The color is cloudy deep orange with some yellow highlights around the edges with a finger of foamy white head and some slight lacing.
The smell bursts out from the can with a bright piney aroma. Nowhere near the can and before the pour the hops are already present. The aroma is fresh hops all the way as if you had a packet of hops about to be poured into a boiling wort.
The taste is hoppy with some pine flavor sitting on top of a juicy citrus flavor. The layers of hop flavor both big and small seem to meld well here. From orange pith to the piney Douglas fur flavor to the slight bitterness toward the end. Sweetness right where is should be with some bitterness that comes in but has out the dull knives and only eases into the bite.
The feel is smooth and goes down easier then expected from a hop forward beer. It is really drinkable and seems to want to go down without a thought. This is may be the most drinkable hop-flavorful beer I have had. Worth the wait and the travel to have this beer. 1,067 charactersDuhast500, Jun 06, 2012

This time I am reviewing and only poured 5 ounces out of can to see appearance and get more smell than outta can...not that you can't smell the hops as soon as you crack the can. Really hazy yellowish with minimal head. Laces but not as sticky as I was anticipating, dissipates as the head did. This beer you can smell as your drinking it, rinds, grapefruit,citrus, and don't forget the hops. Different than any dipa that I ever had. Great hop pop, Med Carb,and balance that makes you want more!! Big hop aftertaste that keeps you wanting more. Overall lives up to hype and will seek out again. Hop heads dream and really really leaves hops for days in your mouth. In my top 5 just unsure until I have access to more where it falls. 820 charactersMounty4Life, Jun 06, 2012

A: Beautiful yellow-orange sunset. It's unfiltered and various particles are visible. Note: the label recommends consuming the beer straight from the can. I tried one like this and also one that I poured into a tulip glass. Both were magnificent.
S: Incredible aroma of mango, grapefruit and guava (yes, guava). Some orange and lemon thrown in for good measure.
T: Taste follows the nose perfectly, with the mango standing out beautifully. Astonishing flavor. Important hop note: as stated on the can, this isn't supposed to be a hop explosion, and it's not. What it is, is a perfectly balanced beer.
M: carbonation is perfect. Just enough to let the hops dance around the tongue, and not too much to overpower the hops.
O: This is, by far, the best DIPA I've ever had and perhaps the best beer I've had period. PtE, Hopslam, and Dreadnaught are incredible beers but not even in the same class as Heady Topper. HT leaves them in the dust. I've had CBS on more than one occasion, and almost all Cantillon variants. I'm not exaggerating or going overboard when I say this might be the best beer on earth. A remarkable offering. Do yourself a favor and try this brew. It's worth it and then some. 1,299 characterscccarson, Jun 05, 2012

Poured from 16oz can to imperial Surly pint glass...
Pours a hazy honey gold, gorgeously unfiltered. I like my orange juice with pulp, I like my beer with floaties. A big, rocky off-white head swells to fill the 20oz glass. Spotty, sticky lacing. Great looking beer, I don't really understand why this beer is suppose to be hidden inside of a can.
The nose is stuffed with fresh hop aromas - tangerine, orange peel, fresh floral bits, plenty of evergreen harshness to balance the heavy citrus. Not really any detectable malts here.
On the tongue... hop abrasion like I've never really experienced. Grapefruit, orange peel, massive flavors. Exceedingly hoppy and bitter. The super dry, bitter afterburn keeps me going for more. What a delicious thing this is. 
Overall, I can see why people go nuts over this stuff. A unique, aggressive, very satisfying drink. 948 charactersyamar68, Jun 02, 2012

Poured a nice coppery hue with a long lasting white head. The beer itself is cloudy with particulates all over the place. Impeccable smell. Huge gobs of pine resin and orange/grapefruit rinds all over. I don't even know if words can appropriately describe this. Pine, earth, grass, and citrus fruits battle it out on my palate amongst delicate carbonation. A healthy honey-grain malt backbone keeps everything together. Wow, quite a treat. 489 charactersDmanGTR, May 31, 2012

Pours an extremely hazy yellow-amber with a lush, creamy head that is kept at bay at an inch plus. Impressive hop-haze, if that’s what it is. 4.0
Don’t think I was catching whiffs from the moment I opened the can to the moment I was typing out my appearance description. This beer has some serious hop aromatics. Pineapple, fir tree, mango nectar, tangerine, grapefruit, and herbal tea. A top three ranking for best-smelling DIPAs. 5.0
Amazing fruity hop profile. Phenomenal flavors of a cornucopia of tropical fruits; notably pineapple, grapefruit, starfruit, and mango. Mildly bitter, which works to balance some sweetness, yet not obscuring the showcase of the hop flavor profile. Hardly a malt presence other than some light syrup (as in the light syrup in canned fruit) and biscuity character. The hop character is dank and oily and complex in that it has a plethora of different varietals’ flavors. Exactly what an Imperial IPA should be. I could drink this all night. 4.5
One milky brew with heft. Pockets of bubbles in the back of the mouth. Velvety smooth and a sly strength make for an incredible mouthfeel. 4.5

S - Straight up 5 here and I don't understand how you could give it a rating any lower on the smell. It was like fresh squeezed hop juice with very strong mostly noted grapefruit like hop dankness. Man this stuff smells good!
T - As expected it drinks freaking amazing. Hops are strong almost acidic or piney but the caramel like malts keep it from going overboard. I also love how well it hides the ABV it's almost non existent. Summed up perfect!
M - It has a medium bodied and drinks with the best of em.

4.82/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 516oz can into Duvel tulip (drank small amount from the can--prefer it in the glass, *as with every beer*). No freshness info, but my friend just bought it for me when a stray case hit Boston a couple days ago. Sold out in a day at 1 can per customer.
Appearance: Free pour yields a 3/4 inch fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. Pours an opaque orange-ish yellow. Some spotty lacing. I quite like the solid yellow color; gives a real nectar impression.
Smell: Grapefruit, mango, and lemon, with a slight pungency and some pale malt. With time, it's all grapefruit and lemon--dankness disappears as does the malt. Bursting with bright citrusy hop aromas.
Taste: Up front, beautiful citrusy hops with a tinge of tropical fruit. Finishes with just enough bitterness along with some subtle pale malt. 
What a simple, direct, but genius beer. Every sip is that succulent citrus and mango hop explosion up front, leading to a sort of soothing balance of slightly toasted malt, alcohol heat, and bitterness. The latter three all read as "soft", and the hop flavor persists on top of them through the dryish finish into the aftertaste. Excellent.
Mouthfeel: Just right. Medium bodied and smooth, juicy with a slight creaminess. Low to moderate carbonation comes across as an occasionally noticeable tingle. Perfect dryness, bitterness, heat.
Overall: This beer reminds me of a great jazz band. The malt, heat, IBU, and mouthfeel are all playing wonderfully subdued parts, supporting the hop oil virtuoso soloist. DIPAs don't get much better than this. 1,554 charactersPahn, May 29, 2012

The beer pours a hazy golden amber with a white head that fades quickly. There is some thin lacing, but I'm not really letting it sit long enough to cling to the sides. The nose is potent, orgasmic citrus hops with some potent ethanol. The beer drinks like a sweet hop elixer with an incredibly smooth mouthfeel that leaves a slightly lingering bitterness. Excellent beer for a reasonable price, and yes, this one is definitely worth the hype. 500 charactersThePorterSorter, May 25, 2012

The aroma hits you right after you open up the can. Pine and lemon zest come off of the aroma and it's quite floral while at the same time a bit bitter. Despite all of this, the aromas aren't blurred and it's pretty crisp. 
The taste is considerably elaborate without being muddled. This, like the can describes, is not an over the top DIPA, yet it does provide some solid bitterness. It focuses mostly on the hop character, so in that regard, the bitterness that comes through is quite impressive. It begins with major pine resin from the hops, and then takes a citrus spin, only to come back to the resin for the finish. 
The mouthfeel is quite nice. Everything is quite smooth, and it's not noticeably too thin or too thick. The finish is moderately dry and slightly sticky. A bit of alcohol heat takes away from it, but aside from that it's perfect.
Overall, this beer isn't what I expected, but it is as good as I expected. This was incredibly refined, while also giving a solid dose of bitterness and aggression. I would really love to get my hands on more of this stuff. 1,167 charactersBBP, May 23, 2012

A- Poured into my Alchemist pint glass, blonde-amber in color, darker than a traditional IPA. Very cloudy appearance, it has lots of particles floating around in it.
S- The first thing that blew me away about this beer when I had it the first time was the aroma, because I could smell it from about 5 feet away. The initial smell is hops, lots and lots of them. But it's a lot more complex than that, there's tons of citrus fruits in there like grapefruit and orange, definitely some pineapple as well. Awesome aroma.
T- The taste matches the aroma so well. It is very hoppy, but it's smooth at the same time. Heady Topper is so drinkable because in my opinion it tastes so much like juice. It has a good amount of alcohol in it and you definitely taste all of the hops, but the grapefruit and orange in it reminds me of fresh-squeezed juice every time. It's just so good.
M- Like I said, goes down easy. Perfect amount of carbonation for a crisp IPA like this, I always prefer something like this on a hot day to quench my thirst but it's just as good in the winter if you get it fresh.
O- This has been my favorite DIPA since I tasted it and after having Pliny, Abrasive, Hopslam, Citra, and most of the other well-knowns out there, I really don't see that changing. It has an element to it that the others don't bring to the table the same way. This truly is the only IPA that I would seek out at this point, with good reason. 1,510 charactersmgp2675, May 23, 2012

A: Very hazy pale orange, lots of sediment. Not an especially good looking beer but then again I went against their very clear specific instructions and poured it into a glass. Looks like homebrew. Beautiful tenacious head and plenty of lacing.
S: Cat pee, floral, citrus fruits. Got to say, the aroma isn't nearly as huge as I anticipated (but I cant verify how fresh this is). Either way it's very nice if a bit oxidized. Smells like homebrew.
T: Tangerines & oranges, some resinous oniony aftertaste. A very nice DIPA.
M: Creamy and very juicy. Extremely quaffable for this strength.

Poured half of a can into my SH Snifter and consumed the other half from the can side by side. 
A: Poured a bright orange color. Extremely cloudy. 
S: Insane aroma. Huge notes of tropical fruit (mango came immediately to mind) coupled with massive pine/resin notes. 
T: Waves of mango and citrus dominate the front of the mouth. By the middle of the mouth the bitterness begins to emerge; the bitterness is tamed out back with a sweet malty presence. 
M: Medium carbonation. Medium body. Extremely sticky. 
Oh my, easily one of the top 3 IIPAs that I have had to date. This IIPA towers above the hype that surrounds it. This beast from the east stands tall among the ''big guns'' of the west ( specifically the offerings from Russian River and Alpine). I can only hope that the crew over at The Alchemist make these shipments of Heady Topper to NYC more often. 920 charactersxenjoiii, May 22, 2012

A: Hazy sunset orange with a giant fluffy white head that drops to a superbly lacing ring
S: Initially took a giant hit of citrus and tropical hops. Mango, passionfruit...  Some sweet malts with a hint of pine perhaps?  Incredibly strong nose for a commercial beer. 
T: A little less strong on the hops. The bitterness builds to a biting nature over some sweet bready malt. Some alcoholic heat is definitely at play. Fruity hop profile with grapefruit rind and pineapple. 
M: Spot on, although I would have preferred it drier. 
O: Really nice beer. Worth the hype?  I guess, but I can drive 3 hours for Surly so I don't see this supplanting my needs, especially at the trading cost it now asks... 904 characterskjyost, May 22, 2012

I have to be honest, I love the smell you get when you pour the beer into a glass and the color is spectacular, however I like the taste better straight out of the can. I wish their was a happy medium that could be found. So poured out of the can it is a golden copper color with a nice cream colored head. The smell is floral hops and very inviting.

A: I did pour a little bit into a pint glass to see what it looked like. Light yellowish color. It looked hazy, even with the small pour.
S: Pine and citrus hops predominate a really nice aroma profile. On a side note, I did feel a little self-conscious trying to smell through the opening in the can.
T: Flavor follows the nose well. Citrus hops predominate.
M: A bit on the heavy side for an IIPA. Also is somewhat less bitter than I expected.
O: Really good IIPA. Couldn't tell you the last time I had a beer out of a can, but I can promise you it wasn't anywhere close to this tasty! Would definitely like to have again. 722 charactersmacrosmatic, May 21, 2012

A- Pours a very hazy orange with noticable sediment (i.e. yeast buds) producing nothing more than a 1-finger, soapy, white head. Personally, I prefer an appearance of other bottle conditioned IPA's like that of Dogfish Burton Baton, Lagunitas' Maximus or Founders' Double Trouble.
S- Absolutely out of this world! A piney/tacky, yet sweet orange, grapefruit, pineapple and other tropical fruit aromas are all present.
T- Despite 120 IBU's and 8% ABV, this is one easy-to-drink beer...bitteringly refreshing as a sugar-topped grapefruit. The bitterness is masked with late (flavor) hop additions and the alcohol is never present. The palate is never dominated by astringent hop bitterness...but your are always wanting more...an extremely well-crafted Double IPA. To be very infantile, I would say that this is nothing more than alcoholic citrus juice...wow!
M- The light/moderate carbonation allows the flavors to open up on your palate leaving nothing more than another taste.
O- As commented by so many others, this is an exceptional brew and no surprise that they made this their flagship (in the wake of the mess Hurricane Irene wreaked on their brewpub). If you find yourself in Vermont, search it out. In the meantime, I will be thankful that copious amounts are at my taking.
PS- Despite the instruction...No, I have never consumed from the can...Blasphemy! 1,449 charactersthreeviews, May 21, 2012

Finally a beer that demands you drink it from the can! I cheated and poured a little in a glass to get a better look. Hazy, funky with a nice head and good lacing.
Smell is hoparific. Pine citrus hops oh my!
Taste is exceptional. This is one delicious beer. Bitter without being bracing, balanced without being tame. Absolutely great.
Mouthfeel is on the light side of creamy with enough prickly carbonation and dryness to bring you hack for me.
Overall, I'd say 13 bucks is highway robbery, but this beer almost makes extortion worthwhile. I'll justify by saying this is a limited tough to find release that easily trounces a bomber of other DIPAs at the same price. I won't pay that again, I'll trade instead. But I love canned beer and I had to try this one. It lives up to the hype. 862 charactersfoureyedgeek, May 20, 2012

The taste...This is an 8% American Double/Imperial IPA that is as smooth and easy to drink as any a 6% American IPA. As the beer starts to warm, all of the delicious tropical flavors just explode in your mouth.
Overall, this is how you make a World-Class Double IPA. It deserves all of its hype. I'm going to travel all the way to Vermont just to pick up a case this summer. I declare this Summer of Heady Topper! 643 characterstony32408, May 19, 2012

Cloudy golden and translucent with a thinnish head that dissipates quickly enough. Doesn't leave too much lacing at all, but what little there is sticks in spots to the inside of the glass. Not really that chunky, but it's not that easy to see through. Smell is out of this world, holy God. It smells like someone squeezed fresh pineapple, grapefruit, mango and passion fruit straight into the glass. There's a mild peachiness that follows this initial tropical fruit onslaught, coupled with some smooth maltiness on the end. No booziness detectable.
Taste follows through on the smell, with all of the fruit essences making an appearance, though they do seem a bit subdued on the tongue after getting punched in the nose with all these amazing scents. Bitter hops appear next, though the flavor is balanced by the sweetly pungent fruit. There's maltiness in here, but it's definitely not the featured attraction. Mild bitterness comes through on the tail end, but doesn't ride through into the aftertaste. The finish is very, very smooth and dry, leaving you wanting more (and you definitely will). The body is just so right, equal parts smooth and gently carbonated. Very well done.
This stuff is miles above 99% of the DIPAs I've had, wow. Totally complex yet eminently drinkable, this is the new standard. Definitely deserving of the score and the hype. 1,495 charactersr0nyn, May 12, 2012

Can to tulip at about 45 degrees.
Pours with 1F of off-white head over an opaque, deep gold body with tons of floaties. Touch of lacing.
Aromas contain a tropical fruit explosion, full of pineapple, coconut, some grapefruit, and surprisingly ... plenty of charred log as it warms. 
Bold and sharp on the palate. Flavors move slightly off tropical over to orange, mango, and pine, with lots of white pepper, and some young pineapple rind. Definitely a DIPA, as the hops seem to engulf the sweetness. 
Crisp and full of carbonation... could be smoother for higher points here.
Not the be-all, end-all of DIPAs. I thought it was very reminiscent of Mongo (bottle variety, not draft). Sharp, hop-forward, and full of floaties. 783 charactersBeerImmediately, May 12, 2012

Did pour a little to take a peek, hazy golden in color, dense head which fades away quickly. Pretty dank smell, resinous, pine, and some citrus, it does pop pretty hard. The taste is as expected, hop forward. Snappy, pine, citrus, chewy hops. Then some more hops. Not so bitter, actually much more of a fruity hop affair. This is a little refined for me, I tend to like my IIPAs rough and tough. Leaves the palate dry and crisp finish. Smooth as silk mouthfeel with soft carbonation. No trace of alcohol, drinks as easy as advertised. 657 characterspmlondrigan, May 09, 2012
4.31/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Appearance: The beer pours a yellowed brown, like cloudy dehydrated piss. With a thick bubbly eggshell white head with good retention. Lacing is light and droopy, only lasting for a short while above the head. 
Smell: Smell is super strong in piney hops with a slight citrusy tinge. A mellower light malty tinge seems to hide itself in the edges of the smell, but for the most part the smell is dominated with floral hops.
Taste: Super bitter with hops, this beer is achingly crisp on the tongue with just an overwhelming sense of bitter from start to finish. Slight citrusy notes can still be felt if you swish the beer around in the mouth, but overall it is just an overwhelming pine based bitter. I also took a couple pulls from the can, since that is what the can demanded, and was surprised to find more fruity notes being accentuated by the can. While still crisp and bitter I detect better note of citrusy flavor. Overall this beer is very heavy in its hops.
Mouthfeel: My initial sip from the cup was harshly bitter on the tongue. The beer is quite watery and smooth on the mouth. It definitely fizzles with bitterness as is peaks over the back of your tongue. The beer is less harsh when drank from the can, with the fruitier notes causing nice freshness on the tongue.
Overall: Great IPA. Fantastic floral hopping with a great hop-filled taste. This is a beer I would have again. The 8% alcohol content, and high drinkability also make this beer phenomenal. 1,471 charactersMaxwell, May 09, 2012
3.54/5  rDev -23.9%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 3.516 oz can generously shared by colonelforbin. Thanks Mike. Pours a very cloudy light amber with a small light tan head that has decent retention and leaves a good lacing on the glass. The aroma is big mango, floral notes, light caramel, a bit of pineapple, and some sugar cookie. The initial taste is sweet with mango and pineapple going into a bit of caramel, sugar cookie, and some light dankness. There is a very light bitterness on finish along with some lingering mango. Light bodied. Low carbonation. I definitely could use a bit more bitterness and a bit less sweetness. Not bad, but certainly not in the class of the best west coast IPAs. 646 charactersjethrodium, May 08, 2012

I poured a little into a shot glass to get an idea of it though. It’s much lighter in color than I anticipated, close to something like a golden straw color with a small head. The body is cloudy and there are delicious little bits of hops floating about. Don’t read too much into the appearance though. This was by no means a full pour, and I was more curious about the color more than anything else. 
S-	Grapefruity, citrusy, herbal hoppy goodness! My sweet dear baby Jesus does this beer smell GOOD! I think the mastermind behind this beer, John Kimmich, puts it best… “Sometimes I wish I could crawl right into the can”. I couldn’t agree with you more. It’s tough getting a HUGE whiff from the can (and you look kind of funny doing it) but it is absolutely there.
T-	A sublime balance of many different hop characteristics is the most apparent flavor. Citrusy hops are first to show, followed by piney and earthy flavors. You’re left with a fresh, almost grassy flavor to enjoy once the beer is gone. This brew has so many complex hop flavors that by the time you’re done trying to decipher them after each sip, any major malt profile has since been overpowered which is just fine by me. This beer is a true hop lover’s wet dream. 
M- A silky smooth body with a sharp alcohol bite is the driving force behind the mouthfeel here. A quick swish of the tongue releases a huge wave of oily hops and makes the beer slide down with ease. 
O- If you love hoppy beers, beg, borrow, or steal to get this beer. Seriously, it’s THAT good. This right here is something special. 1,684 characterstdexterc, May 08, 2012

S: Huge tropical fruits, pineapple, mango, peach, nectarine and some caramel. Awesome. Tropics in a glass.
T: Pineapples, mango, citrus, grapefruit, assertive hop bitterness but really smooth finish. Everything is balanced. Malt is caramel and sweet.
M: Sweet start to a finish drying finish.
O: This beer is amazing. Super assertive hops but not overwhelmingly bitter. Could just be the bitter factors of the hops used. This is the Hoptimum of tropical fruit hop flavors. Exceptional. 650 charactersJerseyKirk, May 08, 2012

A: Pours a bright orange with a nce tower of white, soft head. Great retention and lacing.
S: Huge grapefruit and slight marijuana wafts from the glass. A bit of sweet pale malt behind.
T: Nice mix of citric and pine hops transitions into a subtle, alcohol-laced, grainy maltiness. Grapefruit, pine needle, grass, mild orange, bready grain, vanilla cake, hint of solvent alcohol. Pretty dry.
M: Creamy, soft, nice.
O: This is a nicely balanced DIPA, which is further helped by it only being 8%. Although it's certainly not the best DIPA out there (a bit too dry), it is pretty nice. 670 charactersEtan, May 05, 2012

4oz poured into glass to get a view of the appearance. The rest tasted from the can as per instructions. 
A: Cloudy straw color. My previous can had some floaters in it, but this is devoid of the blobs. 
N: Missing the hop blast I'd hoped for. Grapefruit, pineapple, pine. This falls really short of the high water mark of Sculpin, IMO.
T: Bitter hop goodness. Plenty of earth and pine with pineapple, mango, and pineapple laced through. This is well balanced and the 8% is muted if not non-existent altogether. Definitely finishes bone dry. 
Mouthfeel: Expands across the palate. No complaints here. 
Overall: Definitely enjoyable, and a beer I'll be glad to have time and time again. I just wish I got more than a whisper of hop on the nose. 775 charactersSarlacc83, May 04, 2012

A - Super hazy dark yellow body. Lets just a bit of light through. Some floating sediment and yeast. Soapy off-white four finger high head forms after a quick pour. Settles down to a dirty cap with plenty of lacing and retention. Leaves behind a slick coating with each sip.
S - Super juicy grapefruit with some peach, mango, and orange. Just a hint of some biscuity and bready malts. Simply perfect.
T - Orange juice. A touch of sour grapefruit and light floral and grass. Not getting much of a malt backbone. Just some faint buttery biscuit notes that work really well with the intense orange and grapefruit notes. Really clean and refreshing with a pleasant but quick bitterness on the finish. Medium moth feel with low carbonation. Alcohol is not noticeable at all. Taste is identical from the can...
O - This is unbelievably easy drinking, I'm afraid this four pack isn't going to last very long. Which sucks since the inflated shop price was $18. I don't think its one of the best beers in the world, but it is really high up when it comes to DIPA's. 1,271 charactersdavey101, May 02, 2012

A: Golden color. Very hazy, with plenty of sediment floating around.
S: Some floral hops, but mainly tons of citrus.
T: Tastes pretty dry (in a good way). The bitterness is not extreme, though some stays in the aftertaste. The main flavors are very pleasant - floral and citrusy (though less citrusy than I expected from the smell). Any bready malt flavor is masked or balanced quite well by the hops.
M: Medium body and carbonation. Certainly not as heavy as would be expected based on the ABV.
O: Quite a nice IPA. I wasn't expecting much, given that it's an East Coast brewery (no offense, but the hoppy beers are not necessarily as world-renowned as some of the West Coast ones), but I was pleasantly surprised. 758 charactersshleepy, May 02, 2012

The appearance is murky due to the low flocculation of the yeast strain but man if it doesn't make the peachy, tropical notes of the hops that much more vibrant. 
The mouth feel of this beer is one of the best qualities of this beer; for an IIPA it has one of the creamiest mouth feels I have encountered. 
Depending on my mood and how good my palate is, I have picked out grapefruit, peach, papaya, pineapple and resin. 
For me, this is a desert island beer. I could drink this all day (plus I wouldn't have to worry about the beer being light struck ;-)) 706 charactersJeffTheJuice, May 02, 2012

A: Pours a very hazy orangish amber with a 1 finger white head. Quick to dissipate it is easily resurrected with a swirl. No lacing on the sides. A few bits of debris visible in the body.
S: Loads of citrus hops up front. Simply amazing. Grapefruit, orange and pine in there as well. Sweet fruit like malts become noticeable as it warms up. 
T: First sip is a delicious blend of floral and citrus hops. Very clean hop flavor with mild malt in the background. Unlike other hop bombs its not as much of a slap in the face but a delicious blend of tasty hops.
M: Very easy drinking for something with so much hop taste. Nice nectar like quality, on the low end of carbonation. Doesnt leave a sticky film in your mouth either. The 8% alcohol is hardly noticeable. But hard to tip back a few in a row.
Overall I'd say this beer is worth the hype surrounding it. One of the easiest drinking and tastiest Double IPA's hands down. Still hoping some day I can get this locally. 1,032 charactersCloudStrife, May 02, 2012

A: Light Orange color with one finger head, good amount of lacing. Lots of bubbles. Some stuff floating around. For a beer that the brewery recommends to drink out of the can, it looks decent.
S: Orange zest Lemon citrus grapefruit, pineapple - best smelling DIPA ever! 
T: This has got to be my favorite DIPA, I have ever had. This beats Pliny (both Elder and Younger) and Dreadnaught. Perfectly balanced, yet still hoppy as hell, sweet but not overly sweet... I pick up pineapple, grapefruit, lemon, orange, little bit of pine. Hoppy bitterness is there, but not predominent - just kicks it slighly at the end. Taste doesn't linger as long as Pliny, but it's amazing. 
M: Compared to other DIPAs, this one is very refreshing. Lighter in body, higher in carbonation. I liked it - I thought it matched (or added) to the experience. 
O: This is the DIPA to beat at the moment for me. 955 characterssukwonee, May 01, 2012

Heady Topper pours a hazy slightly dull orange. There are some tangerine highlights, and visibility is minimal. There's about a finger and a half of cream colored foam crowning the beer, and head retention is just OK. Lacing is fairly nice though, more of the glass is left covered in it than not. The second pour does result in plenty of sediment hanging in suspension. The nose is absolutely wonderful. Tons of mango and pineapple, with some more overtly citrusy grapefruit present in more of a supporting role. The flavor profile leads off with a bit of candied sugar sweetness. The bitterness that rolls through next is surprisingly mild/smooth. I kind of wish it was a little bit more intense/attention grabbing. The hoppy close though is just as fantastic as the nose though, with tons of tropical fruit and just a ittle bit of citrus. The mouthfeel is spot on. The body's not quite Belgian style brew dry, but it has just a little bit more heft to support it. Meanwhile, the carbonation explodes on my palate, helping the potent hoppy flavors to come alive. Heady Topper's a stunning beer, and one of the abslute best double IPAs I've had to date. 1,277 charactersaxeman9182, May 01, 2012

16 oz can, no date. 
appears a hazy rust orange color with tons of floaties. bright white head that fades. obviously this is why they want you to drink from the can. 
aroma is hop forward obviously. orange, lemon, cut grass, slightly earthy too. taste is super cirtusy. a touch of biscuity sweet malt, but not much. tasty though if you're looking for fruity citrus hop flavors. 
medium thickness, but it coats the tongue, a bit oily. good carbonation level, but I'm not a fan about the oily feel.
good, but not sure it lives up to the crazy hype and higher price. seems quite similar to other citrusy DIPA's. still glad I got to try it though. 713 charactersjmdrpi, Apr 29, 2012

A- heady pours a bright orange body that glows as it touches down in the glass. A plethora of floaties are all around. Much more than Smutty Finest and Flower Power. Great white lacing on the sides of the glass, although the head of foam faded. Just a completely hazy orange brew that is definitely different than anything I have seen before
S- this is the Armageddon of hops! A whack of citrus and piney hops that is the most massive I have ever come across. So tropical and completely exposes you to a complete whiff of hop resins. This is no question, the real deal. I feel like this glass could be an air fresher of hoppiness that never fades. Very impressive
T- unbelievable flavors. The citrus and piney flavors are simultaneous and provide and delicious blast of sweetness in tune with the bitterness. I can't recall any experience that is quite like this other than flower power and pliny. The taste experience is totally positioned for a bold hop experience. So much flavor meshing into a flawless taste
M- talk about a curtain of hoppiness draping your mouth with flavor. This is so delicious with flavor all over
O- Heady and Flower Power represent the east coast shouting back at the west coast saying we can do this too! This is an incredible experience of drinkability coupled with an onslaught of hoppy flavors. What a DIPA! I need more! Come to Syracuse Alchemist! 1,507 characterslovindahops, Apr 29, 2012

A: Very light golden to pale yellow appearance with vigorous carbonation. Big head with minimal lacing. Bubbles constantly rising toward the surface and then plunging down deep. Much less cloudy than I had been led to believe.
S: Huge pine hops, sweet citrus overtones. As big a hop nose as I have ever encountered with none of the harsh or onion esters that can ruin a really nice thing.
T: Damn. This is a world-class DIPA. Is it better than Elder? I'm not sure. It's definitely in the same class. Big, rich citrus and pine out the wazoo. Totally love this stuff. Can't believe this doesn't have wider distribution while Lagunitas goes everywhere. I like the Lags, but they've never bottled a beer this good. If Sucks tasted like this, I wouldn't drink any other IPAs.
M: Perfect for an IPA, a little bit of stickiness but mostly just crisp and refreshing with a lot of lingering big hop flavor.
O: As good as hyped. Seek this out if you can find it, and then hoard what you get your hands on. 1,077 charactersdrgarage, Apr 29, 2012

Can't come up with one single advantage of drinking from the can...plus I can't review the appearance that way (did take a sip or two from the can in between refilling my glass and it didn't affect the taste at all). No date found anywhere. 
A: The appearance isn't overly impressive, really. Pours a cloudy light orange/copper color. A half finger off-white/eggshell colored head fades rapidly, but there is plenty of carbonation bubbling up through the beer. There are floaties! My favorite thing to see in beer...not that I doubted it would be, but it's definitely unfiltered.
S: Smells very juicy and absolutely hop forward. Lots of citrus - orange, lemon, grapefruit primarily.
T/M: Despite the description, this is a very bitter IPA...definitely smacks you with it up front...then gives way to hop flavor with plenty of citrus - mostly grapefruit and lemon notes. A bit of pine in the finish. I'm glad not to get the orange in the taste that I got in the nose though - not my favorite flavor. If I didn't know how to make beer, I'd never guess that there was any malt in this whatsoever. Finishes with a near perfect dryness for an IPA. 
O: This is a raw, down-and-dirty, throwback beer. Haven't had one like this in a good long while. My favorite thing about it is that it's different from the other big DIPAs that everyone gushes over. The market is begging right now for a more traditional, citrusy, good ol' Imperial Hop Bomb - which is what this is. 1,519 characterskbuzz, Apr 28, 2012

It ruined me for other IPAs and until I can find more I'm drinking Sculpin and Deviant Dales. 325 characterssuperdan73, Apr 28, 2012

A-drank from the can as stated and also poured into a tulip once. The color is a really great yellow pale. Right what i would be looking for in DIPA. the second pour came out with the chunks. Probably the hop resin that is supposed to be left in the can,
S- Opening the can produces a hop bomb. It can be smelled across the room. Putting your nose u to it is quite glorious. Citrus and a really great pineyness come out. Delicious
T- Holy hops Batman. The hops are certainly there. It is bitter but not over bearing. It is fruity and piney, and citrusy and really delicious. It puts the hops at the forefront but so gracefully. It's not like a bitter bomb, but also not to malt forward. Really incredible
M- So good for the beer and the style. I love the Elder but I always felt like it lacked in mouth feel. Great in taste and smell, but the mouth feel wasn't there. Not with HT. It is long and lingering. It feels full bodied without getting the extra maltiness. Wonderful
O-I They say to drink from the can and i say yes(though it is awesome out of a glass as well). I think this is an exceptional imperial Ipa. Something to be duplicated, and sought after. I have had and love some Pliny, but I am taking the Topper side. Both great beers but the Alchemist takes the top spot in this battle. 1,438 charactersBrewsoBrewco, Apr 27, 2012

A: Even though poured into a glass and it has it's cloudy/chunky look I won't penalize here as it is meant for can consumption. Plus I look at those chunks and smile as I know what awaits me.
S: Yes there are some hops in this bad boy; resins, pine and some tropical fruits.
T: This is where this beer shines, perfect balance for the style. Solid upfront bitterness that is followed by a great hop flavor profile, and the bitterness gently lingers the whole time and for a time afterwards.
M: It is a DIPA and it is dry as it should be while maintaining a solid malt presence that is very clean.
O: Get it and drink it, it is worth the hype. If trading for it make sure it is fresh as it does lose it's hop profile faster than most other DIPA's I have had. 831 characterslucas1801, Apr 27, 2012

Only poured half the can into a tulip since it advises to drink from the can.
A: Pours a very cloudy light sunburst color with a small creamy white head. The head quickly reduces to a thin film on top. Some spotted lacing is left behind.
S: The hop profile aroma is very good. It starts off with tropical fruits (grapefruit, pineapple, mango), then moves onto a light dank, resiny smell. There is also a bit of pine.
T: Like the aroma, but much more bold. The tropical fruits are lighter in the taste than the aroma which lets the other hop flavors come through more. Much more balanced hop profile.
M: Medium bodied and perfectly carbonated to allow the flavors to dance across the palate. It finishes with a slight bitterness.
O: This is definitely one of the best DIPA's out there. Just as good as my beloved Pliny. Highly recommended. 922 charactersBilbosNuts, Apr 27, 2012

This beer has a massive pour: Half beer, half head in the glass. Sticky white head that wants to last forever. Lacing clings to the sides of the glass. Burnt orange body.
The smell is an explosion of citrus and piney hops. Grapefruit, pineapple, mango and pine resin. Earthy, bitter hops follow the initial floral/tropical sweetness. What a well balanced, well crafted aroma.
The first sip yields a burst of citrus and piney hops just as the nose promised. Each flavor is distinct and well placed. Grapefruit and pine up front followed by earthy, bitter hops and sweetness. Tropical flavors are mixed in as well. Finishes bittersweet. Outstanding.
Medium soft mouthfeel with excellent creaminess. Carbonation is spot on. Assertive, but not overly done. Amazing drinkability.
Heady Topper blew my mind just like the dude on the can. This is right up there with all the best DIPAs. I would seek this out whenever possible. 956 charactersdgugliuzza, Apr 23, 2012

4.75/5  rDev +2.2%look: 2.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Followed instructions and drank from the can, a first for me with an IPA. As a result, I can't judge the appearance, so I gave it an average. Smell was fantastci, grapefruit and pine and grass; hops galore. Taste was intensely citrus and hops, but no super bitter like most DIPA's. Much of tre hoppiness is on the mouth and tongue, but doesn't so much linger down your throat. The grapefruit, orange, grass, pine flavors are huge and awesome. What a great combination of ingredients!
Mouthfeel was not noteworthy; having it from the can. The taste is so good I didn't have time to notice anyway. What a great beer. Only the ABV would prevent me from drinking my entire 4 pack in one sitting. Next one will be in a glass... 722 charactersBeTheBall, Apr 22, 2012

4.05/5  rDev -12.9%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4I drank most of this from the can, but also poured enough of it out to see what it looked like and to see what it's like in the glass. Honestly not sure which I like better. It does seem like the aroma is almost too potent in the glass, making the can a nice step back. 
Appearance is golden and hazy. Moderate carbonation. Aroma is pure piney hops. I'd hoped for more tropical fruit or citrus, but it's almost one-note piney, though those notes are there. Just not upfront. 
Flavor is bitter, very bitter. Dry and woody, it's attack to the palate is relentless. The citrus missing in the aroma appears a little bit in the taste (grapefruit). Malt backbone balance is almost non-existent. I've certainly had hoppier, but the ones I enjoy the most are more balance. Still, the hop presence is impressive and the flavor really opens up and bitterness subsides as the beer warms. 
Mouthfeel is actually where the beer stands out. The intense bitterness really creates a lively mouthfeel, with a strong aftertaste. 
Overall, this is a very good DIPA. I've had others I prefer, but that in no way is a knock on this beer as the reason I prefer others is balance. I also prefer more hop emphasis on aroma and taste rather than bitterness. That's just personal preference. 1,269 charactersBlanco, Apr 22, 2012
4.67/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Heady Topper pours a very cloudy honey color, hints of orange and soft brown, lots of sediment floating around the glass, much of it sinks to the bottom, a faint head pops up but doesn’t stick around too long, not much of a residual film and some mild soapy lacing sticks to the glass. The aroma is fantastic, big notes of citrus, heavy on the grapefruit, but with a nice amount of tropical fruits, mango, papayas and pineapple come to mind. A healthy amount of grassy and dirtier pine-like hops come through as well, very bitter that cuts the brightness and sweetness very well, almost no malt presence to speak of, some faint biscuit hides in the shadows of huge hoppy aromas. The flavors are wonderful, huge bright notes of citrusy hops, grapefruit, lemon zest, the tropical sweeter flavors are there, some pineapple and mango, but again, a wonderful bitterness from some dry pine and weedy flavors, just a super dank hop profile. Like the aroma, only the faintest biscuity malt can be detected underneath a potent hop forward palate. Nice full body, coats the mouth really well, goes down super easily, remains wonderfully dry and bitter, keeps you coming back without leaving an unpleasant cotton mouth experience. 
Verdict: Sublime IPA, I still like Pliny a bit more, but this is just an incredible beer. I like everything that’s happening here, great hop profile, the flavors are balanced exceptionally well, certainly one of those beers where you suddenly look down and the glass is empty, it’s that good. Cheers to The Alchemist, I will definitely have to get a lot more of this. 1,595 characterskevanb, Apr 22, 2012

Poured a very cloudy, gold-peach-yellow color with a healthy puff of white head; nice retention and lacing. No worries about floaters on tap. As in the can, big aroma of hops, lemons, and an afterthought of pine needles. Taste is equally laden with juicy hop goodness, lemon, grapefruit, more lemon, pith and pleasant bitterness, light notes of pine and pineapple. Medium body, juicy and fresh up front, crisp and drying in the finish; excellent beer as always. 
The Cannery makes for a nice easy diversion and is a quick jaunt from Burlington. Since we can't review breweries here for whatever reason, I'll just quickly note that they have a nice simple set-up, plenty of cans for purchase, sample-sized pours on tap, and lots of neat merch, as well as a self-guided tour.

N: Very tropical with pineapple, papaya, tangerine and mango. Navel orange and lemon. Nice bready aromas along with caramel.
T: Juicy tangerine, papaya and mango with touches of peach and pineapple upfront. Mid-palate has big bready malts drizzled in caramel with notes of lemon juice and navel orange. Finishes initially with the breadiness taking over and transitions to pine needles and maybe some grapefruit pith.
M: Medium-full bodied, juicy, smooth, dry and slightly sticky. Carbonation is light.

4.02/5  rDev -13.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Heady Topper came out the can looking like a muddy stream but settled in the glass looking reasonably presentable. Its complexion really varies depending on the angle and closeness of the light, ranging from clear straw yellow to thick mango smoothie. Heady does not have much head, nor does it show any signs of carbonation. 
The aroma has such a floral and fruity bouquet that you'd think it was designed by a gardener. That being said, there's a little bit of butterscotch and nutty-sweet malt that can't be ignored. Still, the bouquet's most prominent feature is likely the flower petals or the citrusy pineapple notes. There's a bit of white wine grape too. 
The flavor is far from overwhelming but there is a notable absence of any alcohol. The soapy, pungent bitterness that lingers is the smoking gun for some early kettle hop additions. For something so strong and so hoppy the beer is incredibly manageable and composed. Warming unties things slightly, but that is to be expected. 
I think anyone who's graduated past pale lagers should be able to appreciate this IPA. It tastes like a combination of grapefruit, orange, papaya, and lime, and leaves a distinctly floral aftertaste. Hints of pine bark pop up here and there as well. The malts taste like some kind of caramel and almond biscuit and have an almost nougat-like sweetness.
If one believed all he read on Beer Advocate then so he would think Heady Topper the best DIPA in the world - and so he would be wrong. I don't wish to take anything away from the fine people at The Alchemist - this is a damn fine brewsky - but there are many out there just like it. Seek it out, by all means, but don't trade the stars and the moon. 1,699 charactersbiegaman, Apr 20, 2012

I will say the announcement was made it was coming and it showed up at stores 2 days later. This beer is fresh! So glad to have a chance to drink this liquid gold (know where my review is going??)
Poured from a can directly into my mouth, just as the can states. I will drink the next one from the glass to see if there is actually a difference.
A: Not entirely sure since I drank it from a can, but the little I poured out after I had finished most of the can was a very cloudy sediment riddled medium golden color with some orange hints.
S: Wow, the smell just oozes from the can opening up to your nostrils. Huge tropical fruit up front with grapefruit, mango and others with some slight caramel sweetness. Tropical fruit is huge and you get an idea what's coming next.
T: The tropical fruits just pop. Huge waves of hoppy goodness with grapefruit, pineapple, mango and passion fruit. There is this sight malt sweetness that is sort of there, but never really comes out. Towards the back of the flavor I am getting some pine which I did not pick up on the nose. Finish is dry and clean but not bitter. There was some slight bitterness coupled with the pine but it does not finish bitter. Absolutely no alcohol present. Wow, fan-freaking-tastic.
M: A thing of beauty. Medium mouthfeel with some slight bitterness and a crisp dry finish and no alcohol. The mouthfeel is hurt just a little in that it does not linger on too long. 
O: This beer lives up to the hype and will stand as one of the greatest IPAs out there, just awesome. It helps that this one is super fresh, but there is no question about the quality of this beer. Wow.
Overall this beer is one for the ages. Those that have not tried it yet, this is a must. I'm a hug fan of Pliny, my only perfect "5" I ever reviewed, but this beer comes real close to perfection, real damn close. Amazing beer. 1,970 charactersKadonny, Apr 19, 2012

I bought it with ease. Purchased a single at Capone's and a 4-pack from the bottle shop at Local 44. Props to Origlio for pulling in a great brewery, it's about time you guys found some new blood.
A silver can, the liquid dispersed in the pint shows a golden orange glaze that haze some hazy within the liquid. Floating particles seen throughout suspended. Not much of a head or even a cap, just a small white ring around the collar.
Smell is pretty bold with a lot of citrus and high dry hopping scent. The funny thing is there is a weird scent that I cant describe that's either a distinct hop variety (im thinking summit) or a odd malt type. Kinda reminds me of the Ephraim scent. The scent while not my thing, is lingering.
Taste on the other hand is right up there with the big boys. Out of the CAN, the finish is a bit crisper, while the glass version comes off smother. Either way, a whole lot of dry hopping with citrus, grapefruit, mango, with a sharp pine taste as well. Bitter, but not over the top. Some grassy taste lingers on the tounge with warming.
Feel is pretty much medium, but it really drinks easy as hell, goes down without a burn and not a alarming overly bitter aftertaste. Carbonation is there and not overly done. After the CAN was done, my mouth is not attacked and wrecked, this is the sign of a great DIPA, one that you can drink a few of. I don't know what else to say, this is tasty beer. 1,549 charactersBARFLYB, Apr 19, 2012

A: Pours a hazy orange color with a generous white head that bubbles and craters away, leaving thin curtains of lace.
S: This beer smells amazing. All the best hoppy fruit flavors all at once. Citrus, pineapple, mango, apricots. A little bit of pine. I wish I could just smell this all day.
T: Waves of hoppy goodness. Similar hop profile as the aroma: chocked full of tropical fruits and citrus. The pine flavor is a little stronger and now there are some herbal notes; grass cuttings. The finish lingers with herbals hops and an ever-so-mild touch of alcohol for a long time.
M: Smooth, medium bodied and with a little effervescent carbonation. Sort of oily, really coats your mouth.
O: Good. Damn good. What all other IPA's should aspire to. Better than PtE? I'd say so. 816 charactersWankelEngine, Apr 19, 2012

Thanks to my brother (Mitchell) for going way out of the way to pick up a case while in Vermont. While I will agree with many that Heady will not be winning any awards for appearance, it certainly deserves ever bit of its rating on BA. Heady Topper is definitely one of the best IIPA’s I have ever drank in my life. The hops come in waves and while it never overpowers you it continuously lets you know you are drinking an IIPA. It is scary because it is so drinkable that I could throw back a few of these without hesitation but at 8% is will definitely let you know you have been drinking. It starts off with wave after wave of piney citrus hops in the nose. The hops are present but very drinkable with the same piney citrus mouth feel. This beer is unbelievable as sip after sip coats your mouth with a wave of hops. This beer is definitely better cold as it looses some of the wonderful characteristics as it warms. Follow the instructions on the can and drink it fresh, cold, and from the can and you will not be disappointed! 1,143 charactersbvdubn, Apr 18, 2012

What really got me was the aroma, i was practically drinking with my nose. I also love how it comes in a four pack of 16 ounce cans, not a 22 ounce bottle like most of those world class beers. I am definitely making another trip up for some more. The only thing I thought can be a bad thing or good thing i guess is you will have that delicious taste in your mouth for a while.

A: Pours a hazy golden color with two and a half fingers of white head. Retention is not bad.
S: An equal mixture of juicy tropical fruits and pine. All hops, though. Extremely clean aroma, clean and simple. Maybe a light pineapple sweetness.
T: The taste starts out with moderate bitterness accompanied by light, clean pineapple juiciness. The hop flavor then kicks in with mostly pine - very pleasant. The balance here is wonderful between bitterness and light sweetness and a great, strong hop flavor. No hint of ABV.
M: A tad on the thick side with great carbonation.
O: There is great balance in this beer. It's certainly quite hoppy, but it's not overly bitter, not overly sweet, and not overly watery. The hop flavor and aroma is in your face, too. I suggest leaving a couple ounces in the can, though - otherwise there is lots of yeast. 878 characterscoreyfmcdonald, Apr 14, 2012

No born on date 
Big thanks to nutter for sending this one over in a trade
A: Pours out a yellowish amber, think apple cider colored, with 1.5 fingers width of sea foam white head, with decent retention but after a min or two dissipates down to a thin film. There is just an absurd amount of sedimentation suspended in the glass.  Some may find it gross, but I actually don't mind it.  That how I know it's made from the good stuff!  Leaves a fair amount of lacing, but could be more, especially compared to some others in the style.  
S: Very aromatic.  Holy hell the citrus notes are out of this world! Peach, orange, lemon, grapefruit, apricot, mango.  There are also some accompanying piney hops, and some floral notes.  I get almost no malt presence (and I like it!), just a faint subtle sweetness.  Malts be damned.  I may have found a beer that smells better than Hopslam (maybe). 
T: The citrus hop bouquet is not quite there in the taste.  Don't get me wrong, this is still a hop bomb, but the citrus profile is not to the degree that the nose implies.  The biggest hop presence in the taste is a biting piney hop bitterness.  On the citrus side I do get orange, lemon zest, grapefruit, and peach.  Unlike the nose, there is a malt presence, which acts to balance things out nicely.  Some sweetness comes out as it warms.  Really good, but not quite as good as the nose. 
M/D: So very smooth, which to me is one of the big things that separates the great DIPAs from the just good ones.  It has a very subtle carbonation, which I appreciate and prefer.  There is an impressive drying quality that acts to wipe the palate clean quickly after each sip. Does a great job of masking the ABV.  Drinkability is very high as well, this pint went down way too easily and fast. Just about perfect for the style in this area. 
O: Overall, one of the best example I have tried of one of my favorite styles.  I still think fresh Hopslam is the epitome of the DIPA style, and this one doesn't knock the king off it's thrown, but I think it's fair to say its my #2.  Blows Pliny the Elder out of the water if you ask me, and that's saying something.  Definitely a beer all hop heads need to try. For the next one, I think I will drink it out of the can.  And I can't wait.   2,498 characterszac16125, Apr 13, 2012

Scent is just what anyone would want in a DIPA...such lovely hop aroma! Tropical hops with intense, bitter pine notes. Smells so fresh and hoppy...pineapple, grapefruit, melon, pine sap, guava, orange, lemon...SO INVITING. Taste is lacking in the malt profile...which is GREAT! Being from the west coast, this is just what I like. A little bit of malt, but not enough to make this delicious brew lose any points. Lovely citrus and tropical fruit flavors with just the right amount of bitterness. No lingering bitterness with this beer...crisp and clean. The palate is miraculously wiped clean after a few seconds of each sip. Mouthfeel is medium bodied, full of flavor, and crisp finish. Drinkability is Very High. ABV not even noticeable. Overall, this was a great experience. I am very impressed considering this drinks like a west coast style DIPA...love the lack of malt. I wish I had regular access to this so I could drink it like the can recommends... straight from the can. Brilliant beer! 1,115 charactersDovaliHops, Apr 13, 2012

A - Ugly! It's the girl in high school that had the most desirable personality but wore an eye patch and was overweight. You just need to love it. Super cloudy with all sorts of shit hanging out in the body. Who cares? I can already smell it. 
S - Wowzas. HUGH hop notes. Smells like pineapple, citrus, hop-oils and a bag of weed. It's completely unique. There's malt in this? 
T - Fucking amazing. The best way I can describe it is like a sort of dank citrus fruit. Pineapple, mango, grapefruit and something that would taste like the resin leftover if you were to smoke hops in a bong. If you've had Heady, you know what I'm talking about. No malt, that simple. 
M - This is where this beer stands out. There is basically no bitterness to this beer, it's all sweet, sweet flavor. I don't know what the hell Alchemist is doing to achieve this witchcraft, but I love it. Creamy as hell and pretty decently carbed. This drinks much like a cask ale, just a tad more carbonated. Honestly, if you like hop flavors and hate bitterness, you'd be in heaven with this. 
O - Stop reading this review and buy/trade for this beer. it's the bees-knees. 1,240 charactersDevilsCups, Apr 13, 2012

16 oz can. I had the first few sips from the can and then decided to pour this one into a glass to do get a proper score on appearance. I'll drink any future ones right from the can, I promise.
It poured an orange amber color with a thin but sticky white head barely covering the top of the beer. The head faded a little but left some great lacing as it did. 
The aroma is bright and juicy with some notes of peach, pineapple and grapefruit coming out in it. I love the juicy, tropical fruit notes in it. Fantastic hoppy aroma overall.
The taste sows more of the bright, juicy, tropical fruit notes to it up front. Towards the finish some of the bitter, citrus rind and grapefruit flavors start to mix in and linger through the finish. Hop Bomb, excellent balance though. 
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a fantastic beer, I loved the bright, juicy hoppiness. It had a great range of flavors to it and was very drinkable. Possibly the best beer I have had in my house and def out of a can.
Want more. 1,076 charactersphishphorce, Apr 13, 2012

Couldn't wait!).
pours a lighter straw-yellow than I was expecting with a huge wallop of hops right out of the can. there's a lot of sticky lacing and the beer settles into a cloudy sun-orange. aroma of, you guessed it, hops - candied orange peel-and-pine hops. it smells just a little like the orange-wedge shaped gummy candies from my childhood and fresh spring pine shoots.
the flavor is a bit more pine than citrus, like the new green needles on a fir or spruce (minus the resiny bitterness). it's what a DIPA is supposed to be - a flavorful combination of hops with enough malt to cut the acid and bitterness, allowing you to taste it all the way through. it's complex but straightforward and to the point. possibly one of my favorite DIPA's - up with Pliny and Hopslam, but stands apart due to it's bitterness (in comparison) and complex hop flavors. I'm a major fan, now if only I could get it more often... 1,170 charactersfvernon, Apr 12, 2012

T- Dank hops, somewhat floral, citrus, bitter but ballanced by a light sweetness.
M- Right consistency, a bit lumpy, could use a bit more carbonation.

A - A soft yellow/orange hue with a bubbly white head that stick around for a bit. Little cloudy, but looks good.
S - Tangerine, citrus hops dominate with a incredibly nice floral aspect that rounds this aroma out nicely. While some IIPA's can have hop crazy smells, which I usually like, this one is quite subtle but it works. It's quite appealing.
T - Those citrus hops hit up front, with a big blast, but just like the smell, piney hops poke through here and there. Makes the taste pop, and quite assertive in a good way. Taste is unrelenting, hoppy from the beginning to well into the aftertaste. Well balanced and complex.
M - Mouthfeel is very smooth, aside from the assertive hop. Very drinkable, which could be dangerous. Carbonation is good, and not too high which could make those hops overload possibly if too high.
O - One of the best northeast IIPA's I've had. A great job of taking some floral, piney hops and integrating a wonderful citrus flavor that keeps you coming back. Very drinkable and delicious. Overall, I can't really find many holes in this beer. It hit all the spots that it should, and then some. Well done. 1,224 charactersScrumtralecent, Apr 12, 2012

4.8/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5-reviwed from notes-
Appearance-Drank this straight from the can as instructed.
Smell-This is what all DIPA should smell like. I closed my eyes when smelling this just to intensify the experience like my sight was interfering with my sense of smell. The scents I picked up on-super-premium citra hops (rinds of citrus fruits), pine, grass.
Taste-This is where it got interesting. I swear the tastes differentiated at least 3x when I drank from the can. Not in a bad way, but the onslaught to my buds were hard to keep up with. At some times it was the perfect citrus bomb. Next sip would be mostly grass. The sip right after would be light citrus mixed with some pine.
Mouthfeel-Full mouthfeel-spot on carbonation. For a DIPA this one begs for you to continue drinking and I happily oblige.
Overall-This was probably the single best IPA I will have. When I started to drink this I thought to myself how can anyone drive a couple hundred miles for this beer-now I've pulled a 180. How can I not drive to VT for this when I'm already in upstate NY. After I drank this beer I refused to rate/take notes in the beers I had the same week-for a very simple reason. There is no way another beer can line up. This beer is perfection in a can. 1,235 charactersFirkin-Bunghole, Apr 10, 2012

Wave after wave of insanely fresh hops, with absolutely explosive aftertastes. I stick to The Alchemist's recommendation, and drink it straight from the can, so it's tough to comment on appearance, but that's hardly necessary for this big, fresh double IPA. In spite of being a slightly lower ABV than many double IPAs, it packs a bit of a punch, probably because the alcohol is entirely covered up by the hops. Make sure you drink it fresh, and don't fear drinking it out of the can! 597 charactersJDRomano2, Apr 09, 2012

poured into a snifter
appearance: an opaque golden color, very unique, nice clean looking 1" white head, chunks of yeast that pour out at the end. very unique looking for an ipa

palate: medium bodied, medium carbonation, heavy alcohol feel to it, and yet this beer feels pretty smooth and very crisp
taste: big citrus flavors, a true DIPA in taste, a bit flowery too, huge kick
overall: definitely one of the best DIPAs ive had in my life, but it didnt quite live up to my expectations. dont get me wrong, this beer is great, and if i lived in NE USA id be drinking it all the time. but theres just as good (some better like zombie dust, odell) ipas/dipas that i can get my hands on much easier.

Hop insanity in a can! Lots of talk about this brewski finally being canned. The greatness forgives the sheer rawness it brings to the palate. In our opinion, this is what sets it apart from other highly hopped ales in the US. Keep it tamed in the can, as pouring it out will only show the extreme rustic measures to make this beer. 634 charactersBeerAdvocate, Apr 06, 2012
4.9/5  rDev +5.4%look: 3.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 5Review #100! Big thanks to Fijii13 for this one. 16 oz. can poured into pint. Decided to ignore the request on the can for reviewing purposes. Had the second straight from the can.
A - Pours a very hazy pale caramel/orange color with very little off white head. More floaters than I have ever seen in any other beer. They are suspended throughout the body and I am guessing this is why they want you to keep it in the can. There is so much floating uniform sediment, that it looks impressive and intended, so I won't really dock it too many points for that.
S - Powerful tangerine and grapefruit citrus with some subtle malts. The hops are piney and spicy, but they pale in comparison to the citrus and tropical aromas emanating from the glass.
T - Fantastic tropical fruit flavor coupled with some tart citrus on the front. Once it reaches the back of the tongue, there are some piney hops that linger, but they do not detract form the forward citrus flavors. I am blown away by the flavor. The aftertaste is of nice, dry hops. Balanced and impressive. I could drink several of these in one sitting. 
M - Medium body with some delicate, tingly carbonation. Extremely smooth with a dry finish. Every sip leaves me wanting more. No alcohol present here.
O - Despite the lofty expectations I had for this beer, I was not disappointed. It is not overwhelmingly hoppy for the style, but the hop flavors work very well with the dominating citrus and tropical fruits. The finish and aftertaste are a remarkable blend of bitter and sweet. I was able to keep myself to only consuming two tonight, but I easily could have drank all four. A beer deserving of its world class rating that I will certainly seek out in future trades. It is not the hoppiest or biggest, but it is damn near the best. I highly recommend it. 1,813 charactersNoLeafClover44, Apr 06, 2012

Pours hazy straw yellow with lumps of sediment all over the place. Nice head of white reaches 2 fingers high, decent retention with little flecks of lace.
Nice perfume aroma with a nice mixture of resin, herbaceous grasses and earthy tones. Nice malt sweetness a touch of caramel and doughy. A bit tropical and exotic interesting aroma.
Caramel malt, very doughy and chewy to balance the resinous and grassy hop profile. No citrus yet it's got tropical notes. Really herbaceous with wonderful balance and a steady bitterness. 
Finishes dry and a sticky coating that leaves lasting bitterness. Perfect carbonation and the body is chewy and raw.
Very evident why you need to drink this one out of the can, it has perfect balance and comes out of the gates swinging with a unique east coast bold hop profile. Raw and resinous yet well crafted.

Appearance - Hazy amber colour with a large size frothy off white coloured head. It's hard to make out the amount of carbonation and there is some good lacing. The head lasted for over 5 minutes before it was gone.
Smell - Malts, caramel, hops, grapefruit, lemons, tangerines
Taste & Mouth - There is an average amount of carbonation and the taste is made up of caramel and malts mixed with hops. It also has a wack of citrus flavours - lemons, grapefruits, and tangerines. Juice and zest. It ends with a sweet and bitter hop aftertaste.
Overall - It reminded me of a pliny meets rad racer taste wise. It's got a lot of lemony citrus flavour that almost makes it seem more like an IPA than a DIPA. I consider this the pliny of the east - worth seeking out. 795 charactersspinrsx, Apr 05, 2012

Poured into a Duvel tulip. Hazy golden color with lots of sediment mixed in. The head is a dirty white, very dense and produces staying power and lacing.
Very fruity and slightly effervescent nose. A mixed bag of tropical fruits with citrus standing out the most. Mouth watering scents!
Lovely hop burst up front with grassy and leafy notes to go with the marijuana hop presence. Lovely malt backbone to cut through some of the bitterness. Grapefruit lingers at the end and into the aftertaste. 
Very smooth and soft all around. A medium body with a warm alcohol presence at the end.
Great beer, so glad I finally got to try it. This definitely goes towards the top of the list for the style. 768 charactersjera1350, Apr 05, 2012

A - cloudy orange color, foamy head, not too vigorous. Actually the head fades quickly. 
S - smell of hops as soon as the can opens. it fills the room. Sweet, very citrusy. Getting a little yeast fragrance too 
T - wow. Lots of hops but there is more to it than that. Almost a citrus bite. Nice resiny bitterness, but I can still taste the grains. 
M - thick and chewy, but the bitterness keeps it from being cloying. fizz comes back in your mouth 
O - as the can says "so drinkable it is scary". Pretty delicious. Extra credit for local and canned. My favorite beer style, done right. How can I not give it 5's. Going to have to have a blind taste test with Resin and G'Knight. 791 charactersgreenengineer, Apr 04, 2012

Not the biggest fan of drinking from cans, but it seems thats the brewers preference. Not much booze until it warms up, which makes that 8% catch up with you fast, but the cans also warns you off this. Listen. The can makes it feel like a session beer but it's far for a session beer.

16oz can poured into a pint glass
Appearance : very cloudy golden color. A nice one finger white head forms after a less than aggressive pour that slowly dissipates to sticky lacing
Smell : lots of wonderful evergreen and pine tree aromas. Lots of pineapple and orange citrus aroms also abound
Taste : flavor is spot on one the most easy beer to fall in love with. Tons of orange citrus flavors and pineapple dominant. Finishes with mild hop bitterness. Strong malt backbone adds a pleasant sweetness 
Mouthfeel : medium bodied brew with pleasant carbonation 
Overall : I really love to drink this beer quickly I just can't seem to sip this one. I suggest drinking this one in a big gulps. Every BA owes it to themselves to seek this beer out. Make sure to get your self a 4pak because one is not enough 850 charactersBUNZILLA, Mar 30, 2012

4.18/5  rDev -10.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4On draft at Blind Tiger.
Beautiful pour, plenty of head with solid retention. Aroma holds fresh hops, pine, malt, citrus. Great balance of malts and hops in the flavor profile. Many Vermont IPAs fall into the West Coast style while Heady sits somewhere between East and West.
My biggest criticism of Heady Topper is its relatively thin body compared to other DIPAs. It's much improved on draft (vs the cans I've had), yet still lacking. But this is just splitting hairs -- HT is easily one of the best DIPAs brewed today. 523 charactersbrystmar, Mar 29, 2012

4.59/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5First - thanks to MRMOJORISIN for bringing cans to our annual ABB-festival.
A: Yes, I ignored the warnings on the can, and, after a couple sips, poured it into a mug. The result? A cloudy, hazy dark orange with a ton of stuff in suspension (given the smell, I'm guessing hop remnants of some sort). On top is a finger of white head.
S: The nose is intense. Dank. Perfumey. Loads of citrus (grapefruit & lemon zest) and pine (resin and needles). This is a hop lover's nose.
T: Citrus and tropical fruity hop goodness, with resiny, bitter pine and a hint of apricot. After the palate gets adjusted to that big hop onslaught, I sense a bit of sweeter malt underneath, but it's having trouble asserting itself here. Lingering lemony bitterness in the aftertaste, and a little bit of heat from the 8% ABV is felt in the belly. Man, I'll be tasting this lingering palate-coating hops assault for awhile.
M: The body is medium in heft with only a modest level of carbonation. Finishes dry - and bitter. Real bitter. Brings to mind my first tastes of Victory Hop Wallop or Stone Ruination many, many years ago. 
O: This is great stuff for a hophead. I'm not sure you'd want to drink more than one or two of these, however, but if you like a fresh-tasting, hop-juiced beer, this should be right up your alley.
D: Certainly a very, very good IPA. Actually reminded me a lot of Sculpin, but more bitter. Would definitely like to have this one again. 1,444 charactersKendo, Mar 29, 2012

S: Smells like a bag of fresh hop pellets. Concentrated hop aroma mixed with pineapple, orange and wet pine. A superb example of what a DIPA should smell like.
M: I noticed the hops coating my mouth with with a thick layer of greatness which stuck around for what seemed like forever. The flavor of hops lingered in my mouth until I drank something else. 
T: By far one of the most delicious DIPA's I have ever had. Starts out with a beautiful upfront pine flavor followed by an almost marshmallow like sweetness. As the can states, not much bitterness just layers and layers of hops. Citrus, passion fruit, and pine blast the palate with flavor. No alcohol present, I could enjoy these all day.
O: Incredible "drinkability" I think someone should give up their slogan. Haha. Really glad I got my hands on one of these, thanks to ixodus for throwing in this amazing extra. It was so good im going to have to get more at some point. 1,084 charactersshuntstout, Mar 28, 2012

Appearance: I generally drink from the can, but like most, I had to pour at least a little in the glass for comparison purposes. It is cloudy (unfiltered), but pours a beautiful pale orange color with great head and lacing. 
Smell: Seriously dank. Tropical fruit. Big citrus. Some pine. Big peach notes. Serious depth and complexity. Pale, sweet balancing malt. Rivaling Surly Abrasive for best smelling beer ever.
Taste: Just wonderful. Maybe the slightest hair behind the nose, but very close. Big citrus and pine. Some Columbus-like vegetal notes. Big dankness again. Quite bitter, but the hop flavor dominates. Enough malt to balance, but this is a hop bomb. 
Mouthfeel: Very long, dry finish. The hop flavor lingers on your palate forever. Carbonation is on point. Lifts the beer off the palate easily. Has to be the most drinkable 8% beer on the planet. All I can think about when I finish a can is opening another one.
Lives up to the hype and then some. Between Abner and Heady, I think I'll start searching for jobs in Vermont. 1,135 charactersjacewg, Mar 27, 2012

Pours a hazy golden peach color with a solid 2 finger head that dissipates slowly into a thick bubbly film on the surface. Leaves thick lacing on the glass.
Aroma is heavily grapefruit based, with dank resin and slightly sweet caramel malt giving a rich, decadent balance. By far one of the hoppiest beers I've smelled. Pine and mint surface as it warms, adding to the complexity.
The flavor is delicious! Tropical fruit, mangoes, pineapple, and a grapefruit tang assault the mouth, with a bready malt backbone providing a transition into pine, resin, and a slightly bitter finish. Apricot and tangerine add more depth of flavor to this fruit salad of a brew.
Body is moderate, with a fairly high level of carbonation and a warming alcohol finish. 
Overall, the best dipa I've had to date. It's hop nectar to the extreme. I don't want the experience to end! 941 charactersbarczar, Mar 27, 2012

Nice foamy head at first, fades away and leaves a nice ring of lacing. I have never seen a beer this disgusting to look at. Looks like a bunch of lugees floating in my beer.
S- Fresh harvested honey, some hints of citrus, mostly orange and tangerine. Smells of wet hay, pineapple, mango and some funkiness. I really like this! It's not IIPA so to speak, but it's really fantastic! Lots of sweet maltiness. 
T- Green tea, honey, mulch, and a ton of pineapple, mango, and citrus. Might be old, or maybe it's supposed to be this way.. not sure. Reminds me of Hopslam... lots of honey sweetness, with some citrus character. No real definition to this brew. Sweet and citrusy. It wishes it was DFH 120 without the balls to be such! 
M- Caramel, rotted citrus peel and wet hay. By far the thickest IIPA I've ever experienced. 
O- Horrible to look at, AMAZING to sit and smell... tastes sweet and has a nice honey citrus flavor. Almost too sweet for an IIPA. Not enough citrusy punch for my liking. Very unusual and glad I tried it. Big thanks to Ubufan2112 for hooking me up! I'd certainly love to try this one again.

Big tropical fruit notes, pineapple is giant. Juciy, fresh grapefruit and orange notes. Nice pine notes add some bitterness too. Hugely hoppy, but with the perfect amount of bitterness. Get different hop notes with each sip and they keep coming. Awesome drinkability, the hop blend goes down like a Gatorade. Overall, the best DIPA I've had to date.

The color is lighter than I would have guessed. It's a nice butterscotch color with not much of a head to be found. Its a bit hazy. And the nice hop particles floating in the glass let me know that my hop cravings will quickly be satiated. 
The smell is pure heaven. If it tastes even close to what it smells like, I'll be in nirvana. 
The taste just blew me away. Hands down the best brew I have had in quite some time. It is incredibly well balanced. Just like the can says: it's not super bitter. The hops just dance on your tongue. Citrus notes abound. I crave more with every sip. Damn my brother for only giving me two cans! I am trying to figure out when I can make it to Vermont to get more...this turned me into an addict needing my next fix! I want to eat it. I want to bathe in it. I want to use it as a shampoo. I want it as a cologne. I want to put it into a humidifier and infuse my bedroom with it so I can fall asleep to Heady Topper dancing through my head.

This beer is a hazy yellow-orange. Tons of hop floaties in there. No head. Yet another reason to drink it from the can! The aroma is sublimely hoppy. Citrus, pine, and resin aromas dominate on the nose. Taste? Oh dear god. HOPS. I could say that there's a light amount of caramel malts, but it's really a secondary flavor to the absurd amount of DELICIOUS hops in here. It's nowhere near overly bitter, instead just providing an absolutely delicious, resiny hop experience with so many layers. The mouthfeel is fairly light and goes down very easily. The drinkability is absurdly good, I can crush this down like it's a 5% pale ale. If you like IPAs, you HAVE to experience this beer, at any cost. It's absolutely fantastic. World class. And yes, it is better from the can. 922 charactersshand, Mar 24, 2012

4.83/5  rDev +3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A: A bright tangerine orange is dense with large, bran colored floaties. Dancing yeast cake is evidence of a good swirling carbonation. Frothy cream colored head sits well with a respectable amount of lace. One, I love a ipa that stays true to tradition and stays pale, without the influence of toasted specialty grains. Two, I love the extra visual of dancing yeast floaties, like a snow globe adding not only a visual sense but some vitamins as well.
S: The nose was of a sweet tropical fruity nature, mangos, fresh wet pine and some sweet orange/citrus mix. A dash of peppery spice is light along with some passion fruit. Very soothing, clean and polished. 
T: The flavor was sweet and citrusy pine and oranges with a dash of peppery spice. Dried tropical fruitiness of pineapple-orange. Dry pale grains are crisp and clean, free from specialty grain coverup providing a nice base. Spicy citric elements, cypress, hoppy, but not over the top bragging rights, but rather a smooth, eloquent and jazz filled refinement providing an even flow of hoppy flavors from start to finish that was highly respectable, but never overbearing and obnoxious. Very sweet, tropical and citrusy. 
M: Medium bodied, nice dryness of citrus with a dash of peppery spice sits well on the tongue.
O: Overall is very, very drinkable. An ideal tropical island drink with an ideal tropical and citrusy hop nature. Very even flow of hoppiness, refined and smooth with citric elements, peppery spicing and keg worthy. Would be my go to IPA if demand and market allowed. Again love the fact that it has a clean pale grain base, strong hop presence and junk in the glass for a visual bonus.Gentle lingering spicy west coast hops provide an invite for the next sip. Didn’t want this beer to be finished. 1,780 charactersbeerthulhu, Mar 22, 2012

Simply put this is an awesome double IPA and is something brewers around the country need to measure themselves against.
EDIT: It's been a couple years since my first review and since then this beer has become a legend.  My feeling now is that the bar Alchemist reached is getting met by other breweries.  Having accumulated a stash of HT recently, I poured out one and had another from the can (thanks to a few trades for Surlys - thanks traders) and I still can't deny the excellence of this beer.

Not only am I grateful to Al for this can but I'm also grateful for the Surly Darkness snifter I poured a sampled into (the rest being enjoyed from the can per the brewery's guidance). 
Poured a hazy yellow with a thin crop of white foam sitting on top. Lacking head retention although some lacing clings to the glass. 
My favorite part of this beer was the nose which showcased intense citrus hop aroma with an initial burst of grapefruit and then some lemon wedged between a back-end of tangerine. Detecting some grassiness as well. Cleanly fermented. 
Prominent grapefruit in the flavor combining with an herbal/grassy component. Very high level of bitterness that I find somewhat harsh and detracting from drinkability. Finishes a touch sweeter with a mandarin-like fruitiness. 
Medium-light in body, moderately carbonated. Slightly viscous mouthfeel was unexpected, perhaps due to hop oils. Also picking up some astringency and a warming sensation. 
Layered complexity in the hop aroma is a real treat here but the bitterness is somewhat harsh and hinders drinkability. Wishing for something smoother. Certainly a very good beer but there's definitely room for improvement. 1,286 charactersBrewerB, Mar 22, 2012

S - Lots of hops. Very piney, some floral and citrus notes as well. The slightest scent of sweet malt.
T - Tastes great and amazingly balanced. Sweet malty caramel flavor followed by very piney and again slightly floral and citrus hops. Nice refreshing bitter finish but not overpowering at all.
F - Medium-bodied, nicely carbonated, crisp and dry bitter finish. Bitterness stays around for a little while, especially on the tongue, but is not overbearing. No sign of alcohol at any point.
O - This beer was delicious and one of the most unique DIPAs I've had. First of all, it looks very different, with a very hazy appearance and lots of floaters. Despite this, it smells and tastes terrific and very different than most other DIPAs. It has lots of piney aromas and flavors while a lot of others have mostly citrusy and grapefruit smells and tastes.

Smell - Potent stuff. Very crisp, sweet citrus aroma up front, gives way to a more piney resin smell. Really nice.
Taste - More of the citrus here with notes of grapefruit, and sweet hop flavors. Malt character is present but is very harmonious with the hops throughout. Fades to a very bitter finish that lingers around on the tongue for some time. 
Mouthfeel - Nice carbonation level and thickness here. 
Overall - Great DIPA, aroma is through the roof and the malts stand up to the super hoppy beer very well without being dominant. Definitely worth trading for if you can. 697 charactersccarney2, Mar 21, 2012

Smells incredible but very subtle- grapefruit and tangerine with a little spice of hops at the end.
Tastes even more incredible- full, round hop flavor. A little malt at the beginning and then the hops take over. A little grapefruit at first and then soft piney notes with a nice medium dry finish. Superb.
Mouthfeel is also exceptional. Medium bodied with light to moderate carbonation. Get this if you can!!
PS- Flavor is more direct out if the can but I prefer it in the glass. Give both a try. 657 charactersHopdaemon39, Mar 19, 2012

4.72/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a muddy, opaque light orange with floating sediment. Thin head quickly settles. 4
Very fruity citrusy nose. Mostly tangerines and clementines, also some lemon-lime. Piney, earthy hops in the background. 4.5
Taste follows the nose. I initially get a very strong citrus hop taste, almost tastes like I'm drinking orange-grapefruit juice. Very well balanced with a light caramel malt. Aftertaste transforms from delicate tangerine, to bitter grapefruit, and builds to a "west-coast" piney, resiney hop profile. Eventually, the piney hops dominate. 4.5
Taste from the can: hoppier, more bitter, stronger pine. More aggressive DIPA. ...better. 5
Mouthfeel is full bodied, just the right carbonation. Spot on for the style. 5
Overall, an excellent, superbly balanced DIPA. Certainly worth seeking out. 4.5 810 charactersAdrianized, Mar 19, 2012

Canned 2/2/12.
Pours a murky honey yellow with a white head that settles to a film on top of the beer. Small dots of lace form around the glass on the drink down. Smell is fantastic with citrus zest, citrus fruit, and tropical fruit aromas. Taste is the same with citrus fruit, citrus zest, and tropical fruit up front with a malt finish. There is a mild bitterness on the palate with each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is an exceptional DIPA with some amazing aromas and flavors. 638 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 19, 2012

2012 vintage. No canning date, but likely less than 1 month old. 16 oz. can poured into a snifter.
A: Incredibly hazy orange body with a finger of fluffy white head that dissipates quickly. Tons of sediment. In fact, I've never seen so much sediment in a fresh DIPA.
S: Huge citrus hop notes. Straight up orange and grapefruit. Very straight to the point here.
T: Wow. Incredibly hoppy, but not overpowering. The orange is the most dominant citrus note on the palate. It almost has a fresh orange juice flavor to it. The hop bite hits up front, but it's short-lived because it's quickly followed by the citrus sweetness.
M: This is about the perfect amount of carbonation. Just the right amount of dryness and sweetness, as well. Resinous, but not a palate killer.
O: This beer is well-deserving of the hype it receives. The drinkability is incredible. I was a little put-off at first by all the hop sediment, and I do wonder how it impacted the flavor. I also probably should've had a couple of tastes straight from the can. I guess I will just need to track down more. One of the best DIPA's I've ever had. 1,147 characterstravMI13, Mar 18, 2012

taste was almost perfect - with all the hop flavors hop resin the beer still has the malt to balance all that bitterness

A: Poured from the can to my glass this brew pours like your average IPA. Murky golden hue with a white capped head.
S: The aroma is delightfully hoppy fresh. Resinous hops take over. This brew is a little less fruity than a normal DIPA.
T: The flavor is near perfect. Very well balanced and not over sweetened in the process. The flavor is fresh, raw hops.
MF: The carbonation is great, my pallet isn't torn up, the after taste isn't offensive.

A: very cloudy, orange with a slight red hue. Big sandy head. Not much lacing. 
S: the smell omg. Piney tropical hops, a real explosion. I sense Simcoe. Very herbal dank and earthy underneath the citrus. Some Columbia perhaps. 
T: super bright and citrusy, I get kiwi, mango, clementine, grapefruit. Finish is so sweet. Peaches, grapefruit all the different notes. It's really not all that bitter. Tough to pick out the malts but it's more honey than molasses /caramel. There's some earthy floral dankness hiding beneath the tropical hops, some hop oils and resins. It just tastes fresh. 
M : super soft and chewy. High carbonation. No burn. A syrupy body. Resinous and oily. 
O: quite possibly the best beer I've ever had. Crazy hops, the freshest rawest beer I've had. So tropical and drinkable it's insane. I could session on this. Must try, lives up to the hype. 927 charactersBigCheese, Mar 16, 2012

 The aroma is pretty amazing with a complex fresh hop with grapefruit, pineapple, earthy notes and tangy fruits! The malt also smells really nice with gentle sweetness but not overlly heady sweet.
 The flavor is huge! Yes it's complex with layers of hops, fruity, earthy, grapefruit, sweet fruits, you name it, if it's in the hop spectrum of flavor's it's in here!! But that's not what blows my mind, it's the balance and insane drinkabilty from this DIPA. Usually the large amounts of malt, high alcohol and massive hops keeps the "session" kinda short, but not here, It's kinda scary how easy it is to drink. 
 The feel is fresh, full, jazzy and slightly smooth maybe even a bit dry in the finish. 
 Love the can! 815 charactersGratefulBeerGuy, Mar 15, 2012

THe head is white like it came with batteries.
The aroma isnt as intense as i thought it would be but, hop aroma with out senses being overwhelmed.
The color is a solid amber-orangish. Not light penetrating. haze.
The flavor is strong hop, spicy, dramatic, and pronounced. The mouth feel is smooth, coating the tongue.
Overall this is a solid example of an IPA. 425 charactersDakotaRules, Mar 15, 2012
4.67/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5So if your beer tastes like this, maybe you only need to make one. There's likely no way that you'll ever out do Heady-Topper so just stop right there!
With a controlled and creamy pour of medium gold elixir, this hazy and glowing ale constructs a creamy, cottony white head with substantial retention and islands of lace. Overall, this is one sexy beer!
Seductive and mouthwatering citrus aromas abound from from the rim of the glass. The straight-up juicy fruity scent of the freshly squeezed pulp of ripe ruby red grapefruit with elements of citric acids, fruit sweetness that seems of thin honey, and some softer tropical notes of mango and apricot. It's impossible to put your nose so close to the glass without taking a sip.
The delicious delight of a beer delivers the straight forward grapefruit flavor just as the nose promises. The sweet pulp of fresh-picked ruby reds couldn't be more spot-on. Resiny as the citrus flavors seem to coat the mouth while the stripping of enamel commences. Soft caramel malts support the hops with the supple and elegant sweetness of powdered sugar and honey, but do so without contrast- make no mistake about it, this is a hop-forward ale with the likes that rarely seen. A very delicate yet hop-dominant balance throughout. Any estery fruitiness would weave into the hop matrix and inform the beer with complementary notes of tropical mangoes, apricots, and pineapple. Succulent and savory throughout, even as the beer's elegant hop flavor develops into soft resiny bitterness that grips the gullet with kid gloves in finish and aftertaste. Only the strong taste of alcohol for moderate 8% that reminds me of super glue is the only slight defect in taste.
Very creamy and delicate on the palate from the initial sip and deep into the middle portion of the palate. All the while coating the mouth with citrusy acids, diluted pine resin, and light sticky honey. The beer's carbonation develops a malty-dry finish that retains its soft malty body while contributing pleasant alcohol warmth and an extended citrusy bitterness.
When you're convinced of the impossibility of ever tasting a better IPA, something like this comes along and shows new possibility in flavor intensity, dryness, drnkability, and absolute elegance and finesse. It's hard to keep this beer off of the "perfect" line score. 2,340 charactersBEERchitect, Mar 15, 2012

Per instructions, I drank the first few sips from the can. They were amazing. Then, I poured the rest into a glass and the amazing continued.
A - Tons of hop "floaties". I was not turned off by this at all, but it's definitely not traditional for a "commercial" beer. I try avoid this when I'm home brewing, but after trying this, screw it, I'm leaving the hops in :)
S - Wow. Really...wow. Maybe the best smelling beer I've ever come across.
T - Double wow. Not the strongest or most bitter IPA I've had, but without question the best. The citrus-y flavors are off the chart, and the hops are balanced so perfectly with the strength of the beer. I could drink a lot of this really often. If only I could...
M - Perfect. A little sticky from all the hop goodness, but in a really good way.
O - Definitely the best IPA I've ever had, and maybe the best beer I've ever had overall. I can't say enough good things. Deserves its 100 rating and then some. 1,088 charactersGreenplastic615, Mar 14, 2012

A: looks like a homebrew - tons of sediment. Pours a cloudy light gold color with a good sized head that leaves a lacing to cover the whole top. 
S: excellent tropical fruit smell smell that only gets better as it warms. Citrus, pineapple, light malt, and yeast round out this beer's smell. 
T: well balanced with malt, bitterness, and fruity hops flavors. Amazing taste profile that only gets better as it warms. No alcohol presence, and the bitterness accents the taste rather than takes away from it. There is also a huge malt aftertaste along with the hop aftertaste, and it stays on my tongue the longest I have ever experienced. 
M: medium carbonation and medium body. It's full of very light, fluffy bubbles, making it quite an experience. 
O: my only complaint is that I don't care for the floaties, but that's likely because I didn't let it sit longer than 1 hour from the time I got it to when I drank it, and my pour was poorly executed. 1,032 charactersHolland, Mar 12, 2012

I get slammed with a whiff of tropical fruit hops as soon as the can is cracked. Proceeds to pour a bright tangerine color, murky, with a one finger white head that retains well and leaves nice lacing. The aroma is just insane. It feels like I'm holding actual pineapples, mangos, and grapefruits up to my nose. No hints of malt in there. Taste follows the nose, with the mango hops a bit more prevalent. This is fabulous. As it warms, a bready, biscuit malt sweetness backs up the hops mid palate. The full body, medium carbonation feel finishes on the dry side, nice and bitter, with lingering pine and grapefruit. 
Can't say much more other than this being one of my top 3 DIPAs to date. Splendid, dangerously drinkable, and I need to get more. 809 charactersgaruda, Mar 11, 2012
4.79/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Given to me by a friend who stopped by the brewery last week - a very unexpected and pleasant surprise. Drank from the can.
I stuck to drinking from the can so I can't really remark on the appearance. Unbelievably hoppy and sweet aroma - I detected lots of citrusy grapefruit and mango, with a piny quality in very concentrated doses. It had a very tropical character, but I could already sense the bitterness that would be intermixed in the taste. Awesome smell, it literally made my mouth water. A few sips in and I was in heaven. Lots of citrus fruit sweetness, but a constant dry bitterness that I felt like I got mostly in the end of the taste. It was an amazingly complex taste that satisfied every bit of expectation I had for this beer. Mouthfeel was fairly light in weight, but had a nice zip to it and a sort of creamy quality upon swishing it around in my mouth. It brought out the best in the taste, that's for sure.
Overall, this was by far one of the tastiest DIPAs I've had. It stands right up there with the Plinys in terms of complex hoppy and sweet tastes, and it was incredibly drinkable. I'm really looking forward to the next one! 1,153 charactersshangwang, Mar 11, 2012

Smell - Resin, citrus, heavy pine, grapefruit
Taste - Heavy on the citrus and tropical fruits, pineapple, orange and grapefruit really comes through, a little grassy as well. 
Mouthfeel - Light and bubbly, little resin, I actually feel like I'm drinking a light IPA but know it's going to do some damage later on to my liver. Drinkability much like the Cpt. Lawrence Imperial IPA. Goes down very smooth and warms the belly too.
Overall - Excellent beer, wish I could get more but it doesn't get up to New York often especially Long Island. Had a buddy at a pub share one, and a friend from a bevy sell me one. It's good to be friends with your distro guys. 776 characterspezfiend, Mar 10, 2012

4.55/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5One of my pals went down to Vermont 3 weeks ago and picked a few cans of this up at the brewery. Being 3 weeks old, I know it's not at its prime but I'll probably never have another chance to review this.
A gorgeous shade of mango flesh orange fills the glass. Its hazy quality actually makes you want to bite into it rather than drink it. An inch of brilliant white whispy head floats on top, leaving dots of lace as it recedes. 
At 3 weeks old, the nose is still fantastic. I couldn't imagine how this would smell as soon as it leaves the canning line. Tangy and zingy notes of fresh lemongrass and ripe peach immediately come to mind. Mango skin, papaya flesh, and overly ripe-sugar coated pineapple further the intensity of this juicy tropical fruit melange. A soft biscuity malt character lurks in the background.
The hops come in a more raw and resiny form in the taste with notes of fresh pine sticking to the sides of the mouth and being most responsible for the bitterness this beer carries. Fresh lemongrass criss-crosses across the tongue while soft fuzzy peaches delicately brush the front. The impression of mango and papaya skins are left behind, being slightly bitter and less sweet and juicy than their innards. A kick of overly-ripe pineapple comes through in the middle and leaves a lasting, sticky impression.
The feel of this is near perfection in my books. It's delicate, soft, smooth, and creamy without a hint of its alcohol content. It's packed with flavour and still incredibly easy to drink and highly refreshing.
I can see why this is considered the cream of the crop in the vast category of DIPA's. The bitterness is there to refresh rather than to destroy the palate. This is all about the fruitiness of the hop and that's what I love. 1,769 charactersludachris, Mar 09, 2012

A: A murky golden color with a 1 inch white fluffy head that fades quickly to a small lace atop the brew. Very good.
S: Awesome! A hop heads wet dream. Some piney citrus upfront quickly blended with some tropical fruit scents some more grapefruit citrus on the end. Such a well blend of hop varieties. Awesome!
T: Starts off with a mouthful of bubbles and piney malt which is quickly drowned by a hop flavor that ramps up quickly and overtakes the taste. A beautiful grapefruit / pineapple blend with a piney bitterness which sticks with you on your palate. Man, such a well blended IPA. One of the best blends of hop flavors I've had in an IPA.
M: Medium body with a hard carbonation. A creamy bitter finish. Very good.
O: All in all, yep, this is one of the best IPA's I've had. If you like an IPA that blends all flavors exceptionally well, than this will blow your mind. If you like an IPA that is just bitter and nothing else, this is satisfy, but not blow you away. A must try for the hop lover! 1,135 characterssteve8robin, Mar 09, 2012

A- DRINK FROM THE CAN (its a golden sunshine yellow if you are curious)
S- Delicious
T- A strong bite of hoppy heady goodness. The sourness grabs the tongue and the bitter flavor resonates in a soft aftertaste that will make you take a second sip. The strong alcohol by volume content seems to fade into the flavor of the beer, but caution to those who drink all 4, you might soon to loose taste of the flavor! 
MF- A strong first buzz similar to a 9 volt battery soon fades into a softer aftertaste, not my favorite but the beer's flavor should speak for itself!
Too bad its not everywhere, but for those of us living in VT its a treat. Make your way up to see the factory in Stowe is worth a visit If you can get your hands on some then you will understand! 960 charactersLostcarkeys, Mar 05, 2012

Ht pours a peachy amber color with excellent head retention and considerable sticky lacing. The nose on this bad boy is pretty amazing, as I pick up considerable dry citrus, dank earth, light marijuana and light pine. The nose is very, very floral in this one and is dominated by pine aroma. The flavor profile replicates the nose, and I'm impressed by the balance in this beer. While the beer is fairly dry for a DIPA, there's enough sweet malt to keep the impressive bitterness in check. Still, I'm impressed by the light tropical fruit, which quickly gives way to a blast of grapefruit bitterness. In combination, it's quite excellent. Mouthfeel is medium bodied to full, with a long, prickly, bracingly citrus finish. Alcohol is so well integrated into the flavor profile... it could have been anything from 7% to 10% from what I could tell. 
A very, very tasty DIPA... probably the best East Coast DIPA I can recall ever tasting (OK, not counting some of the limited release stuff from Hill Farmstead). Delicious stuff. 1,149 charactersJohn_M, Mar 04, 2012

All I can say is, WOW! By far, one of the best beers that I’ve tried to date, regardless of style, and a sure ‘must-try’ for all who appreciate the finer beers of the world. Hoping that this becomes more available in MA, because as of now, there are only a few places that you can enjoy this ‘world-class’ brew. I’ve yet to try Pliny, but have read that this DIPA rivals it. If you get the opportunity to try this, it’s a must. Kudos Alchemist, looking forward to other offerings in the near future." 631 charactersdemdog8, Mar 03, 2012

S:Lots of hops and citrus. Really mouthwatering.
T: I get a ton of hops mixed with orange, pineapple and grapefruit. So unbelievably drinkable. 
M: Not as sticky as most DIPAs, leaves a citrus rather than bitter aftertaste.
O: I was afraid this wasn't going to live up to the hype but it absolutley did, I've never had a DIPA with pineapple characteristics before and it mixed with the other fruits and hops so well. I couldn't be happier with this beer. 541 charactersFubar1453, Mar 03, 2012

I get to enjoy this usually every month or so, and simply put: it's the best out there. I've had it 7 days old and 7 months old. Nothing beats it fresh but even after half a year it still tastes incredible. Pour half in a snifter and enjoy half in the can. The smell upon cracking that can will blow you away. Definitely my favorite double IPA out there and probably my favorite overall. It will never get old. The hype is real! If you have a chance to get your hands on this, do so...by any means possible.

4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 516 oz can poured into a snifter. (Yes, I'm disobedient.)
8% ABV, Hard to "drink fresh" with no date. "Don't be a d-bag, recycle this can!"
Big thanks to Rochefort10NH for sending this my way! I knew this beer would be good but I should have taken his suggestion for 4 cans, not just 2. Oy.
A - Pouring slowly from the can (yeah, for review I find it necessary to disobey the can's blatant directions) Heady Topper is a fully cloudy, tainted golden apricot color. Head rises up but this beer certainly isn't heady. Low retention but delicate lace patches the glass.
S - It's hard to experience a better, fuller, hop-rich aroma. Bursting with American hop goodness, this Double IPA rocks out with bold pine sap and sticky lupulin gland resin. Citrus plays a part but certainly doesn't run the show here. Mild pineapple falls behind grapefruit and lemon zest.
T - Full-on hoppy-hoppy joy-joy, Heady Topper is laced with so much hop complexity; bold pine keeps the pace while grapefruit extraordinaire grips your teeth's enamel and doesn't let go. Sticky honey and pale malt almost becomes completely forgettable despite it's impeccable balance.
M - This can reads, "So drinkable, it's scary." I'd have to agree wholeheartedly. It could just be the explosive hop profile but, the alcohol percent isn't even perceived here. From the perfectly smooth mouthfeel to the grippingly bitter, freshly squeezed grapefruit juice-like finish, this chewy Double IPA is a pleasure to pass over the tongue.
O - I think the crude can drawing is trying to depict the back of this guy's head exploding with hops while a giant smile creeps from behind his beard. After I got my first whiff, I almost had to check the back one mine too! What a hop rush! While Heady Topper isn't the craziest beer our there, and they acknowledge it on the can, it's fantastic balanced makes it one of the greatest Double IPAs out there!
(Observation; though they exclaim, "DRINK FROM THE CAN!" the can clearly shows this guy drinking from a pint. Things that make you go, "hmm".) 2,046 charactersBeerFMAndy, Feb 29, 2012

Appearance: Poured by bartender (damn!) and filled to the brim, the Topper comes with evident carbonation and about one-half finger of snow-like head. Good retention, beautiful lacing. 
Dirty hazy orange color, straight from the farm, just like Hill Farmstead and other artisanal brews. 
Smell: The juiciness and hops and fresh citrus comes through on the can already! On the glass is actually less pronounced. Fresh squeezed orange juice, a bit of lemon. Maybe they're right about drinking it from the can... 
Taste: Follows nose, only more intensified. Clear juicy hops, bright citrus. Pomelo, candied orange. Whole-cone hops, so fresh they hurt. But never overwhelming. This is no West Coast IPA pounding you in the face. 
Mouthfeel: Very well balanced, with almost full body and flavor, medium carbonation. A little watery around the edges but not terrible. Very fresh and never dry, didn't need any water. 
Overall: Extremely drinkable. Extremely fresh. Extremely hoppy. Extremely WOW! 1,096 charactersDoubleSimcoe, Feb 28, 2012

A: Well... it's a can. A fairly attractive one. It appears to contain beer.
S: Sharp piney smell as soon as it's opened, like a freshly cut christmas tree. I pick up a few tropical notes as well. Pineapple and papaya. After drinking a bit, with more space in the can, the tropical scents start to become more dominant. I have to say, though, I think this drinking from the can is a loser on the aroma front, no matter what they claim.
T: Resiny, with fairly sweet biscuit malts. Bitter finish, but not over the top. Really piney. Chewing on a pine branch piney. But, in a good way.
M: On the heavy end for the style, a decent amount of residual sweetness that gives it a pretty mouth-coating feel. Slight drying astringency that balances it out a bit. Medium-low carbonation.
O: Very tasty and stays interesting through the whole can. Having this the day after a side-by-side of PtY and PtE, I think I'd put this above Elder and a bit below Younger, at least based on what my palate has been preferring lately. At another time, I might have found this a little too sweet. I do think that this is taking a hit on account of the can format. 1,216 characterskscaldef, Feb 28, 2012

Poured an orange brown, severely unfiltered with large particles that sit in suspension and on the base of the tulip. Good retention and spotty lace however. Nose is brilliant, but slightly more right out of the can (is this why they want you to drink it right out of the can?), loses a bit when poured into the glass. Tons of mango, pineapple, resiny, juicy and oily. Light dankness. A good amount of malt to balance. Taste has loads of grapefruit, mango and passionfruit. Chewy sweet malt character reasserting the "East Coast-iness" of this DIPA. Solid bitterness in the finish and some sweetness to lightly offset it. No alcohol to be found, and this was incredibly poundable. I can only imagine having access to this locally - a quintessential East Coast DIPA and fully lived up to expectations. 930 charactersliamt07, Feb 28, 2012

4.92/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Live tasting 16 oz can into Duvel tulip...
Appearance; pours a hazy yellow gold, and a moderate pour yeilds a finger of straw colored head that recedes after a couple minutes... Lacing is good with spiderwebs of head sticking to the sides of the glass. I did get a little carried away during the pour and per the warning on the can, dumped some resin and yeast into my glass so there is some suspended floaties... Will try the next one straight from the can, and no points off for my dumping sediment into the glass... 
Smell; popped the tab and stepped into a tropical rainforest!! I had a feeling this was coming given my experience with Abrasive and the fact that it's canned as well... I'll save my "can revolution" talk for another time and place but this beer smells phenomenal. Citruses such as orange and grapefruit and tons of tropics, mango, hints of peach, and pineapple.
Taste; absolutely the smell personified here.. Pineapple, orange and grapefruit rinds, mango, peach, tangerine, just the faintest hints of pine, with the perfect amount of hop bite that sneaks in after a couple sips... Notes of caramel, round it out... Exceptionally well balanced.
Mouthfeel; on the fuller side of medium body, slightly sticky with a lingering bitter finish that never becomes overbearing or intrusive carbonation is perfect. 
Overall; DAMN. This is one hell of a beer, and I will be continuously on the lookout for more. Absolutely fantastic DIPA.
————————————————————————————
Revisited direct from the can 3/17/12;
Live review, can directy into my mouth...
Appearance; looks great, a slightly polished silver color with screen printed black graphics... No dents, dings or major scratches, information about the brewery on the back along with an advisory pro-recycling statement. 
Smell; great tropical aromas spring out of the mouth hole and continue oozing out of the can, mango, pineapple, tons of other assorted tropical aromas that I can't quite pin down..
Taste; simply outstanding pineapple, citrus, and markedly more resinous notes than I picked up pouring into a glass... A slightly more significant pine characteristic is also evident...
Mouthfeel; identical to the mouthfeel in the glass, absolutely fantastic.
Overall; direct from the can or in a glass, this is a damn fine beer. I'll be sad when Im outta these... 2,396 charactersThingus, Feb 25, 2012
4.44/5  rDev -4.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Huge thanks to beerhan for this awesome extra.
Partially poured from a 16 oz. can (no date) into a pint glass.
A moderate pour yields a 1 1/2-finger cream-colored head that slowly fades after a couple minutes to a thin coating and thick foam ring. The body is a hazy orange amber with a light number of random carbonation bubbles. Some light lacing can be seen clinging sporadically to the glass throughout consumption but does not stick around long.
The nose is a delicious and even combination of citrus and pine. Sweet and tropical, notes of grapefruit, tangerine, and mango all come forward and make themselves known.
Sweet acidity cuts the tongue at the beginning of each sip. Strong tropical flavors of tangerine, mandarin oranges, and grapefruit meet a strong pine flavor. Upon swallowing, the citrus and pine flavors kick it up a notch, Emeril style. These flavors linger and slowly transform into a slight bitterness.
Medium bodied with moderate carbonation, this beer is easy sipping, easy swallowing, and easy to enjoy. The body is thick and coating, and allows the flavors to not only stand out but to take hold of your palate. The carbonation is barely noticeable but is certainly doing more than its fair share to contribute to the drinkability.
Consuming this beer from the can (as opposed to from out of a glass) has multiple benefits. The carbonation becomes stronger which adds to both the mouthfeel and the drinkability. The flavor becomes a bit more citrusy and loses a bit of the bitterness. 1,518 charactersoutput01x, Feb 25, 2012

Pours very hazy if not a bit chunky orange with a one finger off-white head that retains well and leaves some rings of lacing behind.
Aroma is fresh orange, tangerine and grapefruit citrus, pineapple and peaches, some sniffs tend more toward a dank and piney hop profile. Overall a citrus and fruity hop bomb. Malt? Why bother... Very good to excellent strength.
Flavor is an onslaught of all the things that make a great IPA. Tons of orange, tangerine and grapefruit citrus, pineapple, some pine, resinous and a little dank, minimal malt backbone, fantastic strong bitterness on the finish and a bit of alcohol. Super JUICY!
Mouthfeel is medium bodied, oily and sticky with good carbonation.
An incredible, world-class Double IPA that is more than worthy of all the praise it receives. Very complex for the style, it’s got a little of everything a hophead desires. While I should be going slow and savoring my only can, this is dangerously drinkable and going down pretty fast. Fantastic! 1,132 characterselgiacomo, Feb 25, 2012

All I can say is, if you live near Healthy Living in South Burlington VT, grab a 4 pack today (toward the back). This is the best batch I've had. The tropical juice is just sublime. I did have one batch where I hardly detected any juice, it was most straight up hops. This one is just right. Juicy. Piney.
Slightly slick feel in the mouth. I almost cried from happiness after I popped the can and gave it a sniff. I'm drinking this one out of the can as directed. I'll probably try the next one out of a glass.I'll probably go for a third since wife isn't home. Gotta go, I

4.82/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5One of my favorites ... I buy a case every other month or so.
Appearance - is a cloudy, golden orange and small amounts of debris in suspension. Lots of speculation on what is is, but we all seem to agree it tastes pretty damned good! I always wish for more head.
Smell - grapefruit avalanche with spots of other citrus ... minimal but present pine and perhaps a little lemongrass.
Taste - the gift that keeps on giving. waves of aromatic hops roll to the back of the tongue and crash on the shoreline of the pallet. Huge bitterness balanced with mingling sweetness. Maybe a little diacetyl buttery inbetween??? Very complex beer ... I may never fully understand its beauty.
Mouthfeel - rich, thick, and slippery. Very modest carbonation.
Overall - a very rich and rewarding beer. The kind of beer that spoils you and makes you question others that you liked a month ago ... 879 characterssans, Feb 24, 2012

I know the can says to drink the beer directly from the vessel, but for review purposes, I wanted to see it. Pours a beautiful, hazy orange with lots of sediment and a 2-finger, frothy off-white head; minimal lacing. It looks very raw; as if it's not ready to be consumed. This is about to get interesting...
Smell is overpowering fresh grapefruit, tropical fruit hops with a hint of herbs. The taste is sweet/slightly bitter grapefruit & tropical fruit hops (mango, maybe pineapple and passion fruit) with some herbal hints; faint caramel malt flavor. Mouthfeel is medium-bodied, lots of carbonation, yet smoother than I expected. This is not as chewy as I expected, but the bits of sediment are noticeable. 
This is a hop bomb like no other. Rough & raw, but if you love grapefruity DIPAs like a PTE, you'll love this. 854 characterstheghost3, Feb 22, 2012

A mystery box will be coming his way soon. Should have been a batch within a week, two max.
A: Following the directions of the can, I drank it straight from the can versus pouring. Perhaps my next will be into a glass.
S: Even from the small opening of the can, quite the aroma. Plenty of citrus & tropical fruits and hops.
T: This is without a doubt the most well balanced DIPA I've had. Finally a benchmark has been set for what they should taste like. The hops and tropical fruits meld together perfectly without a harsh after-taste.
M: Pretty light bodied with just the right amount of carbonation.
O: I was wondering if this would live up to the hype and it certainly did. It is certainly the best DIPA I've tasted. Not even because of the flavors but just because how well balanced everything was. I'll be interested to see the difference in a few weeks from the fresh one I have right now.

Wonderfully aromatic with a boatload of citrusy hop character. Grapefruit and orange stick right out there. A fair bit of sweetness with even a slight vanilla-like note that is certainly unexpected but rather pleasant. 
The bright and citrusy hop aromas cary over well into the palate. Deliciously hoppy without the mouth puckering bitterness you often find in DIPAs. Sweeter than your typical IPA/DIPA but not cloying at all. 
Mouthfeel comes across with a nice smooth and creamy medium body feel. Overall, Heady Topper is hard to beat. I might just have to make more trips to Vermont from now on. 708 charactersKinsman, Feb 20, 2012

A: Poured a cloudy straw yellow color with small to moderate lacing and glass retention. I see some yeast particulate suspended in the air. About average, which is why I suspect we are directed to consume from the can.
S: As I first crack the can, a geyser of hop propelled CO2 assaults my face. After I regain my senses, essences of pine, dank moss, pineapple, orange, fresh flowers. It presents itself surprisingly sweet, but make no mistake, it oozes with fresh hop aroma.
T: Everything an DIPA should be. My palate is ravaged by concentrated hop juice. The balance of pine, honey toasted biscuit, grapefruit, orange, and lemongrass intertwine to create a symphony of hop magic. It has a relatively light malt backbone.
M: Chewy and juicy, medium body, balanced carbonation. The balance of the elements only serve as a conduit to facilitate the coating of more hop resin in my mouth. The finish is incredibly smooth with no indication of the 8% ABV. Extremely drinkable.
O: A perfect example of the style, this was a treat from start to finish. Do I want more? Yes.

2.88/5  rDev -38.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 3 | taste: 3 | feel: 2.5 |  overall: 2.5I've had many a can of Heady Topper over the past few months, and with each one I'd hoped that my opinion of the beer would change for the better. I'll review my inaugural taste here, as it hasn't changed at all really. 16 oz. can poured into a Duvel tulip. Reviewed from notes.
Pours a fairly dark orange with nice clarity, in spite of the small bit of suspended yeast. A one-finger white head recedes pretty quickly, leaving minimal lacing.
The nose is very, very nice. A lot of citrus fruits, bright oranges and mangoes. But there is an off-putting, lingering aroma of quasi-rotten fruit that I just can't shake. It's a very curious sweetness that just seems unnatural.
Hops seems oddly dead in the taste. Waves of malty sweetness seems to obscure any bitter hop bite. At the same time, a very strange vegetal flavor throws the balance of this beer out of whack. It seems disjointed, and though this can was very fresh, it just feels faded.
The carbonation is too low, and the mouthfeel is too heavy. Perhaps some more carbonation would help the flavors open up.
As a rejoinder, I'll add that I've drank Heady Topper straight from the can, though I didn't find that that method of presentation impacted the taste at all. In the end, I suppose it's just not for me, though certainly not terrible. 1,303 charactersamphion1065, Feb 20, 2012

The rest of this review will be from the can. The aroma is huge and heavy as soon as you crack the beer. Tons of tropical citrus hop character assault your senses. I guess I should have expected as much from the 120 IBUs. I can't tell how this beer could smell any better: no hint of alcohol and an overload of hops. Perfect. The taste build on the aroma, if that is even possible, you again are assaulted with the tropical citrus hop flavor and yet a bit of piney resin is prevalent, too. Unbelievably smooth. Unreal how balanced this beer is. Malty sweetness with fruity character from the hops. Clean. Smooth. Medium bitterness, not over the top, no clue this is 8%abv. Amazing flavor. Again, not sure how this can get any better. The mouthfeel is full and creamy and rich and smooth. Very well balanced. Overall, this beer is phenomenal. Perhaps because it was fresh, this is now the standard for DIPAs, sorry Pliny. I will do whatever I can to obtain more. Terrific. 1,272 charactershopfacebrew, Feb 20, 2012

S: The aroma smacks you as soon as you pop the top. Tropical, pungent hops embed themselves in your nostrils and have no intention of going anywhere soon. This might be the best smelling beer I've ever had the pleasure of laying my lips on. Absolutely delicious aroma...can't wait to dive into this one.
T: Taste is an exponent of the aroma. Fruity, piney and dank...wow! So smooth even with all the IBU's, very bitter at first but then an inviting sweetness envelops your mouth and everything blends together so well. As this beer warms the tropical notes take center stage and surprisingly this beer becomes easier to drink as it warms. Not harsh at all at 8% and 120 IBU's...just amazing.
M: So rich and creamy in the mouth. The carbonation is a little lighter than I was expecting but it makes sense as you work your way through the beer. With all those hops a light carbonation doesn't wreck your taste buds...allows you to enjoy the depth of the hop profile. Well done...
O: I got a 4 pack of this bad boy from a buddy who lives in the Boston area. I've had many IPA's and DIPA's but there's something different about this one. Every sip you take invites you back for several more. I received a box with a 4 pack of Heady Topper, 4 pack of FBS, 3 Expedition Stouts and a FW 14th anniversary bottle and i honestly would have been more than content drinking the Heady Topper all night. Absolutely lives up to it's rep...I just wish I had more. I've never had Pliny but if it's better than Heady Topper then it's the world's 8th wonder. Absolutely delicious...get some if ya can. 1,752 characterslokieman, Feb 18, 2012

Cloudy, glowing orange with some chum floating around. Small head, without much lacing or retention.
Aroma has it all. Hops in spades: pine resin, bright citrus, tropical fruit, melon, and a big floral note. Most IPAs have one or two hop qualities in the nose, but Heady Topper seems to have them all, I do reckon. Wow.
Flavor has some pale, malty heft to it, but not in terms of richness. The alcohol has to come from somewhere, right? This beer is a vehicle for hops, and they come through loud and clear in waves of drinkable goodness. Lots of sappy, resinous hop character. Fruity, but not as strong or citrusy as the aroma. Nevertheless this stuff is really, REALLY good. Mouthfeel seems a touch under-carbonated-- is this intended? 
Great to drink some fresh, fantastically hoppy beer from New England. As the Bros. have preached all along, East Coasters know how to hop (even if they are emulating West Coasters). Prost! Slainte! Cheers! 1,077 charactersdasenebler, Feb 18, 2012

First off the can thing, I was told to drink it from the can so I am.I like good canned craft brew, Caldera IPA is IMHO world class in a can.So I forgo the appearance to be loyal. Wow ! Not what I was expecting. Huge bitter hops, the first wave is insanity, then the tropical fruits come into play, grapefruit is the most predominant initially, then wave after wave of mango, bitter orange, huge mint, and fresh ground black pepper. The finish goes on for ever ! This is one complex beer, each sip reveals more layers of fruit and bite. I am digging this bad boy big time. 
I have one more can to play with and I think I may split it between my glass and the can for a more traditional experience and to see what this delicious brew looks like.
I am so glad I have finally been able to get a taste of east coast goodness, it really lives up to the hype, truly unique and original. 971 charactersOTB, Feb 18, 2012

Smell-Grapefruit mango topical fruit hops
Taste- This is what i want as far as an ipa goes. Very citrus throughout with a lingering grapefruit taste and bitterness. The taste starts out strait citrus but then grapefruit and bitterness build until the end. It says drink from the can, and is great from the can but i do think it taste better out of a glass. I think you get a lot more of the grapefruit flavor this way. The more i think about it, it is better out of a glass. That being said, the can is fine if the occasion calls for it, even if that means just wanting to drink out of a can at your house instead of dirtying a glass.
Mouthfeel-Like carbonated light pulp orange juice leaves you wanting more
Great double IPA. One of the best i have ever had. Reminds me of galactic double daisy cutter, but definitely has its differences. I am really getting in to can beers lately and the 16oz can makes for a great disc golf companion. If this was shelf beer where i lived i would be in trouble and they might run out. 1,215 charactersBeerverage, Feb 17, 2012

Aroma: Powerful citrus/tropical hop aroma. No trace of malt.
Flavor: Follows the nose. Very strong, lasting tropical hop flavor. Smooth bitterness and citrus hop on the back. Any malt flavor is totally overpowered by the hops.
Mouth: Lighter body for an 8% beer. Highly carbonated. Fairly dry finish.
Overall: An absolute hop-bomb. Must drink for any hop-head! Might be a 'better' beer if it had some malt flavor, but that's really not what the brewer is going for here. 537 charactersmz3frs, Feb 17, 2012

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I scored 3 four packs of this beer thanks to my parents who had vacationed briefly in VT. Trying this out of a glass first, then out of the can for kicks and giggles... because it says so. Something about releasing the hop aromas. 
The appearance is a very cloudy gold color... almost yellowish. A few flecks of very fine sediment are visible. The beer is topped with a puffy white head that is very thick at first, but later settles down to the size of about a finger. It looks just right hanging there as it clings lightly to the glass. 
The vast aroma give me the chills as I take it in. My first impression is that of an exotic, fresh fruit stand. Of course pineapple, grapefruit lemon/citrus, but also strawberry and mango - all very sweet. Something about the spice reminds me of potpourri and clean linen. There is an underlying piney resin notes are detectable beneath. When I lean in to the can rather than the glass, the resiny cannabis subtleties are much more 'outspoken.' 
Now for a taste! Wow - this isn't going to be easy. Very complex to say the least. From the glass - a very quick 'juicyfruit' start coats the mouth and disappears at which point a dose of strong pine flavor, almost like gin for a second pops in. Finally, a very resinous character presents itself and takes over my palate for the bulk of the experience. There seems to be a doughy malt aspect intermingled with this resinous taste as well. The finish is a giant snap of bitterness. 
It's interesting that this is kind of a medium bodied beer, does not seem 'boozy' or instantly 'warming' as it goes down, but I would say that after you take a little break from sipping you 'feel the alcohol' in your gut - a good thing if you ask me. 
Overall - Definitely an acquired taste but I like it quite a bit. This is the most interesting and complex DIPA I have ever had. It's not so easy to talk about or assess simply. 
Now - I am going to try a second one straight out of the can instead of from the glass. *Drum roll* I like it better from the can! Never would have guessed. With this beer - picture drinking a milkshake out of a big straw vs drinking right from the glass. The can is the straw - you get more of a concentrated blast of taste vs from the glass. Perhaps it is because there is no aroma preview, so to speak. The various aspects of the flavor previously described seem more together, hitting me at once instead of in stages this way. The sweetness seems to stick around longer and the resinous aspect seems less earthy and more spicy, more organic. Delicious orange rind dominates. Changing this to a perfect score. I'm glad I have a decent amount of this - will be sharing with close friends. Get some if you can. 2,717 charactersNeorebel, Feb 16, 2012

4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I’m torn here. The brewers leave instructions on the can. Rather than enjoy the beer poured out into a glass, as common sense dictates, they wish us to drink it straight from the can. Normally, I’d do as the brewer says, no questions asked. This kind of goes against my principles though. In the end I decided to enjoy it from my New Belgium globe, though I did decant it, again, as dictated on the can. If I’m ever able to score another can or two or this, I’ll try it straight from the can and see which experience I find more enjoyable.
A: Pours a very hazy golden color. Eggshell white head has good retention, but eventually settles down to a thin slip. Lacing is very sparse and occurs only in small dots.
S: Dank, oily weed. Some soap and wet leaves. All the requisite citrus scents are here too. Mango puree, tangerine, pineapple, et al. There’s an underlying aromatic pine needle scent too. All of this sits atop a doughy malt base. This smells delicious, and definitely unique. It’s unlike any other IPA I’ve ever had.
T: Citrus bitterness punches you in the face immediately. Bitter grapefruit and pine resin intermingle. The tide of bitterness builds a bit, but plateaus off at a nice even level and stays resiny throughout. Tropical fruit flavors play on the tip of the tongue. Pineapple, kiwi, tangerine, and other flavors come to the forefront, though the bitterness never lets up. Oily and leafy hop tastes are there, though I don’t get any of the soap that was present in the smell. The malt base seems sweeter than the nose belied too. It tastes doughy but also a bit sugary. Pina colada just before the finish. Finishes with plenty of tropical fruits and a receding tide of resiny bitterness.
M: Light in body, but certainly not lacking substance. Very creamy and smooth in the mouth, with just a bit of an oily impression. Low carbonation, but just enough to get the job done. It’s like drinking a cloud. 
O: This is absolutely delicious. As close to perfect as I’ve come across to date. Maybe the easiest drinking DIPA I’ve ever had. It feels like a found a part of my soul that I never even knew was missing. I’m not a religious man, but I’m fervently praying that this gets regular distribution to MA. 
Notes: One of the few beers I’ve had of late that not only lived up to the hype, but completely surpassed it. I think I need to plan a road trip in the near future to try and secure a case of this. 2,457 charactersryan1788a5, Feb 15, 2012

I drank part from the can and part poured into a snifter. After pouring it into a glass it produces a nice 2 finger width white head that leaves nice lacing with each drink. It is opaque orange/copper color. The nose is amazing great fruit smells first grapefruit, lemon, and a hint of sweetness from a fruit like mango also there is a good piney smell along with the fruit smell. Great bitterness up front but it balances well with the sweetness form the malt the bitterness is a good combination of fruit bitterness like grapefruit and a piney bitterness. All round great balance of flavors that you find in DIPA's. Mouthfeel is medium, carbonation is on point for the style. Over all this is an amazing beer If I could buy this off the shelves where I live I would have two 4 packs on hand at all times. 903 charactersphisigben, Feb 13, 2012
4.25/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Got a 4-pack from a friend who just returned from Waterbury. Probably as fresh as it comes directly from the cannery. 
I did drink ½ of the beer directly from the can as advised but wanted to see the beer color and head so I poured the second half in to a Three Floyds pint glass. 
A – A wonderful hazy orange, you can tell right away this bad boy is unfiltered. Poured with a really nice 2 finger white head that hung around for a while. Good lacing was seen all the way around the glass.
S – Smells like freshly trimmed Christmas trees. Pine notes are really heavy, along with fresh cut grass. I do get some citrus in there as well and I would peg it as grapefruit. If you love the smell of fresh hops off the vine then breath deep and enjoy!
T – I was puckered at both ends on this one. Bitter, bitter, bitter…a hop heads dream. After that initial piney bitterness the hop flavors were very smooth. I have no idea what kinds of hops go into this beer but they all played very nicely. There was a light alcohol warmth at the back end that was very pleasing. The malt in the beer is shadowed by the hops but it is there non-the-less.
M – I couldn’t get over how smooth this beer was. A very nice well balanced medium bodied brew. Carbonation was on point and added nicely to the hop explosion. 
O – Overall a very impressive beer, so happy I got to try it and glad I have 3 more to enjoy. Not going to share these with anybody. I wish I was able to head to VT more often so I could get this on a regular basis. When they talk of hop shortages I know where they all went, into a can of Heady Topper! 1,622 characterscps98, Feb 13, 2012

There was a lot of drum roll about this beer. It is not sold in stores
in the Boston area, and a limited number of bars served it starting last week. There is a limited availability.
The beer is served in a can and was not too cold- a good start.
The directions on the can recommend against drinking it in a glass in order to savor the hops.
This is the IPA lovers dream beer. It's the hoppiest beer I have smelled and tasted.
I preferred it in the glass. The color was a very light amber and it pours a small head. 
The smell of hops is overwhelming. A wonderful lemony finish with a slight sour bitterness. 
There is a lot of thoughtful artistic brewing in this beer. It is a highly unusual beer. 
I am not a big fan of IPAs. It's not my style. However, if this beer is available, one shouldn't miss the opportunity to savor it. 899 charactersbrureview, Feb 13, 2012
4.77/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Straight pour from a 16oz can to a straight-lipped Ommegang flute (the glass included in the 2011 gift packs), but sampled partly from the can for tasting and aroma notes as well. No date on the can, but one week ago the (very, very good) friend who gave this to me said he bought it the weekend prior, so my guess is this is 2 ½ - 3 ½ weeks old at the most. I’d say it’s pretty fresh. And yes, I did drink this from the can first! 
Appearance (4.0): One and a half fingers of very light tan head sticks around for a while, leaving some good lacing on all sides of this glass—thought I still want more, and I still want a chewier head. Body is the color of unfiltered honey, a slightly tan-orange. And this is the definition of hazy—almost opaque. Very lovely. 
Smell (4.5): From the glass, it’s all sweet citrus fruit—super-ripe pineapple, some passion fruit, grapefruit, mango, etc. From the can, it’s all resin and pine with a grassy background, some tobacco in the back and some light caramel tones help smooth it out. Very, very intense pine and grapefruit tones. Goddamn beautiful. 
Taste (5.0): Blindingly bitter, but not astringent, with enough malt sweetness to lend it some gravitas—from both the can and the glass. The hops are like a wad of fresh-cut grass stuck in a big, warm glob of pine sap, on top of half of a red grapefruit. The malt is relatively light—pale, enough to be inconspicuous, but thick enough to anchor the hop profile—and has a very subtle, sweet caramel note in the back. From the glass, there’s an interesting tobacco note that pops up in the body that’s actually very enjoyable. From the can, it’s just a hop explosion slowly taking over your brain. Yeast character? Typically neutral American ale yeast probably, but who could tell with this ridiculous hop load. A little booze in the finish, but it blends so seamlessly with the long, grassy, piney, extremely grapefruit-pithy finish that it’s integrated perfectly with a nice drying effect. 
Mouthfeel (4.5): Ugh. So nice and dry. Just on the heavy side of medium, maybe, definitely a full-feeling beer, but damn you don’t want to take it slow. It invites you to keep going way too easily. Carbonation is nice and smooth, with the finest prickliness mixed in—it’s like hop cones are giving my tongue acupuncture. 
Overall (5.0): What’s interesting about Heady Topper is that I can fully recognize that this is just one point on the spectrum of (d)IPAs, in terms of the flavor profile and perhaps more specifically the hop profile. But, it seems almost inherently clear that this is more or less the pinnacle of one of those points in the spectrum. There’s undoubtedly other beers at least as enjoyable with different flavor and aroma profiles, maybe more citrusy and fruity or whatever, but they’re not better or worse so much as different. Like a pantheon of pinnacle (d)IPAs. And this almost certainly has a seat in that pantheon. Waxing poetic, maybe, so let me put it differently: this beer is totally tits. Go out and buy it, because especially at $12-13/ 4-pack, it’s worth every penny. Long Live The Alchemist. 3,154 charactersfmccormi, Feb 12, 2012

S: Wow, stunning aromatics - just an explosion of fruit. Grapefruit, citrus and pineapple. Mango and apricot too. A bit of resin too maybe?
T: Again, hop mania. As in the nose it's all citrus and the tropical fruits mainly. A bit of resin and pine in the aftertaste. It's sweet but not overpowering, just compliments all the fruit nicely. Bitterness abound but NOT as harsh as other big IPAs like maharaja or ruination. Not even close. It's also not too sweet like a double crooked tree or a 120min. This is a big DIPA that's actually balanced. Long lasting residual taste that sticks with you forever. 
M: Medium bodied, carbonation is just about right. A bit drying from all the hop oils.
O: This beer is all about balance. One of the best balanced yet big DIPAs I've had. I like big harsh bitter bombs but this is just a thousand times more drinkable. I feel like I could have a bunch of these. That's what really sets it apart I think. 1,115 charactersDope, Feb 11, 2012

A: Pours a hazy golden orange color with a fair amount of suspended particulates. Quarter finger brilliant white head with small tight bubbles clinging to the side of the glass. 
S: Talk about an absolute hop bomb. As soon as I cracked the can the pungent aroma of hops came pouring out. Strong earthy, piney resin aroma with plenty of citrus fruits coming through. Slight sweet malty notes in there as well. Absolutely one of the best smelling beers to come across my olfactory system. 
T: Very strong hop presence on the front of the tongue. Extremely aggressive bitterness. Piney/earthy hops. Middle of the tongue turns into a sweet breadiness and followed by another wave of pungent hops. Wow.
M: Medium bodied, not thick but an almost oily feel. Absolutely no alcohol presence. The can is right; scary drinkable. Good amount of carbonation. Dry finish.
O: Absolutely deserving of being deemed ‘world class.’ One of, if not, the best DIPA I’ve had to date. 1,060 charactersChadlyG, Feb 10, 2012

Poured into my Roosters true pint glass a very nice cloudy golden orange color, lots of floaties also, very nice carbonation, with a very nice one-finger thick creamy off-white head, with some nice sticky lacing left behind. The second I popped this open I could smell hops, the nose is hoppy, with a nice little malt blend, a very nice citrus note, and some nice pineyness. The taste is slightly sweet, hoppy, malty, with some nice citrus notes, and pines. Medium body, with a nice slightly bitter/dry finish, pretty chewy also. Just had a side by side comparsion with a fresh bottle of Pliny the Elder and this brew (fresh also), looks and taste are a HUGE difference, no comparision at all, the PtE wins hands down. I cannot go with the hype on this brew at all, nice but no where near the hype, sorry.

A- Reviewed from Can. Second can: poured into a glass- very hazy brownish yellow, average carbonation, 2 fingers of white head that dissipates fairly fast, layered lacing left around glass while drinking.
S- HOPS!!! Immediately hit with very piney hops and a sweet grapefruit smell. Very aromatic, could smell immediately right when I cracked open the can. Definitely one of the best and most intense aromas from an IPA I've encountered.
T- Very sweet piney hops, a little bit tangy/citrusy, one of the best tasting experiences I've ever encountered in a beer. Leaves a great sweet aftertaste that delights the palate.
M- Very very drinkable, medium bodied, not much carbonation, can barely detect any alcohol. Extremely well balanced.
O- Absolutely Awesome! This is probably the most well balanced, best DIPA that I have ever drank. This is one of the most hoppy beers I've encountered but it has a perfect balance between the hops, sweetness, citrus flavors, etc.. Would most certainly buy again. Great beer highly recommended if you are ever in Vermont. This is a perfect example of everything you want in a DIPA. Absolutely nothing wrong with it.

4.48/5  rDev -3.7%look: 2.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.5Many, many thanks to BAs hoppymcgee and jedwards for sending Heady Topper cans within mere days of each other; as this is one from a 4-pack sent by hoppymcgee, I'm reviewing it.
16 oz. can, poured to an imperial pint glass.
A: What??? A lovely caramel/butterscotch pour with a SERIOUS problem of floaties. I'm talking suspended chunky bits from top to bottom... Decent lace, sticking in places. At first glance from afar, it looks pleasing enough, a nearly two-finger white crown of dense fluff atop. From askance, I'm giving at least a '4'; on closer inspection, it's a '2' for all the debris. '3' would be a compromise, but I can't go there... maybe the 'Drink from the Can!' admonishment on the label is less recommendation, more requirement! Yuck!
S: A nano-second past the crack of the can, I smelled the hop-sweetened goodness: if that doesn't warrant a '5', I don't know what does. The scent is magical, all the best of an IPA - sticky toffee and orange-laden hops, biscuity grains and full-on pine. It's a juicy and drippy noseful of sweetness and spice. I'm sold.
T: Freshly cut green hops and amply-grainy baked bread, perfect spiciness and equally perfect squeezes of lemon zest and grapefruit with a finish of cracked pepper. This beer takes one on a journey through all the flavors an IPA can hold and expands upon them. I went into this beer thinking 'meh, I know IPAs and this'll be a good one' to thinking 'wow, this captures magic in a bottle... er, can!'. Pretty amazing stuff.
M: For an 8% (D)IPA, drinkability is scary (yeah, it does say that almost verbatim on the label, but I concur!). Medium-heavy feel, but smooth body and looong-lasting finish.
O: Very good. Very, very good. Forget the weird, goopy/brackish appearance and it's among the best I've tried, overall. OK, it IS among the best I've tried, regardless. Worthy of the 'hype', extremely tasty and sensual in all aspects. Gotta have one... but then you'll just want more. 1,961 charactersmsubulldog25, Feb 09, 2012

Waited patiently for this to hit Boston and got the first can at a bar in JP tonight. 
Believe the hype. Tasted like Pliny, but with more bite. This beer was fresh as can be. Smell was so powerful, taste was robust. It's a slow sipper to be sure. I savored every sip.
Looking forward to seeing this around Boston more. 332 charactersSeakyden, Feb 09, 2012

Drank from the can at The Independent in Somerville. 
Can't comment to much on the appearance since i drank it from the can, but I did pour a bit into a glass for a look. Nice hazy goldb orange.
Smell is unreal. I think I am going to dump a can of this over myself next time I go on a date. Smells like the hops were literally plucked in front of me and placed into my beer. 
Taste is ridiculous. I had to slow myself down. It is truly that good. Fresh hops, perfect bitter and sweet mix - truly remarkable. Even when I burp it tastes good. Wow.
Mouthfeel complements the beer perfectly.
Overall this is amazing. Hands down the greatest beer I have ever consumed. I cannot recommend this enough. Find it fresh, and drink it. Now!!!! 878 charactersTWStandley, Feb 08, 2012

4.57/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Enjoyed my first two Heady Topper's today. Purchased from Woodstock Hops N Barley in Woodstock, VT.
The first I drank from the can. The instant you crack it open you get an explosion of grapefruit, slight pine, and pure IPA magicallness. It's without a doubt the best smelling beer I've ever had. It smells exactly how I want IPAs to smell. Whatever has been missing or off in any other IPA's smell is here. You have to experience this to believe it.
Taste was amazing. I got waves of hops, a bit of sweet balance (which I like) and then more waves of hops. There's so much going on here. For an dIPA, the ABV is REALLY hidden.
Mouthfeel was the most surprising thing to me. This particular 4-pack has very light carbonation. I wonder if it may be on the older side of fresh? I can't believe the can doesn't have a born on date...
It feels almost TOO smooth. It's in my top-5 beers ever, no doubt. But smelling it, I expected a sharper hop forward flavor and more carbonation to open everything up.
I poured my second can into a pint glass and saw that it had only a small head that vanished quite quickly. This is in contrast to what others have said, so I'm guessing this 4-pack is not a REALLY fresh example of the beer...
That said, this tastes INCREDIBLE. As soon as I can, I will drive to Waterbury, VT to pick some up from the Alchemist Cannery...I want to try this beer as fresh as possible.
Heady Topper is far and away the best IPA I've ever had. And I'm not even sure I'm having it fresh. If you ever have the chance to try this - do it.
BTW, the store I purchased this from is no more than 150 yards from my work, so I pretty much have an endless supply of Heady Topper available to me going forward. This does not suck.
Cheers!

4.29/5  rDev -7.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Received a couple cans of fresh HT from BaconSausage as extras in a recent Trade.
Poured both into a Surly pint glass and a bells tulip on two different occasions with varying results.
In the first sampling - one was extremely cloudy and much darker red than i was expecting based on other reviews. The second can was much more orange and clear. Both were adorned by nice white caps
The appearance was the main difference between the two as they both had huge hop blasting noses with heavy citrus/mango pine wafts coming at you.
Flavors i picked up were much different than the nose. I picked up a bit of stale malt hidden behind large grassy citrus hop characteristics.
Overall a great beer and one i wish i had access to. 728 charactersadrock7309, Feb 07, 2012
4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This was canned freshly last week and was sent to me through the mail. Something everyone on this website must try, my pallate was in heaven during the consumption of this hoppy yet amazing beverage
A: Had a hazy orangish yellow color. I personally loved it, I homebrew and I love hazy type beers because it usually is due to particles in the beer which causes higher amounts of flavor
Aroma: smelled like heaven, if you've ever brewed with fresh hops, this beer has the amazing smell of fresh hops through the nose, just an amazin beer to smell before consuming. citrusy yet heaven! 
Mouthfeel: it had a very typical and awesome DIPA mouthfeel. It wasn't to light but not too heavy, just perfect for an awesome 
Taste: the beginning taste is a beautiful hoppiness(citrusy) like armarillo hops taste. As it moves past your palate, it goes from hoppy to a very balanced flavor that goes down very smooth, dangerously smooth.
Overall: I've had ple and sculpin, zombie dust, just many many IPA's, and this is by far the best DIPA I've ever encountered. If you haven't tried this beer, it's a must have at $4 a can.

4.62/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516oz can with "1 12 23A 2 BB" stamped along the bottom of the can. Not sure what this means, but I'm assuming the 1 if for January and the 12 for 2012?
Pours an extremely hazy orange-yellow color and is topped by two finger worth of white colored foam. It's been several minutes and the head has settled to a thin layer, but there's lacing all over my glass.
Smell is definitely an indication that this is an upper tier DIPA. Orange and grapefruit are the dominant citrus fruits that I am getting. Maybe a bit of pineapple as well. Very nice!
Taste: Citrus fruits and sticky hops flood the taste buds immediately. It's bitter, yet there's enough sweetness to balance it out. Not overly malty mind you, it's more like the sweetness you'd get from an actual orange. The fruit and hop flavors both linger on well after you swallow inviting you to take another sip.
Medium bodied with a sticky-hop-juice mouthfeel. Carbonation in middle of the road.
A world class Ipa, no doubt about it.
Morey's Bottom Line: Well, this is my first HT, and I can honestly say that I wasn't let down at all. I've had Hopslam and Double Trouble within the last week, and this is a notch above both IMO. Seek this out! 1,200 charactersMorey, Feb 06, 2012

Big thanks to apollokim for this can!
The big guns keep on showing up for this Super Bowl party! This one pours a rusty tawn topped by over a finger of cream foam. The nose comprises ruby red grapefruit zest, yellow grapefruit peel, orange zest, strong pine resin, light leek, and buttery toffee (think Crunch 'n' Munch). The taste brings in more of the same, though the pine, leek, and citrus peels come through stronger, taking things in an ever-so-slightly bitterer direction. Things are still very well-balanced, though. The body is a lithe medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a slightly creamy feel. Overall, a damn fine, nicely-balanced DIPA. Good times. (Note: We tried this both in the glass and straight out of the can. There was no consensus, as about half preferred the can and half preferred the glass. I was in the latter, though it wasn't a strong preference by any means.) 936 charactersTMoney2591, Feb 06, 2012

A – A lot darker than I thought it would be. Very hazy with a lot of funky floaters. The off-white head quickly dissolved, but a small ring of bubbles remained. A huge sticky lacing on the edge of the glass is left behind after each sip. Fugly brew.
S – Some sweet caramel, pineapple, and pine oh my! Some tropical fruit is sticking with me for a while.
T – Great forbidden fruits… Hop resin/bitterness hits big in the finish; once again… I know I’m drinking a DIPA. 
M – Super easy to drink, medium bodied with a slight alcohol burn. Nice amount of carbonation.
O - My first craft can. Delicious… I am going to have to seek more of these out. I wish I would have done a side-by-side with Pliny, but for right now, I’m leaning towards Heady. A great IPA. 848 charactersZombiesAteMyDog, Feb 06, 2012

A: I understand now why they say to drink from the can--this beer is ugly! A hazy, putrid, light orangy color, with a thin head that disipates instantly. Hop resin clearly visible in the bottom of the glass, despite a careful pour.
S: Out of this world: juicy pinapple, light orange, and fresh lightly piney hops. Amazing.
T: Hop bitterness upfront, with the same pinnapple-orange interplay mid-sip. Strong bitterness in the finish--just what I want from a DIPA!
M: Supremely drinkable. Medium-thin body, with moderate carbonation.

4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Gifted to me from eyebrews, one outstanding beer lover and guy.
Poured out of the can, even though it says "drink from the can" on the top of the label. Pours a hazy antique gold with a tinge of rust. The bone white head quickly diminished into my pristinely clean stemmed chalice to a mere 1/16". Barely enough to completely blanket the surface. No visible uprising carbonation. Looks very rich and theres lots of fine suspended particles just begging to be quaffed. Fine unbroken rings of delicate lace all the way down. But first...
Probably the most erotically citrus infused hoppy splendor I've ever whiffed. Intoxicating layers of sweet, luscious dripping hopsation to ever grace my nostrils. Damn, I wish I didn't fill my glass so full as I'de like to bury my schnoz in it. (okay, I'll admit it, I just took a big gulp to make for headroom to further my smell test). A few swirls evoke a familiar tamarind-like scent I also detected in Pliny the Elder when I first tried it (fresh) a few years ago. And I like it as much right now as I did then. Mounds, heaps and booming crests of hop goodness for sure.
The taste is just as expressive as the smell. Tropical fruit epic hop collision. Bitter, sweet, lightly sugary, peach skin basking of the gods. You can't take away my Heady-Topper! Get away! Get away! Is there enough to bathe in it? Surely there must be. *WAIT* *WAIT* Sorry about that, I was transported into some crazy dream for a spell. I hope that made sense.
Mouthfeel is silky with the softest ultra fine carbonation I've felt in a Dbl. IPA. It sits so still, but it moves like a school of barracuda, swift and undetected. Magically drinkable. Slightly chalky and tenderly bitter finish.
Overall I am so very grateful for this unexpected can of Dbl. IPA royalty. I ws waiting for the 7th anniv. of New Beer Sunday to try it, and I'm glad it lived up to the hype. I feel like this ale gives me spinach-to-Popeye strength. I think I'm slipping back into a dream. I'll stop here before I do. 2,011 charactersmalty, Feb 05, 2012

As soon as you crack the can, you would think you died and went to Hop-Heaven! The nose of this is outstanding, with very high potent citrus and all around American hops! Since the can specifically tells you to drink from the can, that's what i did, So cant really give you an actual perspective of the DIPA! But the taste is out of this world! When drinking this you will encounter a hop bliss! Very very hoppy taste, loads of citrus and pine notes! When i scored this beer i wished i could of scored it higher!

m. as expected, it's got the perfect thickness, as in, I could drink this by the case. the look of it makes you think t could feel thicker, but it's perfect.
o. it's great, and worth finding fresh. easily one of the finest beers I've ever had. would be great if the alchemist decided to retire inside the beltline and start a Raleigh brewery. not hating, but the Raleigh area breweries have yet to attack this style, and I wish they would. 1,169 charactersASUGeog, Feb 05, 2012

A - A really vibrant straw to grapefruit rind sort of color. Really surprised by the appearance on this, as it is cloudy, but even with the haze, still very striking and brilliant in the glass. Beautiful stuff.
S - A nice resiny grapefruit aroma, to match the grapefruit rind appearance. The grapefruit is dominant, but it is more of an almost candied grapefruit, as it is sweeter than normal.
T - Not as malt heavy as a dIPA might be. Extremely clean, with a slight touch of booze, but mostly just super solid clean hop flavor. A slight astringency, as well. Lots of juicy citrus, and a nice pine backup. I feel like this does a better job showcasing the extra hopping than other dIPAs that I've tried. Doesn't tend to the syrupy side, nor does it stray into the abyss of biterness without beautiful hop flavor. A nice bit of spiciness in there as well.
M - Again, not so syrupy as you sometimes find with Double IPAs. It's a much more approachable, drinkable beer. It's got a fairly effervescent feel to it, which I feel helps on the citric/spice bite of the hop. But it's certainly not harsh. Almost seems to follow the Belgian idea of the digestibility of a beer. Really quite nice.
O - A beautiful IPA that in some ways makes me question if this truly a dIPA, or if it's just a really tasty IPA with a little extra kick. Super accessible for those out there who think they don't dig IPA, but also hoppy enough to keep the hopheads happy. A really refreshing dIPA, which isn't a way I'd characterize many of the others I've had. Full of bright, exciting flavor. Find some, put it in the glass (or keep it in the can, if you like), and eat it. 1,754 characters4thmedbn, Feb 04, 2012

A- the can looks beautiful, and clearly states to drink it from the can, which is what i did, the one other time I tries this we split a can between 4 people, I remember it looked nice, but it was too long ago to be specific, and for the review I felt it best to follow the brewers instruction.
S- Smells awesome, grass, resiny pine, a bit of citrus, a very pleasant aroma.
T- piney and resinous just like the nose, a bit of grass and citrus tastes very fresh!!! Very nice balance of flavors working here, delicious hops throughout.
M- medium bodies with medium carbonation, extreemly drinkable, with a slightly bitter finish, kinda chewy on the end too, which i like.
the only part of this that imam not a fan of is the lingering bitter aftertaste, seems to coat the mouth with bitter resins.
O- an excellent dipa, very nice, great aroma and flavor , everything is spot on, the only thing negative I have to say is or the aftertaste, I feel as though this beer is excellently well rounded until that point, and not that it is overly offensive, but it sticks out to me, and seems a bit out of place, I wish there were more of a crisp clean finish.
P.s. in retrospect, I am much more impressed with this straight from the can then I was the first time when I had my portion in a glass. 1,354 charactersPeterIngemi, Feb 02, 2012

while some folks found the floaties off-putting, I find them a sign of authenticity and appreciate their presence
I was tempted to just put 5's across the board, but I feel there is always room for improvement - the overall score if 5 is indicative of how good this beer is to me
A - hazy straw orange with a lot of little chunks swirling about, buoyed by lazy CO2 rising in the glass; nice creamy dense white head that lasts and lasts leaving generous lacing
S - dank; citrus and pine and candied citrus with moments of earth and flowers followed close by more of the same - there is definitely malt in there somewhere, but not on the nose
T - so very well crafted - balancing hops and malt in a beer of this size is no easy feat; layers of hops are clearly the point here and success is achieved, but there is precisely enough malt sweetness to keep it in line; excellent length and persistence of flavor; the finish is a reprise of the nose only on the tongue and soft palate - waves of delicious hops
M - creamy and rich and light and firm and...just perfect; CO2 is also spot on
O - this is probably one of the best beers I have ever had; I only wish I wasn't on the third of my four-pack; bravo! 1,386 charactersnezelrac, Feb 01, 2012

Two hop-head friends of mine and I tried a month-old Pliny the Elder and a week-old Heady Topper side-by-side. Every one of us (after coming down from hop heaven) had to admit that the Heady was the better beer. It's better balanced (no Munich malt to detract from the hops, unlike Pliny) and has a more comprehensive hop presence. Of course, this is like picking between Salma Hayek and Penelope Cruz (Salma=Heady Topper): either one is reason for a whole lot of gratitude. 697 charactersacread, Jan 31, 2012

A. You should be drinking this from the can as it says. But if you happen to pour it, you will see a great looking beer you can almost see from the color how balanced it is. That said it really does taste better from the can. Weird huh? The best and the worst beers are best consumed from a can. 
S. Damn fine! Smells like grass or weed. Not as much citrusy as I would have thought from such a high rated DIPA this may be the only thing Pliny has on this beer. 
T. Balanced. There's sweet there and a ton of bitter too but they are balanced perfectly. Hops are abundant but not bitter nor overly sweet or spicy. Don't know how that's done but glad they do. 
Mouthfeel is pretty light and drinkabilty is great for a 8 percenter. Would like another one but that wouldn't be a good idea. 829 charactersNinjabrew, Jan 30, 2012

A- Great light copper color. One finger white foamy head dissipates into thin layer. Not much lacing. Nice haze, floaties, which I don't mind.
S- Nose crusher with those big dank hops. Piney aroma, the fruit is in the background here, love that big dry hop taste that explodes when you crack the can. 
T- Mouth crusher. Leads you in with nice grapefruit, like real grapefruit juice, dry, bitter but juicy. This leads into big pine resiny flavors. Yum love the dankness chewwwy.
M- Nice and crisp. Just love that mouth burn dry mouth just took a hit feel. Perfect carbonation for the flavor.
O- One of my favorite beers ever. Beers like this are why I love IIPAs. Delicious. Great. 781 charactersNachojon, Jan 29, 2012
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 516 oz can into Piraat tulip glass
Nose: Tone of pine resin. Prickly, sugary grapefruit with a hint of prune.
Appearance: Hazy amber-copper with perfectly sustained head and great lacing.
Taste: Just a downpour of hops. Very bitter and herbal. Almost medicinal in a tasty, holistic way. A touch of lemon, a very slight hint of strawberry. Lively carbonated feel and a super-long bitter finish.
Overall: Just ridiculous. An inordinate, unprecedented amount of hops. However, it does fall off quickly. These cans are about 10 days old. The first one I had two days ago was slightly more citrusy. Absolutely no complaints though. Totally fantastic. HUGE thanks to my brother Mike for the Christmas gift. 703 characterssjverla, Jan 29, 2012

Can to snifter (and mouth)
From notes. I've enjoyed this several times, but this review comes from notes from bspringer's birthday celebration. An epic night to celebrate his golden day of birth!
A: Dark tan. Single (frothy white) fingernail head on gentle pour.
S: Oh so good! Pine, earthy hops, citrus fruit, and nice malt character.
T: Sweet malt up front to very earthy and aromatic hops. Complex citrus fruit, pine, and oak. Very nice. Quite sweet, but not too sweet.
M: Medium bodied/carbonation.
O: Thick and coating. Delicious! Just a really nice DIPA that everyone should try. I love that it is in a can. Highly recommend drinking it from that if you can - simply heavenly! 701 charactersspdyfire83, Jan 28, 2012

P-Like the scientist on the can and nice long story on the beer and how it should be drank on the back. 
A-Well this beer pours a cloudy and foggy orange peel. Keeps about a finger of head. Not much. 
S-No lie, this beer smells like straight up sweet hops, pure and simple. Just imagine a bunch of hops in your hands and shoving your nose into it. 
T-Sweet man. Very sweet. Nice hops and well, more hops. Has a sweet malt presence that seems to stick. Grapefruit and green grapes along with pineapple. 
M-This is a more full bodied IPA. Not too full though or heavy. Really smooth man. Great flavor. Has a quick dry finish. 
O-Very impressed with these beer. Man, i think it might be better than the Pliny, I dont know though, thank god i got more to figure out this crazyness. 832 charactersales4baldo, Jan 28, 2012

awesome looking can. love the mad-professor looking guy, reminds me of my buddy Luke. Luke, if you're reading this, take it as a compliment. 
says DRINK FROM THE CAN!, so i'm drinking from the can (at least for the first 2/3). no idea what it pours like (at least initially), but i'd imagine it's beautiful
smells glorious, hoppy as vince carter, smells bitter, incredibly floral and fruity. bouquets of bada$s flowers.
taste is outta this world. about as great as it smells. massive hop flavor obviously, slight rauchbier hints?... some smokey notes and aftertaste for sure (which I love). carbonation is spot on.
Wow. 4 bones a can? are you kidding me? absolutely love this stuff. really makes me want to take a trip to the northEast. will have to see Rustic Overtones while i'm there. amazing stuff. CHEERS.
PS - poured the last 6 or so ounces out into tulip. golden orange chunky and amazing. 973 charactersheelsn02, Jan 28, 2012

Poured from the can into a snifter, amber golden color with nice initial head that recedes quick with sticky lacing rim. Cloudy and chunky but so damn inviting. Nose is great with hops hops and floral aromas. Taste is the king on the heady. Explosion of hops and bitterness that is balanced on initial hit to the palate and then the hops and piney bitterness builds. The finish on this beer is amazing. 
The balance factor is not quite up to the Pliny and abrasive level, but is definitely in my third favorite dipa.

A: Pours an amber like hue with a lovely white, frothy head that recedes awfully slow. Lacing just sticks to the glass and stays there for a long time.
S: Smells of a tropical fruit delight, pineapples, mangoes and grapefruit over whelm the nose. I also detect some sweet malt in there as well.
T: Talk about a sweet hop wallop, this beer is a hop lover's dream. The sweet malt backbone balances the hops brilliantly.
M: Very smooth and easy drinking. Has a nice oily, resinous aftertaste to it.
O: Just sprung to the top for me. What a delight to try this beer and I would have this in the fridge at all times if I could. 782 charactersFinatic, Jan 26, 2012

-pours a light orange color with a good looking white head on top. it leaves both above average retention and lacing. there is a good amount of hop sediment lingering within
-big time grass, weed mix with a hint of grapefruit
-big time hop flavor right off the bat. the hop flavors for me are grass mainly with a bit of grapefruit following behind. after this some malt sweetness rolls in to balance out the big hop flavor leaving a lot of hop resins, but not a big lingering bitterness
-there is a good body on this one with a lot of hop oiliness that coats the mouth tools
-i got a 4 pack of this on tuesday. drank the 1st the night of and it was pretty epic. i was a bit bummed to find by friday that the hop smell and flavor had changed so much. most of the flavor and smell was still there, it had just gained some soapy, harsh accent. for this i cant give it a 5 in both those categories. that being said, this is a great IIPA and i would put it right behind both plinys and citra. it just didnt have an unbelievability to it in certain areas like those 1,162 charactersjuhl31, Jan 25, 2012

Says to drink from the can, which looks awesome btw. 
Smells like a clean dIPA, pineapple, grapefruit, just really sweet hops in general
Just an extremely well balanced dIPA, drinkable as stated by everyone before, you taste what you smell and its consistent. Every sip offers another angle, this is complex as hell. Taste amazing right out the can. 
MF is incredibly smooth..
Not as crazy as I expected, but just a ridiculously hoppy, sweet, clean, smooth and drinkable dIPA... by far the greatest beverage I've ever had out of a can. 599 charactersLeoPanna, Jan 25, 2012

A - it pours a great orange amber with a small head. Lots of particulate in suspension, yeast and hop resin. Again the beer doesn't look bad, but I feel it is tough to rate because of how the brewer intended it to be consumed.
S - This beer smells fantastic. Hops, orange, pine, lemon, citrus, I even get some mint. So many complex scents coming from this beer it is amazing. I want to bury my nose in the can and get high off the fumes.
T/M - This beer taste even better than it smells. All of the scents come through in the flavor. Notes of orange, piney-citrus, and mint roll across the tongue so smoothly. And of course there is the hops. The hopping is done so well in this beer you get the giant hop flavor with out giant hop bitterness. This is the first and only beer I have ever had that has pulled this off. There is so much hop flavor, but the bitterness you experience isn't overwhelming at all. The hops flavor comes in waves of slight bitterness that build as you roll the beer through your mouth. I am just bewildered as to how they accomplished this amazing and delightful experience. 
O - Buy this beer! That is all I can recommend. I know that it doesn't get very far south of Burlington, but if you ever find it, buy it. This is not just the best IPA I have ever had; this is the best beer I have ever had. 1,537 charactersxensure, Jan 24, 2012

A- Really nice golden orange with a nice hop haze. 1/2 finger white head with really nice lacing.
S- huge citrusy, piney, earthy, resiny characters coming off this beer. Really pungent hop aroma that just flows out of the glass like a hop scented yankee candle would. Pick up some bready malt but the hops are the main character in this feature. Love it.
T- Big bitterness right from the gates, then the grapefruit and pine come into view. Nice malt back bone to round it all out. Its really almost chewy and creamy at the same time. Very well balanced for a beer with 120 IBU's. 
O- This is one of my favorite DIPAs you get everything here. Big huge hop aroma and flavor showing off the citrus and pine with a really nice malt balance. Really great drinkable Dipa. Go to the Alchemist cannery and get yourself a case. Thats what I did and Im riping through it like Hulk Hogan through his Hulkamania shirts.

Had out of the can, and in a glass.
Pours bright orange with white head. Theres bits of hops floating around, some are green and some are bright white.
Actually smells better out of the can. All the aroma hops of pine needles, fresh grapefruit, and hints of lemon.
Taste is pretty much exactly what the nose leads you to believe. Grapefruit takes the lead, but dont forget about pine needles and lemon zest. Unlike Pliny, there is a pervading bitterness that just goes about a full-frontal assault on your tongue. 529 charactersVncentLIFE, Jan 22, 2012

A- A beautiful golden amber color. Healthy white head that clings all over the glass. The beer is extremely clear, and bubbley.
S- Like sticking your face in a bag of hops. Notes of grapefruit, lemon, and mango. A distinct piney scent is present, as well as some fresh grassiness. SOOOO hoppy
T- Very smooth initially, but then the hops just go crazy. Piney hops and citrus just pound your taste buds. Lots of pineapple and fruity notes, with strong floral piney flavors as well. It's just so fresh tasting, and the flavor goes on for ever. Nice hoppy aftertaste as well. 
M- Pretty much spot on. A bit dry at times, but carbonation and body are perfect.
O- Grade A DIPA all the way. This stuff is incredibly tasty, and tastes just like it did at the brewery. After drinking a significant amount of this, it really ruined most other IPA's for me. Nothing else I've had really compares to the smell and depth of flavor. Pliney tasted pretty boring next to Heady. If you are a hop head, this is a must have

I can't really judge the appearance this way, but the can has a cool design. The smell is a certain citrusy aroma with hints of the can mixed in the smell. The taste is perhaps the most balanced DIPA. the hops are not overpowering, and the flavor is exceptionally complex. Flavors of grapefruit, pine, and a sour hop flavor come to the forefront. The most remarkable element is the smooth mouthfeel. One might even say it goes down soft. The aftertaste does not limit the experience, but takes it in a different direction. The citrusy flavors sweeten like candy. Most DIPAs express punch of bitter hops at this point, so this was surprising and refreshing. This beer is definitley worth the hype. 799 charactersJohnnyHopps, Jan 21, 2012

I wasn't sure what to make of this beer at first, which says a lot because DIPAs aren't usually a surprising style with a lot of leeway. It's most easily described as "hop juice," not an IPA. The balance of hops is unique in that the flavor is huge, but it's never over the top, where overly-hoppy beers become perfumey messes (I'm thinking of Weyerbacher's Hop Explosion).
The aroma has a clean and clear floral grapefruit character with an earthy, citrus seed edge—think about when you're eating an orange and you get a seed on your tongue. The flavor is intense but manageable. In addition to the vivid grapefruit and orange peel citrus, there's a vague grassiness, tropical notes, and an odd (and thoroughly unexpected) touch of barbeque sauce that fades as the beer warms.
I approached this beer as a skeptic, but it's easily one of the most complex beers I've tried, and one of the most drinkable at that. I should have bought a case. 1,034 characterstempest, Jan 20, 2012

Appearance: A lustrious hue of burnt golden wheat
Smell: A pungent aroma of grassy hops and tropical citrus, pineapple. A strong lighter malt backbone, earthy.
Taste: As they command, from the can, creamy grassy hops, light resin and hints of pineapple, sweeter malts finish in a floral hop-bitterness. No heat from the 8% at all. Fantastic!

Appearance- Poured some out of a 2nd can for friends so I glimpsed the appearance. Hazy, a little more amber than most IPA's. Looks like a serious beer (whatever that means).
Smell- Pine, hops, and some fruits..can't exactly pick out which ones
Taste- Unlike any beer I've had. Some sips, it has powerful cirtusy and piney hops that challenge the drinker with bitterness and leave with a very dry finish. Then other sips, it's got a refreshing sweetness coming from juicy fruits...kind of like juicy-fruit gum (maybe not quite that sweet) with a very clean finish. It's bizzare, but makes it super flavorful AND insanely drinkable, which is a potent and marvelous combination.
Mouthfeel- It's very creamy with full carbonation. Coats the mouth nicely and lingers.
Overall- I already mentioned how drinkable this is for how hoppy and bitter it is. Why am I trading half this case again? 955 charactersAuror, Jan 19, 2012

S: Perfect pine with accents of ripe grapefruit and tangerines. Just the right amount of buttermilk biscuit holds it up. A hint of grain too. Truly amazing.
T: Comes on with great citrus and grapefruit then I get smacked by a sappy pine tree. More tangerines and then it hints at a bitter bite...but it never comes. Somehow more grapefruit and hop oil perseveres and smooths this elegantly into a clean finish. Amazing.
M: Creamy, firm, a little chewy with a bit of fizz.
O: It lived up to the hype. Simply phenomenal. A hop bomb that doesnt leave me feeling like I drank syrup. The sweetness is toned down and this is just perfectly hoppy and clean. 819 characterslegalpete19340, Jan 19, 2012

Nice aromas of citrus and pine blast out from the can. Immediately noticeable.

Full-bodied but not sweet at all.

A: Yellow/amber with lots of little uniformly sized particles floating around. Thick off-white seafoam head forms and retains quite well. Good lacing also.
S: Recently fallen pine needle dominates as well as a resinous punch of a cannibisian nature. Subtle biscuit cookie shows as an afterthought.
T: Pine and grapefruit pith wash over the palate as well as that resinous quality aforementioned in the aroma. This is quite bitter I must say, and evokes a nice tingly sensation on the middle of the tongue which sort of amplifies that quality. Sticky tobacco leaf tar like flavors creep into the finish in an interesting sort of way. Great stouts often carry "layers" of flavor and usually they revolve around chocolate. This carries layers of hop driven complexity. Overall I find it to revolve around herbaceous flavors. Not much citrus and what's there resembles more pith than zest. Overall this is bitter however there is a sort of burnt sugar cookie quality which provides some sweet balancing notes. This is not quite as dry as pliny overall. 
M: Despite the prickle, this is very sticky on the back-palate contributing to a nice long finish.
O: Really a very good beer, and I would love to try more of it at the freshest stage possible. All the same, however old this was it's very good, but lets be honest, it's not deserving of a 100 rating. 1,377 charactersflannelman808, Jan 17, 2012

The fresh aroma of this immense ale was overwhelming as I dove into the first taste with eager anticipation. This complex and tremendous IPA with aggressive, but balanced, characteristics captured my attention. It reminded me of some great IPA flavors I had tasted from casks.
The malt elements surfaced in various ways as I promised myself to find more of this in the future. 
While I could compare it to any number of IPA's that are stoutly hopped, this seemed to hold a magic that I could not quite describe. 726 charactersbonbright7, Jan 17, 2012

Starting off drinking straight from the can, as per instructions: Awesome fresh grapefruit & floral smell, like I just tored open a bag of hop pellets & took a whiff. A sweetly creamy & even dank, "organic" character develops before long, kind of like a pudding under the citrus hops. This smells fantastic.
Taste follows the smell, with a beautifully fresh hop character that's primarily grapefruit, with a moderate pine bitterness. For a DIPA, this is neither heavy on the bitterness or the malt, just very fresh, brisk, & clean, with the only thing weighing it down the tiniest bit is a little alcohol. Still remarkably light & refreshing for the style. That sweetness comes in a little in the taste, but not super sugary, more like a mild whipped cream. Some tea-like tannin character. Damn.
Medium-bodied, very smooth, with the bitterness lingering & causing a nice counterpoint but nothing overwhelming my palate. A little bit of heat from booze, but again nothing overwhelming. Very pleasant.
It's weird commenting on the appearance so late in the game, but here goes: Poured into a shaker, forms a nice three-finger off-white head over a just-hazy copper-gold. Head is lumpy & rises like a souffle. Even looks awesome, like lots of tiny nucleation.
Wow, this is one hell of a beer! I'd really hit a lull with IPAs lately, & it's great to be reminded of what a really transcendent one can be like - such an awesome experience. I've heard a lot of talk about this giving PtE a run for the money, & I can see why. 1,573 charactersOneDropSoup, Jan 16, 2012

T: juicy citrus and tropical friuts with nice lemon, orange, tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple and mango flavors complimented nicely by a piney hop bitterness with a hint of malty sweetness
MF: medium bodied, moderate carbonation, hoppy bitterness lingers on the palate
O: Heady Topper has set the standard for DIPAs for me, and it's a pretty high standard, blows fresh Pliny out of the water in my opinion, no contest, will continue to seek this out as often as possible 823 charactersADTaber, Jan 14, 2012

Poured from fresh 16oz can recently purchased at the brewery.
A: STRONG piney aroma, supported by black tea leaf, and a light honey note. Simple, yet delicious aroma profile.
A: Clover honey-colored body with a decent haze and some floaties. 1 finger head with that fluorescent yellow tinge that I've come to recognize in an IIPA. Head is not quite as thick as anticipated, but then again, I should be drinking this from the can... The brew leaves decent lacing after each sip.
F: Pine up front, some nice, not overpowering, bitterness. Honey-graham sweetness to balance. Some delicious green tea on the finish. DELICIOUS!!!
M: Medium-full body with medium carbonation. Right where it should be. Some sticky tannins cling to the inside of my mouth and lips.
O: I want more of this one! I can't think of an IIPA I've had that was better than this. A great mix of aromas and flavors. Everything just seems to work well together! Highly recommended! (On a side note, I drank my second HT straight from the can, and actually enjoyed it even more this way. Contrary to what you might think, if you get your hands on this beer, you should try it from the can. 1,197 charactersmdvatab, Jan 14, 2012
4.69/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.75This one pours pretty cloudy, with little bits floating around. If you pour it into a glass (which I prefer, but the brewery discourages), leave the dregs, as you would a homebrew. 
The hop aroma is intense and wonderful.
Taste is intense and wonderful, but with just a bit of a sourness.
Mouthfeel is perhaps the weakest aspect of this beer to me, it's pretty resiny and while I appreciate the flavor/aroma of the hops, this one's a little sticky.
Overall, this beer deserves the attention it's getting and is very, very, very good. Perhaps the coolest aspect of it is that for all its hype and popularity, it doesn't cost any more than the regular DIPA's you get off the shelf. Kudos to the Alchemist for that! 716 charactersdougfur, Jan 14, 2012

A: Pours a slightly hazy bronze-copper colour with a marshmallow-like creamy foam head. Decent retention and very good lacing down the glass.
S: Amazing. Damp earthy moss funkyness, lumberyard pine, a big grapefruit and mango element, and creamy walnut. Incredibly smooth and well integrated aromas. 
T: Buttered biscuit-like malt serves as the backbone, with an earthy pine bitterness and tart grapefruit and sweet mango upfront. An earthy damp wood and mushroom-like elements are present. The taste screams fresh. Smooth, creamy, and very well balanced. Alcohol pretty much undetectable. 
M: Full body with a moderate carbonation. Quite oily (welcoming) with a slightly resiny and grainy texture.

*From notes
-- Many thanks to the multiple BA's who've hooked me up with generous pours and fresh cans of this over the last few weeks. --
A: It looks like a really dingy cider. A good pour yields a fluffy 1.5 finger white head and solid retention. It should be noted that there are large white gobs floating around in the beer. Some settle. Some don't.
S: Wonderful bouquet. Juicy hop oil, it's got that island fruit vibe all over it.
T: It's hoppy alright, yet it's quite bready and rather bitter too. There's not a massive amount of complexity to it, it's simply an easy drinking beer that comes off more like a low key IPA then an Imperial.
M: Meh. It feels alright, but it's not gonna blow any skirts up or anything.
O: Having had large amounts of this at three separate tastings in a six week period, I can honestly say that Heady Topper is a grossly overrated beer. It's not bad, in fact it's a very pleasant brew. It simply doesn't reach the heights one would expect from it's rDev. Don't go out of your way to attain this. I know I won't. 1,114 charactersRhettroactive, Jan 10, 2012

A- pours a orange/copper with a slight haze and a decent sized head that dissipates to about 1/3 of an inch, a little bit of lace.
S- the second my nose gets close to the can I'm hit with an incredible punch of really fresh, piney, resiny hops that immediately bring with it citrus rind and tropical mango aromas. A feint but solid bready malt aroma is present as well.
T- this is just incredible. At first I want to call this an extreme hop bomb, but it isn't. Instead, it is the perfect display of extreme hopping and a good malt presence in one. It is ridicuously easy-drinking, and hits the bitter and sweet notes at once better than any other beer I've had.
O- I think this is the best DIPA I've had, and one of if not the best beer I've had. Really lives up to the hype. 901 charactersTschnab, Jan 09, 2012

pours a golden / medium amber tone with some haze to it while yielding a finger and a half of a creamy, off-white head. excellent retention and lacing.
nose offers a nice, fragrant bouquet of hops, heavy on the tropical / citrus, some floral and some grass notes and a hint of sweet malt. 
flavor follows the aroma. lots of tropical / citric hoppiness - lemon zest, grapefruit, and mango among others - with a little malt in the background. with medium bitterness. nice, medium bodied mouthfeel with average carbonation.
overall an outstanding beer. i'd probably be enjoying it even more had my expectations not been so incredibly sky high. and while it's not the best IPA/DIPA i've ever head, it's certainly up there - it just works. world class brew. 804 charactersperrymarcus, Jan 09, 2012

I'm not a fan of the unfiltered IPA look but that said, this is a fine lookin' beer. Golden amber color with some floaties swirling about in the haze. Dense head never really diminishes and rides down the glass depositing layer upon layer of foamy rings like my glass is wearing a rugby shirt. As always, bonus points for cans. Super extra bonus points for a tallboy. 
Aroma is every wonderful C hop aroma smushed into one glorious beer. Like motorboating a bag of hops. Grapefruit! Pine! Passion fruit! Grass! Yowza! Gadzooks! Spongecake malt underneath. So, so fresh.
Tastes like grapefruit soaked spongecake. Creamy unfiltered mouthfeel is also prickly with hop resin. Chewy.
So hoppy I tried filling my empty glass with water to make a small beer. It didn't work.
I honestly can't think of a way to make this beer much better. I guess filtering out the floaties wouldn't hurt. And at 8% it's a lot for my sensitive self. But I'm being really, really picky and a DIPA is what it is. Hope the brewpub is up and running again soon. 1,079 charactersdonkeyrunner, Jan 08, 2012

Special thanks to TheSevenDuffs for this beauty.
A- Slightly hazy orange juice colored pour. Half finger snow white head that disappears quickly. Lacing sheets beautifully.
S- Bright grapefruit and mandarin with a nice tropical lime and mango that I've never experienced. It's sweet and tangy in a citrus way. Pine and floral hops tie everything together. I can't get over how tropical this smells; it makes me think of a tropical Jugo Juice.
T- Bright grapefruit and mandarin and mango. Sweeter than the noise leads on but not too sweet. Pine bitterness with an orange juice concentrate syrupy finish. Well balanced bitter and sweet. Dry lingering finish.
M- Medium bodied, lively carbonation with heart burn inducing bitter (my stomach telling me it's good)

It's an attractive one!  A nice finger of head develops and the color is that of dried apricot fruit. There is a small amount of sediment floating about, but not much and it doesn't detract.  The head dissipates to nearly nothing, but some ultra fine lace remains that sticks to the glass with every sip. 
Big citrus and piney hop aromas. Tangerine!
For such potent nose the taste is quite well balanced for a DIPA.  It follows the nose to some extent with grapefruit citrus, but a hint of slightly sweeter fruit as well.  The malty backbone is there, subtle, but clearly balancing.  The finish is prickly bitterness although not overwhelming.  After it warms, every taste brings something new, oranges, lemon, honey suckle, peach...very interesting and complex!
For 8% ABV this one is quite drinkable.  The body is medium and the carbonation mild but a nicely done complement to the hoppiness. 
Thanks to Dr. B for sending this one.  What a treat! 1,095 charactersKMcG, Jan 07, 2012

the beer poursed a golden yellow color with orange hues and a 2 finger head that lasted a long time. the smell was huge citrus and piney hops with a subtle malt hint in the background. the flavors coming forth were huge grapefruit citrus and bitter piney hops in the finish with barely a trace of the malts in the nose. there was high carbonation with a dry light mouthfeel that left the mouth almost watering for more. huge bitterness that almost bit the tounge. overall this batch was the best ipa i have ever had, although when averaging out the batches of head i have had i like double sunshine and abner more. wish i had drank more of this batch and extra'd and traded less. 854 charactersrowingbrewer, Jan 04, 2012

A: Pours a hazy, particle filled, reddish-orange with a thick white head that slowly retracts to a couple centimeters. Leaves a ton of lacing as sipped down.
S: The nose on this is incredible. Tropical fruits, oranges, grapefruit, and resiny hop aromas dominate the nose. Insane citrus nose. 
T: Hoppy and complex, citrus and tropical hops stand out right away and are nice complemented with good bitter piney and resin hops, nice malt backbone.
M: Smooth, medium body, a little creamy.

The head is about 1 and a half fingers, slightly off-white, and creamy. Fades down but has really nice sticky lacing and leftover 'foamyness.' The color of the beer is a cloudy bright orange with some sediment floating around (not much though).
The aroma is REALLY nice! Fresh bright citrus fruits, blood orange, pungent grapefruit, tangerine, mango, just a plethora of those types of aromas, along with piney, bitter, leafy hops. Really great smelling!
The taste is really quite similar and very nice. Fresh citrus, blood orange, and really overripe citrus flavors, tropical fruits, grapefruit, mango, and maybe passionfruit, along with some bitterness and piney, wet, and hop cone flavors.
Mouthfeel is nice and creamy, almost luscious. Nice creamy consistency, medium carbonation, body is medium (maybe closer to the lighter side), and the finish is nice and light and dry. Superbly drinkable!
Overall this is a really damn good beer. I'm not quite sure where I rank it amongst my top DIPAs but actually I get to have a bottle of Pliny and can of Abrasive right after this haha. And after having all three, I honestly can't pick a favorite. I'd give Pliny the edge when on tap, super fresh bottle, or fresh growler. But Pliny really does seem to drop off after 2 weeks. If I had to rank them from this tasting, I'd say Abrasive &gt; Heady Topper &gt; Pliny. Thanks again for sharing these, Paul! 1,496 charactersmatttttYCE, Jan 02, 2012

Poured from the silver can w/ the "Alchemist", HEADY TOPPER, & DRINK FROM THE CAN! all in black into a 16oz pint glass (but only half the can). Enjoyed the rest straight from the can so I could review half and enjoy "how it should be" the rest. Has 11020B2BB on the back but no sign of freshness date. 
Aroma- Has the biggest citrus, piney hop aroma I've ever experience! Reminds me of a FFF brew. Grassy as well. Packed with more hops than can describe. Try for yourself! 
Appearance- Pours a 3 finger, bubbly head that lasts for great time. Has a nice orange/reddish copper body with no haziness. Leaves suds down the glass (but only got to see what 1/2 a pint did). 
Flavor- VERY fresh and perfect complexity. Mango and citrus hit the palate hard and then has a piney flavor. Sweet nectar, this thing rocks! Medium-High Bitterness and finishes rather sweet. Can't get enough... 
Mouthfeel- Medium-Full Bodied, Medium-High Carbonation, Smooth, Pure sweetness, and then grapefruit actually came out on the ending, leaving the palate with pure pleasure. 
Overall Impression- And this is why I was looking for this one for the past year! Unbelievable! Thanks for sharing Mark. Both drinking from the glass and the can were enjoyable but from the can was very fun! Intense, fruits like crazy, and great amount of hop all kept this one above many I've ever had.

Pours a vibrant, sunburst orange. Hazy, with a very dense, white head. Killer retention and some fine lacing. 
Smell is of juicy hops. A lot of citrus and tropical fruits, with some pine and grass thrown in. Not much in the way of malt, and a touch of alcohol.
I love me these juicy hop bombs! Wonderful hop profile. Tropical fruits upfront meet with some dryer piney/grassy notes in the middle. Some bready malt keeps everything in check. A bit of alcohol rounds it all out. Super clean throughout. 
This is where this brew really stands out. So smooth and surprisingly light on the pallet. Perfect carbonation. By no means overly bitter or sweet or dry; just perfect. Just as smooth as Pliny. 
Overall this is truly a world-class DIPA, and a damn fine beer. I now know why this beer is alway mentioned in the top five for the style. It isn't as aggressive as Abrasive, but more so than Pliny. A must have to any hop-head. Cheers! 1,158 charactersHumulus85, Dec 30, 2011

I'm going to drink some out of the can, as they suggest, and some out of a snifter, as I tend to prefer.
pouring half(ish) of the can into an oversized snifter gives a glowing golden orange body and a pure white head that is not too oversized, but sticks around and laces well.
tropical fruits slam my nose with tons of citrus, juicy and bitter, and some pine, lemon zest, some earthy/floral hops and some light malts. very aromatic.
tons and tons of resiny hop flavors with tropical fruits, juicy and bitter citrus, tons of pine, a good amount of bitterness, and a sweetness that comes in for a visit before it finishes resiny and bitter. (when I took a 1 ounce sample at the brewery, I tasted it the whole 3 hour drive home!) what a tasty, intense beer.
medium bodied and over-the-top resiny with just enough carbonation to add a prickly feel. it starts and ends as pure hop resin though.
oh my god. definitely meets the expectations. I'm glad I spent my Christmas money to buy an entire case. I was going to share a lot of it, but I have a feeling I'll be drinking a lot of this the next week!!! Happy new year to me!!! 1,185 characterssilentjay, Dec 29, 2011

Wow... the nose is pretty damn good... citrus zest... grapefruit... tangerine... maybe some lemon.... balanced just slightly by a light pale malt presence.... smells very fresh and very yummy.
Big bitterness up front quickly moves to a palate blast of citrus hops that have a touch of pine in there.... even some tropical fruitiness is accentuated by a slight pale maltiness... very good.
Body and carbonation are spot-on for the style.

4.25/5  rDev -8.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5From a glass with about a third from the can.
Very pale yellow with a foamy, two-finger white head. Very small flecks of yeast float around.
The aroma from the can is an exceptionally concentrated hop. Just potent hops. Mostly pine, musky, with a citrus edge. Maybe a little grass in the back. I get no malt in the aroma. A glass tames the smell--same stuff at lower concentration.
Tastes like a musky, piney grapefruit--but not a red grapefruit. It lacks the sweetness and lush, tropical juiciness of the best of the best. Still, it's a great hoppy taste. Very bitter, minimal malt that's only in the back end, which is just the faintest bit of biscuit. It's all that great bitter hop. 
It's fairly thin, though. That was disappointing. Red's Rye and Sierra Nevada Celebration are thicker, and they're singles. I expected more from a double. It's nicely carbonated, but finishes thin. It tastes more full from the glass and thinner and more single-noted from the can. 972 charactersbirderbeerer, Dec 27, 2011

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Canned on Dec 13, 2011. Poured in to CBS Snifter. 
A - Murky orange colour with one finger of thick, foamy off-white head and some very good lacing. 
S - Huge pine and citrus aromas up front with a big bitterness evident. Grapefruit, tangerine and some light peach and lemon zest aromas along with a slightly sweet caramel malt bill in the background. 
T - Massive bitterness up front. Grapefruit rind, pine and orange zest flavours come through with a very fresh and juicy hop bitterness. There are some tropical fruit flavours present as well - some mango, peach and pineapple. The malt bill is almost non-existent and provides a touch of sweetness to compliment to the big hop bitterness. The finish is dry and bitter with the hop resin lingering on the tongue. The ABV is extremely well hidden. 
M - Light to medium body with a big chew. Light to moderate carbonation. Resiny, oily, tongue coating. 
O - A great example of the style. 942 charactersTheSevenDuffs, Dec 26, 2011

It's quite hazy in sunset oranges and yellows. The head is white, but there isn't much of it. 
MMMM, passionfruit, marijuana, tangarine, orange hard candies. Explosive fruity aroma all over the place. Fleeting alcohol heat. 
Orange peel bitterness, grapefruit, dank and resinous hops abound. A sexy hop tango between grapefruit and orange bitterness and tropical and resinous flavors. There is the sweetness of significant caramel malts tempered by the bitterness and mellowed by alcohol. 
It's really soft in the mouth. I would say a bit undercarbonated, but it's got that nice softness that transfers bitterness so wonderfully. A little slippery with wonderful alcohol integration. 
World class is right. The hops are so vibrant. It has a much more substantial malt base than, say, Pliny the Elder, but it is so tasty. I rarely give fives. 964 charactersbrewerburgundy, Dec 24, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Fresh from the can...then poured into my Darkness snifter.
Body is beautiful, clear orange, even though I know it's unfiltered. Head is moderate to thin and off white. I recall the head being thicker at the brewery, maybe my pour was too gentle.
Nose is unsurpassed. This smells like true hop heaven. I can't see how they get this intensity without using a hopback, bet they do.
Flavor is so smooth and juicy, it's hard to believe this is a DIPA. It wears the 8% ABV so well it could cause trouble. Serious citrus hop flavor, but without extreme bitterness. Malt is there too, but hides in the back, as it should with this sort of beer.
Mouthfeel is slick, coating and enamel etching. Oh yeah!
Overall is tops. Worth the drive to VT. Worth whatever you need to trade to get some. I love this beer! 802 charactersghostwalker, Dec 24, 2011

I really felt lucky to be finally able to try this hyped (sorry Jeff, ;)) beer. Jeff made sure that he got it as fresh as possible in Holland. The can was opened three weeks after it had been filled! Cheers Jeff for this opportunity.
A4 - A yellow hazy fluid with some visible yeas tin it. The head is bright white.
S4.5 - A good strong smell of citrus and pine.
T4 - A light sweet beer with strong tones of citrus and pine and (if you ask me) there is a rubber in there as well. 
M4 - A medium carbonation that is excellent for the taste, the after taste is really bitter though.
O4 - A good strong double IPA - solid as a rock.
On Wednesday 28th of December 2011 I had another brilliant tasting session at my uncle Peter place . This was the beer Thijs brought. So thanks for another experience Thijs. And yes every one, I have a beautiful family in which good beer is highly appreciated.
A4 - It was the same as before.
S5 - This time I really took a good sniff and WOW what a nice scent of mango, pineapple, fresh cut grass, citrus and pine. It all entered my nose to explode right there. Perfect!!
T5 - This time I could enjoy more of this beer because we were with less people, and I could also drink it from the can. In the taste all the promises of the smell came true. New where the sweet and bitterness experiences, besides the smell that is.
M4.5 - A creamy feeling after the soft carbonation has died, in the end the bitterness sets in, overall a nice round feeling.
O4.5 - A good solid DIPA and I really could appreciate the aftertaste this time. 1,731 charactersMar02x, Dec 23, 2011

I really would say for my taste these 3 would b interchangeable as far as which one I like best. Number ratings don't tell how even they are. I drank from a glass on the first one can the next two. Looks great as fresh world class DIPA should, nice foam and you can get lost with your nose in the glass. Citrus, and lost of it, smooth hops, and a lot of that too, On my 1st can I was thinking of Pliny in a way to compare, but after having a few over the last few days I'm changing that up a bit. It comes on first sip like Pliny, then somewhere along the line the overwhelming hops kicks in and it's more similar to Alpines Pure Hoppiness. Nicely bitter, but not crushingly so, balanced as hell. Just a tremendous brew, surely equal to anything brewed anywhere that's a DIPA. It this was easily available I'd be 300 lbs. 922 charactersnc41, Dec 22, 2011

Did pour a little into a glass and it had a hazy orange tint with a decent rim of head, but it wasn't more than a couple ounces, so I wasn't checking out the head too much. 
Cracked it and smelled a pine forest full of grapefruits. Very intense. Not spicy, but it's aggressive. I had thoughts about getting squirted in the eye by my morning grapefruit as I stuck my nose as deep as the can mouth would allow. I had heard the hype; hype does not smell this good.
And the taste trumped the nose. Gobs of pine and citrus, but the mango stickiness lingered at the finish with an enticing balance of biscuity malts scattered in the middle. No boozy heat, just a smooth coating of the palate that kept me slurping and made me finish the can finish too quickly. The bubbles were small and perfect in quantity. Had to have a second one and take a lingering walk around town afterwards. 
The only flaw: they need bigger cans. 1,037 charactersguezarka, Dec 20, 2011

Poured into a tulip from a 16oz can.
A – Pours a very nice dark copper color with some slight haze to it. There is a 0.25 inch white head that recedes down to a thin film. (5.0)
S – Starts off with some slight sweet piney hop notes. There are also some nice citrus notes and tropical fruit notes. There is some nice mango and tangerines in there. There is definitely very grassy and hoppy nose. (5.0)
T & M – Starts off with a nice hoppy and grassy note with some nice tangerines and slight orange. There is some nice biscuit malt notes in there as well with some earthy notes. There are definitely some nice piney notes in there. This brew is quite smooth and drinkable. There are tons of flavors in this DIPA with nice mango and some slight passion fruit as well. Tons of grapefruit notes are present. There is some nice bitterness in there as well. This is definitely a top five DIPA. Nice dry bitter finish. Mouthfeel is nice and light-medium with some refreshing notes. (5.0)(5.0)
O – This brew is delicious. Tons of hops with some slight bread notes but definitely a hop heads dream. Might not be as balanced as other highly rated DIPAS (Abrasive, Pliny, Citra) but that’s ok for this hop head. This is a very flavorful brew with tons of hops and great bitterness.

S: The smell of this beer is simply amazing. At the first whiff it reminds me of a fresh bag of hops or hop pellets. Juicy mango, luscious grapefruit, and juicy pineapple, a long with some resinous pine.
T: Bursting with flavor! Pineapple, grapefruit, apricot, mango, orange and a slight bit pine resin. The taste lives for minutes beyond the sip. Even though this is brewed in Vermont, it tastes like Hawaii. Definitely balanced towards this bitter side.
M: Smooth, medium bodied, soft carbonation, juicy.

A: Well I can't really tell now can I? From the picture of one I took a few weeks ago into my Russian River goblet. Muddy orange brown pour with a pretty thick white head.
S: The hops smack you right upside the face on your first sip. Metal hints from the can seem to bolster the big piney hoppiness, but certainly a caramel malt backbone is noted.
T: Honestly, the taste is not entirely different than it was out of the glass. Big hit of piney hops up front, citrus and other tropical fruits. Bitter, but the fruitiness is pretty formidable as well. The malt backbone from the smell is only slightly noticed, this one is all about the hops. The balance between bitter hops and fruity hops is phenomenal.
MF: Carbonated very well, medium body, very crisp dry finish. The booze is noted every so slightly.
O: Best beer I have ever enjoyed straight from a can, and one of the better ones I've had period. I've had Pliny this fresh and they are both phenomenal in their own regards. 1,203 charactersrusswbeck, Dec 15, 2011

The smell is intense and when you take a drink you can taste everything that you smell. Alcohol is barely present as the flavors balance the beer out very well. A bit of bitterness at the end, but like I said, everything is balanced well. 
Overall this IPA is a must have and will definately acquire this again. It is an IPA that you can just sit back and enjoy every small sip of it. 682 charactersintensify, Dec 14, 2011

A: Pours a very cloudy iced-tea color with a finger of bright white oily head that slowly faded into a very greasy film that left soapy patches of bubbly lace down the glass.
S: Stupid powerful and bright scents of fresh citrus hops layered with sweet tropical fruits and a blast of pine. Much easier to smell out of the glass. 
T: Follows the nose with very sweet and fresh flavors of tropical fruit nectars and slightly bitter citrus juice. The hops in this are just so fresh while being so flavorful and easy to drink. The finish is sweet, juicy and honey-like, and the aftertaste is very smooth with hardly any bitterness. 
M: Very slick and greasy mouthfeel, oily thick body, soft and fluffy carbonation. This goes down so smooth.
O: One of the best DIPA’s in the world. Definitely top 5. Love the flavors in this. Every bit as good out of the can than the bottle. If I lived near where this beer is distributed, I would always keep my fridge stocked at all times. 1,186 charactersscottfrie, Dec 11, 2011

Score (Can): 96
Score (Duvel tulip): 92
2011 can, courtesy as an extra from FrankenBrew (BeerAdvocate trade)! Been wanting to try this forever. It's rumored to taste/smell different from a can, so I'm doing this brew half-and-half. The half I drank out a glass was from a Duvel tulip.
Appearance (Can): Silver colored can with black artwork etched on the front. The can has a thrice repeated warning around the upper edge that reads, in all caps, "DRINK FROM THE CAN!" I don't like it when beer tells me what to do. Whatever, I'll do what I want!
Appearance (Duvel tulip): Pours a super hazy orange-amber color with a finger of super foamy cream-colored head that sticks around for a couple of minutes until it settles into a ring around the glass and thin clump in the middle. Decent lacing. 4/5
Smell (Can): Huge citrus and floral aromas. LOTS of intense, fresh tropical fruits -- oranges, grapefruits, pineapple and mangoes. Fresh grass clippings and dank resin. The nose is absolutely packed with bright, floral hops. Let's be honest -- it's like a sunshine of citrus-hops. This is hands down the best IPA, potentially the best beer, I have ever smelled in my life. I wish I could buy an air-freshener that smelled just like this! 5/5
Smell (Duvel tulip): A lot of the intensity of the citrus-hops aromas is lost when you pour this out of the can -- even into the infamously aromatic tulip glass! The aroma is a lot earthier, mellower and maltier. Reminds me a lot of Zombie Dust. Still getting zesty oranges and some lemons with big whiffs. You need to smell with much more effort to get the deliciousness once its poured. This one is absolutely better from the can -- no joke! 4/5
Taste (Can): A lot more mellow and subdued than the aroma would have you believe. Very earthy, dank hop bitterness. Orange pulp and lemon hit up front too, almost like a mellowed out Zombie Dust. Malty, bittersweet citrus builds on the mid-palate as the beer layers. Alas, it's not the front or midpalate that defines this beer -- it's the finish. The finish is zesty, bitter oranges and hops, and BOY does it linger! 4.5/5
Taste (Duvel tulip): Like the aroma, a lot of the intensity of the flavors are lost when you pour this from the can. The lingering orange-citrus bitterness largely disappears, and turns into a very average IPA-like finish. Since aroma makes up a main component of taste, this is not too surprising. A lot of the bright citrus flavors are lost and replaced by dank, earthy tones. When poured from the can, Heady Topper turns into an earthier Daisy Cutter with mid-palate flavor. 4/5
Mouthfeel (Can): Medium bodied, medium carbonation. It feels a little under-carbonated at first, preventing the citrusy bitterness from popping on the tongue, but the trade-off of a heavy lingering flavor on the tongue for the finish is absolutely worth it. Finish is a little oily, a little stick, and bittersweet. 4.5/5
Mouthfeel (Duvel tulip): No difference, other than a slightly maltier finish.
Overall: This one should ABSOLUTELY be enjoyed from the can. From what I read, a lot of the volatiles that make this beer so special quickly escape from the glass, whereas the can maximizes their presence through lower exposure and retention. Who would have thought that drinking from the can could be so wonderful? Maybe those tailgaters have it right after all! If I could get consistent access to this beer, it would be my go to non-stout brew.
Recommendation: This is an absolutely must-seek out double IPA. Just make sure to drink it from the can. I wish I could pour it back in and undo the mistake I made, questioning the wisdom of the can.
Food Pairings: Kuma's Corner hamburgers. Spicy food would be pretty great with this too.
Cost: $12 for a four pack. 3,816 charactersjegross2, Dec 11, 2011

Powerful fresh grassy hops are immediately apparent despite the can.
Bitter, powerfully grassy west-coast US hops. Slight undertone of honey, but not nearly enough to balance. One dimensional, perhaps, but good at that dimension.

16oz can. Poured about 4oz in a small snifter for color and aroma. The rest was had from the can. 
A- Pours a hazy golden/orange color with a thin white foam that leaves a few rings of lace. 
S- The nose on this is incredible. Tropical fruits, oranges, grapefruit, and resiny hop aromas dominate the nose. Insane citrus nose. 
T- Very bitter initially with loads of hop flavor. Orange and grapefruit flavors lead the way with a touch of pine. A very small amount of malt sweetness and alcohol in the finish. Anything but balanced in terms of flavor, but as a hophead I don't mind in least. 
M- Medium bodied with good carbonation. I've had a few big DIPAs that seemed a little syrupy but this beer is surprisingly dry and crisp. Helps to enhance the hop flavors and bitterness. Ridiculously drinkable. 
O- Very happy I got the chance to try this. Certainly a must have for any true hophead. 962 charactersprojectflam86, Dec 08, 2011

Aroma was just green vegetal hop madness. Lush and rich. Simcoe, amarillo for sure. Not really picking up bitterness, thankfully. Taste was more of the same, super awesome hop mouthfeel. Carbonation was just right. Take your pick you can taste and smell all the usual good hop adjetives. . . piney, grapefruit, citrus, green etc. . . this is dank. So nice, bitterness is so soft, hop taste so big. Seems like every other east coast ipa out there (not literally every) just makes an ipa with a shit ton of bitterness and no dry hop aroma or hop mouthfeel. Heady Topper takes a back seat to no one. Its not unique, it might as well be an uglier looking Pliny clone, tastes so similar.
Why try and reinvent the wheel when you can just mimic it and do a damn fine job doing it? 969 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Dec 08, 2011

16 oz can first sampled from can then poured into a tulip glass
A- A hazy brunt orange/light brown with a white one finger head.
S- Can: A explosion hops, citrus/grapefruit, pine, tropical/mango, resin.
 Glass: Getting a little more of the malt backbone and the citrus and tropical hops are a little bigger smelling.
T- Can: Hoppy and complex, citrus and tropical hops stand out right away and are nice complemented with good bitter piney and resin hops, nice malt backbone.
 Glass: Not noticing much of a difference if any, maybe a little sweeter from the malts, but still just tons of hops!
M- Smooth, medium body, a little creamy.
O- This is just amazing. When I first saw the can in my box, I was super excited to try this but was a little nervous after I did not see a canning date, but after smelling it I knew it had to be fresh. Right up there with Pliny The Elder, worth seeking out, and I will be search for this more and more. 981 characterslarryi86, Dec 08, 2011

4.99/5  rDev +7.3%look: 4.75 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thank you Lambicking for 12 cans of this. Truly my favorite beer.
First off, I feel like you have to drink other IPAs before this so you know what exactly you are drinking. You're going to want to have a refreshed and clean palate for this gem though. You drink any typical highly regarded DIPA, take a break to refresh your palate and then drink one of these, and you'll see my point.
A - I drank some of these out of the can and some from the glass. In a tulip it pours with about a 1 finger head. It's hazy as hell, leaves decent lacing, and is golden orange. There are tons of what I assume to be hop resins floating around. The appearance is a 5 for me because I don't mind seeing the hop resins sitting in the glass whatsoever, although I could see why it could be off putting to some people.
S - Pine, tropical fruit, and grapefruit super strong. There's definitely some earthy, grassy smells in there, but it just smells like ripe fruit. Citrusy and definitely getting some pineapple, mango, and grapefruit. This fresh smells better than just about anything I've ever smelled, forget beer. This is by far the best smelling beer I've ever had (over PtE, Zombie Dust, Dreadnaught, Hopslam, etc.).
T - Very similar to the nose. It's heavenly. The hops are showcased so well, and a slight sweet maltiness is there just to support them and does nothing but add to the flavor. Quite frankly, once you drink this next to something of lesser quality, you realize what you are missing. This has complexity unlike any beer I've ever had. There's so much going on, but there's not too much of one thing and it all comes together perfectly. The malt it is the background providing a touch of sweetness and balance, and all the different hop flavors mesh together perfectly, but you can still pick them out and enjoy each and every one.
M - The mouthfeel just adds to the taste. It's so smooth with a nice amount of carbonation. The carbonation level isn't extremely high, but it's spot on to get it across the palate and wake up the mouth without going overboard. It needs a nice level of carbonation because it really coats the mouth, and it is medium bodied. That said, it is still extraordinarily easy to drink. I tried to savor it, but just couldn't really. The 8% ABV really is nowhere to be found. There is only a hint of it.
O - By far, I can't recommend any beer more than this. If you can ever get this you are doing a disservice to yourself by not tasting this fantastic concoction. It's like drinking the nectar of the gods. Seriously, that good. I must say, though, that this is fantastic when fresh, but if you don't have it fresh it's not nearly as good. Over my dozen cans, the beer fell off after a couple of weeks. Silly me drank them over 3 weeks. The first week it was a religious experience, and by the last one it was only as good as any other world class DIPA. You could probably age this and it'd be great, but do drink fresh if you can. Giving it a 5/5 because it is tops on my list. If something dethrones this, I'll knock it down a notch. For now, this is as close to perfect as a DIPA can get in my opinion. 3,136 charactersnrs207, Dec 07, 2011

Appearance: A bit more orange than amber with noted opacity. Nice 1.5 inch white head, that quickly streaks the side of the glass with beautiful lacing.
Smell: Very piney with a citrus peel nose pucker that makes my lip curl. Cannabis abounds. Very nice!
Taste: Taste follows smell nicely. There is plenty of pine resin and citrus. The bitterness lasts at least a minute after you swallow and the alcohol is undetectable.
Mouthfeel: There is an obvious tingle once the beer touches your tongue. It's very smooth but a bit thin.
Overall: This is an amazing IIPA. I wish it was more readily available!!! 630 charactersdogbones, Dec 07, 2011

A - Pours a hazy golden-amber with a creamy white head that settles to a slight haze and ring.
S - Oh boy. This is right up my IPA alley. Fresh hop aromas of grapefruit, pine resin, mango, and peach with a very subtle malt backbone.
T - Similar to the nose, lots of fresh pine resin, grapefruit peel, and tropical fruit flavors with a light malt profile. Excellently bitter finish, with just a little bit of heat from the 8%. 
M - Smooth and crisp, with a touch-over-medium body and good carbonation. You can really feel the hop oils. 
O - A superb DIPA, almost exactly what I look for in the style. Insanely drinkable, this would get dangerous if I had regular access to it! 834 charactersjsanford, Dec 06, 2011

A - Pours a nice, slightly hazy orange hue with a nice creamy one finger head that fades to leave a thick halo and nice clouding.
S - Smell is excellent, lots of fresh pines and grapefruit peel. There is some very light tropical fruit in the back, but mostly just pine and grapefruit.
T - Delicious. Super nice grapefruit along with good pine oil flavours. Lots of citrus and pine in this one. Not too sweet with some more light tropical (slight mango/pinepalle, but not much). Good bitter finish.
M - Really, really nice. Almost a 5, but not quite. In one sip, you cant taste the ABV, the next you get the booze. It does feel nice on the tongue.
O - Overall this stuff is dangerous. These tallboys go back so easy its easy to lose track. The price too...my goodness, under $4 a can! Stuff is just delicious. Well worth getting. 917 charactersrudzud, Dec 05, 2011

drinking from the can (as instructed) and poured a few oz's in the middle to a taster glass
A - VERY hazy, on the darker side of gold in color. half finger, loose fluffy head settles to a thin film.
S - hop aroma hit my nose immediately when popped. well balanced citrus: candied oranges, pineapple, and grapefruit meets some wet pine and a hint of biscuity sweetness. 
T - gentle sweetness for a split second before the big wave of hop flavors rush in. flashes of peach and pineapple turns very resinous and piney for a second before floral and juicy hops finish up. as advertised "wave after wave of hoppy goodness will creep up on you". bitterness is abundant but not at all overpowering, and just the faintest bit of booze wakes everything up. 
M - medium bodied, perfect amount of creaminess while moderate carbonation livens the bitterness and hop flavors. nice and oily through the finish, yet somehow still a touch dry. not much to improve on here.
O - a stellar DIPA worth all the hype. i was leery about this as I've been a bit burned out by hops lately, but this delivired and ten some. the real magic here is the myriad of hop flavors taking turns, and absolutely INSANE drinkability. this can is going wayyy too fast. must. get. more. 1,367 charactersStigs, Dec 05, 2011
4.85/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I got this can from someone at the CL release, basically as a present. I don't remember the BA handle, but he's opening a brewery in Jersey. Thanks!
Heady Topper has a hazy orange body with a few particles floating around in it. The head is a couple of fingers high and is a light tan color. The retention is good and the lacing is excellent. Great look for a IIPA. On a side note, I also love how the can looks, both the art and the black-on-silver color scheme with the black tab.
Huge hop nose. All kinds of juicy hop aromas with bits of grass, citrus, fruit and a little bit of resin. There isn't much of a malt presence in the nose.
Heady Topper is an absolute hop assault right off of the bat with tons of fruit. It features flavors of Grapefruit orange and citrus lead things off. The orange and citrus flavors are definitely more powerful than grapefruit. All of the fruit flavors have an extremely juicy feeling to them, and they are generally very good. In addition to the citrus, there is a generically fruity hop element, a touch of pine and a good bit of resin flavors. With this array of hop flavors comes a good bit of bitterness. For a double IPA I would say the bitterness is moderate at best though, as this isn’t part of the “teeth-melting” variety of IIPAs. The malt profile is hidden underneath the hops, and I really don’t have much to say about it other than it is of the paler variety used in the style, so it doesn’t bring tons of caramel flavors. The finish and the aftertaste have tons of hops also, bringing bitterness and brand new assault of the initial hop flavors. The flavors hang around for quite a while.
The mouthfeel is definitely defined by hops and bitterness. The body is a touch above medium, and the carbonation is full and smooth. It is also very oily and noticeably bitter.
I've drank tons of this stuff from glasses and cans alike, and I haven’t noticee an appreciable difference. No matter how I drink it though, Heady Topper is absolutely a world-class IIPA. This is a beer that is worth seeking out, and I could probably drink it by the case. It doesn’t have a touch of alcohol to it, and the bitterness isn’t excessively harsh at any point. 2,210 charactersHojaminbag, Dec 04, 2011

M: Medium viscosity; thick and creamy for an IPA, but that's just how I like it

4.89/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Dare I call this beer perfect? Without a doubt one of my favorites. I've never had the pleasure of having one on tap, but upon cracking a can, the smell of hops overpowers everything within arms length - it's really quite impressive. While John Kimmich recommends drinking out of the can, I drank one from the can, one from the glass. 
After a gentle pour, I was unimpressed by this beer's head. With a hard pour, however, I'm sure that it would live up to its name. Either way, it does provide a beautiful lacing. Resins float throughout the body of the beer; hazy yellow/orange color. 
It tastes clean, with piny undertones. There's a good amount of sweet malt in the middle, but it starts and finishes all hops. For me, the standard for an imperial IPA. 
It feels smooth, with a fairly mild amount of carbonation. Despite the power of the hops, drinkability is incredible. Not to deamean such a tasty beer, but if I were still in college I think I might just shotgun one of these. 
In short, the Kimmichs reported that after Hurricane Irene, their goal was to brew one beer perfectly. In doing so, they have set the gold standard for what a DIPA should be. 1,163 characterstylerprince, Nov 30, 2011

Appearance: Full can takes up the majority of the glass, with the last couple of inches providing a nice creamy white head to the top of the glass. Color of beer is a pretty honey orange amber color with very little light coming through.
Smell: Perfect. Pine, grapefruit, and other hints of citrus mingle with a touch of sweet malt smell. It really doesn't get any better than this. If you visit the cannery there is a potent hop smell in the air, and it smells exactly like the inside of a can of HT.
Taste: About like it smells. Perfectly balanced - it's full of citrus and pine hops up front, with a nice bitterness on the finish. The malt gives it a very slight caramel flavor to keep this beer from being an abrasive over the top hop bomb. Alcohol is simply nowhere to be found - incredibly masked for an 8% beer.
Mouthfeel: Pretty full bodied for a DIPA, very creamy and smooth. Carb was a bit on the low side but perfect for the beer.
Drinkability: Extremely high. Aside from the extreme hops, you wouldn't really know this is a DIPA. Alcohol is nonexistent, and I can't really disagree with the brewer in the hypothetical shotgunning ability of HT. :) 
Overall: I've now had this guy on draft, in the can, and out of the can. Any way you take it, it's an amazing beer. I do feel that straight from the can had a bit more hoppy flavor, but pouring it gives you the killer nose plus the ability to see the beer. Net-net I'll probably go with what I'm feeling at the time. 1,617 characterscbeer88, Nov 27, 2011

4.65/5  rDev 0%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5finally getting around to reviewing this. about 10 days since its canning. poured into my hill farmstead pint glass. 
a - pours a cloudy orangeish-golden, too cloudy to see through, with a beautiful finger-width thick creamy head with great lacing as well
s - total hop blast to my nostrils, with some sweetness hidden in there. very pleasant aroma. some pine, grapefruit, herbalness, and a hint of marijuana as well
t - very balanced and representative of the smell - all those flavors are in there. balanced exceptionally by malts. quick bitterness that doesn't last long
m - medium to full-bodied, moderate carbonation, alcohol hidden very well, as I know from experience
o - is it homerism? maybe, but I think this is about as good as it gets. definitely right up there in drinkability and quality with fresh pliny on tap. is it better from a can? maybe, certainly doesn't get worse, but figured it was worth reviewing out of the glass. simply amazing and i'm so lucky to have this so readily available. 1,012 charactersAshleyMiller, Nov 26, 2011

4.62/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A fresh can into a standard pint glass.
Hazy golden yellow with orange highlights, some floating sediment can be seen and a decent amount of lazy bubbles that raise to the top. A thin white head rests at the top and some lacing happens as the beer is drank down.
Pine with mango and pineapple greet your nose, then move into grapefruit like citric qualities. A soft graham cracker like sweetness layered below that, with a fresh cut grass and peach aroma. Pretty awesome smelling, and unoffensive even though it has that pine resin in the forefront which I typically do not care for. 
Opens with more pine resin, then moves into pineapple sweetness with grapefruit zest to compliment. Softer notes of graham cracker, mango, and that nice peachy sweetness. Great stuff.
Crisp, medium bodied with a bit of stickiness and a touch of drying.
Awesome representation of pine resin with notes of grapefruit and pineapple, with a softer graham cracker like sweetness. A top 10 beer right now that lives up to the hype in my opinion. Glad they have made this one more accessible. 1,075 charactersauroracrisis, Nov 26, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5One of only a few 4 packs left at a Burlington area grocery store. The beer guy said it would be gone soon, as the first order of 160 cases disappeared in less than 4 days.
A-Not sure. They reccomend drinking it out of the can. I don't entirely trust that advice, but since there's a whole 4 pack, I'll give it a shot. (Edit: I poured out a little bit just so I could give a rating. Rusty orange with a thin, bone white head. No lacing.
S-As soon as I pop the top, bold, vibrant hop aromas. I can smell them from a few feet away. Resinous pine needles, spruce, grass clippings, tangerine skins,skunky weed,grapefruit juice...I could go on. There's plenty going on here.
T/M-Reminds me a lot of Russian River Blind Pig. From the first sip it's clear this beer is in the same echelon as the best IPAs the West Coast has to offer. The malt profile is thin and bready, acting as a skeleton for the muscular, assertive hops. Leans towards the piny side of the spectrum, with some undertones of dry bitterness and fresh cut flowers. The finish is dry without coating the palate.
O-Really great. Top notch. If they can start producing enough of this to get it outside of Vermont it could become formidable competition for Pliny or any of the other highly regarded West Coast hoppy beers. 1,284 charactersDaveHS, Nov 26, 2011

Pours a hazy golden orange with tangerine hues and a 1.5 finger white foam head that slowly settles into a lasting ring. 
Dank, uber-fresh hop aroma with lots of resinous hop oils and grassy pine along with a ton of citrus and tropical fruit character. Spicy with hints of pine needle, orange peel, grapefruit, mango and pineapple as well as a subtle biscuity malt presence. 
Chewy fully body with a blast on dry, oily hops that linger over the sweeter fruit notes and subtle malt backbone into a nice dry finish. The hop profile is pretty complex with dry, earthy pine needle flavor countered by sweet citrus and tropical fruit notes. Hints of papaya, mango, pineapple, grapefruit and orange peel give this beer some nice sweetness and great balance without overpowering the bitterness. In fact, these two flavors continuously bounce off of each other back and forth throughout. In addition, there is a faint malt presence which gives the beer a good backbone, again without taking anything away from the hops. Toward the finish there is slight boozy heat but overall the ABV is very well masked and this beer is dangerously quaffable. 
This beer is legit, living up to the hype I wish that I had easier access so I could add it to my regular rotation. 1,344 characterscorby112, Nov 24, 2011
4.39/5  rDev -5.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to mtardiff for sending me a 4 pk. No canned on date. Against the recommendation on the can, I poured into a snifter.
A - A slightly aggressive pour yields a dirty tangerine color with a 1-finger head. It's quite hazy, and you can't see any carbonation. The head retention isn't great, and very little remains once it dissipates. Minimal lacing does not stick.
S - Boom! It's a tropical fruit storm. Lots of pineapple and grapefruit and a hint of lime. So much fruit it's tough to detect any malt character.
T - Juicy grapefruit and orange with honey sweetness, a whisper of malt, then a pine bitter onslaught. Yum.
M - Lighter bodied and slick with light carbonation. The hop oils really coat and there is a slight alcohol warmth.
O/D - I had heard alot about this beer and read outstanding reviews. In my opinion it really lived up the hype. I was able to savor a four pack. Too bad it's not easier to get because I will always want this beer. 957 charactersLaCoursiere, Nov 24, 2011

4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16oz can into a Duvel Tulip - totally ignoring the instructions to drink from a can (I'll drink the next one from the can). Thanks to rhong187 for the hookup.
A: Cloudy burnt orange color. Careful/yet still aggressive pour leads to a 2 finger fluffy white head that dissipates over a the course of a few minutes and leaves sticky white lacing down the sides of the glass. Lots of floaties and very slow carbonation bubbles rise from below.
S: Citrus hops hit the nose first and foremost followed by spicy-piney notes and finally the malt backbone makes it's way through letting me know that strong balance is to be expected.
T: Follows the nose directly. Sweet and sour grapefruity notes dominate the palate. Mango and bitterness find their way in as well followed by the malt that was present in the nose balances nicely. ABV is well hidden.
M: Perfectly carbonated, medium body. Hop oils coat the mouth and leave a long, lingering aftertaste that leaves me wanting more and more, even after the can is finished. Sticky mouth coating lasts for what seems like forever. Most definitely a palate killer.
O: A fantastic beer - world class DIPA. Extremely happy that I had the chance to try it and I will never turn it down. I probably will seek this out a few times a year for the fact that it's freaking delicious. 1,332 characterssuspect, Nov 23, 2011

I've had this about twelve more times since this initial review (most recently on 2016-03-06 from a 1-week-old can) and it remains very high on my list.
A - Per the instructions, I smelled and drank most of this beer directly from the can. I poured the last 4 ozs into a nonic glass. The color is amber-orange with a 1/2-finger off-white head. It's somewhat hazy with some small floaties. There isn't much lace but there are alcohol legs. 
S - Lots of pineapple, pine and fresh-crushed hop buds, sticky and oily. Not much malt. A tropical hop lover's dream.
T - Big, marvellous flavor, much like the smells. Huge fresh pineapple and orange flesh, big oily resinous hop buds, pine, moderate pale malt and very light caramel sweetness but the fresh pineapple sweetness is more dominant. The bitterness is orange zest and comes in more towards the finish. This fantastic taste lingers but doesn't assault the tongue. Balanced. Remarkable. 
M - Light-medium body and medium carbonation. A bit creamy and dries out nicely.
O - This is flat-out a great beer; hovering at the very top of my IPA/DIPA favorites. One remarkable thing about this brew was my wife's reaction, who isn't a fan of bitter hop bombs. She too loved the smell. Her comment on the taste is that it was really good and for the first time, she can appreciate what I like about hop-centric brews, my favorite style of beer. 
Notes: A ton of thanks to matador677 for continuing to hook me up with this taste treat. 1,552 charactersTucquan, Nov 20, 2011

4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks go out to Ryan for hooking me up with this stellar double IPA. I have had it a couple times now, both directly from the can and decanted into a pint or tulip on various occasions.
This beer is a hazy brownish amber color covered by wisps of sticky foam after the pour. Some lacing, but not nearly as sticky as I have seen on my favorite-looking imperial IPAs. Looks significantly better in the glass than it does in a can...go figure!
The aroma right out of the can is unreal. Concentrated mango, pineapple, and grapefruit, as well as a hint of pine. When decanted, it gets a but more citrusy and brings out some sweet stonefruit and toasted coconut aromas. On the palate, the pine is certainly more assertive, and it does drown out the citrus to a good extent, but the grapefruit and orange notes remain. The bitterness is kept in check, but that which does come through is a dank bitter flavor...my favorite. The alcohol is masked completely, and there is almost no malt backbone present. Just delightful.
While not as sticky or resinous as other DIPAs, the nearly perfect carbonation level makes this an extremely enjoyable beer to drink. One of the most enjoyable "new" DIPAs that I have had in a long time! 1,221 charactersNittanyBeerFan, Nov 20, 2011

A: The pour is a cloudy dark orange with a finger’s worth of white head.
 S: The nose is intensely perfumey with lots of grapefruit, mango, pine, and lemon zest. There’s a pretty nice pine aroma, and just an overall fruitiness to it. 
T: Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and lemon zest give this a big fruitiness. Though it does have a lot of fruit notes, it’s also pretty intensely bitter and piney, which is very nice. 
M: The body is medium with a pretty lively carbonation and a dry, bitter finish. 
D: Certainly a very, very good Dipa , looking forward to my next can -:) 629 charactersbeerpirates, Nov 20, 2011

A: Heady Topper pours a darky, rusty orange color. Fairly cloudy. A massive, fluffy three finger head erupts from a fairly aggressive pour. The head color is somewhere between eggshell white and cream. Fantastic lacing and head retention. Excellent.
S: Mmmm, pineapple, creamy citrus, and just a faint touch of pine resin. Very balanced and smooth bouquet going on here. Simply bursting with the promise of a massive (yet balanced) hop bomb.
T: Contrary to the smell, I'm getting a prominent pine resin flavor here. Fairly bitter, but not harshly so. I prefer mine a little creamier and citrusier, the finish here is too bitter.
M: Really nice. Flavors are well-balanced. Relatively light carbonation and an ever so slight malt shine. Nicely done. 
O: This is a fine IPA. Well-balanced, hits the right notes, and has a nose that rivals any out there. An overly-bitter finish holds it back, but I wouldn't dissuade anyone from picking this one up. 1,013 characterssiege06nd, Nov 19, 2011

S: Huge nose on this beer. Tons of tropical fruit. Mango,tangerine and peach. One of the best smelling beers ive encountered.
T: Taste is like the nose. Tropical citrus. Fresh, super fresh grapefruit. The Grapefruit shows up on the finish and makes this beer finish extremely dry and bitter.
M: Medium bodied with nice carbonation and extremely dry.
Overall: I was a bit disappointed with Heady Topper. I've heard PTE comparisons and i really didn't get that. I think the main fault with this beer is the bitterness is way over the top. DOn't get me wrong, it's an awesome beer. I just wouldn't put it in my personal top 10 list of IPA's or DIPA's.

No pour here, since I decided to follow the directions on the can and sip straight from it! We’ll skip right to the nose. The aroma is lush with bright smelling hop character, as pine and bitter smelling grapefruit are funneled up the nose. There are some leafy herbal tones and tropical fruit notes here as well, along with some spiciness, and a firm malt sweetness across the back that gives the hops something to bounce off of. This is full and bright feeling in the nose. 
The taste has a fresh feeling vibrancy to it, with a blast of grapefruit and sticky resinous hops. This is tempered on the edges by a ripe and juicy tropical fruitiness and a sweet malt character that almost honestly seems like an afterthought compared to the bulk of this hop onslaught. The finish is dry and piney with some lingering bitter pith that sticks to the tongue. This has quite the aggressive finish on it. The mouthfeel is medium bodied, maybe a little fuller, with a big creamy crispness to it that blows up in the mouth. Some slick and oily textures weave in and out with this, really keeping things overall smooth for 8% ABV. There is some gentle warmth to the body that mostly adds some extra boldness to those hop flavors. 
This is my third different time reviewing this beer and it still holds up even here in packaged form. I still feel that it shows just a tad too much alcohol to really go the full monty on the style for me but there is no doubt that this is a DAMN great DIPA. The fact that this beer is now available in cans is just mind-boggling to me. I see many more of these in my future. 1,705 charactersKegatron, Nov 16, 2011

Smell: sweet malt, slightly piney, fruity, vague pineapple, mango, warm caramel smell
Taste: smooth, slightly piney on the front with a pleasant oiliness. Pineapple, mango, papaya, and slight citrus in the middle. Very pleasant juiciness. Slightly bitter and dry finish. Leaves you wanting more.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied, pleasant mouthfeel with pleasant dryness on the finish. I would prefer a little heavier body, but that is my preference.
Overall: For the style, this beer looks a mess, but it tastes and smells great and I could easily drink several and not realize it. Definitely a beer to check out! 851 characterslaintringulis, Nov 16, 2011

A hazy orange body with a slightly off-white cap. Head rose about a finger and faded rather quickly. Some minor lacing and a thin layer of foam left behind.
Bold tropical fruit nose. Papaya, pineapple, mango and white grapefruit leap out of the glass and attack the nostrils. Oily, resiny hops. A light pale malt backdrop does not detract from all these fantastic hops.
The flavor profile really follows the nose. Huge tropical fruit blend. Sweet papaya, pineapple and mango up front while bitter white grapefruit and pine resin carry through to the finish. The finish is highly bitter and builds with every sip. The beer is brash and in your face. Unrelenting with bursts of flavor and bitterness.
A medium body, smooth and luscious. The hops keep coming in waves and beat down on your palate. The body has a bit more heft than some of the elite.
This is a damn fine DIPA that is scary drinkable. The 8% is unnoticeable. I find this to be on the Mt. Rushmore of DIPA's that I have been able to try. It is not as clean and refined as PtY, but rather brash and in your face. Which, is both good and bad. 1,138 charactersColForbinBC, Nov 16, 2011

4.65/5  rDev 0%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a 16 oz can into a Sierra Nevada hop tulip glass.
A: Pours a very cloudy orange color. 1/4" head, tons of sediment in this beer.
S: Loads of glorious hops. Citrus, a hint of pine, lots of floral accents as well.
T: An outstanding IPA. Waves upon waves of hops in the form of some citrus, lots of floral flavors. Only slightly bitter, mostly in the finish. A tad bit sweet. Fairly well balanced with some pale malt.
M: Medium- full bodied, slightly viscous, average carbonation.
O: A top notch IPA, it lives up to the hype. One of the best I've ever had. 570 characterswilljschmidt, Nov 15, 2011

a: pours bright amber in color with a thick white head that sticks to the sides of the glass for an incredible amount of time. this beer has that perfect "drink me!!" look.
s: ridiculously strong citrus (grapefruit, tangerine) and floral hop aroma. you can smell this beer about a foot away from the glass. it's truly something amazing.
t: lives up to the hype. as promised on the side of the can, "wave after wave of hoppy goodness" overcome my senses. strong flavors of citrus and bitter pine. finishes extremely nicely, alcohol is well hidden. close to perfection.
m: exceptional mouthfeel.
lives up to the hype. better then pliny? yeah, maybe a little but they're both so delicious that i don't even care about that comparison. get this beer if you can! 812 characterstzieser, Nov 15, 2011

pounder can served at cold temperature poured into a snifter.
The beer pours a hazy amber hue with lots of white particle sediment suspended and settling out as The beer rests. Bleached white head of 1 cm that fades to an edge layer and islands fairly quickly. Aroma is robust hop hits with pine sap and grapefruit rind, plus some grassy notes, but dominated by citrus notes.
First sip reveals an average body and silky smooth texture. The carbonation is fine and tingly. 
Flavor is brief caramel and then all hops with grass, pine sap and some citrus notes mixing together nicely creating a complex hop profile not just overassertive bitterness. Very nice hop mix for a tasty and interesting beer, I was slightly doubtful after so much hype, but this beer lived up to the stories told about it. A nice American double IPA. 859 characterssulldaddy, Nov 15, 2011

4.83/5  rDev +3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5A- Thick, creamy looking body and a super sticky head. Long long long lasting retention, beautiful two fingers developed easy from the pour into my glass. Tons of singular bubbles give me the hope of a crisp tall drank. The perfect lacing... its been a long time since I've seen a work of art such as this. This deep amber, almost like a warmed caramel coloration does tons for me. 
S- Tons of tangerine and mango notes. Very very tropical. There is a nice layer in the background of grass. Gentle, grapefruit and a bed of vegetation. Not flowery, but fruity strands of hay. 
T- Big burst of tropical flavors! Its like a creamy extravaganza of Caribbean woman hurtling every kind of fruit they can find into my orifice. I'm hit with pineapple, mango, tangerine, oranges, grapefruit, lemon rind. Repeat experiences hit me with caramels, light biscuit, bitter pine fronds, and something light but mistaken. I can't put my tongue on it but its different, haven't encountered it too often... I think its a guava persimmon hybrid with memories of peaches. Its unreal! 
M- Creamy, super creamy. Thick, almost syrupy. Velvety smooth, crisp openings and crisp pine finish give this the balance it needs for such a big beer. Carbonation definitely doesn't last as long up front as I was led to believe. At 8% you'd have fooled me with a 5.5% tag. Very sticky, layers of soft evaporated beer tickle my peach fuzzed lips and cracks of my mouth.
I've said it many times, Heady Topper sucks big donkey dick. And now I must eat my words. What a nigh on perfect beer. 1,556 charactersKhazadum, Nov 14, 2011

4.9/5  rDev +5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.7516 oz. can. Canned 2 weeks ago.
Partly cloudy, Bright orange gold body. Thick, whipped, fat finger of rocky, dense, light beige head. Great head retention and lacing. Ridiculous hop nose with tons of fresh mangoes, pineapple, kiwi, mandarin orange, grapefruit, pine sap, and even a little resinous funk. Still, the tropical fruit hop aromas dominate and mix nicely with some candyish malt aromas. Heavenly. 
Bitterish hops and toasted malt up front quickly give way to huge tropical fruit hop flavors. Fresh, juicy, luscious mangoes, pineapple, and mandarin orange. Resinous, slightly sappy, oily hop flavors hideout underneath and show up toward the finish. Sweetish, honeyish, fruity malt blends in nicely with the fresh hop wonder wall. Dries out in the finish with lots of lingering tropical fruit hop flavors. Moderately bitter, but mostly just flavorful. Medium-full body with a thickish, chewy feel. Half a case in, and whether straight from the can or poured into a glass this beer just keeps wowing me. World class. 1,026 charactersalexgash, Nov 14, 2011

A: deep orange, hazy with a half inch head that recedes to a mere wisp, score was initially a 3.5, but the second pour from the can produce some hop particles in the beer than made my smile grow even larger
N: like a fresh packet of hops, beautiful, pine, pineapple, mango, georgeousness, one of the best noses ever...right up their with Hopslam and Pliney in this category
T: not quite as instantly impressive as the nose, but has a subtle complexness that grows on each sip, plenty of pine and citrus, bitterness isn't initially apparent, but also builds....
M: medium full for the style, adequate carbonation
O: excellent, doesn't displace Hopslam as the king in my personal hierarchy, but uniformly delicious and obviously elite....seems to be more typical of the NE DIPAs (closer relative to Gandhi-Bot and BIG A than the CA or Midwest versions of the style)...New England is an under-rated producer of delicious hoppy brews and The Heady Topper is Exhibit A
Other Notes: I wasn't a D-bag and did recycle the can. But, I did not drink it straight from the can, call me a traditionalist.
Huge thanks to Matt for the cans. You are truly a beautiful human being. 1,224 charactersmodernartblues, Nov 14, 2011

A- Murky, dark orange with unfiltered yeast. Bright in the light, but the murkiness dulls the color. A 6 oz or so pour gives 2-3 fingers of white head.
S- Very dank hops punch you in the nose. Mango fruitiness upfront with a good amount of pine that fades into the mango seamlessly to make it almost a spicy mango. Really wonderful, with nothing about it to knock.
T- Taste starts off in line with the nose, with fruity hops. Finishes with a punishing pine bitterness. As expected, the hops take center stage, pushing any malt notes deep in the background.
M- Pretty heavy with a big thick hop bite throughout.
O- I gave this 4.5 across the board. Smell could be a bit higher, but I wasn't willing to give it a 5, taste could be slightly lower, but not a 4. This is a damn, damn good beer. 909 charactersfsvan, Nov 13, 2011

Pours a clear honey orange color first followed by all the yeast towards the bottom of the can. The floaties are everywhere! Looks like a gelatin almost. Smells like a tropical Christmas tree - big pine sap, pineapple, mango, and sweet malts. Hop bomb from the get go, but not so bitter, just really delicious citrus hop characters. Not incredibly complex, but just brewed to near perfection. This has to be my favorite DIPA next to Pliny the Elder. If you haven't had it, you've got to get some. 574 charactershoptualBrew, Nov 13, 2011
4.62/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A+ in my book, just a fantastic and well rounded beer.
A: Dark gold/copper almost zero head but what little there is, is white.
S: amazing, pine notes exude, floral hop notes there as well. They almost mask any malt aroma in the beer but what comes through is a biscuity malt aroma.
T: seems like mostly two row in typical APA. I'd say some Munich malt maybe as the taste is all about the hops, if there is some caramel I'd be surprised. But the hop explosion, wow. Blends well with the nose and finishes bitter, but on the right side of the balance. The full body malts mix very well with these pine flavors, just the right amount of grapefruit coming through as well.
M: almost viscous for an ale. Creamy feel and again, blends well with the taste and nose. Makes you want to sip it which is great as the taste profile changes as it warms.
O: a fantastic beer 866 charactersonefmatt, Nov 12, 2011
4.83/5  rDev +3.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Longtime reader first time reviewer, not that I need to. The jury is already in on this beer. As a die hard IPA/DIPA chasing the latest and greatest available to me I just have to say this beer is a double edge sword. This IPA is so fantastic, that if it is not readily available to you and you are a diehard hophead I and others I know would nearly recommend not trying this beer and especially if you do not have more than a couple in your possesion. This beer has nearly ruined many other IPAs and DIPAs for me, I still enjoy them, but this has clearly set the standard. Also, I truly agree, do drink from the can, it is better than in a glass. I look forward to my first from a tap though. Warning over, onto my brief review. This beer bursts with grapefruit, citrus, lemon? white fruit and some very clean pine. Just amazing flavors that seem to change as you go through the can. The malt backbone is right where Ilike it in a beer of this strength. Its subtle but full arriving just before the fruit of the hops set in and leaves just in time for the bitterness to take over and make you want more. I try to limit myself to one of these per session so that it remains so special. As a last note, I do not know what hops are in this beer but I think columbus and cascade are here, for all I know there are many more. 1,321 charactersNHcraftbeer, Nov 11, 2011

3/4 of the can into a Duvel tulip. 1/4 from the can. I actually liked that there was a significant change in the beer's profile glass vs can. Both treatments were very nice. 
I can't believe it's been over two years since the last time I got to drink Heady. This can was a long time coming. Pours a brilliant golden orange with a mad amount of hop floaties (the only part of the beer I wasn't thrilled with). Aroma is out of this world. My favorite kind of red grapefruit juice and tropical fruit candy. Flavor matches the nose in a pretty straight forward but completely complementing way. It's a whole mouth filling fruit forward hop flavor that I really dug. The slightly viscosity of the liquid was very nice in the mouth and carried the flavor well. Overall I'm just thrilled. Good show. 829 characterstubbnik, Nov 11, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks goes to nathanjohnson for the chance to try this beer.
A: I'm drinking this from the can as recommended, but I did drink one last night from my Duvel tulip. Hazy orange in color with lots of floaties from the dry hopping, I guess. Finger or two of white head. Decent amount of lacing and fairly thick film.
S: Big hop smell as you'd expect. Weird to say, but this just smells bitter and juicy at the same time. I get mostly grapefruit and orange citrus with lots of pine and some tropical smells that I have trouble picking apart. Despite all of the hops, the malts are still present..caramel or crystal..maybe both. I don't know. Good stuff either way.
T: Heady Topper is awfully bitter, but the malts do an admirable job of balancing things out and reigning in the hops. Citrus, pine and tropical flavors are all here and enjoyable...pine seems to win out towards the end leaving a resinous aftertaste. Also, when the beer warms, there's a peach like flavor that I like a lot.
M: Can a beer be both creamy and chewy? That doesn't make sense to me, but this seems to have both qualities. Bitter and sticky.
O: I'll be perfectly honest, when I first drank this last night, I was a little let down. Not that I thought it was a bad beer by any means, but it just didn't wow me the way I thought it would. With that said, I'm really liking it tonight. 
I'm not sure if drinking it from the can really makes that big of difference or maybe I was just suffering from seasonal depression last night. At any rate, this is a top notch IPA that's certainly worth seeking out and that I'm glad I got the chance to try. Thanks again Nate. 1,640 characterstitosupertramp, Nov 11, 2011

Tall boy can poured into a wine glass. Appearance is orange, honey with a good sized head. Its` nose has resin, pine, grapefruit and hops. The smell is most certainly an inviting one. Upon sipping this, I taste more of the pine and resin, citrus aspects are still there, along with a good amount of hops. The hops are well balanced and it finishes with a fair amount of bitterness. With everything in mind, this is a great drinking DIPA and gets accolades with reason. 510 charactersmltobin, Nov 10, 2011

4.92/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Despite the declaration on the can to "drink from it" i did half in the can and half in a tulip
Appearance - Good thing i poured half of this to see the beautiful DIPA this thing is, perfectly carbonated, great golden orange/light amber hue, a quintessential DIPA verging on the side of perfect
Smell - Oh good lord, as soon as you crack this one you are assaulted pleasantly with big citrus characters. Grapefruit, Mango and Papaya dominate the nose, more tropical juiciness than typical west coast profiled IPAs but it is different and amazing. Again, i dont get it as much by sniffing right from the can so i am glad i did some of this review out of a glass.
Taste - 5 on the nose, 5 on the taste. Just epic stuff, deserving of the hype. Different than all other DIPA's I've drank in that it is a very tropical juicy flavor profile. The tropicalness is right up front, juicy in the middle and ends with a dry and perfectly bitter/malty finish. You cannot taste 8 percent in this at all. This beer made me so happy to drink. I must admit honestly though that i DID like it more out of the can, it could be totally psychological but hey, whatever this beer was just absolutely incredible in the can and in the glass.
Mouthfeel - Rich, chewy and perfectly carbonated. Coats the mouth with a delicious taste.
Overall - I am not lying when i say this is probably the best DIPA /IPA i have ever drank, it deserves the hype and i think its a great experience to beer geeks a like to test their palate in and out of the can. I can't wait for this beer to be distributed. The east coasts Pliny that i can see in the future giving it a run for its money. 1,652 charactersaorloski, Nov 10, 2011

Aroma: My nose was just assaulted by hops. Citrus, peach, pineapple, papaya, mango and pine.

I've rarely seen a better looking DIPA, smelled a finer flower, nor tasted anything as hoppy and honeyed. I'm not sure what kind of black magic this brewery dabbles in, but this beer is a incantatory balance of hop and malt. It's sweet (but just right), it's hoppy and piney, resin-y, and brilliantly citrus-y. If I ever have an imperial IPA better than this, I might just call it the best I could ever have. I'm serious. 522 charactersJChristopher, Nov 09, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +3.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Poured from 16oz can into an Alchemist pint glass.
Appearance: Beautiful orange body with a two-finger-thick, white head. The lacing on the beer is great. A lot sticks to the glass and there's plenty of it on the top of the beer.
Smell: Hops hit you over the head. In a good way. No, a great way. Citrusy, flloral, and fruity hops are plentiful. You can smell grapefruit easily, followed by mango and papaya. I sense honey and caramel-like notes also. Great aroma, even right from the can.
Taste: Hoppy throughout. There is a slight sweetness at the beginning of the flavor that stretches out into a great hop fest. There is a very, very subtle bitterness in the finish that doesn't linger at all which is exactly what I look for in a DIPA. 
Mouthfeel: Smooth. Drinkability. Tomabilidad. Whatever you want to call it because you can easily down this beer. I'm pacing myself only because I want to enjoy the only can I have. It's fresh, crisp, and light to slightly medium-bodied. When I went to the brewpub in Vermont this past summer, my friends and I easily downed three or four of these. 
Overall: My favorite beer I've ever had. It's the perfect beer. I wish I had started reviewing a few months before so that I could have reviewed the ones I had on tap. Regardless though, this beer is spectacular. The best. 1,319 charactersnmbr0ne, Nov 09, 2011
4.53/5  rDev -2.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5As per suggestion I tried this out of the can "briefly" and yup, knew it wouldn't work for me. Evaluated by pouring straight down the middle very slowly into a nonic pint glass, letting the head settle, then topping up later. At first about 4 oz was only poured in the nonic pint glass, with the can to be evaluated afterwards.
Nice looking can. As for the beer, really exceptional looking slowly decanting the beer punching it through the center of the glass. Head on the bottom forms the most perfect looking microscopic nitro looking bubbles, with the top filled with creamy off white foam. Body color is textbook almost pale amber with great orange hues. Slightly hazy guessing unfiltered but just enough to see through it. Head retention is massive, you couldn't drive a mac truck through this and it hangs for a long time. 
Ripping this open, man the hops just escape. Smelling the can a real dry hop pine sense, and of course my lip hits the bottom and I taste aluminum. However, when pouring about five ounces, the nose brings a giant hop pine which is tolerable and not aggressive. Small malt and tiny sugars, dry hop smelling hops and pine but also a real burnt smelling and sense of smoke. Very unique.
Tasting out of the glass, a surprising turn. Citrus angle hits first of a smooth orange, finish resin pine comes creeping in with a slow calm bitterness. The citrus angle is quite a surprise from the nose. Tasting from the can the beer is more prickly and carbonated, but nowhere as good or enjoyable. Even a second whiff brings... nothing from the can. Aftertaste just lingers on and on and on. Feel is almost creamy matching the head appearance, lightly carbonated, with a good hint of malt balance. There is also no sense of alcohol booze on this whatsoever.
Overall a great example of the style and real enjoyable, too bad my chances of trying this again are going to be slim in this area. Except when I head to Vermont! May not be my ultimate favorite but it is one dam good beer. 2,003 characterssmakawhat, Nov 09, 2011
4.58/5  rDev -1.5%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.516oz cans, love 'em! First beer I've sampled from The Alchemist. Hazy golden yellow/orange pour with a nice creamy white head on top. Lots of hop sediment so be careful on the pour. Aromas are a blast of deep fruity, tropical hops. Such a wonderful, juicy, resinous hop blend that I could easily sit and inhale all night long. I would advise to drink this hoppy treat as fresh as possible.
First sip brings a rush of bright, pungent hops. Huge fruity, tropical flavors with resinous hop oils all over the place. Sweet crisp malts take their rightful place as it flows down with a bitter hop blast. Love that this is unfiltered and unpasteurized. An amazing fresh hop experience that is incredibly tasty!
Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with great carbonation. Medium bodied. This ends up being an extremely drinkable hop monster of a beer. Go ahead and drink this one from the can. Well worth seeking out if you're a hop lover. I'm really happy to have had the opportunity to try this. I have to get to Vermont one day! 1,020 charactersorbitalr0x, Nov 08, 2011

A - Pours slightly hazed amber orange with a small half finger tall white head leaving small wisps of lace down the glass. It does have a little sediment floating around in there.
S - Smells of pungent grassy hops, rich tropical fruits; mostly mango and grapefruit; and some lightly toasted caramel malt. Still quite floral.
T - The taste is fairly similar to the nose. It starts off with a big dose of grassy hops quickly giving way to a mix of tropical fruits and sweet caramel malts. Fairly tropical flavor that is very easy to drink. The finish is a mix of light dryness and hop bitterness, lingering on the pallet for a short period of time.
M - Medium body and flavor with moderately low carbonation. Smooth, hoopy, feel with plenty of hop bitterness lingering through the finish.
O - Very nice IPA. I had no problem finishing my glass and I was left wanting more. The balance of juicy fruit and grassy hops to the slightly sweet malt is very nice. I hope to try this one on-tap some day soon. 1,118 charactersorangesol, Nov 07, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516 oz can. I had the first few sips from the can and then decided to pour this one into a glass to do get a proper score on appearance. I'll drink any future ones right from the can, I promise.
It poured an orange amber color with a thin but sticky white head barely covering the top of the beer. The head faded a little but left some great lacing as it did. 
The aroma is bright and juicy with some notes of peach, pineapple and grapefruit coming out in it. I love the juicy, tropical fruit notes in it. Fantastic hoppy aroma overall.
The taste sows more of the bright, juicy, tropical fruit notes to it up front. Towards the finish some of the bitter, citrus rind and grapefruit flavors start to mix in and linger through the finish. Great range of hoppy flavors to it. 
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with carbonation being moderate. Overall it was a fantastic beer, I loved the bright, juicy hoppiness. It had a great range of flavors to it and was very drinkable. Great beer overall. 992 charactersbillab914, Nov 06, 2011

A: Beautiful can. Great contrast between the brushed aluminum and the black design. Funny text, too. Perfect appearance.
S: The can doesn't quite amplify the aroma like a tulip would, but what scent wafts through the widemouth is pure hops candy. Tropical fruit, citrus, pine, and angel deodorant.
T: Hoppy heaven, plain and simple. Fresh, juicy, intense, delicious, complexly flavorful hops. Fruit, flowers, resin, and a clean finish. Truly delicious in every way.
M: Smooth, velvety carbonation fills out the clean, medium body. Lovely.
O: What a beer. While not quite as perfect an experience as it was on tap (HT was my first perfect 5 review), this can was still one of the greatest hop celebrations my mouth has ever known. If I lived closer to the cannery, I might not drink anything else. This beer is the real deal.
Cheers! 868 characterswoosterbill, Nov 06, 2011

A - Pours a murky yellowish-orange with one finger head that fades quickly.
S - Pine, citrus, melon, sweet tropical fruits.
T - Starts out with a smooth citrus burst followed by some pine and a slightly drying finish.
M - Medium with oily hops coating the entire mouth and tongue.
O - Very, very solid DIPA. Amazing how smooth yet bitter finish this beer delivers. Right up there with fresh PtE but a bit sweeter. 530 characterspigc, Nov 06, 2011

Not one to take orders from a can, I poured it into a NB globe.
A - A great looking burnt orange color. Big, soapy, off-white head slowly dissipates leaving lots of lacing.
S - Wow! Just a huge blast of hops. Not just typical citrus aroma. You get a little of everything. Just when the grapefruit, pineapple, orange rind, and tropical notes fill your nose, some resinous pine floats up behind.
T/M - Much the same as the nose. Seems to touch all the bases. I did get just an inkling of a malt base, but really wasn't looking for or missing it. Seems to be just enough to not make this a mouth-scraper. Medium to full bodied.
O - Flat out delicious! I definitely look forward to having some more of this. 807 charactersbigaltemple, Nov 06, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to mountsnow1010. Cheers!
A careful pour reveals a clear apricot colored body. This beer is definitely unfilter, plenty of sediment and hop resin ready laying on the bottom of the can. A full pour will leave you a cloudy, murky DIPA. Three finger white lacing is set atop. The retention is fairly impressive. As the head recedes, the glass is covered with lacing. 
The aroma is straight up hops. Massive citrus and tropical fruits. Tangerine, orange and pineapples. There is an underlying pine aroma which is fairly subtle but provide a bit of balance. There is a touch of malt which is picked up in the nose. Soft pale malt finds itself buried requiring a bit of searching to find. This may be the best smelling DIPA I have had to date.
I am not certain the flavor live up to the aroma, but that should just speak to how amazing the aroma is. the flavor is all about the citrusy, fruity hops. Tangerine, guava, pineapple and a bit of grapefruit. The fruity hop flavors are bright and assertive. A fair amount of pine and pith develop just behind. The bitterness is just high enough to provide a bit of balance and deliver a little bite.
Medium bodied DIPA. The carbonation is on point for the style. Very smooth and soft texture. The finish is rather dry, slight citrusy flavor left lingering on the tongue.
Heady Topper, this one was a long time coming and did not disappoint. Just as good as any DIPA I have ever had, perhaps the most enjoyable beer I have come across. Flavors is bright and clean. Drinkability is off the charts, there is no sign of the 8% ABV. This is one I will seek out on a regular occasion, would be a daily drinker if I lived close enough. 1,683 characterskzoobrew, Nov 05, 2011
4.64/5  rDev -0.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Surly pint glass. A semi-hazy burnt orange color. Few and far between, large, carbonation bubbles lead to a very small head. As I swirl my glass I get just the smallest hint of, off white colored head. There isn't any lace to speak of.
Smell is fantastic. Green, wet, leafy hops. Citra I believe? Fresh, sweet citrus smells of an orange or pink grapefruit and some pine resin and perfume.
Taste is pretty citrus bitter. Yellow grapefruit in bitterness and orange or tangerine in sweetness. There is also some piney, wet, green, hop cone flavors. I think this is the closest to Abrasive I have tried. Hop Knot and Odell IPA come close, but this is right there. At end there is some alcohol warmness. 
Mouth is smooth, with creamy carbonation. Medium body and a long, wet finish.
Overall I must say that I have really laid into the North Eastern folk for asking the world in trade for this, now, year round offering. It is quite fantastic beer and almost equal to Abrasive, but not worth a bomber of Canadian Breakfast Stout. I received this as an extra from a Midwestern trader. Thanks TIMMYJ21 for not being as stingy as the NE guys. 1,151 charactersazdback, Nov 05, 2011
4.62/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Wow! Big thanks to Adamdc for sending this beer to me in a trade. Sometimes a beers hype is really spot on. This is one of those times. The can says it should be drank from a can. Force of habit finds me pouring this into a Imperial Pint glass.
A- The body of the beer is a peach coloration. Major amounts of sediment floating in the beer. Not really going to knock it for clarity as those floaties tell me its going to taste great. The head of the beer is biege. Resolved to a ring of foam. Nice foamy marks line my glass as this beer rapidly disappears. 
S- The aroma is a hop explosion. Lots of grapefruit and resinous pine to the nose. As the cool kids are saying the hops are really dank. Caramel wafts in the background adding some malt support.
T- Very hop forward. I am being gobsmacked by grapefruit wraped in pine. The biterness is nicely hedged in by tropical fruit notes of pineapple and mango sweetness. Still manages a bitter bite on the back end. 
M- The body of the beer is pretty full nice carbonation levels. No alcohol in the present in mouth. Nicely done.
O- Very well done! Perhaps not a session ale but I could do damage in an evening if this was easily available. 1,191 charactersnlmartin, Nov 05, 2011

4.72/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Heady on tap pours hazy dark gold with an enormous fluffy white head. The retention is excellent and the lacing very sticky and attractive. Huge aroma of hoppy complexity; so much going on in the nose, from citrus (mostly grapefruit and pineapple) to pine to floral notes and traces of very slightly onion-like notes as well.
This is one of the best tasting IPA’s/DIPA’s you’ll encounter. Just as complex as the aroma, with a restrained maltiness that’s only very slightly sweet. Grass, citrus, pine, onion. Drinks more like an IPA than a double, with alcohol nowhere in sight…goes down very easy. It’s bitter but not dominated by bitterness or any other single flavor aspect. You can taste everything. 
Good carbonation and a medium finish with a lingering aftertaste full of complex notes, not just overwhelming bitterness. Everything is very balanced and totally delicious. 890 characterstobelerone, Nov 03, 2011
4.62/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Received in trade from GoGriz.  Poured from 16oz. can into a Stone snifter.  Beer was a clear, orange color, with a one-finger, white head.  Head quickly faded, leaving behind some faint traces of lacing around the glass.  Moderate carbonation. 
Aroma was hops.  Holy citrus hops!  Some pine and sweet malt.  Smells amazing!  
Taste was bitter and hoppy, but not overly so.  Some biscuit and bread notes, along with a touch of caramel sweetness, but bitter hops throughout.  
Slightest warming of alcohol in the finish, followed by a long lingering, delicious, hoppy finish.  
Very tasty beer.  Thanks to GoGriz for the hookup with the fresh cans.  I would definitely recommend and seek out again.  716 charactersdrumrboy22, Nov 03, 2011

Pours a bright gorgeous slightly hazy golden color with minimal head.
(From snifter) Aroma is bright piney citrus hops - juicy, tropical. Taste is sharply bitter & acidic - grapefruit, pine, resin.
(From can) Taste is more tropical, orangey, pineapple than from the glass. Still a sharp piney bitterness on the finish, but mouthfeel is smooother, more juicy.
Overall this is indeed a unique beer. Extremely, dangerously drinkable and clean - I taste no alcohol at all. Tastes basically like grapefruit juice, feels a bit like getting your mouth scoured out by pure hop extract. This is as close to hop mouthwash as I ever want to go - but in a good way. 881 charactersdraheim, Nov 02, 2011

A: This beer pours a hazy, rudy amber brown color with tons of floating sediment. A 1/4 inch of khaki head that recedes immediately.
S: Nose is tons of pine and orange peel with a mild undertone of caramel malt.
T: Taste is pine upfront with slightly bready malt. Mild caramel malts make their way in with a bit of fruitiness. Big notes of orange peel come through and the finish is pure grapefruit.
M: Medium body, medium carbonation, pretty dry bodied at first with a sticky finish. 
O: Goes down easy, very tasty, not too filling, well hidden kick, great representation of style. I highly enjoyed this beer and look forward to trying more from this brewery. 713 charactersJayli, Nov 02, 2011

Nice tropical flavors with pineapple, mango, grapefruit, caramel malt, and a little citrus zest. Both sweet and bitter at the same time, with the caramel malt backbone keeping the bitterness a little bit in check. Classic style DIPA flavor.

Clear golden and orange except for huge bits of floating sediment throughout. Nice, persistent, off-white head and lots of lace left down the glass.
Wonderful aroma, and my favorite aspect of this beer. Huge floral and citrus hops balanced nicely with a touch of bready malt character. Very nice.
Medium to high bitterness, lots of floral and citrus hops, a bit of bready balance, and very little alcohol heat.

S: The aroma contains a lot nicely blended of floral hops, fruity citrus and caramelized malts.
T: The taste starts out with a very strong grassy hops bitterness along with a big fruity citrus sweetness. The malt character is hearty but not too heavy and creates an excellent balance. The after-taste is hoppy and slightly sweet.
M: Very crisp and very smooth, medium body, medium carbonation, finish is slightly sticky.
D: Very tasty, goes down quite easily, not too filling, good kick, very good representation of style, this beer is exactly what you look for in a 2IPA and is worth drinking for a whole evening. 789 charactersTheManiacalOne, Oct 30, 2011

4.94/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 516 oz can thanks to Michael.
Since The Alchemist has so emphatically instructed me to drink from the can, I gave it a try. It felt kind of weird drinking such a potent beer from the can so I poured some into my Bell's tulip and I'll review from that.
The pour is a hazy deep burnt orange with a thin tannish head. 
The aroma, from the moment you crack the can open, is an inviting bouquet of pine and citrus. It's a nearly perfect balance of pine and citrus with a nice resiny feel to it. 
The taste is intensely piney with some sweet citrus in the finish. The bitterness is just north of assertive but well short of overpowering. I did find it interesting that the flavor did seem a little more intense straight from the can. 
The mouthfeel is fairly thick and sticky and the carbonation level is moderate, right where it should be for this kind of beer. Overall, this is really a spectacular DIPA and is deserving of it's lofty reputation. 946 characters321jeff, Oct 29, 2011

16 oz
2011
Thanks to Kzoobrew for this one.
App- A really good crisp orange with a good amount of clairity. A nice head was formed and left a touch of cling on even a taster glass.
Smell- A great bit of pine, guava and orange in the glass. A little bitter with some hop oils.
Taste- This was a very good DIPA. More of a mallt presence than I thought would present itself. It has a good bit of citrus behind it and was very crisp with a refreshing bite behind it. Still felt a bit awkward drinking such a choice beer out of a can but oh well.
Mouth- A medium bodied DIPA all the way with a paired medium/high carbonation level. Good citrus with a small malt backbone residual flavor. Nice tropical flavors with only a touch of earth.
Drink- Kevin, I can't say enough about this beer. Thank you so much for having an extra for me. I would love to have more of this beer for sure. 932 charactersFosterJM, Oct 29, 2011

A: this is exactly how I like my dipa's to look. Cloudy deep orange color. Nice size head and great retention.
A: Again pretty much spot on for the nose as well. Great piney hops, with notes of grapefruit, sweet caramel malt, and pine sap.
T: Taste follows the nose well. More notes of bitter grapefruit, pine sap, caramel, and other citrus fruit. The distinct flavor of simcoe hops are prevalent. The beer finishes dry and very bitter, just like it should.
M: Pretty heavy, but not unexpected. Perfect levels of carbonation.
O: This is an outstanding beer. Great nose, great flavor, and great balance. Right on par with Hopslam as the best dipa's I've had. I am very fortunate to have a couple more cans.Excellent! Skal. 844 charactersGtreid, Oct 29, 2011

Immediately the smell is a citrus bomb. This beer combines so many great citrus notes. It is as if the fruit is from some hybrid tree that only grows in Vermont. I would say the grapefruit is the star though. Crisp taste with some tangy bites. Very fresh hop notes. The mouth feel is almost as impressive as the taste. This is almost described as creamy to my palate. Overall this is the best IPA I have tasted. 526 characterscbwufpack, Oct 28, 2011

4.92/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Drank directly from the can, as the can itself instructed me to do. The hoppy goodness literally filled the room. I could smell the can from several feet away, beckoning me to come take a sip. I pulled it right from my fridge so I gave it about five minutes before I took my first sip after opening. Probably five of the most grueling minutes of anticipation in my life. There is obviously a lot of hype around this beer so I knew I was in for a treat. 
The smell if floral and hoppy. There are citrus notes, a bit of grapefruit and something else that reminded me of sticking my tongue across a nine volt battery. I don't think metallic is appropriate, maybe electrifying? It was pleasant and fresh. 
The taste of this beer is god nectar. It's a wonderful beer that is so balanced between bitterness and refreshing. There are flavors I haven't experienced in any beer. It's complex. I pull the citrus immediately and just a touch of booziness comes across the palate with the initial swill. The booze quickly dissipates and hops take over. I couldn't tell you what hops are used, why they are used, or what characteristics they impart on this beer but I can tell you that the mix is right and this beer is delicious. I want more of them and I want them now. The best way to describe this beer is fresh and unique. Maybe I got caught up in the hype machine a bit one this one but I think it's easily surpased to my expectations. 1,430 charactersrobboyd, Oct 27, 2011

Tastes of that same tobacco. Some hop bitterness bleeds into it to give it a double ipa edge. 
Mouthfeel is very fizzy in a pleasant way. It has a thickness that's pleasing.

T - Right up front, extremely bitter. All the IBUs come right at you from the get-go and it fades to let the more subtle flavors come through. The sweet malts first, then the pine hops, followed by a quick citrus taste and right back to the caramel.
M - Medium boded, good carbonation, slightly sticky, slightly drying finish. Sweet malts coat the mouth while the bitterness sticks to that.
O - I'm not sure how I would rate it in comparison to having it on-tap, but still very good. Nice flows with the flavors, nice balance overall. 874 charactersGarrettMD, Oct 27, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Just here to say that this thing is definitely worth the hype it always recieved and I am thrilled that they took the leap to start packaging it (cans...awesome!) and thus making it available to everyone.
Pours a dark orange color with a solid white head, good retention...not sure how I ended up with so many floaties in this thing; doesn't bother me though.
The aroma; killer. Tons of tropical fruit passion fruit, mango, definitely some citrus in there as well.
Upfront, the taste is the same; tropical all day with undertones of lemon grass, candied orange, and more tropical fruitiness!
Finishes with a clean piney bitterness and a solid caramel back to round it out
Overall; I absolutely love this beer, will be seeking more of it out and can't wait until they start distributing in states that I visit ofter. This is definitely everything that it was said to be, if not more and is the East Coast's answer to Pliny/Sculpin! 935 characterspixieskid, Oct 26, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.51 pint tall can poured into a fantome tulip glass.  I, too, could not bring myself to drink straight out of the can, but I have another one that I will give it a whirl with.
A: Pours a hazy, darker copper color with a two finger off-white head that rises quickly from a violent pour and settles slowly and gently to almost nothing but a thin ring.  Heavy, frothy lacing is left behind on the glass.
S: Delicious red grapefruit, tangerine, and orange rind right up front.  Very nice pine resin and resiny and floral hops along with a touch of sweet caramel are a little more subtle but quite present.  There's a very, very slight hint of a grassiness that hides in the background, that offers just a bit more complexity to the aroma.  Really nicely balanced between resiny bitterness and sweetness. 
T: Juicy and fruity up front with some plenty of citrus fruits bursting out of the glass.  The orange and tangerine are a little more prominent in the flavor, with the grapefruit making itself known, but taking backstage.  The pine resin and hops compete with the fruitiness, but can't quite put up a fight.  There is a subtle sweetness that sneaks in here and there that manifests itself in the form of caramel, which is a great dimension that isn't overly sweet.  The finish is comprised of floral hops, a touch of orange zest, and a slight grassiness.  Delicious!
M: Medium bodied with moderate carbonation and slightly sticky on the tongue.  Starts out mostly sweet with juicy citrus fruits and then transitions to a slightly bitter finish.  Really well balanced, though, without an overwhelming quality on either end.  Just a little drying at the finish. 
D: This is a really, really tasty and really well balanced DIPA.  Like the can says, it's not the most hoppy, but it's really tasty and really well balanced.  A real treat to get to try this and one that can stand up to some of the best from out west.  I look forward to getting a few more cans down the road. 1,992 charactersMississipping, Oct 26, 2011

Can states "Drink from the can!" Poured half of the can into a Bruery snifter, and drank the other half from the can...
A - Pours a golden orange with a one finger head that dissipates at a fairly decent pace. There is a little slippery lace to be had...
S - Alot going on here. Grapefruit, apricot, peach, orange, a little pine, and some malt sweetness. Scent is very inticing...
T - Sweet malts up front followed by a good blast of citrus. Grapefruit, orange, and apricot. Ends with some pine, lingering grapefruit, and a little caramel. Very well balanced...
M - Very smooth. On the lighter side of being medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation, and a dry finish...
O - Smooth and tasty. Could easily put a few of these back in a sitting. Definitely something i'm going to be looking to try again...

4.64/5  rDev -0.2%look: 1 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Although the can warns it will be hazy, it is way beyond that: murky and dirty looking with plenty of floaties and barely any head in spite of a very vigorous pour, Heady Topper does look BAD.
 Fortunately appearance is the only unimpressive aspect of this beer. Smells dank and piney, with a freshness I have not encountered in any other DIPA. Some citrus-y fruitiness comes along later but this beer is seriously green, in the manner I like. Ok, finally some onion makes me reluctantly take half a point off.
 And the taste is something to die for, and kill: an IPA can only get so much bitter without getting unpleasant, and Heady manages to stay very very pleasant. Fruity without the sweetness (!), and almost like chewing on pine needles and rind with a bone dry finish and long lingering bitterness. This is the perfect Double IPA. I don't like to make "Pliny killer" statements but I can safely say that this can is better than the bottle of Pliny I reviewed, and I gave that one a 5 on taste... so is this a 5.5 or what?!
 Ah, Heady Topper is just what I need in my IPAs --- low alcohol (for a DIPA), clean and crisp character, mind blowing hoppiness, and palate killing bitterness. Looks aside, Heady is the perfect DIPA and the perfect beer.
 So glad to have tried it, and I will trade for it again and again and again. In past I have been let down by IPAs I have traded for but this?! A-W-E-S-O-M-E. Thanks Dave!

Taste and smell are pretty much the same. Wonderful floral and piney hops. Enjoyable but not overwhelming bitterness. Kinda reminds me of one of my favorites: Sculpin. Medium carbination works perfectly. Can't ask for much more.
 I wouldn't mind drinking this a little more often. Near the top of the IPA food chain. Its a great feeling when hype delivers! 445 charactersIdrinkGas, Oct 25, 2011

S: If this smell eminated from my apartment the DEA would show up with cuffs. It is some dank shit. Tons of resiny hops and a good bit of sweetness.
T: Tastes like it smells. The natural thing to compare this to is Pliny. It is sweeter and more resiny than Pliny but on the same level for sure. 
M: Thick and resiny. It sits heavy but leaves light. It is probably a bit heavier than I would like but definitely acceptable.
D: It's 8% so it's not exactly an all day drinker. That said, I would drink it all day if I could. 687 charactersdrseamus, Oct 24, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Big thanks to n2185 for the can. Canned 11 October 2011, from what I hear. Enjoyed 21 October 2011, reviewed from notes. I followed the instructions on the can and tried it before I poured it - delicious, and as described, more of the hop aromatics still in the flavor.
Pours a hazy deep amber with a yellowish tone. One-finger whitish head, great retention and lacing.
Smells fantastic. Hops, hops, and more hops. Starts out with potent resiny pine, then kicks up the citrus with some grapefruit. Layers of fantastic smells just keep coming. Wow.
Taste is not quite on the level of the smell, but really really good. Hops come heavy, with sticky pine as the most prominent piece. The bitterness is strong, a little more than I'd like, though it doesn't take much away from the beer. Supported well by a nice malt base, but this one is all about the hops. Note: I let it warm up some, and it became a very different beer - less bitterness, smoother, and still quite delicious.
Mouthfeel is good. Medium-bodied, sugary IPA stickiness, medium-high carbonation. A tingly bite from the bubbles and the hops. Finish is long, straight, and true.
This is a darn good beer. Heavy on the hops, but dominated by what I call the positive hop characteristics - pine, citrus, and floral. Up there with Surly Abrasive as one of my favorite DIPAs. Really freaking good all around, and probably the best example I've encountered for showcasing pine hops on top of a bed of others. 1,469 characterszeledonia, Oct 24, 2011

4.52/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5The silo can opens with a satisfying crack; almost immediately, massive hop aromas begin to make their way through the mouth. As directed, I take sips directly from the can.
Wow this beer is good. What I really enjoy about it is that it is exactly as it is advertised on the can - it's not the biggest or most bitter IIPA in America, what it is, however is the purest, most honest expression of hops in a beer (that I've ever had).
I can literally taste the extremely high concentration of hops with every drink. I feel the resin sticking to my tongue and I almost feel as though I'm chewing on a bud (of hops). This dense feeling lingers in my mouth for quite some time, but with only the slightest amount of bitterness accompanying it. My only complaint is an ever so slight metallic taste that accompanies the long lasting finish.
It's amazing how drinkable this beer is being 8% abv. I feel like I could easily throw back a sixer of these (probably a bad idea).
This is perfect camping/skiing beer, I wish I could get it regularly. I poor a small amount into my half-pint glass just to study the appearance, but quickly decide that the brewer is right, this beer is meant to be enjoyed out of the can... 1,211 charactersjIsh, Oct 23, 2011

Smelled of big-n-juicy hops, tropical fruits and resinous pine. Very floral and fragrant. Taste was malty sweet up front, with much of the same fruity notes found in the nose. Body was medium+, with a soft but adequate amount carbonation and a dry finish. Overall a tasty East Cast DIPA. 489 characterssurlytheduff, Oct 23, 2011

No can dating.
The inscription implores "DRINK FROM THE CAN!".
Started that way, then realized I would not be able to comment on the appearance-Duh!.
Golden-orange, clear elixir poured into SA glass. Thin, white head, quickly dissipates. Nice lacing.
From the can, huge hop resin and floral notes--heaven to this hophead. After the pour, grapefruit, lime, sweet and tangy fruit explode. Wow.
This is all about the hop. Full bittersweet hop all over the tongue, smooths out to leave a nice tingling sensation across the landscape. Grapefruit to lemon aftertaste but the sweet hops do not die! Awesome!
Medium body, plenty of bubbles, alcohol hidden (cannot believe 8%).
This is a keeper and one that all hopheads should seek. The standard for DIPAs. Now you can argue that Hopslam is sweeter, but really, for those that crave the hops and all of its glorious characteristics, this is the one. And in a can. The debate is dead. 992 charactersCaptCleveland, Oct 23, 2011
4.59/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5A massive "thank you" to optimator13 for this 16 ounce can from my "Want" list. Archaic date code reads "1 07 20A2 B B" though I'm at a loss for how to accurately convert that to a canning date. Ignoring the "drink from the can" instructions near the lip, this one is poured into a Deschutes tulip glass...
The copper/orange/brown body pours much darker than anticipated, and is perhaps as dark as a DIPA can get before it begs consideration as something else. White unfiltered particles give the appearance of a colloid, and when observing closely, the body does appear to have a gel-like nature because of these particles. About an inch of off-white, foamy, bubbly head develops but subsides quickly to a ring and patches of bubbles. Legs of wet, gooey lacing cling to the glass. 
The aroma is phenomenal, consisting of grapefruit, mango, orange, lemon, and a host of other citrus fruits all masterfully balanced with a piney, earthen, resinous hop character. Some grasses, hay, and a touch of malt round out the nose beautifully. It tastes of spicy, earthen hops in the front, followed by pine, grass, loads of citrus (grapefruit, orange, mango, lemon) in the middle. The rear brings the bitterness of the hops and a glimpse of caramel from the malt. Very well done here. 
Mouthfeel is crisp through and through, the carbonation dancing off the tongue, and finishes a touch dry, leaving one wanting for another sip. Overall, a phenomenal DIPA that is truly deserving of its “world-class” status. Do not hesitate to seek out this one if given the opportunity. 1,568 characterseclipse54, Oct 23, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4A chilled can is poured into a mini pint glass (the can advises to drink it right from the can, so I'm pouring out a reviewable amount and will drink the rest sans glassware).
Golden orange liquid contains many clinging bubbles with a pure white foamy head on top. The body is translucent and has a little bit of rising carbonation. Swirling the glass leaves a foamy slick on the walls of the glass.
Hop oils can be smelled as soon as you begin pouring the beer. Closer inspection reveals a wealth of grapefruit and some pine hops. It's all very bitter and oily.
Initially, the beer is slightly sweet with good crystal malts. Then the hops come in. Big crunchy bitterness is everywhere. There is some orange citrus and some more earthy flavors as well. Warm bitterness lingers.
This is a fuller bodied beer. Carbonation and hop oils tingle my tongue a lot. A decent coating is left behind; it isn't overly slick and packs plenty of flavor. This beer feels good.
This is a good quality DIPA from a fine brewery. While the pub is being reconstructed, this is the only way to have their beers. If you have a chance to pick some up while in Vermont, you should, but I'd also suggest seeking out some Hill Farmstead Galaxy, another great DIPA from the region (of course, HF doesn't come in a convenient can form, so stock up on Heady to bring home). 1,349 charactersToasterChef, Oct 23, 2011

S: Grapefruits and resin with a light flower back note. Nice caramel malts and some solid breadiness as well.
T: The taste is more of the same. Nice flowery notes pop up, some candied sugar and some biscuit malt with a little toffee as well. Solid grapefruit with a little citrus pop to round it all out. There is some solid bitterness on the finish with a hint of pine needle.
M: Nicely carbonated with a nice medium to light body. Leaves a nice floral and fruit taste across the palate. Very drinkable.

4.16/5  rDev -10.5%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Received as an extra from mkabull, thanks Alec!
Poured the beer into a large tulip glass ignoring the odd explanation on the can. This beer has a pillowy, off white head three fingers high. It's a murky amber color with lots of bits of what look like yeast and pellatized hops. 
The aroma is the best part of this beer. Sweet but intensely hoppy. Tropical fruits and sweet malt are in perfect harmony. The aroma is relentless. 
The flavor is just about what you'd expect after the appearance and aroma. VERY sweet initially then a flash of hop flavor and a TON of bitterness. The finish is much drier than I expected with that much sweetness. Lingering bitterness hangs around for quite a while but makes the next sip all that much sweeter. 
There are very few ipas out there that carry this much sweetness and this much bitterness. I don't want to call this beer balanced though. It's incredibly sweet but incredibly bitter at the same time. The drinkability is off the charts. Mouthfeel is medium to full. Heavy, creamy, and thick. 
Overall very enjoyable, Cheers to a great trader sending great extras. 1,110 charactersBrew33, Oct 20, 2011
4.82/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This was a trade from Cheezy Blaster, where he shared the best New England has to offer, and I sent along some of Northeast Ohio's best brews. This beer was among the batch, all of which came through unharmed and ready to drink!
This comes in a 16 oz silver can featuring a professorial-looking dude sippin a brew with a cloud of hops lingering around his head. The labelling exhorts you to "Drink from the Can!" I, however, wanted to see what I was drinking, so I poured this into a tulip glass.
Pours a hazy mango-orange color, with a decent amount of sediment suspension floating throughout. A sticky three finger off-white head presents upon pouring, and it ever-so-slowly reduces leaving a fair amount of sticky foam down the sides.
Has an intense, floral aroma, with tons of citrus, white grapefruit, pine boughs, mandarin oranges, and nectarines. While there is evident malt from the appearance, you wouldn't know it to smell it.
Taste is simply epic. The malt, while hidden in the nose, is evident in the taste, giving this brew a solid malt backbone. Bitter and hoppy up-front, with grapefruit pith, resin, and oaky herbal tastes combining to form a hopsplosion of flavor. Though strong, the flavor is not overpowering, and it is amazing what little aftertaste is left behind. 
This ale leaves the toungue and gums tingling. It is my understanding that at a certain point, beers with a high IBU begin to express that extreme bitterness with the onset of tingling and numbness; this ale is getting me to that point! 
Overall, just a fantastic beer. Piney and hoppy with plenty of up-front bitterness, without the lingering dryness you'll get from a west-coast style DIPA. Moreover, while there's an evident abundance of malt, it is not so sweet as to completely kill the spiciness of the hops. What a well balanced brew from The Alchemist! 1,853 charactersTheHoppiest, Oct 20, 2011
4.59/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Drinking about half the can out of a small snifter, the rest from the can.
Golden and somewhat hazy in the snifter. Not much in the way of head or lacing.
Smell is detectable as soon as you crack the can open. Sweet and resinous citrus peel, pine sap and pineapple notes. A grassy aroma that reminds me of dried hop pellets also noticeable, especially from the can.
Taste is a blast of slightly sweet hop flavor. Pine and citrus all over the place, tropical fruit notes, a lot of sticky, prickly resin. I think I get some cracker-y malt in the finish, but it certainly can't rival the hop flavor. Not overwhelmingly bitter or intense. I'm always impressed with how smooth this tastes.
Mouthfeel is medium, smooth and not very carbonated. It's the perfect amount of carbonation from the can, but when poured into the glass, it lacks a bit in carbonation.
I've thought this was the best IPA made on the East Coast I've had when I first had it at the brewpub a year ago, and now that its in cans I still feel that way. Really glad I bought a whole case at the cannery. I also was surprised to find that it's a bit better out of the can. 1,138 charactersmusicforairports, Oct 20, 2011

a - can is shiny. cracked it and filled my capt lawrence taster tulip. poured a deep but semi transparent honey orange brown with a finger of frothy off white ipa head that hung out for a while. visible carbonation. slightly sticky lacing. very attractive and to style.
s - a very nice burst of hop. great sweetness. not over the top at all. just pleasant. pretty resiny and somewhat sweaty. smelling from the can (as suggested by the can) has a very similar smell but a bit more citric concentrated and definitely more metallic (think i'm actually smelling that can itself).
t - wow. very nice. as suggested on the can, not an all out assault of hops, but rather a nice thick hop with good balance. definitely more resiny in the taste than the smell. took a couple of swills from the can and the hop concentration is definitely more significant and in your face. it also finishes much more bitter from the can.
m - alive. lots of carbonation, great tingle in my mouth. medium bodied with a refreshing finish and thick bitterness.
o - overall, a winner. wish this was readily available to me. would love to try it as fresh as it can get. quite nice from the can or the glass and one that i'd happily swig from the can. 1,341 characterscosmicevan, Oct 20, 2011

Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of pine, resin, and a slight bit of citrus and dankness. Taste is mildly sweet bready biscuity malt being assassinated by an onslaught of hops. Medium to thin body and level of carbonation, resinous bitter mouthfeel. There is a bitterness finish, but it is pleasant, aromatic and not harsh at all. Tried this out of a can, but ended up too dangerously drinkable that way. 589 charactersCuriousMonk, Oct 19, 2011
4.31/5  rDev -7.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.516oz can poured to a Duvel Tulip.
Very aggressive pour yields a 1” white head. Ok retention and some webs of lacing. Very cloudy medium amber with a hint of orange when held to light. 
Way too cold when a first poured it but as it warms the nose greatly improves. Quite complex and stronger as it warms: tropical up front, mango and slight pineapple, with a big juicy hop presence and slight pine and malt. Taste doesn’t quite live up to the nose. Grapefruit makes an appearance here along with the mango pineapple and big juicy hops but the bitterness is just not really balanced here it builds and builds and really hurts the aftertaste and mouthfeel but is still pretty good. Low carbonation, medium bodied and creamy. 
Overall, this is still an elite DIPA but having this right after Bad Boy did not help its case. Medium drinkability with the odd aftertaste but still up there near the top of the DIPA mountain. 923 charactersLSUPT, Oct 19, 2011

M: Is a light bodied beer, 
O: a very pleaseant beer, i loved the aromatic components of this beer there is so much going on at different temperatures of this drink. the hop presence is there but not in the taste did not give me the hop bite that im used to in most ipas, would have given this a higher rating if this quality was present. overall a great beer would purchase this quite often if it was available in So Cal 1,065 charactersxraided81, Oct 19, 2011

The harsh hop hit does not outlast the finish, leaving you with delicate grapefruit notes at the end of this perfection. Not overhyped. 401 characterschalsk, Oct 19, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Jnorton00 for this brew. It's better than Pliny (the Elder), but I'm not quite sure if it's Dreadnaught status (my gold standard). However, given it's abv, it's remarkable. The quintessential camping beer (and yes, the can contributes to this moniker). Everything you want and nothing you don't. Better price point and more convenient than Dreadnaught; just can't decide if it's as good or better. I guess it'll take another night of "research" to come to a conclusion :)
Update: After a 1 for 1 comparison the next day, this beer edges Dreadnaught. And for the value, it blows it out of the water. 609 charactersb3shine, Oct 19, 2011
4.56/5  rDev -1.9%look: 3 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A. Kinda ugly, watery deep yellow. Decent 3cm white head tho. Minor lacing. Nice silver can, which tells you to drink it from the can - I did not. Maybe another time. No canned on date that I can see - how lame. Get with the program, Alchemist, and don't advertise "drink this beer immediatly" and then neglect to tell us just how old it is. 
S. Huge citrus, East-Coast style nose... Moylan's Hopsickle, Boy King. Citra. Deep fruit notes, mango, some phenols, pepper... mandarin orange, touch of booze. Lots of sweetness that's pretty well hid back behind the greenery. Spicy in places. Bold and fun.
T. Hmm... Very nice work here, Alchemist. This is a large East-Coast style DIPA; one that has the malt and hops joining hands and walking together in harmony, rather than being a pine-sap bitter wallop like a lot of its West Coast brethern are. Thickish body, too, which is fun and helps carry the hop-load. 
Plenty of malt sweetness to go around here, but it frankly is tough to tease out exactly what behind the grapefruit, papya, mango, lemon-citrus flavor. There is a high-minded juniper note going on here that is welcome, and ultimately a softer bitter finish that is quite welcome and fades out along with the stalwart malt. Well balanced stuff, I think. 8% is just right, frankly I wouldn't up the booze any more as this is fine as-is.
M / O. Full-on all the way across the sky body, excellent softer, substantial carbonation. Slightly dry in the finish, long fade-to-silence flavor. Topper is quite easy to drink, which is as-advertised. 
Frankly, there really isn't much to dislike with Heady Topper. When my biggest gripe is for the brewery to put a born-on date stamp on their can... they must be onto something. This isn't the absolute best DIPA I've had, nor the biggest, or booziest, or weirdest... but it is certainly one of the most balanced and, for what it is, flawless. Sigh... guess I gotta get more. 1,926 characterskkipple, Oct 19, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.75I was so excited when I got the cans a few weeks ago, I completely forgot to review the damn beer. Anyways, I know it's awesome, and esp in a tall boy can! Tasty crack cans!
Pours a nice fluffy 1 finger head that fades at a med pace with some soapy lacing, over hazy golden orange-red nectar colored beer. 
Nose explodes with fresh hops, plenty of fresh squeezed grapefruit, over ripe musty orange as its freshly sliced into and spraying mist ala the opening credits for Dexter, tropical fruit like papaya, mango, tangerine, and even passion fruit, with the slightest hint of fresh musty hop aroma. There is also a slight malt in there somewhere, hidden way behind the gushing hops. Very late as it warms, a bit of a candy earthy hop kick tries to poke it's head out but gets quickly knocked back down by another wave of tropical fruit.
Now comes the taste, yay! Juicy fruit, it's like mounds of tropical fruit was compressed into 1/10 the original size and 10x the fruit concentrate and ground into a liquid, then carbonated and you have this beer. The tropical fruit comes out and runs amok, lots of mango, tangerine galore, papaya, passion fruit, grapefruit, pineapple, it has it all. Also some citrus playing with the other hops, some musty orange rind and again fresh squeezed orange juice blended with pink grapefruit. The taste brings more of the fresh musty resinous hop flavor, must have added some nice dry hops. The hops are so juicy it literally is like drinking tropical fruit juice. Finally some malts weigh in, giving a nice rounded body and big mouth fell. Malts bring a slight sweetness and touch of booze to help balance the huge hop blast. the bitterness is decent at first, and ramps on the finish as it dries. It plays with your tongue, teasing on bitterness and tickle of almost astringency but before it gets there it leaves like a balk by a pitcher. A slight musty hop flavor lingers with all the tropical fruit and citrus orange rind that never wants to fade, but at the same time clean finish. It seriously lingers in my mouth for about 10 minutes after I finish (and it was hard not to crack another can in that 10 minutes). Damn, even the burps taste awesome.
Mouth is a bit heavier bodied, full bodied, decent carbonation, slightest hint of booze warmth.
Overall just friggen awesome. So far the best IPA on this side of the Mississippi, and probably best I've every had. So full of awesome hops, tropical fruits of all shapes and sizes, citrus orange rind, a bit of musty resinous hop, and all that with a nice big malty balance that takes the way back seat and still lets the hops take the show. A nice dry and clean finish that lingers forever. All that and it comes in a can, I mean who doesn't like it in the can. If I could get this all the time... 2,788 charactersjlindros, Oct 19, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Tasty brew and my first form The Alchemist. 
Poured out of the can for one tasting and left in the can for the other. I preferred in the can, probably why the brewery recommends this.
A: 2 fingered, soapy, slightly off white head that exhibited good retention. Murky orange body with a deep orange core. 
S: Wow, those hops are strong. Lots of floral, pine, grapefruit, lemon, and grassy notes. Sweet malts were also evident. I usually can't identify so many different smells!
T: Quite hoppy, with loads of grapefruit. Not as sweet as the smell led me to believe. However, the rest of the scents were evident in the tasting and were well balanced. Delicious.
M: Medium light, crisp yet silky.
O: A great brew, what else can I say. 736 characterstjkinate, Oct 18, 2011

A - Good looking can.
S - Upon cracking you get an intense burst of hops! A few people who had been standing nearby could even smell the floral bouquet from this one. Very prominent pine and citrus notes, smells like hoppy fruit punch.
T - Not as bitter as I thought it was going to be based on the nose. Loads of tropical and citrus fruits...pineapple, mango, papaya and grapefruit. Very balanced with a strong malt base. This is a hop-heads dream...wave after wave of resiny flavors wash over your tongue from start to finish.
M - Medium bodied and sticky. Light carbonation. Hop flavors definitely linger.
O - A top notch DIPA. Really glad I've got three more of these in my fridge. Definitely seek this one out. 866 charactersJefe73, Oct 18, 2011
4.02/5  rDev -13.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Gift from a buddy up north. Not inlaws, indigestion, or even nagging children could deter him from personally delivering the goods. Good man.
Poured into a Rave Vos Tumbler. Solid inch of stiff, off-white head. Hazed, light orange/amber body.
Smells fresh. Haven't had a fresh beer in a while. Soft citrus rind, muddled leaves, & a splash of orange juice. Aerosol. Not tropical, just green.
Taste is a satisfying one two of citrus & really dry cracker-like malt. Leafy/herbal/rind bitterness is big, but not as big as the fruit. Green Peppers? Very dry middle on in. Bitter aspirin & grain finish.
Carbonation is soft, but active; foamy. Unfiltered of course. Alcohol doesn't hide.
Very solid & refreshing. Bonus points for being fresh. 741 charactersPEBKAC, Oct 18, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to Beefy for this can. 
A: Pours a slightly hazy orange color with a two finger white head. Very foamy with good retention and sticky lacing all around the glass. 
S: Very fresh. Lots of citrus and tropical fruits - some pineapple, grapefruit, and lots of grassy hops. Some lemon and a little bit of orange pith/zest. There is a little bit of pale malt, but the hops dominate, as they should. 
T: Fantastic. Heavy tropical fruit flavors with some grapefruit, mango, and a bit of tangerine. A little more zest/pith going on as well. Very faint pale malts give it a slight backbone. Very tasty.
M: Medium bodied with medium carbonation. Great level of bitterness, spot on. Drinks very easy and extremely smooth. Scary drinkable in fact. No sign of 8% whatsoever. 
O: Lives up to the hype surrounding it. Could drink this beer all day everyday. 857 charactersmdaschaf, Oct 18, 2011
4.69/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Day old can picked up at the new cannery. Despite the advice of the can, poured into a nonic. 
An aromatic wave of dank pine and citrus hops emerge immediately upon cracking the can open. Pours a fairly dark, dull copper/orange. Cloudy and thick with a thick cream colored head. Clumpy streaks of lacing and a thin retentive layer of bubbles throughout. Sweet, juicy, ripe aroma of grapefruit and pineapple, with grass, pine and citrus rind balancing out the profile. Thicker side of medium body, chewy and oily on the palate with a resiny and pulpy finish. Strong bready malt body hides underneath the rich, fresh, intense hop flavor. Much more resiny and pulpy than the aroma, grapefruit and pine flavors dominate. Finish is dry and remarkably smooth. Just about perfect, this is a miracle in a readily available can. 820 charactersyourefragile, Oct 16, 2011
4.39/5  rDev -5.6%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Picked up a four-pack of this last weekend after the bottle release at the Alchemist pub.
Poured from a pint can into my Alchemist glass.
Appearance: Hazy and unfiltered orange (almost copper body). Looks pulpy. Foam is thick and retention is good.
Smell: I can smell it as i pour. Mango, grapefruit a bit as well as pineapple. Juicy, not really bitter but all fruit. Peach slices as well. Heady and never lets up.
Taste: Like eating fruit. Plump orange, mango and some grapefruit. A bit of cedar lurking around. While really good, not as good as aroma.
Mouthfeel: Extremely well balanced and smooth. Very drinkable.
Overall: Really good. Would have liked the flavor to measure up to the aroma but you still can't go wrong with this one. 743 characterspapat444, Oct 15, 2011
4.54/5  rDev -2.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Graciously offered by hoppymcgee in our most recent trade; what a huge treat, big shoutout. 
Pours a, holy cow the aromas are huge! Focus... pours a dark orange, borderline copper color with a nice fluffy off-white head that leaves nice sticky and soapy lacing. A few yeasty chunks made their way in as I was pouring from the can. (I know it said not to on the can but how can you appreciate the aroma in a can, honestly...)
Aromas are straight hop juice. Huge citrus hops; I want to say more but there really isn't anything needed, so I will repeat HUGE PINEAPPLE AND GRAPEFRUIT! As it warms you get a little of the sweet bready and light caramel maltiness but the hops own this show for sure. Okay it's still opening up now; I get the grassy hops which were initially overwhelmed by the pine and citrus. Really a nice balance of hops smells here.
The tastes begin with light sweet toasted bready and pale maltiness but you are immediately bombarded by hop flavors and lesser hop bitterness. The order of dominance is pine, grassy/floral, then citrus/grapefruit. The hops are much more dominant in the flavor department which I LOVE, because too much hop bitterness ruins the hop flavors in a good DIPA. Don't get me wrong, there is def some bitterness (it is 120IBUs), but the light caramel maltiness and pale malt sweetness keeps the bitterness in balance but is still light enough to allow the hop flavors to really own this beer.
The mouthfeel is medium bodied with medium carbonation, nothing to crazy or complex, just perfectly balanced once again. The finish is also fairly balanced with a lean toward the dryer side thanks to the ample hopping and high-ish ABV.
Overall this beer eats Pliny the Elder's lunch. I would take this 10 times out of 10 over it's west coast comparative beer. It is just so damn delicious it's crazy. I may have to move to Vermont in the near future. It also scores extra point for coming in a 16 oz can which is by far the best packaging around. My new philosophy is 6 pack 12 oz bottles need to go away and 4 pack 16 oz cans need to take over; it just makes way too much sense on so many levels. Nice tangent there, anyway this is the best DIPA I have ever had, worth seeking out and highly recommended. I hope all is well and things get back on track because their brewery was damaged during Hurricane Irene and I know they had to shut down for a while. Let's hope all is returned to normal soon so they can continue to churn out stellar beers like this. 2,497 charactersclaspada, Oct 14, 2011

A - Well, it's a very nice can.
S - As soon as you crack the top you smell the intense hop bouquet. Thick, resinous pine aromas paired with grass and citrus -- grapefruit. really only a touch of malt. Hard to get a whiff from the can, but I'm not going to knock it since this is something of a novelty review.
T - Intense piney hops and some grapefruit. Really only a little bit of sweetness of any kind, but it also isn't overwhelmingly bitter. Just intensely hoppy. So dank and resinous. Yowza.
M - Medium body and a perfect amount of carbonation. Leaves the mouth only slightly dry.
O - Overall I would say the beer is surprisingly great to drink directly from the can. I would still recommend pouring it, but it is really awesome from the can as well. I have matched my scores to a previous review in order to minimize allowing this review to impact the overall score 908 charactersgreenmonstah, Oct 14, 2011
3.85/5  rDev -17.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to KickInTheChalice for the pour.
Pours out golden orange with a finger of frothy white head. Limited lacing, and decent retention.
Smells hoppy - piney and bitter - but with a strong tint of copper/metal in the nose. For an east coast DIPA, not as much malt as I would have expected. The hops and copper do fade into a bit of honey sweetness, but this is a hop forward beer.
Taste is better than the nose - there's still something metalic/copper going on, but it's not as overwhelming as it smelled. Starts off with Sweet honey caramel malts, followed by dank hoppy bitterness.
Feel is solid - medium bodied, crisp and dry.
Overall - I don't get the hype for this beer - actually for all the Vermont DIPAs. Not a bad beer, but certainly not world class. 766 charactersreadbaron, Oct 14, 2011
4/5  rDev -14%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured from a 16 oz. can into a tulip. Thanks to CharlieMurphy for dropping this in my box.
Appearance: Out of the can, Heady Topper has a bright orange amber color, slightly hazy, with a soft sea foam froth.
Smell: Pale malt, some honey, and a long drawn out bitterness. Pine, grapefruit, and a little spice.
Taste: The flavor starts with a little malt sweetness and toasted grains, then moves to a blend of hoppy bitterness - pine, grapefruit, and a bit of herbal spice. The finish is a straight bitterness.
Mouthfeel: The body is slightly fuller than medium. Grainy character, with some hoppy resin from the middle to the end. Medium carbonation.
Overall: This has a strong, pleasant bitterness, with the hop flavors taking a backseat. Good, but I don't see how it really differentiates itself from the top notch DIPA's. 828 charactersKickInTheChalice, Oct 14, 2011

Murky amber body with tons of floaties (unfiltered!). Small, tan tinged head. Mostly bubbles and a ring around the glass. Moderate lacing.
Pine, citrus and some menthol on the nose. Some caramel and biscuit malts. A floral aromas appears as well.
Lots of pine and citrus hops attack the tongue right away. Some brown sugar and biscuit malts form a base, but this is destroyed by a bracing bitterness. Very floral on the back end. The bitterness lingers in the mouth for quite a while.
Lives up to the hype. Wish I could drink this all the time. 640 characterslitheum94, Oct 14, 2011
4.77/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A - A delightful deep orange, even the head, which was two fingers of irregular froth dithering to an uneven lace (really a sloppy cobweb) has an orange hue. Sediment chunks that float about make this the Goldschlager of DIPAs. 
S - The Topper doesn't mince words ... it's like smelling a bag of tropical skittles. It smells unreal and fruity, with a hint of pine. Or perhaps like a nice fruit taffy, because there is a bit of cooked sugar in there. Not quite caramel. There aren't too many beers that would appeal to that sense so viscerally. This is select.
T - Imagine biting into a starfruit that grew from a balsam fir. That is about it. Juicy and amazing, with a pitchy taste. OK, so pine aromas are normal. But starfruit is something else. Impeccably balanced. All of the aromas deliver. No false scents. 
M - It has legs in the mouth. Perhaps it's one chink, it's a hair thicker than perfect for me. But perhaps that is good, because if it weren't I would drink it too quickly. 
O - Only rivaled, not beaten. This is the best DIPA you can get, or at least that I've tasted.
This is one of those beers that makes you want to quit tasting beers, and just drink a whole lot of beers. 1,193 characterszbellino, Oct 14, 2011

Moderate carbonation and a thick, slightly syrupy mouthfeel. Burst of citrus and tropical fruits up front followed by a strong caramel malt backbone with hints of buttered popcorn. Mild hop bitterness on the finish.
No hint of the higher ABV; easy-drinking and tasty for sure. Enjoyed this beer but found it a little too sweet and malt-forward for my tastes (maybe I prefer the hoppier West Coast DIPA's?). 535 charactersgrittybrews, Oct 14, 2011

Decanted into a New Belgium tulip. Its clouded darker tangarine, off white head, leaves a lasting collar and a super fine film and again fine bits of lacing.
Nose is loaded with pineapple, mango and fruity/spicy hop goodness.
More of the same on the tongue and palate, pineapple and citric hops seem to dominate. Flavorful, fresh and pleasingly complex DIPA. As advertized this is not designed to blow away your senses with overwhelming loads of hops, but instead dominates your palate with wave after wave of hoppy goodness.

S: Floral hops, pine, orange peel, grapefruit, some malts. Perfect!
T: Just like the can says "wave after wave of hoppy goodness!" All the notes from the nose come through in the taste. This is a hopheads dream. Pure joy in a can. Every sip makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside! Long lasting hoppy finish that I wish would never end!
M: Heavy body/moderate carbonation. Bitter and hoppy throughout the mouthfeel. Couldn't ask for anything more.
Overall this is the best DIPA and best beer I've ever had the pleasure to enjoy! Every sip is filled with amazing hoppy goodness!

I will initially be tasting you straight from your container, per your request, but you will make it into a glass for the rest of the analysis.
Crack the can and a rush of flowery citrus and slightly piney hops punch me in the nose. 
A sip is akin to making love for the first time. So long as that coitus involved a basket of assorted pineapples, grapefruit, oranges, and a frisky roll atop a bale of grassy hops. Beautiful creamy mouth feel with just the right amount of bite against the sweeter caramel malt. 8% ABV? Where? This is dangerously drinkable. I need a cigarette, darling...
After pouring it into a pint glass, I failed to notice the label -- there is a ton of hop sediment. I'm not adverse to this, but it's a little surprising to me that it's not a little cleaner, given that if I finished this from the can, I'd be enjoying a big gulp of pulp. The light caramel color is nice and a smooth head laces well.
Finally! A hyped beer that did not disappoint! Better than Pliny? Firstly, who cares. But also yes, it's made on the East Coast! 1,118 charactersOldIronLungs, Oct 13, 2011

I just received this can this afternoon, figured I'd better drink this as fresh as possible.
I going to take this cans word for it, and leave some of the beer in can, and drink from it. We shall see...
Pours a hazy gold color with a pretty nice bubbly bright white head. Some lacing on the glass.
Aromas are of course, hoppy. Very floral and fresh, bright oranges, tangerines, mangos, and sugary grapefruit. There are also some resiny notes as well. Smells wonderful.
Taste is sugary and bitter up front. Then beer settles into light sweet crackers and creamy malts. There are lots of hop flavors dancing around too, mostly mixed sweet citrus. Hints of sweet orange, tangerines, mango, and bitter grapefruit. Finish is dry, snappy, crisp, and with some sticky resin flavors, Very tasty and balanced DIPA.
Mouthfeel is full, smooth, and very nicely carbonated. 
Overall, an expertly made DIPA, one of the best I've had in quite a while. Very easy, and a pleasure to drink.
I have to say, I sipped this from the can and a glass, I preferred the glass because I could pick up the aromas better. 1,143 charactersflexabull, Oct 13, 2011

Thanks for the shot at this one Oreo!
Pours a musty Orange that sizzles at the top for no longer than 10 seconds and the small bubbles fade to nothing. No lacing is left behind on this one.
Smell is of juicy pineapple, wildflower, pine, and some good citrus-y hops with the sweet caramel malt finish.
Taste is outstanding. Everything you could ask for in a DIPA. Extremely well balanced between the malt and aggressive hops in this one. Big fruity body with citrus shining through the most. 
Mouthfeel is dangerously good. This stuff is too easy to drink. It's a good thing this is hard to get ahold of for me, otherwise I'd be drunk for the majority of my days. Creamy body with a moderate amount of carbonation. It coats your mouth with some great juicy hops and an orange pulp film.
My expectations for DIPA's were raised the other day after having Ephraim, but this one put up a good fight with it. Very glad I got to try this and I'm happy this happened to fall on my 100th review. Thanks again cookie! 1,058 charactersDearthVader, Oct 12, 2011

This one pours a muddied and cloudy dark gold in color with a soapy white head that clings to the rim of my snifter. The nose is phenomenal. You get a lot of grapefruit, pineapple, citrus fruits, with a light malty sweetness. It is very pungent and very, very aromatic. The flavors too are a combination of grapefruit and pineapple with a moderate amount of bitterness and a clean finish. It's just so intensely hoppy. Like the description says, it is wave after wave of hoppy goodness. It drinks well, both from a glass or out of the can. It's just a really nice beer through and through. I'm really glad I got to try this one. 836 charactersaasher, Oct 12, 2011

Scent hits the nose with a big rush of tropical and citrus fruits... grapefruit, tangerine, mango, orange... slight presence of malt, finishes with a hint of grass. Taste starts off with a quick little bitter punch but quickly moves into a cocktail of tropical fruit with light citrus, again a faint presence of malt and a grassy and piney note at the end. Medium bodied, good carbonation, lacking some oily body preferred in the style. Overall, fantastic scent and taste make this beer highly drinkable and a great IPA. 618 charactersrfgetz, Oct 12, 2011

4.52/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Andy donated a can towards my drinking. Excellent. Poured into a pint glass. Pours a hazy golden straw with a finger of fluffy white head.
The real deal on the aroma here. Lots of grapefruit and orange with some grassy hops in the background. Hints of caramel malts but lots of fruity bitter hops here. A little more of a candied orange flavor here on the pallet. Still, this one delivers the fruity profile and lots of bitter grassy hops in the finish. 
The body is medium with good carbonation. Overall this one is simply great. Real tough to beat here. Glad to see these guys canning this guy regularly now. 612 charactersBendurgin, Oct 11, 2011
4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from 16oz can into a tulip glass.
Appearance: Pours a hazy dark golden with a finger of fluffy eggshell white head that settles after a minute or so to a thin layer of head.
Smell: Straight up citrus bomb. Tropical fruits - pineapple, mango, grapefruit dominate the aroma, while a hoppy, dank bitterness cuts through the end of the smell. Very sweet smelling beer.
Taste: Bitey, piney, hoppy bitterness last throughout the entire sip. Citrus flavors are strong as well, it's almost like biting into a grapefruit/pineapple/mango/tangerine hybrid. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied and sticky.
Overall: Hands down deserves the hype it's received. I've had this out of a can and bottle so far and I haven't been let down. 722 charactersAxic10, Oct 11, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Fresh can provided by Urbancaver (thanks Cam!).
Pours a hazy orange/copper with a nice white head. The nose is a combination of tropical fruit and pine smell that comes together in a very encouraging and welcoming fashion. The hop flavor combination is unusual in that it almost combines into the suggestion of a light mint tea. The taste is that same killer combination of tropical and pine flavors, and a good background malt base that is in balance with the hops. Lighter in body and sweetness than some DIPAs, but not dry, this achieves a good balance. Good carbonation. This is a really good DIPA and another to add to the list of 'must trys' for the hop head. Not brutally bitter, but a fantastically interesting hop flavor. Had this right after Hill Farmstead Double Citra and they were right on par with each other and fairly similar. 843 charactersseeswo, Oct 10, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Mallory for going to the alchemist cannery with me and enjoying this amazing beer! Also, good luck to everyone at the Alchemist brewpub, what happened was horrible and I hope for a fast and complete recovery.
A - Light brown 'apple cider' appearance with a half-inch of head that lasts almost throughout the session. Wisps of white lace that dance around my new alchemist glass. Looks like it will pack a punch. Graphics and text on the can are unique as well...notibly the incentive to be green..."Don't be a D-bag. Recycle this can!".
S - Bursts of hoppy goodness...I'm not sure which hops John Kimmich uses, but it seems as though a little bit of everything is in here. Some pine is there along with fruity esters as well. It might be the fact that it looks like apple cider, but I also pick up some cinnamon.
T - As expected, hops...this must be where hops go to heaven. Not overwhelming...well it's overwhelming (in a good way), but a unique hop/malt balance. Some fruit character is here as well such as orange peel and maybe some lemon zest. There is also a complex spice presence involving ginger, cinnamon, and...who knows?
M - Pretty much all you could ask for in a DIPA - lingering hops of all shapes, names, sizes, genders, races, and sexual orientations.
O - This is the best DIPA I've ever had. It is all that anyone could want this style to deliver. The statement on the can sums this beer up perfectly..."Not intended to be the biggest or most bitter. It is meant to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness on your palate". I like this beer better than Pliny the Elder, but that might be because I had this beer fresh from the brewery whereas I had Pliny a couple of months after it was bottled. 1,729 charactersBeerMaverick, Oct 10, 2011
4.39/5  rDev -5.6%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Robtobfest for this one. Reviewed from notes 09/29/11.
Pours a hazy amber/gold with little head an retention. Lots of floaties when decanted. Aroma is a big blast of grapefruit, pine, and some weed-like astringency. Great smell. Mouthfeel is slightly slick and resiny but still nice and full-bodied. Super drinkable.Taste is heavy on grapefruit, orange, and pine before giving way to a solid malt backbone. Shows great balance despite the heavy bitterness. This is a world class DIPA but I'd hesitate to call it the best I've ever had. Nevertheless, I'm depressed that I can't get this gem of a beer regularly, not to mention 4 packs.
I tried one from the glass (the basis for this review) and one from the can (as it says to do) and honestly, I liked the one from the can better. Maybe it's just my mind playing tricks on me because that's how the brewers wanted it but I usually never drink from the can unless I have no choice. 942 charactersTHEOPTIMATOR88, Oct 08, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Four pack courtesy of beertruth, via younger35, long story. Either way I am extremely glad to have it.
I normally would pour this type of beer into a snifter but I drank it out of the can as recommended by the brewer, hence my 4.0 rating on appearance. The smell is exceptional with a huge pineapple, grapefruit and piney aroma hitting my nose a few inches before the can even reaches my mouth. The taste is tropical fruit and major dry, piney blast to the taste buds. The beer is quite bitter but exceptionally drinkable and I am savoring every sip. Mouth feel is awesome with spot on carbonation. The pine taste is very dry but it works for me. 
Overall heady topper is everything I had hoped it would be. In my opinion it lives up to the hype and is certainly one of the best doubles I have had to date. The hop flavors and drinkability are amazing. I wish I could get this on a regular basis but I can't so it looks like I will be trading more often. If you like the hops do not miss this brew because its exceptional. Thanks again Adam and Dan, I owe you both! 1,067 charactersgibby, Oct 08, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.516oz pint can poured into a newly acquired Weyerbacher tulip(against the can's behest). Thanks to DaveHack for the beer & the glass. 
A: Hazy amber hue with a dark core that pushes the light out to the edges of the beer. Bubbly eggshell white head that fizzes out to a soft film that clings to the edges of the glass & leaves a disc shaped ring with frayed edges in the center of the glass. I haven't seen many dipa's that look like this & I am entranced by the murky elixir that is swirling in my glass.
S: Incredible. Intense tropical fruit aroma that dominates, mainly mango with soft pineapple undertones. A nice zesty citrus kick that brings in the finish that ends with a hint of sweetness. Easily one of the most amazing smelling beers I have had the pleasure to stick my nose in. The smell does lose a bit of intensity after it is poured in the glass, but still retains the same character.
T: A bit of mango mixed with pineapple that ends with a zesty, grapefruity flavor. It's all brought together by a mellow hop biterness that tingles the front of the tounge. 
M: Sticky & sweet with a hop biterness that lingers on the front of the tounge while hop oils coat the back of the tounge & roof of the mouth. A bit heavier than most dipa's but excellent balance that ties together all the elements.
O: Amazing aroma & captivating appearance. This is truly an experience that any hop lover should seek. Huge thanks to DaveHack for helping me cross this off my list & for the awesome glass. 1,499 charactersCisco619, Oct 08, 2011

A: Hazy amber color with a bone white head, about half an inch thick or so, sticks around nicely, and leaves a nice ring of lacing as it slowly recedes. 
S: Tons and tons of hops, citrus, tropical fruit, pine, you name it, its got all of the hop characteristics that I love. Juicy hops even. Just smells absolutely fantastic. Pineapple and mango. A lot like opening a bag of hops. Spot on here. 
T: Oh man, this is worth every bit of the hype that it's received. Tons of hop flavor, no other way to describe it. Just like sucking on a Citra hop cone. Pineapple, mango, grapefruit rind, and passion fruit all are hugely present, it's almost like a slightly bitter malty tropical fruit cocktail. Just loaded with hop flavors. Bitterness is there, but is not overbearing, just enough to keep things in check, tons of hop resins as well. Malt profile, no need to worry about a malt profile with all this hoppy goodness, there isn't much there, and I'm not missing any malt. Easily the most flavorful DIPA I've had in a long time. 
M: Excellent, just the right amount of body, lower carbonation, slight warmth, finish is dry, but not annoyingly so. 
O: Yeah, easily the best DIPA I've had in a long time. Huge aroma, even bigger flavor, not overly dry or over carbonated or too heavy or boozy. More and more I'm liking DIPA's to be in the 8.0% to 9.0% range, because the hops seem to get lost in the huge amount of malt it takes to push a beer over that 9.0% threshold, this beer hits everything right on. Great beer, completely worth the hype. 1,746 characterspokesbeerdude, Oct 08, 2011
4.14/5  rDev -11%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Received a couple cans as extras from GoGriz. I've read a lot about Heady Topper, so I'm really excited to try this!
A - Pours a hazy golden orange with a fair amount of sediment floating around, which is a little off-putting. A finger or two of slightly off white head dissipates fairly quickly, but leaves a thin layer of foam on top and a lot of lacing.
S - Citrus fruits - pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. Some pine notes are in there too.
T - Starts with a piney bitterness. The citrus fruits are slightly present, but not as much as they were in the nose. The bitterness lingers all the way through the finish, which is slightly dry.
M - Medium bodied with light carbonation.
O - A very enjoyable DIPA. Surprisingly easy to drink for a relatively big beer. The hops grab you from the first sip and do not let go. Definitely worthy of the attention it receives and would never turn down more! 904 charactersratedz, Oct 08, 2011
4.7/5  rDev +1.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Pours a deep orange almost amber or brown with a frothy off white two finger head leaving supreme lacing down the glass.
Smells of pineapple, tropical fruits and a little bit of caramel. Everything about this beer is fantastic so far.
Strong citrus flavors hit at the front of the tongue balanced out in the middle with some caramel malt. Finishes with a light piney resin bitterness.
A little bit sappy and good carbonation levels.
Fantastic beer. Not the very best of the style I've had, but right up there. 513 charactersjmarsh123, Oct 07, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5A: Poured. Floaties, as you know. Cloudy medium amber with a thick resinous depth and minimal head but thick frothy residual on the sides 
S: Can't do better than this. It's like boring your nose into mother earth's hop vagina. Heaven. Best clean citrusy smell of any IPA I've come across (Ephraim's smell is quite an experience too but not citrusy per say, more like it's alive like a luscious liquid swamp thing)
T: Sharp bittering attack up front and definitely the dominant component of the taste. Slowly transitioned some deafened citrusy flavors, hit with another punch of bitterness, then lulled out with a dampening dryness that lulls the taste buds into enjoyment of their anesthesia. Slightly lacking dimension wise (I know, I know).
M: Very very neutral for a big IPA, minimal dryness and residue. Appropriate carbonation - slightly above average. 
O: Definitely enjoy it more poured than out of a can haha. The can restrains the aroma and taste imo. CANNOT beat the price here. I've had it on tap at the brew pub and only thought it was slightly above average. This is the most enjoyable Heady Topper I've had yet. 
*Also better canned than on draft. 1,167 charactersCharlieMurphy, Oct 07, 2011

Pours a vibrant burnt apricot with a white frothy head. Moderate lacing decorates the glass as I continue to guzzle this baby down. Smells of citrus fruits, grapefruit, and malt. Piney hops I was looking for seem to be mellowed down quite a bit in the nose. Taste is very smooth, pretty much zero bitterness whatsoever. Hops (thank goodness) makes its appearance as the beer rolls around my tongue. I was tempted to call in a search party to look for any bitterness from the hops, but it appears it will just remain on the missing persons report. Mouthfeel is quite impressive. Overall, it's a good DIPA. However, I have had better. 715 charactersleschkie, Oct 07, 2011

S: Blast of hops up front. Settled into a nice aroma of citrus fruits, orange, pineapple and mango. Some pineyness as well. Balanced somewhat with breaded malt
T: Mirrors the nose. Starts with some piney bitterness. Moves on to juicy citrus fruit with some bread crust mixed in. Finishes with hop bitterness
M: Full bodied. Crisp, but slightly undercarbonated. Bitter hop flavor lingers

4.49/5  rDev -3.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Thanks to Ashley for sending this my way! Poured into a taster glass. There is a nice one inch head on top of a hazy orange color. There isn't a ton of head retention on this particular can though.
The aroma is full of sweet pineapple, orange candy, and some pine. Very inviting.
The taste is slightly sweet in the start with more pineapple and citrus. There is a nice dry bitter finish to balance out with some notes of pine that linger. This would definitely qualify as juicy.
The mouthfeel is light to medium with some good refreshing carbonation.
This is top notch. I can't wait for my ski trip in January to stock up. 626 charactersandrewinski1, Oct 06, 2011
4.8/5  rDev +3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.75 | feel: 4.75 |  overall: 4.75Poured from a can into RR tion glass.
A very cloudy coppery, orange color comes from the can. Its not a very pretty color. Decent head quickly dissapates, leaving some sticky lacing behind.
This beer smells like the heavens. The image I get in my head when I smell this is a large hop, just dripping oil. Words have trouble describing the fanatastic aroma of this beer.
First taste is a delicious bitter hop bite. That bite lasts all the way through the swallow. It tastes like a pine cone had sex with a tropical fruit and Heady Topper flavor was born.
This stuff is awesome in the mouth. Again, excellent hop oil abounds. It is definately on the heavier side of medium body.
Overall, the beer is just great. It smells freakin' awesome and tastes excellent. The alcohol is really hidden in this gem. By all means get this beer and consume! 845 charactersDaveHack, Oct 06, 2011
4.48/5  rDev -3.7%look: 3 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5473ml can.
The pour is a nice hazy amber with a foamy white head that leaves a good amount of lacing. Sure, not the prettiest brew but good enough that the Brewers shouldn't be ashamed of it leaving the can.
The smell is awesome when you pour it out, better than sniffing it form the can. It has a great deal of tropical mango and cane sugar. Very resiny. Kind of one-dimensional but in a way that I love.
The flavor is really nice. It has a mellow front end with sugar and melon being the main flavors. There is a bit of pale graininess in the beginning that is that sweet biscuity type which is awesome. The finish is bitter with some nice pine. It is pretty balanced with sweetness all the way through and a nice bitterness at the end. It prob could have had a pinch more bitterness to make it absolutely perfect. I feel it actually is sweeter in the glass than in the can, odd but that is what it seemed like.
Glad I got to try this, I am often let down by hype, but this one is delicious and worth tracking down. 1,021 characterscrossovert, Oct 05, 2011

A- Pours a cloudy pale amber color from can. Sits an opaque hazy orangey gold hue. A slight white head forms, then quickly fades to a wispy cap. Not much carbonation. 
S- A good dose of both sweet and zesty citrus fruit. Really good. The crisp tang of ripe grapefruit is met by sweet sun ripe orange slices. No malt really detected under all these hop aromas. 
T- GREAT! Loads of fresh juicy hop goodness. Sweet orange meets mellow pink grapefruit. A touch of drying caramel malt on tongue. Very hop forward, but not very bitter or abrasive. Really good. A little bit of pine on back end. Sips from the can are different. The flavor profile has shifted slightly and the mouthfeel is different and more bitterness comes through. I prefer the glass, so pouring the rest in.
M- A medium bodied DIPA that is full of hop flavor. Some bitterness on palate but rather mild and soft for a DIPA. Drinking from the can affects the mouthfeel. Makes it a tad harsher. Not much carbonation on palate, pretty flat.
O- An awesome DIPA. Very smooth in the body, yet completely hop forward. Top notch. Completely worthy of being my side beer as I brew my first batch tonight (Nobel Trappist ale). Will need to get more of this beer. 1,429 charactersbusterthecat, Oct 05, 2011

S: Great hoppy nose. Tons of grapefruit and citrus (I catch some hints of lemon), with a touch of pine.
T: Less hoppy than expected on first taste. The maltiness hits me first. Sweet but not overly so. But then the hops kick in. Tropical and citrus with some grapefruit intertwined. Toss in a shot of pine at the end. Very balanced throughout.
M: Medium in body, medium to low in carbonation. Yet still creamy and silky smooth. Fits the taste very well.

I poured about 3-4oz. of the beer into a glass just so I could see what it looked like and give it a sniff, the rest I drank straight out of the can as directed and it felt great.
The beer that was poured came out a hazy almost murky gold with a fairly small white head that left some lacing. 
The nose was dominated by sweet citrus notes with orange, grapefuit, pineapple and cumquat.
The tast was also pretty intense with citrus juice and pine flavors that did not present themselves on the nose. There was a slight malt presence that brought it all together.
This beer has insane drinkability with a smooth and creamy body followed with good carbonation.
This is a great DIPA that lives up to the expectations and belongs at the top with the best of them.
Huge thanks again Stakem and Tanger for giving me a chance to have some of this.
Oh and I am going to be a D-bag and not recycle this can because I'm saving it. Love it. 1,127 charactersBdubleEdubleRUN, Oct 04, 2011

Notes from 09/27/11 
Tried w/ pint as well as straight from the can.
A: Heady Topper is exactly that. Pours a darker gold color with an orangish hue and just a great big 3 finger head of pure white foam. Amazing retention with a cascading lace all down the glass. 
S: Huge grapefruit and massive mango attack at immediate pop of the top. Awesome Awesome Awesome aroma. Very fruity with hints of kiwi and lime. Barely pick up some light sugary sweet bits of malt.
T: Fruity tropical blasts of hop goodness. Spikes with bitter melon, grapefruit and mangoes. Nice hop bitterness overall. Resinous and lingering sticky-icky deliciousness. Some caramel malt background but light and sugary pronouncing the hops. Slight alcohol flavs. Really danky stuff. This is true hop juice.
M: Great creamy texture. Nice carbonation. Lighter body and an oily slick mouthcoat with a refreshingly crisp finish.
D: A fantastic exhibition of hops with great balance. Enough caramel sugar base but just superhoppy and very drinkable. Really great stuff.
Glad to have the chance to try and will definitely be seeking out again. Highly recommended. A contender with Abrasive for sure. 1,256 charactersNugganooch, Oct 03, 2011

A- Pours a slightly hazy sunset orange with a ton of sediment. There is a one finger head that dissipates leaving some tiny spots of lacing. 
S- Right when I open the can, the smell was powerful and bursting with mango, peach, pineapple, melon, apricot and passion fruit, basically a fresh tropical fruit salad. A great deal of floral hops are there as well as a bit of pint and biscuit malt. An amazing aroma.
T- Biscuit malt is more present as well as some citrus notes such as pink grapefruit and lemon zest. Still some tropical fruit such as peach and mango, but not as tropical as the aroma. Orange marmalade in the middle with some citrus bitterness at the end.
M- Medium carbonation and body with a crisp mouthfeel that finishes dry. 
O- Extremely drinkable with a great aroma. The only issue I had was that it was a little less complex in the taste and a little malty, but a fantastic DIPA that can compete with the best. 1,071 charactersiadler, Oct 03, 2011
4.52/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5From a five day old can on October 2, 2011.
Pours a very hazy tangerine orange with a huge, lasting, frothy head of three fingers. More or less what I expected given the fact that it's unfiltered.
I love this nose. Fresh orange, citrus, candied fruit, and light floral notes, with just a hint of juicy tropical fruit and pine. Almost a perfect combination of pungent fresh fruit, bitterness, and sweetness.
Opens with the orange and tropical fruit (especially mango) punch - the bitterness is really only moderate in character on the front of the palate, with just a tiny resinous bite. Some grapefruit and more pine makes its way on the mid-to-late palate, accompanied by a light honey sweetness. Very juicy, fruity, and wonderfully integrated, which is what I look for most in a DIPA. I appreciate that this isn't harshly bitter (though it's no slouch). 
Medium-bodied with medium-low carbonation. I hoped for a little more carbonation, but that's not stopping me from working my way through the can.
Heady Topper lives up to its reputation, and I love that The Alchemist has devoted an entire facility to making and canning it. If I lived close, it'd be hard to justify buying much else at $12/4 pack. An elegant and supremely balanced DIPA. 1,249 charactersVerecund, Oct 03, 2011

4.44/5  rDev -4.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5So I was trying not to drink for a couple of weeks and then I get one of these as an extra from a very generous starrdogg. Thank you, Matt.
Pouring a hazy amber with a dense off-white head with excellent lacing and retention. Going in without reading reviews in a while, I expected this to be clearer and less hazy, but hey, I don't really mind. The nose is big, juicy and very hoppy. Juicy with candied orange, ripe oranges, ripe pineapple, moderate floral and lemon, a little honey. I can't pick up much malt here, as there's so much juicy hop sweetness that it hides any malt on the nose. Quite excellent.
While the nose is solid, the palate is outstanding. Incredibly juicy hop character with oranges, tangerines, Meyer lemons, a touch of orange and grapefruit pith. Along with it is a moderate tropical fruit character, especially on the finish, with some pineapple, mango and yellow peaches. Bitterness is moderate here, and the malt character is moderate with a little bit of honey and a touch of caramel. The finish is excellent, with a lingering tropical fruit character, moderate orange and a mild bitterness. Medium-light in body with soft carbonation, this beer is great. Pleasing resin character as well, this is very good. Excellent stuff, I would love to have this again. Thanks for the chance to try this beer, Matt!
**Edit 06 Dec 2011**
I'm getting a chance to revisit this right after drinking a Pliny, and boy, is it still glorious. It looks cloudy and ugly, though, so I'm docking the appearance down by 0.5. can is fresher, so the nose is more pungent and more dank, hiding the caramel sweetness. I'm upping the nose to a 4.5. The palate is just a hair too sweet, and the more I drink, the less I enjoy it, and I'm dropping the taste to 4.5. Just a touch boozy, too. Still, a fantastic DIPA. 1,816 charactersDefenCorps, Oct 01, 2011
4.64/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5A: Pours in the typical DIPA fashion with a nice creamy haze.
S: Absolutely incredible! Smells like "freshness". Tons of tropical fruits, grass, citrus. Smells like a garden of delights! This is easily one of the best smelling beers I've ever had!
T: The beer follows the powerful aroma, with just a touch more grassiness. Not terribly sweet - a bit dry and truly "heady". So much going on in this one!
M: Creamy and zippy on the tongue.
O: I like this better than Hopslam. Yeah I said it. But for real, a beer available in cans all the time with this much going on? What more could you ask for???!! 603 charactersmiromanyth, Sep 30, 2011

This pours a deep copper color with a nice retaining head that lines the glass. The pour is very hazy but appealing. Smells of huge citrus fruits including oranges, pineapples and melons. Some earthy smells come through with pine needles. Nice hop presence as well on the nose. Taste is very sweet up front with a delicious hop finish that balances on the palate. Very enjoyable tasting beer. Mouthfeel is medium bodied. Overall this is amazing. Very drinkable DIPA with 8% and the taste is amazing. Thanks again Scotty! 627 charactersabrand, Sep 30, 2011

L - I have no idea what this beer looks like so I gave it a 4.

4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.516oz can poured into Deschutes snifter glass. No canning date, but they just started doing it so it's pretty darn fresh!
A: Pours a reddish orange color. Barely any head, but whats there is white. Swirl gets a small off white froth. Some mild lacing and alcohol feet. Good carbo bubbles rolling from bottom of glass.
S: Great nose on this one. I get some pine, some fruit (grapefruit), some cat pee, and some mild breadiness. With the swirl, you get a lot of CP astringency and overripe peachy smells.
T: You get an immediate hop assault on the tip of the tongue. I like it. In the middle of the tongue you get those fruity hop notes and that astringency. Nice crisp finish. A little alcohol warmth in back if throat, but you don't taste the booze in the sip.
M: It's a medium bodied DIPA. Good mouth coat and bitterness.
O: A beer for sure bordering on A+. Still love Furious and Abrasive more, but this runs right up there with them as the King of the Cans. 964 charactersinlimbo77, Sep 29, 2011
4.47/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Here we go...
Pour - when poured into a glass Head Topper is an apricot color with about a half inch of white bubbly head that fades fairly quickly but leaves some nice lacing. Its slightly hazy with some sediment settlling at the bottom of the glass. When you drink it straight from the can (I'm not crazy, read the can) it's all just a mystery - a deliciously hoppy mystery. 
Aroma - pungent, citrusy, floral, sinus-clearing and downright heavenly. One of the best smelling IPAs we've come across - so fresh and so clean. Lots of grapefruit and pine in the nose. Wow. I think you can get a contact buzz off this...
Taste - one sip and you know you've stumbled upon something special. This is fresh times a thousand. Big flavors of grapefruit and hop resins abound. My mouth is puckering within seconds and my tongue is starting to succumb voluntarily to the 120 IBUs this is hop-forward beauty is packing. I'm completely surrendering to this beer. It really hits all the marks perfectly for the style and makes me wonder what I'm going to do after my last can is gone. Like hops? Like style perfection, freshness and in your face goodness? This is for you.
Overall - fantastic! One of the best big, hoppy IPAs that we've ever tasted. Big, floral aroma with tons of chewy, piny, citrusy flavor and smooth finish that keeps you wondering if you might just be able to finish one more can. The strength, 8% ABV, is hardly noticeable with this amazingly smooth and drinkable delight. When you focus all of your attention on brewing just ONE amazing beer its hard to expect anything less than greatness and this embodies just that. 
Note - When you look at a can of Heady Topper it might be hard not to notice that the can actually reads along the top, "DRINK FROM THE CAN". The back of the can explains the reasoning behind this and I can honestly say that it tastes fantastic poured into a glass or straight from the can. This is an absolutely amazing beer any way you enjoy it. 1,981 charactersindiapaleale, Sep 29, 2011
4.89/5  rDev +5.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Ridiculously huge thanks to G311 for the brew; spreadin' love - that's just how G311 do thangs.
HT pours... well, it pours not at all; I am following Alchemist's wishes and taking it straight outta the can... the can looks good, ergo the appearance is nice. And the aroma is f'n sick. Sick. Nuts. Insane. Ridiculous. I was gonna pour it in a glass - the Alchemist's instructions be damned - but as soon as I cracked the can - HFS - JFC - WTF - this is hop Godliness. It smells like wet Cascade, and it tastes like it too (though I've not actually ingested wet Cascade directly); if you don't know what that is like, try smoking some triple Kush, while drinking grapefruit juice, in a lumberyard, hovering over a tropical fruit salad - then add a superbly balanced pungency, and you are imagining a brew half as good as this is. There is also a big sturdy malt, but it is not the star, so why speak of it? Suffice it to say that the malt contribution is nearly perfect, exceeded only by the hop contribution. Big, sticky, and definitely hype-worthy; I hope to have some more cans of this REALLL soon.
Cheers again VG - you know I am not a hop-whore, but this one is out of this world. 1,185 charactersktrillionaire, Sep 28, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Presentation: 16 oz. can chilled from the second batch. Huge thanks to Phingdong for giving me this can for nothing. It was definitely appreciated. Poured into my Sam Adams pint glass (I know it says to drink from the can, but I didn't).
Appearance: Bright orange in color. Pours a nice creamy beige head that has nice retention. Very cloudy. I love the unfiltered look of this beer.
Aroma: Pineappple, mango,citrus and bursts of pine. The hop notes are bright and aromatic. Flawless really. Nice balance of sweetness and bitterness. Really bold and really pleasant all around.
Taste: Big tropical fruits upfront. A wave of citrus and pine follows after. Incredibly flavorful. Some candied hop notes as well. A rather substantial malt backdrop, but the hops really are the star. Nice balance of sweet and bitter. Near perfect. 
Mouthfeel: Creamy and sticky, medium bodied. Low carbonation, but it almost works well here as it allows you to drink faster.
Overall, a near perfect DIPA. That's really nothing bad I can say about it. It was even better on a fresh palate. Another great IPA from Vermont that's affordable and so damn tasty. 1,140 charactersGosox8787, Sep 28, 2011

16oz can into a SN imperial pint glass (love this guy for 16oz cans) leaving the last sip in the can. can says "drink from can" around the lip, I first thought it was a shot at surly but gueshue informed me it's because of sediment (hence the leftover in the can, thanks for the tip)
a- nice 2 inch off white head. very dark hazy orange hue. looking good!. good thing I left the floaties in the can.
s- ohh man this one smells delicious. Very reminiscent of the first six-pack of the year of SN celebration ale. rich hops aroma. screams west coast to me. nice maltiness behind the hops.
t- taste follows closely with the nose. not overly bitter with a fantastic hop flavor! seriously this guy feels likes celebrations big brother. nice maltiness mid palate, perfect amount if sweet. very crisp with fantastic balance.
m- medium bodied on the thinner side of dipas but very juicy. not overly carbonated ( maybe less than usual dipas) but it helps to coat the mouth.
o- the drinkability on this guy is Insane!! it gies down super easy, and at 8% could get you buzzed mighty fast. I could seriously drink this all day long. the beauty of this beer is it's balance, and I believe thats why it's been getting attention. back of can says it the best "not intended to be the biggest or most bitter, it is mean to give you wave after wave of hoppy goodness" and it indeed delivers. 
this is what I was hopin SN hoptimum was going to be like, a bigger badder celebration which is exactly what this guy is. deserves the attention. I never thought I'd get a chance at this guy. thanks gueshue for the chance! 1,711 charactersKevSal, Sep 27, 2011

S- huge dank rediculous hop aromas. Big woody floral pine hop aromas blend with a high alpha hop oil aroma. Big cat piss and a note of lemon zest. Finishes with the tiniest touch of honey and malt sweetness.
T- a touch of cracker pale malt flavor hits the palate at first. Huge hop flavor of wood, pine sap, yellow grapefruit and fresh hop oil. Smooth round bitterness with a touch of alchohol on the finish.
MF- slick oily mouthfeel with a medium body and soft fine carbonation.
D- very drinkable and rediculously hoppy. Don't think I'll be able to taste much after this :)

Crack the can and the fun begins..bam aroma immediately..oh ya this Ipa smells like hops and citrus.
Pours the expected orangey haze with a pleasant light sticky white head.
The taste is something down the alley from Surly Abrasive. Mouthfeel seemed a little bit creamy with plenty of hops and citrus. Nice finish with out crazy lingering bitterness.
Can Art work is neato to boot. 430 charactersLIQUORBARREL, Sep 26, 2011

Nose is full of hop resin, some sweetness, citrus. Flavor is similarly super resinous, sweet, mild bitterness. Pretty tasty, alcohol slightly noticeable. This is a very good beer and if you like super resinous double ipa's than this is probably your thing. To me, it was a little too sweet and green and lacked complexity. 405 charactersPhunkLover, Sep 26, 2011

It says drink from can but I choose to ignore that because I wanted to see this beauty.
Poured into my Saranac pint glass.
Good thing I didn't drink this from the can because I would have missed out on the orange appricot hazy coloring a good finger and a half head of a white head. Good retention and lacing.
Smells like IPA heaven. Very floral and fruity with a nice hoppy presence.
The flavors are in balance. Nothing is overpowering but everything is there. Malts, fruity flavors and plenty of hop but none of that in your face bitterness. This one is all about balance.
With a great medium to full bodied mouthfeel this one has plenty of carbonation. Flavors linger for a while and leave you wanting more.
This might very well be my favorite IPA so far. Balance, balance, balance. This one gives all aspects of the beer it's own moment. I love it and would like to have one of these at least once a week. 1,007 charactersdoopiedoopiedoo, Sep 26, 2011

T - Citrus hits you first, the the pine follows.

Appearance the last time I poured it was a light copper that was a little hazy. Head was decent despite low carbonation. By the way, I love this giant can, especially that they worked in the term "d-bag" on the back.
Smell and taste are both heavily sweet citrus, I feel like I'm drinking grapefruit juice the way my mouth puckers. There is some pineyness to it and a long lasting bitterness.
Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy with lower than normal carbonation.

Lot's of citrus and grapefruit aroma and flavor. There are some definite earthy notes as well. When I poured the beer it was about cellar temp. Getting some definite resin feel on the mouth. Not overly carbonated and the abv is not too pronounced. 311 charactersdrumenigma, Sep 26, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.516 oz. can poured into a Portsmouth Brewery tulip. Deep golden, almost amber body with a fluffy white head that fades into a faint ring. Lots of floaties and other things dancing around in my glass.
Aroma is big on the grapefruit / tropical fruit characteristics. Some floral / grassy notes cut through the fruity sweet aroma as it warms up. Flavor assaults (but in a good way) the palate with even more tropical fruit, citrus, and floral hop oilyness. Big chewy malty flavor in there as well to balance it all out. Some warming alcohol is noticeable in the finish. Light, less carbonated body, but for some reason it works for this beer. Leaves a sticky coating in the mouth.
Love this beer, glad I got 2 four-packs of this. 727 charactersmuttyd, Sep 26, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Fresh can poured into a tulip glass (even if the can tells you to drink it straight out of the can, maybe for the next one). Thanks to AshleyMiller for the fast trade. Beer pours a dark bronze, very very hazy with lots of particles suspended in the beer making it so that you cannot see through the glass. Initial finger of off white bubbly head, mostly small and medium bubbles, recedes to a nice collar of bubbles and wispy film across the surface. Lots of gentle carbonation visible near the edge of the glass, floating slowly up. 
Cold out of the fridge, it wasn't too impressive an aroma. It improved a little after it warmed up closer to room temperature. Nose is a good amount of sweet grapefruit, bitter grapefruit peel, with some sweet orange and floral hops as well. Good strong malt presence to balance it out, toasted grains, caramel, toasted bread. 
Nice balanced flavor profile over all. Grapefruit and orange peel and pith bitterness initially, but not so strong as to kill your tongue, some lighter floral and pine hop notes as it sits on your tongue. Then midtongue, the malt balance really comes through, good amount of toasted grain and bread and caramel sweetness to complement the hop flavors and bitterness. A fairly dry finish with light lingering citrus and floral hop flavors. Alcohol is non existent in the flavor.
Medium body with light carbonation contributing to a smooth velvety liquid that somehow coats your tongue while in the mouth, but still finishes cleanly so your tongue is ready to taste the next sip. Very easy to drink as the bitterness is not overwhelming at all, but still very much there. Excellent imperial IPA, though the weaker than expected aromatics knocks it down a small tick for me. 1,737 charactersnataku00, Sep 25, 2011
4.17/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to Aberration for this can. Shared and reviewed with Kiddynamite920. Poured into two tulips at 50 degrees.
A: A strong pour down the center of the glass produces a 1.5 finger white head that slowly dissipates. Very hazy with loads of sediment in the glass. The second pour is considerably lighter than the first. In addition the first pour produces a much nicer head than the second. 4.0
S: Smell is of hops, slight spicy citrus fruit, grapefruit, carmaley malts, slight must, a little lemon rind, ...smells is quite refreshing. 4.5
T: Taste is of slight bittering hops, slight maltiness really looking for more here. Citrus fruits, orange, little grapefruit, but more pineapple sweetness. Aftertaste is of straight onion. It is good but something is definitely missing. 4.1
M: Good carbonation, super oily, mouthfeel is actually pretty damn good here 4.5
O: Overall this beer is good but its lacking in taste department. Strong onion flavor dominates. Pretty smooth but seems to be a little one dimensional. Super stoked to try this though. 4.0 1,057 charactersslentz, Sep 25, 2011
4.84/5  rDev +4.1%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Funny story about this beer. At BOREFTS a couple nights ago, an American gentlemen asked me what American brews I'd really love to try. After thinking for a few seconds, Heady Topper jumped straight into my head. Love me some big IPAs, and this was the most recent well-regarded example on the market. Not one hour later I meet tendermorsel at the festival and he pulls two cans for us out of his backpack! The Secret really does work. Thanks for sending these over GoGriz, and thanks for doing the dirty work tendermorsel. 
From a 500ml can into a snifter
APPEARANCE: Pours a relatively small, one finger, medium looking, off-white head with good retention. Burnt orange in color, clear, with medium carbonation evident. Head fades to a wisp and ring, sticking to the sides of the glass. A splotchy wisp and ring remain leaving touches of lacing down the sides of the glass. Quite pretty. 
SMELL: This is the shit. Big nose jumps out of the can and fills the room on the pour. Pale malts, caramel and honeydew melon, with some nice pineapple aromas. Citrus lemon and grapefruit all over the place as well. Bold, hoppy nose. 
TASTE: Just great. Pale malts, pineapple, with some sweet caramel and honeydew melon up front. Very flavorful. Finishes with lots of hops; lemon citrus notes and loads of grapefruit at the swallow. Big, bold and persistent aftertaste of grapefruit and sweet, fruity melon, with a good dose of bitterness as well. Very well balanced and flavorful. Some biting hops linger nicely on the palate. 
PALATE: Medium body and medium carbonation. Creamy on the palate and quite oily slick as well. Goes down fine and finishes somewhat mouth-coating. Is definitely creamy and silky in the mouth, but needs to be a touch fuller for top marks. 
OVERALL: This beer is excellent. This rivals Surly Abrasive, both of which beat out the competition for no.1 spot. Piles of wonderful hoppy aroma and flavor that isn’t dominated by that certain overarching bitterness that so many big IPAs suffer from. This is all flavor, and wonderful flavor at that. The can employs me to drink this beer immediately because they are always making more. Good times! This is a perpetual wants list beer, as it totally lives up to its reputation. Thanks heaps GoGriz and tendermorsel for bringing us a couple cans of this gem. Wholeheartedly recommended. 2,354 charactersJeffo, Sep 25, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks to both Mtardiff & BearsonAcid for providing this one. In one week I went from never having this beer to clutching 6 cans in my hand. This is the last of the six and needless to say, I’ll be getting more…. Somehow. Great beer. In fact, this review is being done with ½ the can in a glass and ½ being consumed out of the can. After all, that’s what the brewer tells you to do. (drink it from the can)
A finger of off white foam forms and settles rather quickly. The beer appears to be a slightly hazy almost dirty amber color. Dirty used as in dirty blonde. Doesn’t mean really dirty.. just a more brownish tone to is. Some very light lacing.
The aroma is fantastic, bright and fresh. Lots of citrus notes with some light malt notes just below the surface. Some grassy tones as well.
Flavor is also really nice. It’s a good thing when a beer lives up to the hype. Despite the big hop notes, it’s really well balanced. Up front lots of fruit and some sweetness. Tangerine and a moment of mango. Some grass notes and quite a bit of thick resin. Citrus comes in mid palate and a nice bitterness takes over from there. Smooth, yet bitter finish.
Almost a honey like mouth feel, medium bodied and a bit oily. Sticks in your mouth.
Just a well built beer. Keep cranking out those cans. I love this. Next trip to VT, I’ll be picking up a case. 1,368 charactersReagan1984, Sep 25, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.75 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 516 oz. can poured into a Duvel Tulip Glass (despite the instructions to drink it from the can....well maybe I had one sip). Orange/amber/brown sugar/gold in color. Very hazy, certainly unfiltered. Not quite white, almost orange creamcicle in color head. It erupts at first and sticks around for a little bit, decent lacing. 
Like many Double IPA's, it's a hoppy brew. Hard to completely clarify it, but there's something unique about this one. Big time citrus hops on this one; orange, tangerine, grapefruit and maybe even a little lemon, a little bit of zest/peel. A sweet aroma from it, could be from the tangerine smell, but like slightly tart at the same time; similar to a strawberry that isn't quite completely ripe yet. Not grainy, but steady malt presence, sort of a natural orange bread. Doesn't smell of alcohol, but it does warm your nose a little Really good aromas overall.
Taste is truly outstanding. Every hop lover would love this one, but believe it or not it's really well balanced. ALL of the above mentioned citrus detected in the hops with some slight honey-suckle nectar sweetness. Starts a little sweet (with again the slightest hint of tartness) and has a nice bitter end from hops and zest. Cant stress enough the balance here, very good.
In my opinion it's fairly thick and full bodied. The carbonation level is perfect. Silky smooth from start to almost finish, clean crisp bitter finish. Leaves a long lasting warm feeling from your mouth to you're stomach. I generally like my IPAs/DIPAs in the summer, but I could drink this Bad Larry all year round!!! What a wonderful beer, lived up the the hype and then some for me! 1,652 charactersAndyAvalanche, Sep 24, 2011
4.59/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Can courtesy of nas5755. Many thanks to Nick for the chance to try this one. 16oz can poured into a tulip glass.
Pours a hazy, brillant orange color with a bit of sediment floating in the glass. A nice 3/4 finger white head develops and settles as a soap-like cap. Wispy foam lacing is left on the glass. 
The nose is incredible. Enormous amounts of tropical fruit assault the senses and don't let up. Pineapple stands out above the rest for me but there is also some melon, oranges, tangerine and grapefruit. There are also some floral notes that cut through the tropical goodness as the beer warms a bit. Surprisingly, there was a slightly sweet malt aroma that came through in the background. But really this beer is just dripping with tropical hop aromas.
The taste is a slight step down from the nose but the nose was so over the top excellent that a step down is still quite potent. Definitely more balanced than the nose. The hops do still dominate but the malt comes through more. The full tropical hop profile is in full force again, pineapple, mango, orange, tangerine, grapefruit. The floral notes are a bit tougher to pick up in the taste than they were in the nose. A bit of pine is present in the taste as well. A touch of bitter hoppiness at the finish dry it out a bit. 
The beer feels exceptionally crisp for a high ABV DIPA with low carbonation. In fact, the carbonation is almost non-existent by the end of the glass. Never feels slick or oils as a lot of beers with this amount of hop character do.
Overall, this is an exceptional beer. Definitely in the upper echelon for the style. I'm not sure I've had a beer that has smelled as good as this, regardless of style. Dangerously drinkable for an 8% ABV beer. I'd love to have this one readily available to me. 1,785 charactersms11781, Sep 24, 2011
4.18/5  rDev -10.1%look: 2.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 41,000 thanks to Harrymel for being the most generous BA I've ever came across since joining this site 2 and 1/2 years ago.
A - Murkey Blood Orange - average head retantion and lacing. Not much activation going on in both the Tulip and Guiness perfect pint glass I poured them in, lots of floaties. 
S - Very pungent upon semi-agressive swirl as do most top notch IPAs/DIPAs. The citric notes I pick up are primarily Guava and the Grapefruit I pick up is a ruby red grapefruit. Some orange and faint strawberry. Mauna Lai Juice! The Pine and Earth component remind me a little of PTE.
T - Much the same as the nose. The citrus really reminds me of Mauna Lai Juice cut with some Orange juice backed by earthy pine. Finishes juicy yet dry at the same time. Pretty damn close to perfect bitterness in this. I can see where some may complain too bitter but I found it to be solid. ABV nowhere to be found. Way to easy to session this beer.
M - Crisp, clean, dry earthy finish. Beggs you to keep sipping. Juicy upfront, bitter and dry in the finish. Pretty fantastic. 
O - I had high expectations for this beer. It did not exceed them nor did it fall below them. It was GREAT, just as I suspected. World Class DIPA, just how I like them. It's a beer that belongs in the same discussions as the other overly Hyped ones and holds it's own. There are a few I prefer over HT but make no mistake about it...HT does not dissapoint. Need to revisit on tap. 1,448 charactersRBassSFHOPit2ME, Sep 24, 2011

Very creamy and smooth.
An outstanding DIPA at the lower end of ABV spectrum for DIPAs (yea!) Packed with fresh hop flavors but not at all bitter or astringent. Smooth juicy hoppy goodness in a can!

Poured into generic tulip. 
A: Murky brown, bit darker than I'd expect for the style. Tree stump core with some give towards light wet wood yellows. Water drenched woods really nails the visual for me, raw honey stored at a cold temp. Thai iced teas that are light on the soy. Definitely a darker/cloudier dipa. 
S: grapefruit rind, honeydew melon with rind, and some real pungent passion fruit. Guava doesn't hit me here as much as other citra (assuming citra, seems very apparent) in the nose. A little bit of green mango makes for a nice fruit cocktail in the nose. 
T: First of all, this is a really balanced dipa. tropical, melon, and citrus with it being difficult to tell who's winning. Light cantaloupe with repeat sips. Alcohol really accentuates the melon as it warms. flavors come off dry and crisp. Drying fruit juice flavors really implies a fresh pineapple. The alcohol in this really makes me think fruity desserts. Scorched sugar tropical fruit, tropical fruits and rum. Really nice flavors, extremely well integrated; even the alcohol. 
M: Soft mouth with a medium body and fair amount of chewiness. Alcohol puts a candy shell coating on the mouth throughout the course of drinking. Satin glove on the mouth with some really fine textures. Some dryness that limits the wetness of the alcohols, and keeps it drinking crisp in all temperatures. Really well done.
O: Simply, this is an outstanding DIPA. One of the very best that I've had, and easily the best from the east coast I've had to date. This has the type of balance I long for in a DIPA, and it delivers in the flavor. Seemed to have more of a sweet character than I'd expect to find, but it's really balanced. Alcohol is perceivable, but it's well integrated. Outstanding from Alchemist 1,918 charactersCavery, Sep 23, 2011

this pours a cloudy dirty brownish orange. fluffy creamy white head, great lacing and puffy lacing.
citrus on the nose, bigs of grapefruit and orange. a slight sweetness.
lots of citrus with a faint hint of pine and earthy resin bitterness. the citrus blend is rather interesting as here is pineapple, mango, tangerine, grapefruit, and a touch of pine. 
for a DIPA, the body is easy drinking, a bit slick. i want to say watery but i do not mean it in a bad way. mild carbonation, which i would reckon would add to the lighter body.
drinks sooo easy. i would NEVER guess this was 8%. 615 charactershooliganlife, Sep 23, 2011

Appearance: Pours a cloudy amber with a finger of fluffy white head that fades to a ring around the edge of the glass.
Smell: Just amazing. Herbal and citrus hops smack you in the face. Some pineapple and pine tree in there as well. Super fresh.
Taste: Just like the smell, thank God. Bitter hops throughout, but there is a decent amount of malt to back it up. Lots of grapefruit and apricot with more mild herbal and pine notes. Bitter finish.
Mouthfeel: Medium body with carbonation on the mild side and an extremely dry finish.

Note: My 150th BA Review
Batch 2, canned 9/7/11
Appearance: After ignoring the "Drink from the can!" instruction, this beer pours an interesting copper/amber color - perhaps not as orange as I anticipated - small head, which is typical for the style, fades quick to some good lacing, maintains a nice level of carbonation - a simply legendary amount of hoppy sediment at the bottom
Smell: Excellently complex - oily, wet hops - very floral, very dank and weed-like - tons of pine, resin - orange, tangerine, and sweet grapefruit flesh, some zest, some pineapple and some mango - the malt base shines through with some bready sweetness, caramel - despite the sweet fruitiness and sweet malts, it doesn't become cloying
Taste: Horrifyingly balanced - this is my fourth can, and I still find this mind-blowing - hops are everywhere, but this beer doesn't kick you in the face - as the smell suggests, there is a lot of pine, resin, orange flesh, sweet (ruby red?) grapefruit flesh, sweet pineapple - definitely bitter, but not ridiculously so - a strong, wet, weedy presence - very, very juicy - malts provide a great backbone - lots of caramel, pale malts - sweet, but not too sweet that it clashes with the bitterness - again, a nonsensical amount of balance
Mouthfeel: Stupid good - among the best I've encountered for the style - insanely smooth, silky, almost creamy - medium bodied, low carbonation, juicy, but finishes dry
Overall: I'm moving to Waterbury and living off this stuff
In my humble opinion, Heady Topper is one of the extremely rare beers that not only meets the hype, but exceeds it. This is one of the best DIPAs I've ever had, and it's hard to compare to anything. While it definitely fits the style, it's a totally different beast than something like Pliny the Elder. I'll be buying cases.
Additional comment (6/23/12): Well, I claimed I would buy cases, and I have been buying cases. But due to some unfortunate mistakes, I am currently drinking a 6-month old can. It's still good. The hops taste old, and it's sweeter, but it's still worth drinking. This is canned happiness. 2,124 charactersangrybabboon, Sep 22, 2011

Graciously given to me by Rochefort10nh.
price - $12.00/4-pack (16 oz cans)
I've been dying to try this one and I finally did over the weekend. We actually went up to the Alchemist pub this past summer but it wasn't on tap at the time which was a bummer.
I didn't drink it from the can as is suggested but with my Duvel glass which is probably my favorite glass in the cabinet and well suited for big IPA's.
The appearance is a hazey shade of orange with a thin off-white head that fades within a minute to a creamy ring. Dots of lacing decorate the glass.
The aroma is absolutely amazing with tropical fruit and pine resin balanced out to perfection. The nose stays strong throughout the experience which is delightful.
The flavor is certainly based on a pine backbone with sweet tropical fruit flavors sprinkled over the top. As it warms the fruitiness becomes more prominate which adds some much needed balance. 
Mouthfeel is spot on for the style. A medium body followed by a blast of bitterness but finishing silky smooth. This is the recipe for drinkability and I could drink this all night long with a smile from ear to ear.
Overall this was well worth the wait and lives up to the hype. By far the best canned DIPA I've ever had.

"Drink from the can!" It says. So I did. Though, I did pour an ounce or two into a glass to assess appearance. 
Pours a light amber, very hazy. With a light off-white colored head. Can't argue with that. Aroma is chock full of pine, flowery hops, and a good grazing of citrus notes. It's bustling, and it's wonderful. Perfectly balanced bitterness on the tongue, with big resinous, pine hop notes, tinges of citrus and healthy amounts of floral hoppiness. There's so much awesome hoppiness going on here, who cares about a malt profile. Body is full, rich, with a pleasant carbonation level. Alcohol is nowhere to be found, drinkability abounds. 
The amazing resinous pine and floral notes makes this almost easily one of the greatest Imperial IPA's I've had the pleasure to drink! Guess I'm moving to Vermont! 868 charactersEgadBananas, Sep 21, 2011

A- Light caramel colored, hazy, with 1 finger white head and good lacing.
S- Loads of sweet citrus and pine hops. I could smell the citrus when I opened the can a arm length away from me!
T- Fairly sweet malts and a lot of citrus in the beginning. Nice blend of citrus, spices, and pine hops with a very good pine hop finish.
M- Medium bodied. Medium carbonation and very drinkable. 
O- Like the the can says, "So drinkable it's scary." It that is no lie. I could drink 3 or 4 of these over a a course of night, and not be tired of it at all. Love the aroma, taste, and lower abv (for a DIPA at least). Will try and get more whenever possible! 741 characterskawilliams81, Sep 20, 2011

Taste: Upfront is the floral hop notes which is pretty nice and is backed up by a candy like sweetness and finishes off with a lot of malt. Very good flavor

Nice bright and fresh floral hopped nose with an underlining mild sweet malt presence 
Very nice flavor and balance. Nice fresh floral hop character balanced very well with a subtle candy-like malt character. Notes mild fruit and citrus hidden here and there. 
Mouthfeel is light, fresh and fairly crisp yet creamy. Medium carbonation. 
Overall a very nice DIPA. The best I've ever had outside of Cali. IMO better than PtE and close to Alpine and Citra. Overall great nose, flavor and balance. Highly recommended. 600 charactersMrVonzipper, Sep 18, 2011

I'm enjoying my fourth or fifth can as I write this review. Snifter.
A: Dark orange with some cloudiness and a finger of white foam. Lacing is scattered and retention is good.
S: Bright citrus notes, with tangerine, orange, grapefruit, and a dash of pine. There's quite a bit more malt in this can than I found in the bottle I tried, imparting some bread and caramel.
T: Smooth moderate bitterness with no evident alcohol. Malt imparts bread, biscuit, and caramel. Once again, this is quite a bit maltier than the bottle I enjoyed last year, and decidedly less bitter. I get orange, grapefruit, and a little melon. Dank pine is evident throughout.
M: Medium in body with an upper low level of carbonation. The general theme seems to be lower carbonation with these cans.
Overall: This is good, but it's not on the same level as the bottle I had in 2010. This seems much maltier and the hops aren't as vibrant. It's also a bit heavy on the palate due to the low carbonation. 989 charactersHopHead84, Sep 18, 2011
3.85/5  rDev -17.2%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 3.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Can shared by Whitemomba-- thanks Jason!
Served in tulip pint. 
Really hazy... Small particulates floating around... Creamy tan head, decent retention, thick legs leave nice bubbles.
Smells waaaay more piney than I remember... Nice grapefruit, some grassy and floral notes too. There's a little earthy dank quality on the back of the nose that has an odd character to it... 
The taste follows the nose; dry, bready/crackery malts with big hops at the back end. Citrusy grapefruit, big pine, some floral and grassy notes. 
The dank note I got on the nose translates to a VERY strange hint of cedar chips/hamster cage substrate... It is a combination of the hops character blending with the dry malts. It hurts the overall and flavor a bit, but still doesn't make the beer undrinkable. 784 charactersAleWatcher, Sep 18, 2011
4.54/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.516oz can provided by MrBarleywine, thanks for hooking me up Mike! 
Pours a slightly cloudy deep golden color with a stingy white head that dissipates quickly. Smells of pine, resin, and a slight bit of citrus and dankness. If there's any malt in here I can't find it, but I really don't miss it because I could smell this all night. Taste is mildly sweet bready biscuity malt being assassinated by an onslaught of hops. Resinous dank pine hops barely let any malt come through, but some do find their way in. Medium to thin body and level of carbonation, resinous bitter mouthfeel. This one is all about the hops, no shit right its a DIPA. There is a bitterness here, but its pleasant, aromatic and not harsh. This is a damn fine beer! 735 charactersjohnnnniee, Sep 18, 2011

Lively carbonation can be noticed, along with some sediment floating around. Very fruit forward nose, with passion fruit, pineapple, mango and a touch of sweet cream. Dank ass hops get things kicked off in the taste, giving off loads of fruit, spice and pine. Mouthfeel is medium in body, and the eight percent is masked perfectly. No doubt this is a world class IPA. 468 charactersjamie2dope, Sep 18, 2011

I received this surprise package of 2 very fresh Heady Topper cans in the mail this morning, and could not wait for them to get cold to drink them. This is super fresh- about 11 days old total. What an amazing cool thing for him to do- Beenitty I will get you back man!
Poured from can into my DFH snifter. Nice fluffy head that recedes very slowly. Dank piney and sweet citrus hops announce themselves when the can pops. Smell on further inspection: resinous, piney hops, and there is a bready sweetness to it too. Taste- wow. heaven. the hop oils hit the back of my throat with a burst of bitterness, but it is followed by a tropical sweet flavor that still sits on my lips. Waves of piney and floral hoppiness all over my mouth. If I were to compare this to something, it might be Surly Abrasive. Just a huge hoppy celebration in a can. Super fresh, it probably isnt as balanced as others say it is, the hops are just so pronounced, they are definitely the focus of this beer. 
Overall, this is up there with the best of them. I won't call it my all time best IIPA, but it is close. And so kickass that its in a can....I am going to try to do a trade for a full box of this soon. 1,238 characterslnashsig, Sep 17, 2011
4.94/5  rDev +6.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Batch 2, about 8 days in the can. Poured a bit into my mini Duvel tulip, drank the rest from the can.
A: Brilliant hazy orange. Decent head, decent retention. 
S: Tropical fruits, summer grass, a tiny bit of honey and biscuit. The aroma escapes from even the small opening of the can; out of a tulip it almost unruly. It is captivating. 
T: As the can says: this is not intended to be the most bitter, but there are truly waves and waves of hop-goodness. This is spot on. For those who worship at the altar of hops, this beer is a religious experience. It puts most other DIPA's to shame in the way that it dances on the palate but still packs a heavy hop punch.
M: The malt profile of this beer is so spot on that there is no way that anybody could call it "east-coast" or "cloying". It has just the right amount of weight to support the hop profile that it is carrying. Carbonation is just right, more in line with the cask version than the tap version. 
O: If I were to penalize this beer for anything it would be for being just too damn drinkable. I find myself sipping it all night, and completely enjoying it, with no regard for my liver. And in a way, it has ruined other DIPA's for me because I no longer want to try them, they just wont be this good. 1,263 charactersimagineiii, Sep 17, 2011
4.55/5  rDev -2.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Big thanks to SFLpunk for another fine trade that landed this treat in my hands. Much appreciated Jeff. Poured from a pint sized can into a tulip. This brew appears a hazed copper color. Very fine particulate is stuck throughout the suspension of this brew keeping it from being clear. A solid finger of creamy off-white head sits atop this brew and hold with very solid retaining powers. As the cap slowly fades, it completely coats the entire wall of the glass with an entire wall of lace.
The smell of this brew is very fruited and so much so that it is unlike the typical fruit aromas imparted by hops. It is quite tropical smelling primarily of pineapple with a light touch of mango. Some very light leafy to grassy hop inclusion is present across the back but this is all about the fruity sweetness of the hops here. A very light tingle of alcohol helps to accented the fruited quality of this brew.
The taste of this brew is pretty darn fantastic. The fruit aromas that the hops display in the nose completely transpose themselves in the flavor of this beer. This brew is littered with tropical hop flavoring tasting of pineapple, passion fruit, mango and agave. There is a very mild herbal bitter flavoring that keeps things in check and almost a minty aspect is thrown in there as well. The alcohol is very well hidden initially but starts to make itself known with a warmth and a bit of solvent kick once the brew comes up to temperature. The aftertaste is a bit herbal and lightly grassy which is a nice contrast to the sweetness throughout the brew. There is a perfect amount of toasted malt character present in this brew to hold the hops in place. Fantastic stuff right here.
This is a medium bodied brew with a modest level of carbonation. All in all this is the perfect package. The hop inclusion is bright, fresh and fruity. The alcohol is seemingly nonexistent until it comes up to temperature. The flavors of this brew run the full spectrum of hop characteristics. I killed a pint of this brew effortlessly. As far as drinkability goes, this is perfect and dangerously so. The label boasts that this should be drank from the can but I just cant do that. To not be able to sit and sniff this brew is a crime. I had this when it was first released from a bottle and thought this beer was all hype. Sitting here enjoying a can by myself I an throughly impressed. Fantastic stuff here Alchemist! 2,413 charactersstakem, Sep 17, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to my local beer store for this surprise.
Appearance: Hazy copper. Pours on the heavy side with almost no head. What head there is, is bright white and slightly sticky. Lacing is decent, but not too crazy. 
Smell: Resin, citrus rind/zest, faint spiciness, and a big floral push. Big juicy, oily hops. Smells like a crazy wet hop beer. The hop aromas are incredibly fresh and clean. Malts are sweet and bready, but work to flesh out the back of the big hop nose. Caramel and cotton candy as well. The sweetness is a little distracting overall, working in contrast to the hops.
Taste: Pine everywhere. Dank, resinous, and juicy. Hops are oily and spread across the mouth. The sweetness from the nose brightens the whole thing up and lets you know more is coming. I'm still getting cotton candy and caramel in abundance, but they play through the back of the hop profile. A hint of something tropical (mango?) as well. Tons of flavor, but it's shockingly non-aggressive. Big chewy malt presence helps even things out.
Mouthfeel: This might be a new standard for the style. Low carbonation and a big chewy body. Creamy, smooth, and almost silly drinkable. Coats the mouth, dries it out a touch, and then keeps on going with waves of smooth hop flavor. 
Overall: The fact that this is now available in cans is crazy. I had it on tap 3 years ago and wasn't impressed. Tastes change, but I hope this beer doesn't. A great testament to the style. 1,450 charactersGoblinmunkey7, Sep 16, 2011

Pours a semi-hazy burnt orange with a rocky, one inch, cream-colored head embedded with tiny craters. Head eventually settles into a soapy skim with a thin, bubbly band around the edges. Some swaths and spots of lacing are revealed during the tasting. Love the nose on this beer - grassy, sweet citrus, earthy rind and a slight peppery quality towards the back; incredibly well-balanced. Taste follows nose - earthy bitterness presents up-front and sweet citrus and a suggestion of apricot follows. Finish leaves a slight residual bitterness between quaffs. Mouthfeel is medium-light with a pleasant, even carbonation that is lively without being prickly. There's also a slightly oily texture. The more I drink this beer, the more I like it. Hopefully it will make it to Southern Vermont so I can get a bit more regular access. This beer is nothing short of fantastic - the balance is top notch, the alcohol is well-hidden and it is just so easy drinking. In my opinion, can tops bottle on this brew. 1,089 charactersJwale73, Sep 16, 2011

4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Heady Topper pours a turbid orange with a soft white, two finger head. An early pour is relatively hazy while the last dregs contain flocculants that reintroduce themselves into suspension. 
The smell is glorious! A cornucopia of hops produce notes of pine resin, fresh basil, ruby red grapefruit sweetened with sugar, wet grass (the kind you smoke;) and candied orange zest.
The taste is in your face fresh, fresh hops. A remarkable combination of all the scents, with a fantastic paradoxical blend of slight candied sweetness and a long dry finish. This is one clean beer with no trace of alcohol whatsoever.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Low to moderate carbonation fits this beer to a T. A creamy lush softness again shows the chameleon-like aspects of this top-notch DIPA. 
This beer is exceptional and very deserving of the accolades that have come it's way so far. If I could get this locally, it would be a once-a-week purchase and I think a lot of people would think the same way. In this day and age of johnny-come-latelys and ticker mentalities, that really says something! 1,080 charactersRochefort10nh, Sep 15, 2011
3.94/5  rDev -15.3%look: 3 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Appearance -- Pours a gently hazed golden toast hue with amber highlights and a slim sudsy white head. Not much in the lacing department.
Smell -- Firm honey malt base, lots of floral aromatic hops, and pine forest. There is a definitive whiff of diacetyl - slightly strong, though not too off-putting.
Taste -- Big flavors. Primarily pine resin from the hops along with floral and lychee flavors, There is a none-too-subtle caramel malt sweetness underlying all of the hop flavors. Diacetyl is perceptible in the flavor, though not as intensely as in the nose; think Alpine Brewing. Incredibly long resinous finish with lingering flavors of caramel malt sweetness and flowers. I should also add that the alcohol is frighteningly well-hidden.
Mouthfeel -- Medium-bodied, slightly light carbonation. A definite oily feel is on the tongue. It's good, but not stunning.
Overall -- This was a beer I was very excited to try, and while it's very good, I'm not sure if it necessarily deserves the unwavering praise it receives. Good flavors overall, and if it were distributed around me I'd consider picking it up whenever I needed a lupulin fix, but the lingering oily/bitter finish made me keep going back to my glass to get the taste out of my mouth.
If I had a blind tasting with Heady Topper and the Alpine Brewing IPA lineup, I don't know that I'd be able to pick it out of the bunch. I'm not sure if this says more about Alchemist or Alpine...
Additional Notes - The first can I opened was so full of sediment that I couldn't finish it. It looked like somebody had dumped sand into my glass. Pour carefully. 1,614 charactersyeahnatenelson, Sep 15, 2011

The first thing I think of with the aroma is straight hops in the face. The aroma is very crisp and refreshing, I could sit and smell this for a while.
The flavor is very hoppy and juicy, like biting into a hybrid hop fruit of all the aromas in one. There is the right amount of bitterness and a nice sweetness that cuts through it.
The mouthfeel is smooth, a little more creamy and thicker then I was expecting, moderate carbonation. Though, as a whole everything works well together.
This is an incredible beer, the best DIPA/IPA I have had in a long time and possibly ever. 710 charactersseanwhite, Sep 15, 2011

Opening the can releases a huge hop bouquet. The normal players are there with some pine and lots of citrus. I drank it from the can, so while I've had it in the glass, for the purpose of this description I can't tell you what it looked like. But it tasted like hop heaven. Following the aroma it's loaded with citrus and a little pine and some other fruits. It's bitter and dry like a Double IPA should be. It finished that way but is not harsh and leaves a pleasant after taste that lingers on for further enjoyment.
This rivals any DIPA I've ever tried... 700 charactersharsley, Sep 15, 2011

I didn't listen to the "Drink from the can" instructions and poured into Hair of the Dog tulip. Reviewed on 9/14/11.
A: Pours a slightly hazy golden orange with fluffy whitish head that leaves some nice lacing around glass.
S: Tons of hops of all varieties, citrus, pine and some tropical fruit in there as well. Hints of sweet malt blend well with all the hops and there is very little detectable alcohol.
T: A bit of hop bitterness at first but far less than many DIPAs. Extremely smooth and resinous, tons of pine, floral, citrus and other fruity hops along with some honey and sweet malt as well. The hop flavors and malt mingle and balance each other out perfectly. Leaves an extremely pleasant lingering taste of hops with some sweetness from the malt. Delicious!
M: Very smooth and slightly creamy medium body with low-moderate carbonation, no sharpness whatsoever.
O: Possibly the most drinkable DIPA that I have ever had, much more balanced than most DIPAs that are tipping the IBU scale. Packed from start to finish with delicious hops.

-Hoppy bite in the nose, bitter citrus, very pulpy and pithy. Orange and grapefruit with some caramel sweetness, with literally no alcohol. 
-Very bitter with grapefruit and rind, with pine and sticky resin. Orange peel and pulp, followed by some apricot tones. Decent malt backbone with bready malts and caramel backbone. Fairly sweet but very balanced with the intense hop bitterness. Finishes dry and bitter with extremely little alcohol. 
-Medium body, nice carbonation, sticky and wet on the tongue, lingering finish. Very drinkable, flavorful, and balanced. This is a DIPA for the ages. 774 charactersxnicknj, Sep 14, 2011

A: Pours a hazy golden amber color with a 1.5 finger head disapating quickly leaving behind some really nice lacing. 
S: Fresh squeezed citrus juices and sweet pineapple in the nose. 
T: Grapefruit, pineapple, and a little bit of a sweet malt flavor, fruits became more pronounced as it warmed. 
M: Medium carbonation. clean, crisp, smooth.
Overall: Cant wait to get my hands on a couple more cans. 500 charactersike4tay45, Sep 13, 2011
4.6/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks Chris.
A- Cloudy, hazy, chunks of yeast or hops. Pale golden orange color.
S- Pineapple, citrus, navel oranges, lots of pine and pine sap. Very Dank.
T- So awesome. Very clean, lots of citrus, tangerine and pineapple lead the way with a brisk move towards a very nice piney resin finish. Nice and dry. The hop profile is balanced in the sense that the progression from citrus/tropical fruits to piney bitterness is just amazing. The malt and sweetness levels are present in this beer yet they dont overshadow the hops, they just provide a nice background to let the hops play.
M- Good carbonation levels. Nice hop resin notes. Clean tasting.
O- This is one amazing dipa. As the label says this is not the most bitter or most insanely dry-hopped dipa. It is however one of the best that I have ever had. The hop profile as I mentioned above is perfectly balanced. The hops are present from start to finish and each hop element has depth. A very awesome beer. 969 charactersnas5755, Sep 12, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed on our deck as the sun sets behind Camel's Hump.
I poured a little into a wine glass to look at and smell, then drank the rest straight from the can as recommended. This review is a composite of impressions from both approaches.
A: Very cloudy, dark straw color. Head was a little thin and weak, but a viscous looking brew nonetheless.
S: Melons, mangos, lemons, grapefruit and cannabis. I don't want to crawl into the can like John, but I'd like to get more of my nose in there. Fantastic.
T: Sweet malt supports loads of wonderful hop flavor perfectly. All the flavors suggested by the aroma are there, sometimes blending and sometimes standing out as single notes for a second or 2. Like hop candy, as someone else mentioned. Alcohol is detectable but you have to look for it. Extremely smooth finish that lingers forever. I can still taste it 20 minutes after finishing the beer.
M: Very smooth, medium-light body. Bitterness is never harsh at any point. I feel this is where HT distinguishes itself from PtE; Pliny has a rather harsh hop bitterness by comparison... this is the only substantial difference. Both are super world class beers but, IMO, HT pulls ahead by a nose here. My only quibble is that carbonation seems slightly low.
O: It's unfair to cap this rating at 5. HT deserves a 6 (at least) for overall drinkability. Sublime and dangerous, as the alcohol is not really noticeable, and it comes in pint cans! 1,439 charactersskivtjerry, Sep 10, 2011

Shared with a friend yesterday, poured a yellow orange with some fairly sticky white head, not it's strong suit. Smell is mango, pine, orange, & a little floral. The best smelling IPA ever, at this point. Taste is same, so perfect. My expectations were sky high and this beer delivered the goods. Mouthfeel wonderful & plenty carbonation. Best DIPA I have had, so easy to drink it is scary. Thanks to Bruce & Rick for leaving this on my porch, like a gift from God. 523 charactersSawDog505, Sep 09, 2011

How often does this serendipity happen?
DRINK FROM THE CAN! screams across the top of the can, and so, when camping, do as when in Vermont. And I'll buy the argument, keep these aromatics trapped in so they just burst back into your nose when you burp. Deal. But in the interest of having my coworker experience the pleasure, I pour myself a glass, and he drinks the can. 
Finally, after an untiring weekend of attempting to punish the aluminum for its contents, I sight the colour of the liquid inside. And it is glorious in the Innis and Gunn goblet. Murky orange, dark tangelo on top fading into a lemony haze at the bottom of the glass. Awesome with hop residue and suspended yeast. I can get down with this.
Oranges, felled spruce trees, grapefruit rind, lemon curd, and wisdom zest overpower the malt that is obviously there when you take a sip. Juicy as a unicorn fart. The malt becomes evident when drinking but the crisp bitterness soon takes your hand and leads you away, astray, allaying any of your fears. For this beer is merely 8% and comes in a way too drinkable pint sized serving. Alcohol concealed behind a double curtain of hops.
This is the camping beer for a new breed of man. And so..we shall drink this on the moon next year. 1,436 charactersdragonWhale, Sep 07, 2011
4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Got this beer as a gift from a friend. Canned less than 48 hours before, this beer had it going on! Nose was ripe with pine and a peach like citrus notes. The taste was pretty much the same. HT didn't have the usual very bitter finish of most IPAs. It finished rather subdued and dry, which made it quite drinkable. The mouthfeel was smooth and creamy... lots of little bubbles. Truly a fantastic, world class, IPA. Looking forward to getting more of this gem. 460 charactersLOCAL, Sep 05, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 516oz tallboy, straight from the can, less than 24hrs old.
This is the second time I've been able to drink Heady at home, and it's even better this time. The can is awesome, I love the artwork, and it's shiny!
The nose is really fresh, piney and citrus, it's fruity and crisp, and it's at least as good as on tap, but I'd say it is better than it was in the bottle. However, the aroma is a bit hard to pick up through the can.
Taste is just like hop candy, it's sweet and creamy with a really nice earthy and bitter bite to it that isn't too bitter but it's very refreshing and delightful. The mouthfeel is booming, big full and chewy - just the right amount of carbonation to be refreshing but not sharp.
To me, this is the perfect beer - I love cans, especially tall boys, it's easy drinking, perhaps too easy because there is not even a hint that this is 8% for better or worse, and it's the best IPA I've ever had so now in a can, you just can't beat it! 961 characterskingcrowing, Sep 03, 2011
4.53/5  rDev -2.6%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.25 |  overall: 4.752nd can consumed the day of the release. First drank from can, second poured into a tulip glass:
A: Pours a dark orange (lighter orange in a pint glass), hazy, with a little over 2 fingers of tight white head with great retention and picture perfect lacing. The can is pretty awesome to boot (maybe the first can I enjoyed drinking from). 
S: Holy hop heaven. Pretty intense citrus and tropical fruits: orange/tangerine, a little lemon, mango, maybe pineapple, just a big depth of fruit. It doesn't end there, a big helping of pine and floral notes are present as well as a touch of herbal dankness. Slight bit of sweetness. About as good as it gets.
T: As good as it gets. Few beers with unbelievable aromas have a taste that matches it. This is one of them. In fact, I think the taste is even better than the aroma. HUGE hop character with a ridiculous depth of tropical fruits, pine, and floral notes that only seems to get stronger and more complex as it lingers in the mouth. The "wave after wave of hops" comment is not an exaggeration. The body is perfect, just enough sugar sweetness to add depth and juiciness to the hops, but not enough to make it a sweet beer. A clean toasted malt base with absolutely NO alcohol noticeable and no imperfections in terms of esters/alcohol products. The bitterness builds to a solid bitter finish and again, the hops are almost as strong in the finish as the start. 
M: Medium body, moderate carbonation, maybe the cleanest and easiest drinking DIPA next to Pliny. Drinks better than most 4% session beers. Unbelievably smooth. The only improvement I can see is a bit more sticky. 
O: This is easily one of the 3 best DIPAs I've ever had up there with Hill Farmstead Abner and Double Galaxy. It's pretty much as perfect as it gets. 1,780 charactersSatchboogie, Sep 03, 2011

Poured from can into glass
A- Nice 1 finger head that quickly turns foamy and bubbly. Retention is good and the body has a good amount of carbonation jetting toward the head. The beer is a slightly hazy orange up to the light and murky orange away from it, looks very good. Nice lacing is left after the head resides. Starting off great.
S- Nice piney scent that dominates. definitely some bitter citrus is there as well as a hearty malt presence. 
T- Big piney bitter bite that carries from front to back. A slight citrus sweetness pokes its head out somewhere in the middle to make it a nice combination of all things that make IPAs great. Strong bitterness lingers on the finish that is in between wet and dry. Top Notch.
M- Medium to lighter feel that has a similar carbonation feel. Nice and smooth DIPA
O- Fantastic DIPA! As if the trip through beautiful Vermont and New Hampshire wasn't enough, this beer is great. Good luck to the Alchemist Cannery, the future brewpub and the town of Waterbury that was hit incredibly hard by Irene. Great Job! 1,242 charactersGushue3, Sep 02, 2011

I'm gonna give it a 5 for appearance since it's a sexy can. Nose is lovely and leafy hops all over the place. I get some sugary pale malt, maybe super-light caramel and more piney/earthy hops than you could shake a stick at.
Palate is lovely! Smooth upfront and then bracing bitterness comes flowing in. It's not aggressive in that it's not all at once. It builds up to being super bitter. Malt is very much in the background on this one. Leafy herbal hops all day.
Notes: Amazing. Simply amazing. So glad to have the option to drink this at home! And I'm really happy for them that they have this "backup" plan. I'll be sure to do (drink) my part! 804 charactersSFLpunk, Sep 02, 2011

Served in Delirium goblets.
Pours a hazy pale orange color with a fluffy, but fading white head. Lots of sticky and patchy lacing rims the glass.
A big whiff of pine and wild flowers blast out of the gate. A resinous hop aroma rises and pulls a dry malty smell, along with some perfumy citrus and a little mellow rum.
The tastes follow the aromas very closely. Very hoppy, with bright orange zestiness, yet held in check by a solid caramel malt with some honey sweetness.
So flavorful, yet so drinkable! 553 charactersBeerResearcher, Aug 06, 2011
4.81/5  rDev +3.4%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Review from notes. Consumed on 12/12/10.
Pours a very surprisingly dull, murky, tan leathery, apricot/peach golden color. This is quite different than I remember it on tap. In the past it was the clarity of this beer that had me so impressed before I even brought it to my nose. Two fingers of bright white creamy head sit atop this monster. The lace starts to appear as the head dissipates, sparatic rocky all over my tulip. Thin streams of bubble trickle to the top, showing its moderate carbonation.
Hops, hops, hops. Tons of fruit, mainly grapefruit. This beer is DANK. Somehow it actually smells sticky. Hint of malt sweetness is buried in there. Maybe slightly herbal. I'm impressed.
Follows the nose. Great hop bitterness and crazy fruitiness. The bitterness lingers after every sip. There is a sweetness the starts to show as it warms, almost caramel like.
Medium to full bodied. A slight prickle on te tounge. Light carbonation, but just enough to keep you drinking.
This brew is amazing. I could drink it all day everyday. The only real draw back to this was the color, it just wasn't what I remembered from it on tap. Still amazing though. Glad I was able to drink and share several of these bottles last winter. Now I'm just waiting for those cans... Now that's a game changer. Damn. 1,300 charactersHopStoopid120, Aug 06, 2011

A - Hazy orange body with a delicious white head. The beer sticks and leaves lacing all down the side of the glass. This looks delicious.
S - Waves of hops. Unbelievably delicious citrus and floral hops. It has the strongest citrus hop aroma I've ever smelled. It's wonderful.
T - Great hop flavor up front that just lasts and lasts. Somewhere in the distance is a slight sweetness to balance it out. There is hardly any bitterness, so it only takes the slightest bit of malt to keep this guy balanced.
M - Slick and easy to drink. A gulpable IPA. I put back 3 of these easily. The low bitterness with such a strong hop character is remarkable and allows this beer to be quaffed with ease.
O - The best IPA I have had and a great endnote for my east coast beer trek. Worth the drive and something I hope to get once it is canned! 915 charactersAlieniloquium, Aug 03, 2011
4.5/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5On tap at The Alchemist, 8/1/11. Several 12 oz. pours were enjoyed at a bargain of $4 each. This goes down so easy.
Once upon a time, somewhere in a BA post, I said Heady Topper was good but not as great as all the hype. Well, that was clearly me writing with a hangover or a head injury, because this is a fabulous beer.
Color is a subtle amber, with a nice firm head and solid lacing that sticks. Nose is hoppy and floral with mild bitterness. Good carbonation, easy on the mouth and doesn't burn out the tastebuds. Flavors are hoppy, floral, mildly bitter, and maybe some muted citrus notes. Not as bold as or captivating as Pliny but clearly a well-balanced, top-shelf IPA. I enjoyed a couple glasses with dinner while munching on a chevre salad and a nice cuban panini, ironically while chatting with a man who is trying to bring a craft brewery to Cuba. Cool.
John's plan to can this beautiful beer for wider distribution is by far the best move by a small brewery in recent memory. Well played sir. Cheers! 1,016 charactersElGallo, Aug 02, 2011

S-Wow this is disturbingly hoppy. Wreaks of dry-hopping. Luscious, ripe, juicy tropical fruits. Literally smells like perfume. A wonderful fragrance. The hops waft into my nostrils. Very excited to sip.
T-Blew me away. Unbelievably long lasting taste of grapefruits, apricots, mango, oranges, clementines and pineapples. Just purely juicy and fresh. Excellent bitterness, it does not over exceed its bounds and make you forget about the hop bouquet. Resinous and dripping of hop oils. Packs a plethora of fresh cut grass and crushed pine needles too. Quite possibly the best tasting thing that has entered my mouth. A divine amalgamation of tropical fruit fit for the gods.
M-Perfect carbonation. Slick, resinous feel. Big bodied and excellent. Begs to be gulped, not sipped.
O/D-Heady Topper defines my love for craft beer. Just amazingly delicious and perfectly crafted. There is absolutely nothing about Heady Topper that is not excellent. Well worth the long drive to drink this all night. And the cherry on top...$4 for a twelve oz. pour of week old Heady Topper. Perfect.

4.15/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4After hearing so much about it and enjoying a visit to the Alchemist last fall when it was not on-tap, I finally got to try Heady Topper the evening before the Vermont Brewers Festival.
A: The beer arrived in a 12 oz. glass, a luscious, deep, hazy orange-amber with a big foamy head as implied, which dissipated slowly leaving sticky rings along the edges. Certainly a looker.
S: Grassiness, maybe even a hint of floral, lead the nose followed by tropical fruitiness--I wouldn't quite call this grapefruit, but I'm not sure what it is. Very pleasant and inviting.
T: Malts are much more predominant than I had expected with the hops tending more toward citrus and pine than the grass the nose had suggested. Much sweeter and less bitter than I had imagined or would prefer, the hops and malts seem well-balanced but neither seem to take a lead. It's a matter of personal preference, but I definitely prefer IIPAs that tend toward drier, less sticky-sweet. That said, this was quite tasty.
M: The taste is dry, but the mouthfeel is quite sticky and oily. The beer is medium-bodied and pleasant to drink, but really begs a glass of water to replenish following the glass.
O: I'm glad I finally tried this beer, but for me it didn't really live up to the hype. It was good and I wish I'd noticed that it was on cask as I'd love to try that, but personally I think the Alchemist IPAs I've had--Rapture and Holy Cow--are better than Heady Topper. That said, I'd gladly order this again (especially for the bargain $4, which probably makes this the best IIPA I've had per dollar) and am looking forward to trying it from the can. 1,628 charactersFrankLloydMike, Jul 20, 2011

Liked it so much we made our way out to Waterbury for dinner @ The Alchemist Pub on Sunday night. Had four of these with dinner (including one on Cask) along with some other really excellent beers.
I thought I'd had some really good DIPA's, but this one is def at the top of the list. I also tasted Lawson's @ VBF and this one is easily on par if not slightly above Lawsons.
A - They pour 12oz glasses at the brew pub. Comes out looking nice and unfiltered, a nice cloudy bronze reminiscent of unfiltered apple cider.
S - A thing of beauty. Hoppy, sweet, tangy, piney. Didn't know what to think after the first sniff, only that it had to be something special.
T - Huge fan of this style, I've had some of the better ones that his country has to offer. I would make the trip to VT just to go to Alchemist. Wish they did growler fills so that I could bring some home with me. One of the best beers I've enjoyed this year.
M - Great body and thickness. Excellent carbonation, there really isn't much missing from this beer. 
Will def be going back for VBF next year and this is easily one of the reasons why. 1,154 characterstdawgydog, Jul 19, 2011

Super creamy thick frothy shaving cream head sits atop a hazy apricot body. Sticky lace clings like crazy. Smell is cut wet grass and fresh hop leaf. Taste is pure delicious citrus hop infused goodness. Bitterness climbs in from behind. Slight malt backbone with a little roasty alcohol. Oily and resinous hop mouthfeel, yet crisp. Citrusy and grassy the whole way through.
Lived up to every expectation. Excessively fresh & delicious. 507 charactersggilman, Jul 18, 2011

A: It pours a amber to golden color with some orange hues and very low clarity (hop haze!). There is a good size two finger head that appears to be seriously thick. It hangs around for a minute and slowly fades leaving behind a good amount of sticky lacing.
S: This beer just smells like a tropical/citrus fruit explosion. The hops are smashing my nostrils with heaps of mangos, papayas, grapefruit, and some skunk funk. The malt is buried under the lupulin haze, but I am not complaining.
T: The taste doesn't let down. The hops are way upfront with a load of citrus and tropical fruit. Mid-palate there is a twinge of caramel sweetness from the malt with a hint of dough. That is short lived as the backside culminates in another huge wave of hops with a good dry finish.
M: Medium bodied with a lush, full carbonation.
O: I would say this is the best DIPA I have had to date. I can't wait until the start canning this brew! 966 charactersNeffbeer, Jul 16, 2011

Nice cloudy, hazy appearance. Sticky lacing as it slides down the glass. 
Best smelling Beer I've ever had. Just great. Tropical and dank at the same time. I love a pure citrus/tropical DIPA, but this type is my favorite. It adds that little extra dank grass to push it over the top.
Taste follows the aroma. Hops everywhere. Tropical fruit and some of that stinky pine. The malts are beat down as they should be here. Delicious.
Creamy, sticky mouthfeel. Perfect for this beer. I can't wait til this comes out in cans. It will be a staple my house. Another amazing VT DIPA. 602 charactersBarlow, Jul 07, 2011

The Alchemist in Waterbury, VT has been producing wonderful elixers for years, but I personally believe brewed perfection with this IPA. The hoppy aroma just wafts itself in your direction, giving you goosebumps as you anticipate your first sip. 
This incredibly hoppy brew will stick to your tongue, making any other IPA compete for 2nd Place.

Smells great. Dominated by big booming aroma of pine. A little earthy with citrus coming through.
Tastes even more amazing. Once again the earthy pine flavors are up front. The citrus gives it a little sweetness. Nice bitter snap at the end.
What I really like about this beer is that the body is just right. Its pretty light focusing mostly on the hops. It's quite easy to drink due to the lightness of the body. You could drink a bunch of these and not feel full or have your mouth all tied up by stickiness. 625 charactersBuggies, Jun 07, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Look forward to this being canned.
Appearance: This one has a nice deep, hazy golden color to it with little traces of hops throughout the pour. Nice pure white head follows. I noticed that after having one of the bottles for over a week what originally was some slight residual hops in the bottle turned into a heavy amount of hops in the bottom of the bottle.
Smell: This has all the great tropical smells to it -- mainly citrus- orange rind with some pineapple,grapefruit and a little mango. No pine notes here which is fine by me. I'm all about the Tropical citrus smells in my IPA's. I can tell you from having this once before that this beers smells change completely in a weeks time. Kind of has this funky- strong smell now after it being another week old. Unique in the smell. Drink em up now guys!
Taste: Its like drinking orange juice with a nice bitter finish. I like that there is not a ton of malt to the taste yet it still has enough to keep the bitterness somewhat in check. There is a slight biscuit flavor on the end of the taste as well.
Mouthfeel: Nice amount of carbonation to keep the hop flavors swirling around on the palate to deliver the great,fresh flavor to be had in this beer.
Drinkability: Great beer and am very happy to have got to try it. I will be seeking this one out when it hits in cans which now looks like it will be a while. IPA's are my favorite and this is another to add to the list. 1,432 charactersRampage1, May 17, 2011

D: Made it a point to go to the Alchemist just for this beer, it was well worth the trip. A very solid, top tier east coast IIPA that was well balanced and the 8% ABV is hardly noticeable. 749 charactersmavbrew, Mar 27, 2011
4.2/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Poured into a tulip glass at the Alchemist
Poured with a healthy .5 in head, cloudy appearance with an orange/golden color. Much "murkier" looking than most DIPA's, but still inviting.
Smell is a whole lot of pine to me... hints of citrus obvious, but the pine really dominates. All in all though not an overly floral DIPA, but still a decent amount to work with.
Taste is lots of pine up front.... finishes bitter but not overly so. Citrues notes throughout, but not overwhelming as with some DIPA's. 
Mouthfeel is very smooth, and in turn very easy to drink. Not particularly crisp per se, but certainly pleasant. A very good DIPA.... not in my absolute upper echelon (double trouble, PTE, PTY, and Pure Hoppiness) but just a slight step below it. Certainly seek it out if you're in the area. 798 charactersmechamifune, Mar 25, 2011
4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5The Heady Topper from Alchemist. I had this on tap at the brewpub and was very eager to finally have gotten a chance to experience this beer. This beer is awesome in so many ways. First its great to see an east coast brewery making a super hoppy beer. The aroma is piney/citrusy hops that blast your face(but in a good way). The taste has a nice malt backbone to help let the hops shine but not destroy you. A really excellent beer from a great brewpub.

4.5/5  rDev -3.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Bottle consumed a few months back.
A: Golden orange body with a pillowy off-white head that sticks around for a bit before leaving solid lacing down the sides of the glass.
S: Beautifully bitter grapefruit, orange, pine, and resinous oil. Thick and layered. Easily could get lost for minutes just exploring the aroma.
T: Ever so slightly a fall off from the nose. The Hops didn't quite "pop" with the same intensity as in the aroma. Still, the was quite complex, delicious, and top notch.
M: Creamy smoothness. Medium bodied with appropriate carbonation. One of the really nice things was with all of the bitterness, it managed to not be prickly or raw.
O: A very nice dIPA that deserves to be up with the big boys. I'd imagine super-fresh on tap would take this a notch higher. 783 characterscallmemickey, Mar 19, 2011

I made the half hour trip to try this well reviewed beer and it mostly lived up to the hype.

4.37/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Thorpe429 for supplying the bottle. Sampled just a couple weeks after bottling and poured into a Darkness snifter (being a glassware fanatic, I was quite envious when I noticed that Mike possessed the official Heady Topper glass, bastard, but very cool)
Really excited to try this and very generous of Mike to share the bottle.
Beers pours a traditional light light golden color that was a slightly hazy. A little lighter than expected and I likened it to a lightly paler and more hazy PtE.
Smell was all hops with no real malt to speak of...very nice.
Taste was certainly delicious and it lives up to its name, but I may have played it up a bit more in mind than I should have. Some nice bitterness and citrus flavors. 
Mouthfeel was spot on with nice carbonation and this is certainly a beer that I could sit and drink all day.
Thanks again Mike! 864 charactersLunch, Mar 04, 2011

Lots of lacing coats the side of my glass. Some hop floaties in the beer, which I think just adds to this. I can smell the hops before I even lift the glass off the table. Lots of resiny pine and citrus hops in the aroma. Very nice bitterness, but there seems to be a malt balance as well. This is certainly one of my favourites. 432 characterskwjd, Feb 24, 2011
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5An exceptional IPA from John Kimmich in Waterbury. The heady is about perfect from start to finish. It's slightly cloudy just after pour. You can smell the floral aroma from about 1 foot away. Some IPA's can overpower with hops but this one is all about balance and subtly. They will be releasing the heady in cans late April. I hope they keep the same magic from the tap to the can. 383 characterswillyvt, Feb 24, 2011
4.88/5  rDev +4.9%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Appearance: A hazy dark copper with whispy thin white lacing and a thin head.
Aroma: Sweet citrus, orange peel, a little piney, fresh cut grass.
Taste: Hop bitterness revealing orange peel and zest and grapefruit flavors too. A little sweetness settles in but the flavor profile is dominated by herbal and citrus hops. 
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied beer, good carbonation.
Drinkability: Easy drinking beer. This is a great IIPA. 428 charactersPentastar, Feb 23, 2011

The hop aromas, very C-hop, are very satisfying and very fresh as if I am at the brewery now , as if hand bottled. Great lacing and head. Unfiltered look and taste, a full mouthfull.

4.64/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Had on tap from a freshly tapped keg at the Alchemist Pub and Brewery in Waterbury, VT. Served in a 12 oz glass. 
Look: great looking DIPA. Hazy amber color, but the Alchemist is a bit dim so its hard to tell exactly the color. A finger and a half worth of head sits atop the beer with excellent retention and excellent lacing. 
Smell: huge hop aroma. Tropical fruit like pineapple, citrus with some grapefruit and lemon-lime, hints of pine and some caramel sweetness lurking around back there. Exceptional. 
Taste: follows the nose with a huge hop flavor. Some resin, huge citrus flavor, bits of pineapple and grapefruit, orange, and lemon... everything you could want in a hop profile. There's a bit of caramel maltiness to balance but its not really pronounced. Exceptional taste.
Feel: medium bodied and feels about right at 8% alcohol by volume, with a moderate amount of carbonation that is perfect for the style, a bit of lingering hop bitterness in the finish but not so much that it kills your palate. Alcohol is nicely hidden. 
Drink: great. I drank my glass a bit faster than I would've liked and you'll have to force yourself to savor this one. Could drink a few of these and its very sessionable for a DIPA, only coming in at 8% alcohol.
Overall, I am quite impressed by this one. This has become my favorite DIPA. Everything about it is great, from the hop profile, the meek presence of the malt, the way it looks, the way it smells... everything. The Alchemist did a great job with this one. 
I should also add that I went into this one with a heavy dose of skepticism. Having had Pliny the Elder, which is generally promised to be the end all be all of DIPAs (excluding the Younger, of course) and being very disappointed I thought that Heady Topper would be a product of the BeerAdvocate hype machine. Well, its not. Its the ultimate DIPA and I recommend trying it as soon as you possibly can. Hopefully The Alchemist begins a production line soon because more people need to try this.
Cheers! 2,018 charactersSkunkWorks, Feb 14, 2011

4.3/5  rDev -7.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5got this one in a trade with freud. huge thanks man!
22oz bottle. bottled 11/30/2010. sampled 12/11/2010.
pours hazy orangey amber with a big fluffy off-white head. haze is likely due to pouring the entire bottle including the dregs. the head drops slowly and leaves tons of lace as it falls.
aroma is great. there be hops in there! candied grapefruit and orange. pine. layers of tangerine, apricot, and perhaps even some pineapple. light alcohol. white bread, cracker, and a bit of biscuit. caramel. touch of butterscotch hiding in the background.
taste is good. citrus and pine with a solid malt backbone. grapefruit and orange. bit of tangerine. resiny pine. whole wheat bread and biscuit. bit of cracker. light alcohol. just above medium bitterness level. caramel with a bit of the butterscotch that i noticed in the aroma. the other hoppy layers from the aroma are still present, but at a more subdued level. herbal and earthy hop layers start to appear here, giving it a bit of an english dimension to an otherwise american brew.
mouthfeel is great. just above medium body with a nice dry hoppy finish. medium carbonation level.
drinkability is great. the bitterness never overpowers the solid malt footing. the alcohol is almost unnoticed until a little warmth starts to grow in my stomach around mid-glass. nice hoppy depth. i enjoy the balance of this one - certainly not a palate shredder, and not as in-your-face as some, but it's got much more repeatability as a result. good stuff! 1,500 charactersgrub, Feb 04, 2011
3.83/5  rDev -17.6%look: 4 | smell: 3.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4Big thanks to baconsausage for shipping this towards the Arctic Circle along with a slate of other great beers. The IPA fiend in me has really been looking forward to this one. 22 oz. bottle split into two pint glasses, with the floaties & several ounces left for later potential rumination.
Pour is wide-mouth orange, clear without the hop poop left in the bottom of the bottle. Smell is startlingly bitter, citrus, pine, & touches of raw onion. 
Heady Topper is perhaps the oiliest IPA that's crossed my mucous barrier. Bitterness street-sweeps the senses, separating into grapefruit, citrus, & a knifeful of onion. Strangely reminiscent of Gubna. Definite tang in the back-end, astringent, before the bitterness throttles the life out of everything else in the finish. Strangely, it affects my tongue more than anything else. Bizarre. 
Very drying, invitingly sippable, this is a very good beer, but not sure what all the hoopla is about. Not to say I'd ever turn one down! 979 charactersmaximum12, Jan 26, 2011

Pours a golden orange color. Some hop floaties are floating around but that doesnt bother me. What bothers me is this beers head is terrible for an IPA. Usually their awesome sticky lookin heads. Not great lacing.
Wow. Amasizing citrucy hops even after being a month and a half old. How did this smell when it was days old? Can't wait to try it then. Mango, orange, lemon, grass. Awesome.
Taste is so well balanced. Reminds me of a hopslam in balance but this is better for sure. I'm gunna have to open one of the fresh hopslams I just got in a trade to compare. Tons and I mean tons of hop flavor. Citrucy goodness. The malt backbone complements it perfectly.
Mouthfeel is perfect. Perfect carb and maltiness.
I could have drank a couple bombers of this. I shouldn't have shared it. Lol. But it was shared with another beer lover that deserved to try it. I am for sure in debt to Sideswipe and will have to give him something amazing. Thanks again man 1,062 charactersPeprSprYoFace, Jan 22, 2011

A: Poured a nice copper color with a nice, thick, off-white head (roughly one finger). Left very fine lacing on the edge of the glass.
S: Overwhelmingly smells of fresh, citrus-y hops with a hint of sweetness running behind it, presumably from the malt. 
T: Very fresh. The taste closely follows the nose, but in the best possible way. The malt and hop tastes make quite the combination. A little bit of herbal/grassy taste comes through with a bitter finish.
M: Very good, the level of carbonation was nice and it sat on the tongue quite nicely. It was ever-so-slightly dry, but all that did was enhance the flavor. 
D: Very good. I finished my half of the bottle more quickly than I meant to, and I was disappointed that there wasn't any more. A very fine beer, and it's a shame that I probably won't get my hands on another anytime soon. 918 charactersmjyoung, Jan 16, 2011
4.29/5  rDev -7.7%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4I've had Heady Topper many times at either the pub or the VT Brewers Fest. None of those occasions really allowed me to do a review. Recently, a friend moved to VT and got me a special release bottle of this wonderful beer.
Heady Topper pours a hazy copper color with a one-finger wide, creamy white head on top. The foam dissolves slowly to a thin sheet on the beer leaving behind a fair amount of lines of lace on the glass. Unfortunately, the bottle had many 'floaties' in it that hung in suspension for quite a while.
The strong hoppy aroma has notes of pine and grapefruit citrus with a little grass mixed in. A little bit of pepper and apricot is also present.
Each sip of this medium bodied beer is dry with moderate carbonation. The flavor begins with lots of pine, grass and grapefruit citrus. In the background pale malt and light fruit (apricot) help balance out the hops. Once gone the pine and grapefruit linger on the palate.
This is one of my favorite beers from New England that I wish I could get more often. But then, I'd be too spoiled. 1,059 charactersWanderingFool, Jan 16, 2011
4.4/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4At Kuhnhenn winter solstice (thanks to whomever shared this!)
Appearance- Copper and orange. Clear crisp and a really nice head. Definitely a solid looking DIPA.
Smell- lots of great hops on the nose. Pine, grapefruit, a hint of citrus. The pine was a bit too much I think but otherwise a very pleasant aroma. 
Taste- nice malt backbone supporting a great hop profile. Very tasty with all the different citrus and pine flavours coming off the hops but falls short I think of Pliny and Hopslam. Smells better than it tastes I think
Mouthfeel- decent carbonation, about the right thickness I think. Would be better on cask
Drinkability- a bit of bitterness and the overly pine nose turns me off to this one a bit 715 charactersUrbancaver, Jan 14, 2011
4.92/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Had on tap at the 12/4/10 bottle release at the Alchemist. Reviewing from notes.
Appearance- Poured by John Kimmich himself into a Heady Topper pint glass. Overflowing with about 2 or 3 fingers worth of head. Dark orangish color, almost copper. Cloudy with bubbles flowing quickly from the bottom of the glass.
Aroma- Heaven! The hops are phenomenal. I just want to bottle this smell and wear it as a cologne. The first smell I get is very citrusy. I smell oranges, grapefruit, piney notes, earthy tones. This is the best smelling beer in the world.
Taste- Beautiful in a word. The first taste you get hits you right in the face, a bitter-sweet taste of grapefruit and oranges. The perfect hop profile, it is somehow all at once extremely bitter, but not bitter at all. I can't explain it. It leaves your mouth semi-dry dieing to take another sip. The malt is really no where to be found... but it has to be there at 8%, which is also no where to be found. 
Mouthfeel- Great mouthfeel. Very full but in no way syrupy or thick. 
Drinkability- I could probably have about 10 of these in one sitting. Simply the best beer I've ever had.
My all time favorite beer... so far. 1,176 charactersdsartwell72, Jan 14, 2011
4.87/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Thank you, thank you, thank you profusely to akorsak for sharing this great beer with me last night 1/9/11. Poured slightly cool into a cervoise glass.
 The beer pours clear and golden with a skosh toward amber with a fairly large amount of ecru cap which rises and retains well. The lace clings amply with a tight bead. Carbonation is visibly moving gradually at a moderate pace upward. The beer is very attractive and exemplifies the color of Imperial Ipa's I tend to enjoy. The aroma is intense, a plethora of aromas - pine and strong pineapple greet my nostrils instantly. The smell of herbs, mild sweet grass and elements of citrus which could be tangelo and mellow mango. The floral elements work with a juicy grapefruity scent and lots of tropical notes join the fray so fresh smelling, so intense it is just jammed with beautiful hop aroma. The feel is smooth and very moderately carbonated which is nice as it doesn't push the bitterness to the forefront. There is lots of juicy and resinous texture with slightly sweet finish -not quite oily and not tangy just fits the style perfectly showcasing the depth of hop presence. 
 A wondeful taste experience - the exceptionally smooth citric bitterness blends with a juicy lightly tangy tropical quality and slightly sweet malt cushions the impact ever so slightly and not intruding at all. the juicy grapefruity and piney flavor is there in abundance it does have a mild mango aspect too with subtle acidic taste and mild resinous edge. I like that the fruity, semi-sweet passionfruit and honey like malt and green grassiness compliment each other so well. It has pineapple without all the acidity and tangy light astringency of grapefruit without going over the line with pithy rind notes. The citrus is like sweet less bitter lemon, maybe meyer lemon with a clementines juicy quality. I sipped on this and was dreading swallowing the last drops since it had such a delicious array of hop flavors I didn't want it to end. 
 Thanks Adam, really it brought a little sunshine to a cold winter's eve - the wonderful big IPA is a treat. You have to monitor yourself because the hops are so juicy you might forget you are drinking an alcoholic beverage. It is supremely drinkable and met every expectation, I just dind't have any idea how good it could be. I consider this possibly one of the best of the style, it is very near a perfect Imperial Ipa to me. Mr Korsak, thanks again for sharing this Heady topper with me. 2,475 charactersSlatetank, Jan 10, 2011
4.75/5  rDev +2.2%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Enjoyed last night as the first in a multi beer tasting in a small (8-10oz) snifter, split with multiple friends, last couple ounces left in the bottle still had some hop flakes and yeasty dregs in it.
A: Clear copper to a burnt orange, beautiful and as perfect as I could see for an IPA. Head settled to less than a quarter inch of whitish foam but left nice lacing on the glass. 
S: Have to say this one topped all others I've had, including PtE, as the nose (even ~1.5m old) reached out of the glass and crossed the room. Huge piney nose with notes of grapefruit and other citrusy hops with underlying earthy notes.
T: Damn good DIPA... phenomenal balance of just enough malt to counter the hop bitterness but not so much its cloying or overly astringent/bitter. Hop contribution to flavor is more of the same with citrusy notes taking the front stage and the piney/earthy ones slightly subdued. Taste is exceptional but isn't quite as strong/phenomenal as the smell.
M: Carbonation is a little on the low end (intentionally - note on the bottle indicating carbonation at pub draft levels) but is damn near perfect for this style and brew. Makes for easy drinking and keeps you wanting for more.
D: Could have kept this whole thing for myself and then some and would definitely be a standard stock in the fridge f it was available. 
Highly recommend! If you didn't know better it would definitely comes across as a top notch "west coast" DIPA - Excellent work by a top notch brewer/brewery! 1,495 charactersscray24, Jan 09, 2011

A: fantastically hoppy with a citrus overtone.
Ap: golden amber hue, fairly transparent. 2 finger white head with amazing lacing that lines the glass from top to bottom.
B/T: mildly carbonated, with a smooth and quite refreshing tongue feel. It lingers on the tongue for just the right amount of time to be considered perfect. 
Af: hits the tongue with a punch of citrus hops, but also a faint sweetness undertone. Leaves the mouth a little dry.
Overall: definitely gives Pliny the Elder a run for the money in the DIPAs. If only it were more readily available, it would be a staple in our fridge!

4.44/5  rDev -4.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Got a bottle in trade from beerometer, enjoyed with Jwiss22, from my notes for once...
A- A ridiculous color for a DIPA. Where is the hazy golden, amber color? No where, it has succumb to the light brown/dark caramel color similar to freshly brewed sun tea. I am almost transported back to summer time and the innocence of child hood. A wild looking color with a crazy amount of yeast swirling around and bouncing off the carb bubbles. This one is all capped off with a medium, fluffy white head. Astounding!
S- A barrage of pine, pine resin, grapefruit, citrus fruits and tropical goodness all come through at once. The aromas have staggered me, but I can't give up this one smells too incredible. It's a West Coaster that has found a home on the East Coast. A slight warming and the tropical, citrus and piney aromas are still leading an onslaught of my senses, but is accompanied with the sweet smell of caramel to balance this monster out. Amazing aromas, just want to keep sniffing and sniffing!
T- This one is all about the hops and does not disappoint. After all the smelling and anticipation here it comes...a smack of hops right upside my head. Pine, bitterness, pine resin, bitterness, citrus juice, grapefruit, more bitterness and some tropical hints to keep it all together. It's a crazy balance of hops that continue throughout each sip and seem to just keep coming. Oh yea there is a slight caramel sweetness quivering in the background to try and herd all of the hop nuances from spinning out of control and murdering your taste buds.
M- This one is not syrupy, but kind of oily in a way. It seems to stick to everything and coats every area of the mouth that can taste. It actually feels balanced in a way. The carb is not to tingly, the hops aren't to sticky and the slight sweetness keeps it all in check.
D- A definite hop bomb that is incredibly drinkable. Could drink this for any meal, brush my teeth with it and use it as mouth wash. High abv says no, no, no, but everything else says yes, yes, yes.
My first try of this one and sad to say it was a bottle, would love to try the draft and can't wait for the cans. Looks like the West Coast has found a little bit of competition. 2,207 charactersStormKing47, Jan 07, 2011
4.67/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Big thanks goes out to eggplantwiz for grabbing me this bottle. 
A: Pours a thin white head that recedes quickly. Light caramel colored, with an unfiltered appearance.
S: Malt first, then tropical fruit, like pineapple and mango.
T: Wow, this is good. Nice hops, more than a typical DIPA. The hops and the malt balance well, with the malt in the background as a complimentary flavor rather than a dominant one. Bitter hops start the beer off, then it goes to tropical fruits, mango. I also get a hint of a fruit I wouldn't normally find in a beer, maybe a honeydew melon. Then the beer ends with more bitter grapefruit hops.
M: Not too sticky. Sits well in the mouth without being syrupy like some DIPA's. The lack of stickiness makes it refreshing.
D: I could drink lots of this. It goes down easily and is such a complex and interesting beer.
This beer definitely lived up to the hype for me, I look forward to trying it again in the future. 944 charactersCaseyK, Jan 04, 2011
4.96/5  rDev +6.7%Had this on tap at the Alchemist about two months ago.
(A) Pour was amber/orange with a small head. But to be honest, the smell is what first hooked me and any thought of appearance was overshadowed.
(S) WOW, it was everything I could have expected and more. The aroma of hops are evident immediately. I smelled a citrus bomb (mainly grapefruit) offset nicely by herbal / pine. Nicely balanced.
(T) Well balanced and just as good as it smells. Although you clearly taste the hops it does not overpower the experience. The 8% APV is well concealed.
(M) Medium body and moderate carbonation, very easy to drink for am imperial IPA.
(D) One on the best beers I have had. I would like to try Pliny the Younger on draft and one day compare. 740 charactersscoot64, Jan 03, 2011

A: honey amber color with lots of floaties, which detracts from the appearance. If it didnt have these in there, it would be a 4+ in this category
S: piney citrus hop blast, smells yummy
T: grapefruit and hops, pine needles, bitter bite of a good IPA
M: medium bodied, oily but smooth and bitter, but not too much bitterness, well balanced
D: Its a good Double IPA, hoppy and bitter. However not in the top 5 and definately not a standout amongst the more familiar West Coast style Double IPAs. It reminded me of Stone Ruination. 
However to be fair, it was sent across country and not as fresh as it could be. I will reserve final judgement if I ever get to drink this superfresh. 
Overall, one of the better East Coast IPAs I have had. 775 charactersSolomon420, Jan 03, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to sisuspeed for this bottle.
A: The DIPA is darker, a fuller amber color that, when the bottle is emptied, is thick and brown. A finger and a half of white head laces in bands around the glass. When fully emptied, the ale has yeasty sediment suspended in it.
S: Mr. PtYounger, meet Mr. H. Topper. The nose is citrusy sweet, tropically lush. Pine is a heavy ingredient, adding resiny thickness. Pineapple, fresh pine needles, grapefruit. The leafy strength is impressive. Near the end, just enough caramel comes through to settle things down.
T: Oily smooth, the hops jump out immediately. Following the hops are more hops and more hops. Really, the bitterness rolls throughout each sip. Pine starts off, resiny thick, followed by the citrus blast. There is caramel, providing more balance than I initially suspected. Flat out hop heaven, an oily mess of hops that refuses to go away. The ale benefits from the pub draft level of carbonation, as advertised on the label.
M: Oily hops on top of resiny hops on top of tropical hops on top of caramel malts. The hoppiness steals the show but the balance is welcome.
D: The ale, admittedly, feels bigger than 8%. The hoppiness, strong as it is, benefits from the balance of the malt. An excellent IPA, even if it isn't quite the west coast hop bomb. 1,307 charactersakorsak, Jan 02, 2011
4.37/5  rDev -6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Thanks to KristinCooks for this one in a trade! I'm enjoying this while pre-gaming for a Phish show - my first Heady Topper and my first Phish show... I'm officially a ... hippie?
It pours with a short head and lovely lacing. I'm a bit late in drinking this - and I will have to make it to the brewery to have it freshly brewed - because this one is from the bottle release back in November. It's amber and rich, hazy and with some sediment in it. Lacing sustains throughout the glass. The smell is richly hoppy, with some excellent malts coming through in the nose too. Straight pine and rich goodness. 
Taste follows the nose, and is remarkably smooth. The cleanest finish I've had in a while, and I can definitely say that this is one East Coast IPA ready to take on the West Coast big guys. Not sure if it tops them - for that I'll have to drink it fresh.
UPDATE: had this on tap 2/23/11 at Blind Tiger. Thank you, Alan. This beer on tap looks better, smells more complete with more citrus and malts, and tastes just as hoppy and thick. I will never reject a Heady Topper. Definitely raising my review score on this. A- to A.
With a smooth medium body and drinkable crispness, The Alchemist Brewpub's Heady Topper is certainly a top IPA. Cheers to 2010! 1,260 charactersafksports, Dec 31, 2010
4.15/5  rDev -10.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Better than Pliny, eh? We'll see.
Pours a murky brownish-gold. Lot's of unfiltered stuff floating around in the glass.
Smell is slightly muted, but I can tell I'm in for an amazing DIPA. Perhaps I should let this warm up a bit more before I make any judgments. Pine, citrus, yum. Not getting as much aroma as I get from the Pliny (side by side comparison), although that might be because there's 2 weeks difference in the freshness between the two. 
 Well-rounded, it's a bit smoother than Pliny, not as much of a kick. But that's not necessarily a good thing in this category. Getting a little more complexity. I like it. Lots of pine and grapefruit flavor with a little something else in there that I can't put my finger on, maybe some apricot. 
Overall, this is an outstanding DIPA, but I think I'll have to have it on tap before I can decide whether it lives up to the hype or not. Either way, I will seek this out again if I am on the East coast. 
Well done, Alchemist. 979 charactersEstocker, Dec 31, 2010
4/5  rDev -14%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Bottle. Pours a light amber straw yellow color with a slight white head. Some sediment floating around. Danky type aroma of citrus and some pine type notes, some onion as well. Some lace. Medium mouthfeel. Slighlty sweet taste with a strong hop bitter flavor. Lingering bitterness. Does it live up to the hype? Hmm, it's decent but nothing that I think warrants the hype that it gets. 384 characterskbutler1, Dec 29, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks Alex for sharing this one, you generous SOB. 
Slightly hazed orange due to it's unfiltered nature, and the bottle was approaching it's end. In a tulip glass, there initially was a solid finger's width of white foam, fading to a wispy skim dotted with minor spotty lacing.
Huge tropical aroma, fresh hops galore, sweet citrus, bitter grapefruit, mango, resiny dank herbals. Rooty Tooty Fresh 'N Fruity.
Flavor is similarly fruity, with a big grapefruit presence, moderately bitter, lush and packed with resinous hop flavor and a slight undercurrent of pale malt sweetness. Sticky and dank. Body is fairly light, and with no trace of the abv, it's almost too easy to drink. "Carbonated to pub draft levels" as the label states. A bomber or two of this hop nectar would be awesome, on tap even better. Thanks again Alex! 827 charactersemerge077, Dec 29, 2010
4.22/5  rDev -9.2%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz. bottle re-reviewed. Thanks to Richard.
The nose was much improved vs. previous bottle. A huge pineapple citrus hop nose not present in the last bottle. Went from a 3.5 to a 4.5. Taste was pretty similar but it lacked the spicy hopiness and not just didn't have the bright hop character I wanted. It had a maltiness to it which prevented me from loving it as much. 
22oz. bottle generously shared by oreo. I normally don't review from tastings, but thought I would this time considering it was the first beer we had, its hyped up status and it being bottled for the first time.
It poured an amber honey orange with a decent cream fresh looking head with minimal lacing.
The nose had a medium to medium high amount of citrus orange with present levels of resinous pine. The nose is nice but not as bright and fresh or light as other world class examples I've had
The flavor really almost exactly mirror the nose with an addition of a spicy hop after taste. This spicy aftertaste reminded me of drinking the wort from a beer using a lot of fuggles hops. I know it sounds crazy, and I'm sure heady topper doesn't use fuggles but that particular hop to me has a distinct spicy aftertaste, much more so pre-fermentation, that my mind went right to the comparison. After the hop showcase a firm light neutral flavored malt sweetness became present.
Mouthfeel was medium light, right where I would prefer it, carbonation was just fine. Drinkability was great personally; no signs of alcohol and an inviting hop flavor with a nice malt finish. 
I really appreciated having the chance to sample this bottle but it only had room to disappoint considering the hype surrounding it. While a solid and good DIPA, it's no Piny killer. 1,731 charactersweatherdog, Dec 29, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Thanks to Steve for sending this out. 
Poured into pint glass.
Pours 1 finger of beige off-white head. Color is a burnt golden orange. Sediment in the glass.
Aroma: Dank, weedy hops. Onion flavors from what I think is summit hops. Grapefruit citrus. Very hoppy. Very weed-like. Massive hop attack.
Taste: Starts out with a big dank weedy hop bite. Huge hops. Hop resin. A bit of malt shows, but hardly any. Grapefruit citrus. Sticky goodness.
Mouthfeel: Bitter and sticky. Medium bodied with a good amount of carbonation. Ends sticky with a lot of hops.
Overall, this is a really solid DIPA. It is pretty drinkable. A lot of great flavors and very fresh. I had no problems with my glass of this. Good stuff. Thanks Steve! 727 charactersmothman, Dec 29, 2010
4.09/5  rDev -12%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a weak gold with tons of sediment and a dense head that lingers through the whole glass.
Smells fantastic of resiny pine, mild herbal notes and just a hint of citrus.
Taste is just a bit off of the smell. Slightly thinner but has an incredible lingering finish. Pine is the dominant note and the malts hang through the finish.
Feels smooth and creamy and is very nice to sip and appreciate the dominant pine notes. 420 characterskirok1999, Dec 28, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Completely unfiltered with tons of yeasty delicious sediment. An off copper translucent with a small white head.
Huge bops on the nose piney and resiny as can be and then a burst of citrus at the end, some light cereal grain and coffee eaters as well. 
Very piney earthy aromas thick drying in the middle with only a bit of that citrus on the finish. Oily and resiny with caramel and cereal quailities. Toffee is there as well a bit of sweetness with a forever finish. Great ipa and not one that falls into the everyday category 530 charactersmcallister, Dec 28, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Props to Masterhomebrewer for hooking me up with this in a trade!
A - Medium red/light brown in color, different for a DIPA. Slight haze with lots of "goodies" floating around if the bottled is swirled before pouring. Nice off-white head and no visible carbonation.
S - About as stinky and pungent as hops can get IMO. Thick alpha acid aroma, earthy, and musty. All other DIPAs please take note!
T - Sweeter than aroma suggests but one still has to chew through all the hop flavors. Tons of sticky alpha acids and nice residual sugars. Pretty much as good as it gets for the style but not a 5 because the hops could be a little fresher tasting in my book, but not by much. Back of bottle said to drink before New Year's Day and I had it Dec. 28. I'm sure having it straight from the tap would easily bump it to a "5".
M/D - Thick body and a little lower on carbonation than I prefer. Mouth drying bitterness in the aftertaste and super easy to drink for a hophead. Alcohol sneaks in with it's weight but none of the flavor.
An awesome treat to land this bottle and if it's ever bottled again I will do everything I can get snag another! 1,141 charactersVaTechHopHead, Dec 28, 2010

Tope head pretty good, looks good, nice retention and lacing...Aroma is really malty, lots of caramel, great to balance out the hops and alcohol. Hop presence is huge though, really good...The taste is also really malty, very different and unique for a dipa, but great to mask the hops and make it drinkable. Hops are more there in the feel. 422 charactersjrallen34, Dec 28, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +1.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.75This is a great beer, and a gold mine for hop heads! Thanks to TCassel1 (Todd) for the trade for this!
A: Dark Orange with lots of sediment floating around, which I like (unfiltered is great IMO). Small ring of head and some lacing cap it off. 
S: AWESOME Smell, huge hops and bready malts to boot. Tropical fruit, pine, citrus all appear. 
T: Awesome flavor, really great. Huge hop to malt ratio- Dry biscuit with floral and citrus hops presiding. Really tasty juicy center with dry finish and bitters. Great, complex flavor that just falls short of a 5. 
M: Great feel, man its great. Says pub level on the bottle, and thats how it feels. Low carb, smooth and huge palate of flavor. 
D: Insanely drinkable, wish I could live at the pub and get this on draft!! Great stuff. 779 charactersDreadnaught33, Dec 27, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks to Alex for sharing this one, again. He had shared one with me before, but I was drunk and kept falling asleep and don't feel like a review based on that experience would do this justice.
A - Copper colored beer with a nice, foamy head that dissipated to a solid cap, and left a bit of intricate lace.
S - Purly on the nose, this one blows you away. Huge hop aroma, with citrus, grass, pine, floral, and some awesome tropical notes. Not sure how they packed so much into this nose, but it is great.
T - Great tropical fruit, citrus, and floral taste with some bittering on the end. There is a strong carmel malt base to this beer. The taste is great, although not quite as good as the nose.
M - Medium bodied and crisp, it got a little sugary for me at the end, but still quite good.
D - One of the top DIPAs I've ever had. It really lived up to the hype and was a pleasure to drink. 895 charactersAgentZero, Dec 25, 2010
4.52/5  rDev -2.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Thanks to Kelp for hooking me up with a few bottles of this Vermont jewel! I have had this beer some years ago on tap at The Alchemist but that was before my reviewing days. Let's see how they did trying to capture the hop magic of this one in a bottle.
A-Hazy bronzed copper with a large off-white head that reduced to a thin ring and left spotty lace. Head revived nicely with a bit of swirling.
S-Impressive tropical fruit blast of mango and pineapple with support of spicy orange rind. A light touch of caramel malt sweetness adds moderate support and balance to the intense hop bill.
T-Huge tropical fruit hoppiness with a pleasant spicy bite following. A fairly robust but non intrusive malt bill of caramel and biscuit sweetness. Pineapple, mango grapefruit and orange peel bitterness strike out and assaults the palate. Absolutely delicious.
M-Medium bodied fairly sharp and crisp with long lasting hop bitterness. Hop astringency becomes quite present with warming offering up a drying finish.
D-Not the hoppiest, the biggest, the most bitter or the most spectacular IPA but in the end the hop and malt bill work wonders on the palate and makes for one mighty fine drinking brew. Thank you John Kimmich for producing such an impressive beer. 1,255 charactersDeuane, Dec 25, 2010
4.6/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Many thanks to a very generous BA for the opportunity to try this one, 22oz bomber.
Pours a bright, clear amber with a big pillowy white head with a rocky bottom fed by a steady stream of bubbles Retention is good and leaves a soapy collection of big bubbles on top with good lacing.
Aroma is wonderful and typical of a top-tier west coast DIPA. Tons of juicy citrus with oranges and pineapples mixed with a thick resinous pine aroma. Bit of biscuity malt in the background.
Flavor is just as good with an initial astringent citrus bitterness, pithy grapefruit, that flows into a more juicy citrus backbone with the oranges and pineapples coming back in. The finish is bitter and resinous, sticky with pine hops.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied and well carbonated with a wonderful stickiness clinging to the palate after each sip.
One of the best DIPAs I've had in recent memory and possibly the best east coast DIPA I've ever tasted. Super drinkable but with tons of hop character and bitterness. Really superb beer. 1,018 charactersgford217, Dec 25, 2010

A - Pours a reddish/copper color, cream-colored head, lots of lacing and a nice cap on top with bubbles here and there. 
S - Tropical fruits, dankness, grapefruit, bitter/hoppy, some pine. Really excellent nose. Anything with tropical notes, I'm a huge fan of. This one fit the bill. 
T - Pretty much right on target with the nose (although the nose is better). Lots if pine, hops/bitterness but yet very smooth, slight malty backbone, nice citrus profile, and a bitter finish. 
M - Light, good carbination, crisp, refreshing, piney finish. 
D - Okay, so this beer has been hyped up and down for a long while. East vs. West, this one stands up to the best DIPA's out there. So easy to drink is ridiculous. World-class, as far as I'm concerned. 878 charactersSean9689, Dec 25, 2010

T: Very piny...the hops pretty much rule the day here. Very subtle sweet note.
M: Pucker-inducing hoppiness. Lingers throughout, very dry.
D: Definitely of the sipping variety.
Atmosphere is pretty solid. Decent appearance, nose is not complex for full. Flavor, the same... not complex, but if you like hops, this is it. Overall, this is a great quaff. 511 charactersbmwats, Dec 24, 2010
4.64/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5I got 2 bottles of this courtesy of Kelp, thanks a ton Jeremy. I had a preview at the Kuhnhenn Winter Solstice too, so I was really looking forward to opening these.
It pours a light golden orange with thick foam and spotty laceing, just a little haze. The aroma is heavy with citrus and tropical fruit, grapefruit + papaya + that type of thing. Honestly I would guess Deadnaught in a blind smell test. 
Nice and abrasive taste, a little sweet in the middle, just about the perfect amount of malt. This deserves all of its reviews, wow it's good. A little burn but it feels hops-based rather than alcohol-based. 
Light body, very dry in the mouth, I can't praise it enough. I love this beer, so glad I have another. 718 charactersTurdFurgison, Dec 23, 2010

Appears a cloudy deep honey color with a nice off white head that falls to a skim and stays. Mild lacing.
The smell is of grapefruit, topical fruit. A juicy fruity nose with some nice rich malt lingering in the mix.
The taste is really wonderful. This is a great DIPA. It's wet and juicy, tropical fruit, mild bitterness. Really damn good.
I loved the mouthfeel of this brew. Light/medium in body it is wet and refreshing...and it's 8%!
So this is a delectable brew and should be sought out if you are into IPAs at all. 599 charactersThirstyBird, Dec 23, 2010

A: Poured a mildly cloudy, golden color, w/tons of little floaties present due to the unfiltered nature of the brew. There was a one finger, cloud-white head that didn't stick around for long.
S: VERY strong smell of peach (ala. "Sculpin"), with tons of apricot, mango, and orange notes also. Not much bitterness yet, but tons of yumminess from the tropics.
T: Now this really reminded me of "Sculpin" in it's citrus makeup. Still, the peach taste dominated the very fabric of this liquid! As I got into the session, it got very bitter, but the awesome candy and fruit sugar made it all worth while.
M: Very low carbonation, but I honestly didn't mind that. This was almost like an alcoholic fruit juice with hop bitterness. Still, it was fairly thick in texture, and the lacing was extremely low.
D: Believe the hype! Even though I still prefer the foamy and bubbly nature of "Sculpin", this one was a worthy competitor. Very distinctive in a very competitive category. 1,098 charactersChaney, Dec 23, 2010

Joint review with pintglassjon.
A. A nice deep tangerine, an TON of Sea-Monkeys seriously swimming all over the place and thick, can't see through the glass. Very light, quickly dissipating head.
S. Prominent citrus, mainly grapefruit, and a little pine. Slight malt odor.
T. Taste follows the smell almost exactly. Great, refreshing level of citrus bitterness and lingers mid tongue with the pine. Great depth of hop flavors. Moderate level of dry malt sweetness, is present but not overwhelming.
M. Light carbonation, slightly in the thin side. 
D. Very high, extremely pleasant to drink. Refreshing, enjoyable, a wonderful example of style. Could sit and down these all night, unfortunately geographically impossible.
Overall, great beer and would seek out again. 
Thanks again mmtroop1218. 844 characterstherobot, Dec 23, 2010
4.54/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Bottle shared by Joe - thanks!
Pours a slightly hazy but bright copper color with a one-finger slightly off-white head. The head recedes into a wispy layer on top leaving decent lacing.
Smells great - huge citrus and tropical fruit hop aromas backed by sweet pale malt. As it warms the pale malt aromas intensify a bit and hints of floral and herbal hops join in as well.
Tastes similar to how it smells although not quite as robust. Pale malt flavors kick things off and are quickly overtaken by loads of tropical fruit hops. Shortly thereafter hints of deep citrus and herbal hop flavors join in, drying out the flavor profile slightly. The tropical fruit hops come back to carry through to a moderately bitter ending.
Mouthfeel is good. It's got a nice thickness with smooth carbonation.
Drinkability is very good. I finished my glass quickly and could easily have another.
Overall I can't think of a better DIPA that's made on the East coast and it rivals the big boys made out West. A very nice beer that's well worth a shot. 1,036 charactersglid02, Dec 23, 2010

Pours an orangey amber with yellow highlights and a white head.
Piney and citrusy, smells not overwhelming but pleasant. 
Taste follows the nose, almost really fresh sweet taste that hangs in your mouth, 
Not resinous like a good DIPA should be, and really really light and thin. 
Although pleasant was like drinking hop water. It was good but not worth trading the farm away. PtY is a lot better. 484 charactersMurchmac, Dec 22, 2010

Pours clear copper with a two-finger white head and excellent lacing.
The aroma is really awesome. Huge floral and citrusy hop punch with sweet caramel malt. Clean and intense.
The flavor is deinitely east coast style, but probably the best in that style I've had. Sweet caramel malt balanced by a huge flavorful and bitter hop burst. Floral notes, grapefruit, and orange. Tasty as hell.
The mouthfeel is nice, medium-bodied with big hop resins and a long enamel-ripping finish.
Nice beer overall. Awesome for an east coast style DIPA. 583 charactersnickd717, Dec 22, 2010

 Bomber poured into my Alpine pint glass (A receptacle worthy of this hoppy rarity). A hard pour produces a finger and a half of fluffy white head which recedes gradually. Decent lacing. The beer is a hazy orange, amber color. 
Smell is of pure hoppy goodness. Citrus peel and pine. Heavy on the pine.
 Taste follows the nose. Grapefruit rind and piney bitterness threaten to erode the enamel from my teeth. Mid pallet the beer balances almost perfectly with a malty sweetness, before plunging into a chasm of piney, hoppy bitterness. Finish is dry and leaves me craving more. 
Feel is full, a bit viscous, and perfectly carbonated. 
Drinkability is exceedingly high, given the well hidden ABV and the incredible taste of this beer. 
I found his brew to be eerily reminiscent of, dare I say it?, Alpine's Exponential Hoppiness, which I dearly love. For me, this beer totally lived up to the hype. Glad I had he opportunity and hope I'll be able to enjoy this again. Very highly recommended! 1,110 charactersSideswipe, Dec 22, 2010
4.77/5  rDev +2.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5So excited that I got my hands on this. Pours a dark amber/orange with a frothy head and bubbles of all sizes. Good retention and some lacing. Smell is excellent, dominated by pink grapefruit, powerdy pine, and vines. Beautiful. Taste accomplishes what the bottle said was the goal: amazing complexity. Reminds me a bit of Mikkeller Ten in that you can find almost every hop flavor in the taste. Waves of different hops flow and ends with a biscuity malt finish, then hops linger for days in the aftertaste. Moderate bitterness but intense hoppiness. Mouthfeel is very smooth and medium-light bodied. Drinkability is ridiculous and I could have glass after glass, zero etoh.
I have had almost every major IIPA in the world, this is easily in the top tier, and deserves all the hype. By far the best IIPA not made on the west coast, and blows 99% of those away. Awesome awesome beer. 883 characterssquaremile, Dec 22, 2010

Appearance: Big craggy, chunky head with some good lacing and good retention. Pour is a orange-copper
Smell: Big wet hops, pine resin and grapefruit with a bit of caremel/malt sweetness behind it.
Taste: Big wet hops again, very nice grapefruit with pineapple with a caramel/malt backdrop.
Mouthfeel: I have to ding it here, a bit thin and slightly lower carbonation than I would have liked.

Marmalade orange with a tiny white collar, small infrequent bubbles, and loads of suspended particles. 
Nose is extremely juicy and lush with some bitterness evident and a tropical complex smell that is all over the place. So varied and delicious and incredibly enticing.
Sweet malt kiss up of front segues into a boatload of tropical fruits and long, drawn out bitterness that leaves a dry chalky finish that meets with a secondary wave of fruits.
Low end carbonation works very well. Drinks so softly and smoothly.
Really exquisite and delicious. Quite a treat and a DIPA that I would love to have the opportunity to drink more often. An instantaneous favorite in the style. Just awesome. 754 charactersBarrytheBear, Dec 19, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5HUGE thanks to Brian for sending this my way!
A-Body is a nearly transparent light amber hue. Bubbles can be seen all over the place. Pours with a perfect two finger or so foamy white head with perfect retention. Lacing left all the way down the glass.
S- Nose is awesome. Perfect. Citrus hops and white grapefruit everywhere. A faint sweet malt backbone can be detected as well. Very rich and citrusy.
T- Complex for an IPA and different hop impressions emerge with each sip. Citrus initially, then a touch of herbal and grassy, then a touch of pine and spicy at the end. The citrus is very bright initially then fades off the grassy and herbal remain contantly in the background. The pine is very mild and much more resiny than bright. A really big hop bitterness lingers on and on-citrus and pine resin with a big spicy hop overlay.
M-Medium to high carbonation and a slightly smooth and oily light to medium weight body.
D- Fantastic DIPA overall-complex and certainly in my top five-its a bit to bitter to take the #1 spot for me. Its certainly a hop bomb. Reminds me of my experience with PtY-although that was almsot 2 yrs ago. I hope the Alchemist keeps releasing this because it is a must try DIPA! 1,212 charactersPittBeerGirl, Dec 19, 2010

Mmmm... I get a nice wave of hops before I even bring the glass up to my nose. Lots of grapefruit citrus and pine. Smells very aromatic and fresh. Beautiful nose.
Sticky hop juice on the tongue with some grapefruit citrus and sweet caramel malts in the background. Lots of bitterness up front that continues throughout. Pine-laden hops. 
Mouthfeel is resiny and sticky. Good carbonation and a substantial body. You can feel the hops in this one.
Drinkability is exceptional. This beer goes down so easy. Packed with a good helping of hops and lots of citrus. The nose is very aromatic. An enjoyable drink all around and the ABV is unnoticeable. I might be in the minority, but I think I actually enjoy this more out of the bottle than on tap, even though a fresh pint is still excellent. I'm really hoping this comes to cans soon, because this really is one of the best DIPA's out there. 1,020 characterssisuspeed, Dec 19, 2010
4.87/5  rDev +4.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into a Heady Topper pint glass, revealing hazy caramel body under a few fingers of thick white head. Some lacing. Smells deliciously hoppy with an unctuous meaty caramel malt backbone. Lots of sweet honey floral smell. Holding up well post-release.
Tastes almost as bitter as having it fresh on tap. The hop punch-to-the-jaw has started to fade a little already but it still tastes like biting into a grapefruit rind covered in burnt caramel. Lots of fresh citrus hop bitterness with a clean and juicy finish. A little meaty. Very flavorful. Mouthfeel is big and smooth, medium-bodied with a creamy soft carbonation that plumps up each sip. Very flavorful and very very drinkable. So well-balanced.
Very impressed at how this held up post-release. Wish I could have a case of it to go through over the winter holiday. 826 charactersabuliarose, Dec 19, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -4.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle on 12/18/10 (bottle was acquired at the Dec. 4th Heady release).
Note: I have consumed a few of these Heady Toppers since their bottling and even two weeks later it still holds up as it did on day one.
A: Pours a burnt orange/apricot color with approximately 1 1/2 finger head. The frothy goodness was sustained for more than two minutes, then it started to slowly dissipate with a modest lacing. 
S: Hoppy to the core! Smells of fresh hops and citrus. Enough said, start drinking!
T: Phenomenal. As soon as this beer hits your lips you begin to taste the exact taste your nose was smelling as you lifted the glass to your mouth. Hops and citrus, grapefruit to be most exact. Wonderful after taste that lingers long enough, but doesn't bother your next sip.
M: Not overly carbonated, expected more of a bite considering the amount of head on the pour.
D: Awesome. It's both a blessing and a shame that I share my bombers with my wife. This is one I would have loved to enjoy all by lonesome. (And just because the room is dark and I'm listening to the Doors, it doesn't mean I'm an alcoholic.)
Comments: This beer lived up to expectations when I had it off the tap on release day and it continues live up to the hype two weeks later. I'm willing to bet the 12/31 drink by date is simply a suggestion... tempted I am to drink this beer even later just to see how it holds up. Can this Heady be Topped? 1,428 characterscirclenine, Dec 19, 2010

5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Had on tap the day of the 600 bottle release
Pours a nice, murky orange tone with a thick frothy head. Great lacing with a nice sticky look as it slides down the glass.
The smell of this beer is unreal. I can smell it from a few feet away. Mango, citrus, grapefruit, dank hops, maybe a bit of pine. I couldn't help but to keep constantly smelling the beer. The aroma is so inviting and begs you to take a sip. This is the best smelling beer I have encountered to date.
The taste is similar to the smell. Maybe not quite as powerful but it goes hand and hand with the experience. Delicious citrus hops, tropical fruit, bitter hops. Very complex. As soon as I take a sip, I want another. When the beer is gone, I want more. Just one more taste...
Mouthfeel is crisp, sticky, and a bit dry but perfect for this beer.
Drinkability is off the charts for me. I want to keep drinking this until I am no longer able. At 8%, it could get me in trouble. 
Such an amazing beer. It has temporarily hurt other beers for me, as all I want is another Heady Topper. Currently my favorite beer. Another trip to The Alchemist is in order. 1,126 charactersphingdong, Dec 18, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4Thanks to beerometer for making his first trade ever with such an awesome beer. Served in my Stone IPA glass.
Appearance- Pours a hazy gold/amber with about 2 fingers of pure white head. Nice lacing.
Aroma- Oh wow! Hops, hops, and more hops. Huge focus on the citrus (you would imagine) with grapefruit being the standout followed by lemon and orange peel. There is also a good bit of pine needles hiding just below the citrus.
Taste- So much fresh hops. Again the citrus is right there followed by the pine (almost forresty). Despite the heavy hop bomb there is (and not much detectable malt) this doesn't feel overwhelmingly unbalanced. Finishes with some nice bitterness, and leaves little aftertaste.
Mouthfeel- Well carbonated and mouth coating in the most wonderful way.
Drink- I docked a point here just because this is so bitter and flavor packed that 1 bomber is definitely enough for a sitting. But god I wish there was another waiting for me tomorrow.
Overall this ties with Pliny the Elder for my favorite Double IPA objectively, but the heavy use of Citra hops gives this an edge in my book. 1,110 characterscadaugherty, Dec 18, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Many thanks to mymrnngjckt for sharing a bottle of this last night. What a treat.
Poured a semi-dark copper color with about two fingers of tan head. Kept a pretty good lace with some decent stick on the sides. A bit darker than most IPAs.
Smell absolutely leaped from the glass and was bursting with citrus hop aromas. I could smell it from 3 feet away as I was still pouring. Incredibly fruity, with grapefruit, orange and lemony citrus, juicy and intoxicating. The fruitiest, juiciest IPA nose I can ever recall. Really impressive.
Taste also had a ton of citrus hop flavor. Maybe not quite as dripping with citrus as the nose was, but lots of grapefruit and orange going on. Somewhat tropical as well. There's just a touch of sweet malt to provide a backbone, with moderate bitterness. Tons of hop flavor.
Mouthfeel was a creamy medium body, well carbonated and very smooth. A nice slick, oily feel from the hops.
In terms of drinkability it doesn't get any better than this. So smooth and flavorful, and with so much juicy hop flavor I didn't want to put the glass down. I need to make it to this brewery and just sit at the bar drinking this for an entire evening. Awesome stuff. 1,190 charactersnumber1bum, Dec 17, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Just received this brew tonight and CAN'T wait to try it!! I've heard so much about it from a jerky friend out in Connecticut. Now I get to try it! Drank from my Surly nonic pint glass.
Appearance- Pours a cloudy light yellowish with a nice half finger bright white creamy head. A nice cap and collar is left the entire beer along with a few random spots of lacing.
Smell- Super fruity with an insane West Coast bright hoppy profile. Tons of pineapple, mango, orange peel, lemon zest and grapefruit pith. Like literally the fruitiest nose I've ever taken a whiff of. Not much else I can say about it. Hops, hops, hops!
Taste- Wow. Starts out with a fruity blast that isn't as intense as the nose but still remains fresh and vibrant. A kick of mango and pineapple right from the get go along with a crazy vibrant blast of peach flesh. I almost get vanilla tones at times as the beer is crazy fruity but not bitter in the least. There isn't a real malty thing going on but there is a light cracker sweetness in the background to sort of balance the hoppy goodness. Honestly, the beer sort of tastes like a peach Jolly Rancher to me. The finish is full of grapefruit and Georgia peach.
Mouthfeel- Medium body with a super light spritzy carbonation. The body is spot on for a IPA of this style and the carbonation is perfect.
Drinkability- Oh man. What a great freaking beer. I honestly can't think of another IPA that's like it. It doesn't have the sort of bitterness of the Pliny's, the sweetness of a Hopslam or the maltiness of a Furious. It's sort of an enigma among IPA's and I freaking love the shit out of it. Really glad this brewery put out a few bottles. Hopefully they put out more in the future; this beer needs to be shared! 1,735 charactersyounger35, Dec 17, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to both SneezyAchew and stowehop for bottles. Served in a Sam Adams perfect pint glass. Bottled 11/30/10, and consumed on 12/09/10.
A - Pours with a finger-plus of off-white foam that features great retention and glass-coating lace. Slightly hazed golden peach body.
S - Huge tropical fruits, peaces, tangerine zest, dankness, a touch of chive or green onion, and a light sugary note that reveals that there is a bit of malt in there somewhere after all.
T - The taste isn't quite as amazing as the smell, although it's still quite good. A bit more malt presence contributes sugared citrus mixed with tropical fruits, and maybe a faint hint of pine and leafiness. It finishes with present but well-attenuated bitterness, although it mounts over time.
M - Carbonation is spot on - lively, but not enough to be harsh. Smooth medium body that is more than adequate for 8%. Goes down very smooth and easy, with a slightly dry finish. Alcohol is extremely well-hidden.
D - This beer is beyond drinkable. I'm looking forward to getting to my other bottles because this is going to make for a great Christmas. Thanks John, for finally caving to the pressure and making this available to all (or at least some). Now about that canning line... 1,246 charactersMasterSki, Dec 16, 2010
4/5  rDev -14%look: 2 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Huge thanks to bring for the bottle. Bottled on 11/30/2010, consumed 12/13/2010.
Heady Topper pours a murky, rusty copper hue. Nearly opaque from sediment, and showing fairly weak head retention, this isn't the most visually impressive beer.
The aroma, on the other hand, is an outstanding display of juicy citrus and tropical fruit. Mango and papaya, pineapple and grapefruit, the hop profile has impressive depth. Malt is barely perceptible, almost imaginary.
Malt is more noticeable on the palate, lending a bread-like backbone that's quickly washed away by an assault of hop flavor and bitterness. Grapefruit, pineapple and papaya flavors try their hardest to balance a huge resinous hop bitterness. This is dry and light, decidedly West Coast style, with a lower to moderate level of carbonation. The bitterness grows astringent after a while, and while I do appreciate high IBUs, I feel that in this case it's out of balance with the hop flavor. It's an excellent DIPA nonetheless, and one of the best hoppy beers I've had from the East Coast. 1,052 characterslargadeer, Dec 15, 2010
4.7/5  rDev +1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5First of all, a big thanks to Drazzamatazz who sent out this special beer. Cheers!
Appearance - Pours into my Bell's Tulip with a hazy, dark caramel color. Over a finger of slight tan head is achieved with a moderate pour, that dissipates slowly, leaving nice looking lacing on the sides of my glass.
Smell - The first time I smelled this I had an initial aroma of onion...like Gubna. This scared me. Hence I waited a few minutes for the beer to breathe and was awarded most generously. Juicy citrus notes of grapefruit, orange, mango, and slight pineapple. Next comes the pines and resin, followed by a not as hoppy kick as expected, and just a hint of the aforementioned onion aroma.
Taste - Hot damn. Up front I get more pine than the citrus aroma would have led me to believe. Next come the wonderful hop flavors - not too bitter but also not so faint as to overlook their presence. The middle of the taste lends itself to the nice juicy citrus flavors which are spot on with the smell (I feel this is where it differs from PtE - a bit more citrus here). It ends with slight piney bitterness.
Mouthfeel - Medium bodied, very creamy (more so than PtE in my opinion) and finishes a hint dry like PtE.
Drinkability - Damn quaffable. Honestly, a freaking great DIPA. I see some lower reviews and I honestly can't understand why? Having this side by side a fresh PtE, this is so close to it. If this was readily available like PtE, I would buy this alongside it. A very enjoyable beer, and well worth the trade for it. It has its differences from PtE, but that is why I would freaking love to have both of these in my refrigerator at the same time. So similar yet so different. My first experience from The Alchemist and a hugely positive one at that. As stated, very glad I was able to try this. Again, this is not just hype in my opinion, this really is a top notch, top 5 DIPA in my book. 1,895 charactersSpdKilz, Dec 15, 2010
3.99/5  rDev -14.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Chilled bottle into a glass. Thanks to the numerous Vermonters who showered me in offers of sending this: Drazzamatazz, iwantmorehops, youbrewidrink, and KristinCooks. There are some VERY generous people in that region. 
A: Pours a hazy, unfiltered burnt orange-amber body. The off-white head is very thin and minimal, though it lasts the duration of the drink as a nice collar on the beer. I prefer my IPAs to be clear and filtered in appearance, so that and the small head are my complaints. If it weren't for the overweighting of the apperance category, that would remain a small factor in the overall score. It should be noted that the comments above refer to a gently-poured first glass. The second glass, which captured all the sediment, was very turbid. 
S: Juicy grapefruit, mangoes, tangerine, pineapple. Like Pliny the Elder, those aromas are adorned with notes of pine needles, dried leaves, and spice. A very dry aroma that offers only the smallest cracker scent. A hop showcase plain and simple. Very complex and inviting. 
T: A delicious smorgasbord of citrus flavors. It's almost in the same range as Kern River Citra in terms of pure hop flavor, though Citra has (duh) more of a straight citrus profile. Here, juicy mangoes, grapefruit, pineapple and tangerine come together with pine needles, leaves, and a slightly spicy finish. As noted in the nose, there is no substantial malt flavor to worry about, except for a slight cracker / bread taste. A fair amount of lingering bitterness, though it's not nearly as sharp as Ephraim was (the first competitor I can think of in the conversations about Vermont DIPAs). 
To my palate, it could afford to step back the bitterness or dial up the sugars a bit. Or, just change the malt character to complement the hop flavors. In the second half of the bomber, the malt backbone felt thin and listless. Not enough to ruin the beer, since the hops are so well-done, but in light of the bitterness (which was stronger in the second glass, perhaps because I captured all the hop sediment), it begins to feel like thin hop juice (or hop water - thanks Tim) toward the end. 
M: The bitterness and lacking malt backbone prevented the first glass from being a perfect 5 in my book. Otherwise, the medium body is supported by low-medium bubbles that showcase an ample array of flavors. The beer is dry, and confidently so: it doesn't have huge bursts of alcohol to cover up with sugars. Really well-crafted stuff. I took it down a peg on the second glass owing to the complaint above: the malt backbone is lacking, and the beer feels thin. 
D: The sharp bitterness hurts drinkability, but I loved the first half of the bomber and continued to enjoy the second. 
I'm convinced, given the freshness of this one (~10 days old) that I'm getting something pretty close to the full experience. I don't agree that this is better than Pliny the Younger (this is much more balanced than the latter, so it's a poor comparison to start with). But I agree it's in the same conversation as Pliny the Elder. 3,049 charactersArbitrator, Dec 15, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle shared by Thorpe429. Thanks Mike!
A: This DIPA appears noticeably hazier than other brews of this ilk. The beer itself is light orange in color, with a 1/4" head that leaves a fair amount of lacing. 
S: Wow! The aroma is simply amazing. A bouquet of fresh tropical fruits, to include pineapple, mango, grapefruit, guava. No alcohol or malt scents to be found, just as it should be.
T: Wonderfully hop forward and delicious. The taste is fantastic, but not quite as unbelievable as the aroma, which was absolutely world class. The flavor is all about hops, citrus / tropical fruits, and floral notes. Terrific beer.
M: Bitter and dry, in the best possible way. Hop and fruit flavors linger on the palate between drinks.
D: I have wanted to try this beer for a long time. It is absolutely worthy of all the praise it has received. I look forward to drinking some on draft the next time I visit the lovely state of Vermont.
Edit: Drank over a case of this over the summer. Simply phenomenal beer. I'm not sure how or where this beer could improve. One of the best beers I have had. Dangerously drinkable and mouth wateringly delicious. My highest recommendation. 1,172 charactersHuhzubendah, Dec 15, 2010

4.19/5  rDev -9.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3 |  overall: 4Out of a Hennepin tulip:
Aroma: Tropical fruit. Mango. Moderate malt character with cracker/bready undertones. Herbal notes as the beer warms.
Appearance: Very hazy gold. Minimal, but lasting creamy white head.
Flavor: A mix of pine/onion hop spiciness upfront. Notes of tropical fruit around the edges. Pineapple. The bitterness grows until it completely overwhelms the palate. Again, a dry malt, cracker-like character. Ghosts of tropical fruits emerge from the deep bitterness. Oranges and a nutty, vegetative character become noticeable as the beer warms.
Mouthfeel: Medium body. Very dry finish. Oily and resinous. The beer comes on big, but drops off quickly.
Overall very drinkable, if you enjoy super bitter beers. No malt balance to speak of, but great hop character. A clear variation of the West Coast hop bomb, a la' Pliny the Elder. 850 charactersfunkydelic, Dec 14, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Yes, that's right...bottled! Thanks to John and Co. for finally releasing this one. First tried this at the Cyclorama in Boston (EBF) when The Alchemist was just getting started and have had on tap at the source a handful of times. Very happy to have a friend bust out a bomber at a small gathering last night.
Pours a hazy pale amber color with a nice bright white head that creates some great lacing.
Aroma is remarkable....it seriously made me feel like I was sitting in downtown Waterbury enjoying at the source. So fresh....a boatload of citrus and piney hops grab every bit of my olfactory senses and I can wait no longer to take a sip.
Taste is just as rewarding. 
Such a tremendous balance of hops here, as the piney, sticky, semi-sweet citrus hops are quickly grounded by the bittering hops that immediately follow. This beer has just enough of a malt backbone to keep this DIPA in check and the 8% is very well hidden.
Mouthfeel may be the best I have experienced for an IPA/DIPA. The carbonation is a bit low, but that is the intention and it carries over very well to the bomber and makes this one extremely drinkable. 
I only wish I could have made the trek back to the brewery the day of the release, but it won't be long until I am back to enjoy this and all of the other great beers that are flowing on any given day. 1,333 characterswarriorsoul, Dec 14, 2010
4.69/5  rDev +0.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Very happy I finally get to try this one, straight from the tap into my pilsner glass. Pours yellowish orange with a slight haze, small off white head with good retention and some nice lacing. As soon as this beer hits the table I can smell the hops. This is up there with some of the best smelling IPAs made. Pineapple, sweet malts, tropical fruit, not a hint of bitterness - just wonderful aroma hops. Taste is surprisingly different from the smell, and this isnt a bad thing. Pineapple and tropical fruit flavor but with a bit more bitterness then I was expecting, some biscuit malt (not a lot, just enough to provide balance), a slightly spicy, earthy hop finish. The lighter side of medium body with a medium light carbonation, finishes very clean. This is an excellent IPA and hands down the best one to come from anywhere east of California. Very different then the west coasters in terms of flavor, but much smoother and more drinkable then Pliny or some of the other notables. I wanted to try everything at the Alchemist and this was my first, and then my second beer. Wish I could drink this every night. 1,114 charactersnkersten, Dec 14, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Bottle shared by Thorpe429, thanks Mike. This IPA has gotten so much buzz in the past year, it quickly became my biggest beer ambition to get some, after having some of the bottle last night, it remains one of my biggest wants. I have to make it up to the alchemist the next time this is on tap.
Beer is yellow to amber with some haziness to it. Head is soft, white, and thin made up of a very small bubbles and some medium ones that stick to the glass leaving a little lacing. Carbonation is moderate to low, it looks good, looks like a hazy IPA.
The aroma is beautiful, absolutely wonderful. No alcohol or heat, minimal malt sweetness, complex mixture of tropical fruits like pineapple and mango, with citrus layers of lime and orange. It smells wonderful.
Beer is light in body and quite carbonated in the mouth. Interesting, probably due to the carbonation, the first thing I notice in this beer is the hop profile. A floral and fruity explosion of hop flavors, again tropical fruits and some citrus that gives way in the late palate to some moderate bitterness. I think they could have gotten away with more bitterness but overall it is a truly amazing IPA. Hard to top. 1,178 charactersdrabmuh, Dec 13, 2010
4.17/5  rDev -10.3%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 422 oz. bottle courtesy of the generous masterhomebrewer - thanks, buddy! I wanted to consume this one as quickly as possible, so that it would be as fresh as possible (as is encouraged by the brewmaster on the excellently written label). Poured in to a large tulip.
Appearance: Pours a surprisingly dirty looking olive-hued goldenrod, much darker and hazier than I'd expected, though plenty of active carbonation is visible around the edges of the tulip. A torrent of it, actually, well distributed, and fairly slow, given the sheer quantity - normally beers that showcase this much carbonation have much more spry bubbles. It's nice, though, sort of like suspended jewels up and down the sides of the glass. The head has above average retention - average for an excellent DIPA, of course - emerging slowly to a maximum height of about a finger and change, a dull, jaundiced ecru that fades to a thick, soapy collar, a persistent and largely uniform surface dusting, and a nice amount of sticky, snowy, crisp side lacing, which successive sips only do so much to erode. The process on this one is fantastic - it's only the colors that are a knock against it. Filter this one, and I bet it's a 5.0.
Aroma: Like a baby Pliny the Elder, in many ways. That is, similar in composition, but not in strength. Sweet, juicy citrus dominates the nose, with freshly squeezed and earthy grapefruit, orange, mango, and even springy apricot notes intermingling with lots of leafy, herbal spice. Complex and concentrated.
Taste: Slightly less flavorful than the aroma would suggest. First, the malt backbone is very subdued. I only detect faint hints of roast, and very little sweetness - it's mostly a dry, water cracker-like backbone, a little husky, sort of like a dry English pale ale. This isn't in and of itself a problem, but it misses an opportunity to interact favorably with the hop notes, rather than just let them take the stage on their own. To each his or her own, perhaps.
Now, to their credit, the aforementioned hop notes are pretty stellar. Tons of east coast notes here - lots of grassy notes, freshly mowed hay, grassy and floral, second only to the spicy, herbal, leafy notes. Not a lot of pine here - slightly resinous, but more dank. The spice is distinctly herbal, tobacco-like, faintly wintergreen-like. There's also plenty of citrus, which interacts with the herbal notes to suggest earthy pith, like biting in to the fruit rather than drinking the juice. The "juice" label is further diminished by the relative dryness of the beer. The white grapefruit (not tart enough to be ruby red) and orange notes are here, as are a few other tropical fruit notes, kiwi and pineapple, definite peach, slight apricot - but they're wholesome, a little dirty, and (by virtue of the lack of sweetness) very "essence"-esque, oily.
And bitterness? Sure, it's here, but again, just like the malt backbone, it doesn't overpower the hop flavors themselves. Part of me is appreciative of this - the low (relatively) level of bitterness and the low (relatively) level of sweetness are in balance with one another. 
If I had to guess? Simcoe is definitely here, as are a few "C"s (Centennial and Columbus?), as is one of the leafier varieties (Yaikma, Amarillo, or something of the like). I'd love to see the hop schedule on this one.
Mouthfeel: Oily, and incredibly smooth and soft. The low final gravity makes for a beer that's never even close to cloying or syrupy, and the low "feel" of the carbonation (quite in contrast to what was visible initially) works well with this. The smoothness of the beer on the whole also works well with the flavor profile, amplifying the right notes while not pushing anything in your face. 
Drinkability: The best east coast DIPA I've ever had? Maybe (it's up there w/ HopSlam, which is marginally east coast, I suppose). But it's lacking in some of that bold dynamism that makes beers like PtE (and to a lesser extent PtY), Hop 15, Pure Hoppiness, and White Knuckle so fantastic. At 8.0%, it's not nearly as bold in the ethanol department as some of those, though (which is to its credit), but I would gladly accept this one at 9%, 10%, or even 11% if it could just amp up the sweetness and the bitterness a little. I know the back of the bottle says that this beer isn't aiming to be the biggest, or the strongest, or the most bitter, but the flavor combination is great enough that, with a little extra thrust, this one could be the world's best DIPA. On the whole, though, I was really impressed with this one and thrilled to try it - Heady Topper is the best non-Bell's DIPA (HopSlam, Oracle, and Big Head all top it) that I've had brewed outside California ... and that's sayin' something. 4,730 charactersCrellMoset, Dec 13, 2010

22oz. brown bomber poured into a Russian River tuliip.
A: Pours a very hazy dark apricot color. Moderate head on the pour but with plenty of retention and lacing.
S: Aroma is heavenly. Amarillo, Simcoe, Centennial. Some pineapple in there as well.. so maybe Citra? A candy like sweet aroma from all of the tropical fruit and citrus fruit hops. Malt is there a bit but this is all hops.
T/M: Massive hop flavor, mostly dominated by the citrus and tropical fruits. Not much bitterness here... it's there but not to the level that I was expecting. Malts don't bring a whole lot here either. There's a good amount of sweetness but more from the fruity hop character and the lack of a firm bitterness. It doesn't finish very dry, either, and I think the low-ish carbonation(which the label says is intentional) adds to the lack of perceived dryness.
D: Pretty easy to drink but a bit one dimensional with only hop flavor and not much bitterness or dryness. 1,016 characterspwoods, Dec 13, 2010

22oz bottle into a snifter glass 
Bottled 11/30/2010 - Drank 12/12/2010
A- Pours a really strange murky orange with a real thin 1 finger white head that doesn't stick around any more than a rim around the glass. Decent lacing though.
S- Really nice strong floral and citrus hops that have a nice pine aroma to them as well. Hard to get a good feel for the malt presence due to the awesome hop amount but I'm gonna say slightly caramel and sweet. Definitely some fruitiness in there as well, more tropical oriented it seems. 
T- Wow! Extremely well blended. First sip gave me a really strong floral pine bitterness up front from the hops but on the back of the tongue i was getting a nice sweet caramel malt flavor that brings it all together. I've never actually been able to taste both at the same time due to one being more over powering but these ingredients compliment each other so well. Some nice fruity citrus notes in there as well and the alcohol is pretty much non existent. 
M- Medium bodied with moderate to low carbonation and a really nice strong bitter finish.

A: Comes out a dark-ish orange with a very thin white layer of bubbles on top. This must be what they mean by "carbonated at pub draft levels".
S: Any worry of this being just another East Coast malt bomb is erased when I smell this beer. A rush of floral, fruity, pungent hops overwhelms my senses.
T: This is a delicious fruity yet bitter DIPA that impressed even a west coast hop enthusiast like myself. Reminds me a lot of Kern's Citra, which is saying a lot. The hop profile is mainly of the citrusy mango variety accompanied with quite a bit of bitterness. The malt backbone has a very grainy dry characteristic to it, which helps let the hops be the star of the show.
M: Good level of carbonation, keeps it from being foamy or frothy. Not thin or watery at all. Kinda sticks to your teeth and gums to keep the hops lingering.
D: Pretty drinkable, can't really taste the alcohol, but you can feel the 8% abv a bit. Multiple glasses would probably get you quite warm.
This is a great DIPA, fellow Cali BA's, believe it. I'll probably never have it again unless they finally decide to can it or I make a trip to VT, which is sad. I'd put this beer up against the top DIPA's we've got out here. Great job Alchemist! 1,270 charactersPlinyTheYoungest, Dec 12, 2010
4.61/5  rDev -0.9%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Bottle thanks to Drazzamatazz.
Pours a cloudy orange color with a small, smooth white head.
Scent of resin, sugar, mango, apricot, orange peel, pineapple, dry, leafy hops, and a hint of caramel. A truly phenomenal scent, very hop forward and surprisingly complex. I love a strong tropical fruit presence in my IPAs and this one has more than enough to spare.
Taste of apricot, leafy hops, grapefruit, pineapple, orange peel, mango, resin, and sugar. Finishes slightly dry with more tropical fruit and some resin. As with the scent, the tropical fruit characteristics dominate the taste. The resin is a bit more prevalent in the flavor making it slightly less impressive than the scent, but this is still one damn incredible beer.
Mouthfeel is clean and smooth with medium carbonation. 788 characterspaco1029384756, Dec 12, 2010
4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Sharing a bottle of this with mymrnngjckt. Really looking forward to this...
Appearance: Poured from the bottle, this beer is a cloudy, amber color with a good inch + worth of bone white head. Lacing is impressive, too. The beer had a viscous look to it while it was being poured, this is gonna be good.
Smell: Unbelievable! Huge hops, plenty of ripe grapefruit and pine. Really fresh smelling too.
Taste: Awesome doesn't begin to describe how good this beer tastes. The grapefruit and pine blend together very nicely, and the bitterness hangs around just long enough to savor before it finishes clean. 
Mouthfeel: Full body, great carbonation, and an almost syrupy kind of feel to it. Fantastic!
Drinkability: The best DIPA I've ever had. I cannot recommend this beer enough. 781 characterskrisandajt, Dec 12, 2010
4.32/5  rDev -7.1%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Thanks for sharing this one drew
Poured golden orange with yellow highlights that had a half finger of head and left some bubbly lacing sticking to the glass. The aroma was quite piney, grassy, earthy, and hoppy with a good malt prsence but had lots of fruitness as well. I was able to detect a little citrus. Candied sugar. and wood character. The taste was really grassy piney with woody, caramel, and citrus zest accents but did have good sweetness from the malts to balance out the bitterness. The brew was medium in body with a good amount of carbonation which had a sweet, slighty fruity, woody, earthy, hoppy, bitter, and crisp dry finish. It drank above average and was glad to have been able to try this beer. Hopefully this stuff makes it to the west coast some day. Have to say it was a solid IPA from the east coast. 829 charactersGobzilla, Dec 12, 2010
4.62/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Huge thanks to Sisuspeed for sending this my way in a recent trade! The bomber was split with a friend and poured into two snifters.
A: The color was more pale than I had anticipated. The beer poured a very murky pale amber and is clearly unfiltered. There was a nice 1 finger fluffy white head that had moderate retention and nice lacing.
S: A very intense and beautiful smell. Citrusy hops dominate, in particular tangerine. Probably the most intense tangerine smell I have encountered in a beer actually. A little bit of biscuty sweetness as well.
T: Truly a celebration of hops. The only way I could possibly knock this beer is to say that there is not quite enough balance, but the taste is amazing! Bitterness comes through from start to finish, which I like, as some DIPAs I've recently had the bitterness too focused on the finish. The middle of the drink has more of the citrus flavors, particularly tangerine and a bit of grapefruit, but not much. The finish has some earthiness to it, but is still mostly the citrus and bitterness. Only a faint malt presence, that I really had to search for.
M: Perfect level of carbonation, and a great aftertaste. The beer also has just the right viscosity.
D: Well, I wish I could get more of this. Unfortunately that's probably not going to happen. I could easily have polished off two bombers of this on my own. This 5.0 is in the hopes that they can it sometime in the future. 1,432 charactersglazeman, Dec 12, 2010
4.46/5  rDev -4.1%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 4.5I cannot believe that this beer is in front of me. I've dreamed about it forever. In fact, I've even considered making a trip out to Vermont simply to try it. Thanks, glazeman, and thanks to the trader that got this one done for him, and thanks to the trader that hooked me up with Matt in order to reel in the infamous Heady Topper.
A - Cloudy, dark brown/ruby/murky with a one finger head that quickly fades to a few bubbles. Unfiltered for sure - floaties abound. 
S - Words cannot describe. Overwhelmingly the finest IPA I've ever sniffed. BIG, juicy citrus hops up front with tangerines, oranges, limes, and a hint of lemon. Warm booze in the finish. Perfect.
T - Just incredible. Biscuit malts, piney hops, citrus hops, with a harsh bitter/boozy bite in the finish. I love the biscuittiness that carries this entire beer, but it would be even better if it were only the tiniest bit sweeter. 
M - Very good. Nice carbonation and appropriate chewiness without being syrupy. Great for a DIPA.
D - For me, Heady Topper is a whale of all whales. I wish I could drink it all the time. I could easily drink more than the 11 oz. that I had in this serving, unfortunately, I'll probably never have it again unless The Alchemist decides to make it more available. 1,264 charactersairohead2001, Dec 12, 2010
4.62/5  rDev -0.6%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.522oz bottle received in a trade with rowingbrewer. Poured into a Bruery tulip.
A - Pours a cloudy, slightly brownish tinged golden orange. A finger of off-white foam, dense and tight- bubbled sits on top and falls slowly to a few islands of bubbles and a thick collar. Light rings of lacing left around the glass.
S - Big hits of hop aromas in the smell. Huge pine and grapefruit that completely dominate. Thick and sticky aroma...very little malt gets thru to contribute much of anything here. Not especially complex, but very good.
T - Really mirrors the aroma closely. Thick with hop flavors - very citrusy and piney with just a hint of what others call meaty flavors (Summit hops used in here?), but I find a bit spicy and desirable. Might be a hint of malt at the base, but I really don't care...the hops shine brightly...this tastes great.
M - On the light side of medium bodied with a lowish carbonation level. This is so smooth and creamy in feel and just packed with resiny hops. Hop flavor lingers forever after the swallow.
D - This is a great IPA...I am definitely not let down at all by this one. Reminds me a bit of Pliny and Gubna...both of which I really enjoy. It is right up there in the upper echelon of IPA's...hope they bottle this again. 1,264 charactersportia99, Dec 11, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 522 oz bottle, big thanks to grub for sharing!
Pours a chunky and hazy copper, dark orange, thick and fluffy white head forms and settles to a thick ring around the glass, nice layer sticks, great retention, big chunky spirals stick to the glass.
Smell is intense, very hoppy, lots of sweet tropical fruit, mango and pineapple, resiny pine, some floral, strawberry, lightly herbal, whole gamut of hop aromas, lots of grapefruit, nice malt, a bit of caramel sweetness and some biscuit, candied ginger and some mint, more hops, orange peel, really nice stuff.
Taste is really nice too, huge tropical hoppiness, but still has enough malt to balance, caramel sweetness, lightly sugary, big mango and overripe pineapple, tons of grapefruit and orange peel citrus character, floral, alcohol is totally hidden, solid bitterness but well balanced, really nice.
Mouthfeel is medium bodied with low carbonation, lightly acidic hoppiness. Deceptively drinkable, doesn't blow the palate away but a great mix of complex hoppiness with just enough malt to balance it. Really nice stuff, thanks grub! 1,088 charactersViggo, Dec 11, 2010
4.07/5  rDev -12.5%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 3.5 |  overall: 412/11/2010. Thanks to Murchmac. Bottle. Enjoyable beer but lacking any real bitter bite and not quite as loaded down with hops as I prefer. The beer pours a cloudy, tawny orange-amber with a white head. A very nice sweet citrus and tropical fruit tone dominates the aroma. It's almost entirely tangerine rind, mangoes and guava. There's a hint of pine lurking in the background. However, it's not quite as pungent as the best of the style. Surprisingly, the taste lacks nearly any assertive bitterness. There's a bit of grapefruit pith in the finish, but this is one of the least bitter DIPAs that I've ever tasted. That said, it's also not overly malty or particularly sweet. It just sorta lacks a strong taste note. The thin body and utter lack of hop oiliness in the mouthfeel emphasized this problem for me. It does have a nice hoppy aftertaste. It was an enjoyable beer to drink and it went down easily enough, but, ultimately, I found the beer rather disappointing. The taste fails to deliver on the promise of the smell. I'm happy to have tried it, but I don't really understand the hype. 4/4.5/3.5/3/4
Edit: I've had HT a few times out of cans since my initial review and enjoyed it significantly more. I don't know why that first bottle didn't seem very good. I'm changing my scores for the beer but leaving up the old review. 1,336 characterspopery, Dec 11, 2010
4.47/5  rDev -3.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Thanks for sharing this one, Drew.
A: The pour is a cloudy dark orange with a finger's worth of white head.
S: The nose is intensely perfumey with lots of grapefruit, mango, pine, and lemon zest. There's a pretty nice pine aroma, and just an overall fruitiness to it.
T: Mango, pineapple, grapefruit, and lemon zest give this a big fruitiness. Though it does have a lot of fruit notes, it's also pretty intensely bitter and piney, which is very nice.
M: The body is medium with a pretty lively carbonation and a dry, bitter finish.
D: Certainly a very, very good IPA. Actually reminded me a lot of Sculpin, but more bitter. Would definitely like to have this one again. 674 characterswomencantsail, Dec 11, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Really nice of Rpstevens to send me a bottle of this. I owe him.
Pours an interesting amberish orange with a lighter, golden color on the outside. Interesting. Big white frothy head. 
Smells like tropical mango, pineapple, and papaya, with some grapefruit ... no real pine to it, this smells mostly sweet with a hint of orange husks. Incredible aroma. Really nails the tropical/sweet aspect, without smelling cloying.
Taste is more bitter than I expected, with fresh white and red grapefruit washing over me, a hint, just a hint of bittering pine and earth, and a muted, sweet tropical overtone. It's really nicely done. Not quite as incredible as the aroma, but an excellent, top notch DIPA.
Mouthfeel is light and refreshing; great drinkability. 
Well done Alchemist. Well done. 785 charactersOverlord, Dec 11, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Consumed December 8th, Bottled November 30th. Thanks to BA member gamanley for picking up the bottle for me.
First, let me state that this is the best beer I've ever had.
The bottle suggests inverting daily to resuspend the hop resins, which is what I did. The beer pours a wonderful hazy color with just enough head.
The smell. Wow, the smell. Like opening up a fresh bag of hops and breathing in as deeply as you can. The smell on this beer is absolutely phenomenal. 
The taste follows exactly from the smell. There is a wonderful hop flavor that comes through in waves on every drink. The alcohol is not apparent at all, and it's hard to stop drinking this one, it tastes so good. This beer is not perceived as very bitter at all, the taste is much more focused on the hop flavor rather than setting bitterness records. Just how I like it.
Mouthfeel is great on this one too. Carbonation is enough to keep the drink flowing over your tongue. Each taste brings another burst of flavor without the hops coating your taste buds. 
Drinkability is dangerous. Flavor and smell is so amazing, you just want to keep drinking it. Alcohol is not even noticed, and the 22 oz bottle was gone before I knew what happened. Wish I could have had a lot more of this one. 1,263 characterswattly, Dec 11, 2010
4.41/5  rDev -5.2%look: 3.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A - pours a good orange color with very few bottles, and miniscule what head that quickly fades away. not bad, but unimpressive.
S - huge pine aroma that is quickly and easily enjoyable. massively beautiful from the get-go, with underlying citrus notes. a perfect, varied aroma that promises wonderful delights within
T - slight pine taste, bit of grapefruit, pure hops abound. I wish I knew them better to know what they were exactly, but they are marvelous.
M - hops present an extremely bitter mouthfeel and extreme crispness, presenting a cleansing of the palate. very enjoyable, but perhaps a bit too much crispness lacking balance.
D - very nice, but perhaps lacking a bit of malt balance making this a bit more difficult to enjoy. still, having this EVERY night would never cause me a problem 803 charactersroute66pubs, Dec 11, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Here's one I never thought I'd be drinking. 22oz thanks to Drazzamatazz. I owe you big time. Poured into oversized tulip. 
No idea what to expect of this beer- I can't say my expectations aren't a bit high, I've heard this called a Pliny-killer and better than Pliny the Younger. Since Citra and PtY are my two highest-rated and favorite DIPAs, it's time to put this one to the test.
A- Hazy orangey brown with a big-bubbled off-white head. 2cm settling down to a finger or so. Moderately heavy lacing. 
S- Off the charts fruity. I smelled it from the second I uncapped the beer. As I get closer, a bit more pine resin/nugget stank is there. Floral notes and heavy tropical fruit. Great nose on this one. 
T- Taste is a lot more pine-heavy. Oodles of alpha acids. More new growth pine than resiny/octane. Mango comes through as well as a little bit of grapefruit and pineapple. 
M- Very good body, malt bill is stronger than the WC counterparts, although this one isn't terribly malty. Not balanced but I don't think great IPAs/DIPAs need to be. Perfect carbonation. 
D- Very high. This is a damn tasty beer and is -no question- up there with the big boys from the west coast. Of course, drinking it a week after bottling has got to be a factor... and I'm glad I did just that! Does it kill Pliny? No. Is it better than Younger? No, not in my book, but hey, that's damn hard to do. Does it exceed my lofty expectations? It's up there, man. Good stuff. 1,457 charactersShogoKawada, Dec 09, 2010
4.4/5  rDev -5.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4Pours a very murky copper/orange color with a finger of thick head and good lacing.
The aroma is a blast of fresh tropical fruit....grapefruit, pineapple, mango, etc etc. West Coast hoppiness with an East Coast blast of sweet caramel maltiness hiding deep in the background.
The flavor is full of bitter pine hoppiness and bready malts. I wouldn't necessarily call it balanced, but there is that solid malt backbone. It isn't really an assault of hops like I may have anticipated, but it is borderline...ok, after a few more sips I take that back. Definitely a hop assault. Bitterness all over my mouth and in the finish, pine resin and floral notes from front to back. 
The body is medium to medium/full and carbonation is low, just how I like it.
Drinkability is solid for me, especially considering this isn't one of my top styles. I would definitely stick this beer in the upper echelon of DIPA's, although once you get past a certain point I have a tough time saying any single one is better than the other. 
WOW....6 months ago when I was staring at the old BA Top 100 and trying to tick the whole thing I remember seeing a few monsters on the list that were going to be damn near impossible to get. Heady Topper was one of those monsters. Never did I think that before the end of 2010 I would be staring at a glass of it in the comfort of my own home. Thank you Jim for making this happen (and thanks to The Alchemist for bottling it!) 1,447 charactersalcstradamus, Dec 09, 2010
4.74/5  rDev +1.9%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Damn, this is hoppy. That's about my first impression immediately upon popping the cap off of this. With that, I should say huge, huge thanks to rpstevens and kingcrowing for sending me bottles of this, the latter of which was a complete surprise. One bottle to be consumed tonight, the other to be shared with friends this weekend.
This bottle is shared with Amyliz4 and poured into two of our larger, unbranded tulips. The pour yields a slightly-hazed bright peach body with a two-finger head. Pretty good retention and plenty of spotty lacing as it makes its way down to a bit of rocky foam sitting atop the brew. A fairly-thick collar remains on the brew throughout as more spots settle on the sides of the glass.
As previously stated, the aroma on this is damn near epic and remains amazing throughout. The initial whiff slammed my nostrils with dominant notes of tropical fruit, citrus rind, and a bit of pine. Each swirl kicks up another bit of aroma with some mango skin and passion fruit taking hold at first. Behind that is a flock of citrus and an overload of ripe peaches. Following behind all this when you sniff really hard is a nice finish of some piney resin. 
The flavor picks up where the nose left off, though doesn't quite dominate my senses like the nose did. With that said, this is some really, really incredible stuff. I'll start off with one of my only complaints, which is that the hop flavor isn't quite as pungent as the aroma is. Still, there is some fairly-radical hop flavor to balance the hop bitterness. Did you hear that many makers of East Coast IPAs? Malt sweetness doesn't provide balance to bitterness in a fantastic double IPA, lovely and luscious fruit flavors do. 
Mango, passion fruit, and guava make their way into the mix. The strong, strong bitterness levels really elevate the citrus presence and make me think of some good grapefruit rind. The body on this does an absolutely remarkable job accentuating the hops. There's not an ounce of sweetness, but there's enough body to really pull everything together. The bitterness in the finish is uber-high and leaves my mouth quite dry. There's certainly a solution for that--have some more.
I've been waiting a long, long time to finally try this one. Unlike an unfortunately-large percentage of other beers with so much hype, I have enjoyed this immensely. Huge, huge thanks again to Ryan and Nick for the chance to finally try this. Cheers to both of you. 2,455 charactersThorpe429, Dec 09, 2010
4.54/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle from the release last weekend obtained via trade (thanks Dave for getting it to me super fresh)
A: Beer pours a hazy golden/orange with minimal head.
S: Smells absolutely incredible. Hops and pineapple make my mouth water. 
T: Similar to the smell, but a little pinier and not quite as citrusy/sweet as I expected. It's damn hoppy, but not overwhelmingly bitter, and has a pretty tame low-key malt presence. A sticky hops flavor lingers.
M: Carbonation is fairly low (intentionally), but the beer is creamy and has a nice body for a beer so light in color.
D: Exceptionally drinkable for a DIPA, very smooth and not all that bitter despite the massive hops flavor. I could definitely put down a few of these if I was sitting at the bar. 
Overall this is a pretty fantastic DIPA right up there with some of the other fine examples of the style, but it definitely has a uniqueness to it with the low carbonation, creamy mouthfeel, incredible smell, hops-galore and easy drinkability. Definitely glad I was able to try it and hoping that this beer does get canned and into regular circulation some day. More people need to experience this one. 1,167 charactersstarrdogg, Dec 09, 2010
4.64/5  rDev -0.2%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 522oz bottle acquired from the release in VT
A - Pours a hazy light orange with a thin white head
S - A cornucopia of citrusy and piney hops. As if you pulled the cones from the bines yourself, very dank. I could live in this glass.
T - Continues from the smell; citrusy hop bitterness that finishes very smooth
M - Low carbonation (bottle says "pub draft levels"), coats the mouth with more hops
D - As the bottle states it is insane how easy this goes down especially at 8%ABV
I know this review is not poetry but it's the best I can do for now. This beer was worth the frozen fingers and toes 600 charactersBumpkinBrewer, Dec 08, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Thanks to Jon!!! For sending this out less than 36 hours after I sent him a message about it. Crazy. And consumed less than 48 hours after. 
Pours a orangey gold, small head fades to leave some dotted lace and not much retention. A little murkier on later pours. 
Aroma is great, nice assault of fruity hops, grapefruit and tropical fruits mostly, but theres a great under current of resiny goodness. It's pretty awesome. It's pungent and bright, very well done. 
This really grew on me the more I drank it, the resiny hop flavor intensified with each sip and really took the perceived bitterness up a bit. At first I didn't think it was 'too' bitter, but each pour tops off the glass and revitalizes the intensity. Just huge hop flavor all throughout, excellently vibrant with juicy hop flavors and no malt presence to speak of. Medium bodied and relatively low carbonation, I had to really control myself to keep from downing the bottle. I can't say that I didn't expect it to be this good, but it was certainly a nice surprise. A really nice brew. If they can this in greater quantities, it'll be gold, Jerry, gold! 1,121 charactersIneedabeerhere, Dec 08, 2010
4.54/5  rDev -2.4%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5A: Hazy golden pour with stick off-white foam. I want to rate this higher but only I can smell this beer right off the bat and it's subconsciously influencing me.
S: Wow, grapefruit is strong with this one. It exudes from the glass, hitting me from 2 feet away. Orange rind, lemon juice and pineapple are mixed in. 
T: A funky bitter blast assaults the palate from the first sip, destroying any preconceived impressions given from the smell. The strong citrus fruit takes backseat to dank hops (I swear, I've never tried the stuff!). Not as strong as the Funky Sunshine, but it jars the memory in that direction. The bitterness isn't unpleasant sticking to the rear of the tongue, but it is persistent. 
M: The sticky resin gives the intimation of body but in reality, this is fairly light on the tongue. The 'pub draft' carbonation is soft and even. 
D: This beer shines with hops, and is easy to drink. I am having a heck of a time typing this review up because I keep taking another drink! 996 charactersLazerlobe, Dec 08, 2010
4.57/5  rDev -1.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Poured from a bottle into a Heady Topper pint glass. The beer pours a hazy copper/orange that glows brightly when held up to the light. The pour produces a one finger bone white head that quickly fades to a tight ring, leaving some oily lacing on the walls of the glass.
The smell on this one is outstanding. This has to be one of the 3 best IPAs I have ever smelled in my life, loads of pineapple, mangos, grapefruit, tangerines and the slightest hint of sweet malty sugarcane.
The taste is a blast of sweet citrus fruits; tangerines, pineapples, mangos that lead to more bitter hop characteristics such as orange rinds and bitter pine. This IPA is hops balanced by different flavored hops, just hops, hops, hops. Awesome.
The beer is well carbonated, medium bodied and it incorporates the alcohol into the hoppy flavors well. It's just as good out of the bottle as it was on tap, and this is one of the few beers that exceeded my expectations once I got to try it. I will absolutely make the trip back to Waterbury to drink this again, and I will anxiously await the canned release. 1,087 charactersrpstevens, Dec 07, 2010

I wanted to try a fresh bottle so I cracked one open tonight on taco night and split it with the wife 12-6-10. There is nothing like an ipa fresh on tap. This beer still amazing. Didn't loose anything on taste, smell, or appearance. Not quite as crisp as on tap which effects only the mouthfeel and drinkability ever so slightly. What an exceptional beer. 408 charactersDNICE555, Dec 07, 2010
4.67/5  rDev +0.4%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5This review is long overdue, I have been drinking this beer since the beginning.
The head on this beer is always ample and sturdy (hence the name), it's a nice cloudy straw color.
The nose is pure hop and cleanly so. You really need to spend some time inhaling this before you taste this beer.
The taste is all that you expect and more. The hop profile is complex, so describing this as piney or citrusy is not an accurate way to describe this beer. The malt backbone is light and present, yet not in the way.
Considering the abv & amount of hops this is a very drinkable beer. I'm glad to see that John was kind enought to bottle a few of these so that BA's from beyond have a chance to give it a try. 706 charactersyoubrewidrink, Dec 06, 2010
4.95/5  rDev +6.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Having not logged into BA for the past few months, I've managed to miss the hype of Heady Topper. I went to the release with lpayette just for the heck of it and got to try the beer... so I imagine this review is pretty hype-free.
The appearance was perfect, two finger light sparkling head. It smelled and tasted like fresh hops, in a way that other IPA's try to acheive, but never really make it. I could taste a malt backbone, but it really was all about the hops, as the style should be.
The mouthfeel was incredible... so light and so exciting on the palate. However, I like a little more body. It was very similar to pliny the younger in its body and that just isn't how I would have liked it (although I realize it appeals to most others). 
The drinkability was fantastic. I could have had glass after glass after glass and not tired of the brew. It went down so easily and once its in cans, it may be the only IIPA that I buy (up to this point I haven't bought any in the past few years because I've been disappointed since moving out of san diego... this tops the ones I used to drink back then for sure). 1,117 charactersdbalsock, Dec 05, 2010
4.03/5  rDev -13.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at The Alchemist on the release date, 12/4/10. Poured into a Heady Topper pint glass.
A: Served with one of the thickest heads on any beer ever. A 1.5 finger white sponge of a top that never seems to dissipate and only regenerates after every sip. Beer is a cloudy, unfiltered, grapefruit-orange. Lacing is spotty and weblike with decent stick. 
S: Nose is tropical and hoppy. Mango, pineapple, citrus, grapefruit, and cane sugar. Piney hops predominate and there's a well recognized resiny hop character lingering in the background. 
T: The first sip tells me that this is a west coast style IIPA being made in the east. Citrus and piney hop bitterness upfront with a slight lingering cane sugar malt backbone in the back. Bitterness builds and builds through the experience. Notes of resiny hops towards the middle and end. Sticky and hoppy at the finish with a slight tropical pineapple flavor. Bitterness coasts the cheeks and tongue and builds with each successive sip. 
M: Medium bodied and lightly carbonated. Real smooth and subtle in the mouth with just a touch of bubbles going down. Substantial. Finish is sticky and oily. Aftertastes lingers on and on. 
D: I never expected this one to blow me away and it doesn't. That being said, it's still a very very good beer and a solid representation of the west coast style IIPA. Bitter and hoppy without being too overwhelming. Very enjoyable and now that they'll can it some time in the future, go out and get some! 1,483 charactersSpeedwayJim, Dec 05, 2010
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5On tap @ The Alchemist..
Two half pints arrive at the table, hop aromas literally fill the air. Heady is so wonderfully pungent I might have been able to smell the waiter coming. Fat juicy hops fill my nose, no malt is detectable.
Hop dominance carries right into the taste. Heady is unique in that it comes off as juicy, citrusy, bitter, grassy, and earthy...all at once. Flavors bounce around with vigor, so incredibly vibrant. Think layers of differing hop profiles to explore, all presented perfectly. Mouthfeel is right on the mark as well; a silky "medium", well carbonated. Drinkability is off the charts for a beer with so much flavor. I finially found an IPA that I enjoy more than Pliny, my previous favorite. 
Get to The Alchemist, try this beer, period. 768 characterszoolzoo, Oct 13, 2010

4.79/5  rDev +3%look: 4 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 4.5Drank on-tap at The Alchemist, Waterbury, VT
Served in a mini-pilsner glass
The beer poured a hazy, burnished yellow color with a creamy, bright white, one-finger head that slowly faded to a persistent ring of froth. Small blocks of lacing stuck along the sides of the glass, lasting long after the beer was finished.
The aroma was possibly the best I have ever experienced in a double IPA. Hoppy and amazingly potent. Semi-sweet. Super peachy with loads of apricot and citrus. Orange peel came through strong. Some tropical fruits were noticeable as well.
Flavorwise, this beer was nearly flawless. Super hoppy with just enough malt balance to keep things in check. Citrus notes dominated. Peaches and apricots came through strong. Mango and pineapple notes were also quite apparent. Somewhat tart and lemony in the center. The finish was slightly piney. Crisp and semi-dry. All in all, fantastic.
The mouthfeel was slick, creamy and smooth with a fine moderate effervescence. The only thing that kept this beer from earning a perfect score was its slightly thinner that expected body.
Although this DIPA was packed to the brim with hops, it was still balanced and drinkable. The 8% ABV was also remarkably well masked by the complex hop profile.
Many have compared this beer to the almighty Pliny the Younger. I wholeheartedly agree with this comparison. Heady Topper is for certain one of the greatest beers I have ever had the pleasure to try. 1,453 charactersDamian, Oct 10, 2010

A: Pours a hazy light orangish yellow color. Provides a small off white foam head with sufficient lacing.
S: Hops! Lots of citrus hops hit the nose first. There is also some small amounts of bread and caramel malt scents.
T: This is quite possible the best beer I have ever tasted. Lots of citrus hop flavors up front, also some pine. The middle and back end also have tons of delicious hops but there is some caramel, bread and toast that mellows and blends the beer nicely. This beer is extremely hoppy but it also has good malt character tha balances the beer.
M: Nice medium bodied beer. It is bitter but also creamy. Absolutely tasty!
D: They say 8% abv but honestly, I could 'session' this beer. It is absolutely fantastic. One of if not the best beer I have had. Truly amazing and if you can get it fresh, get it!! 977 charactersIronCitySteve, Oct 05, 2010

Appearance: Pours a cloudy fender vintage sunburst orange to amber with radiant honey streaks and a 3 finger off white hop tinged crown that displays good retention and lace.
Smell: Loads of fresh hoppy goodness. A bit less bitterness than the tap version but much stronger notes of orange, grapefruit, and grassy herbs.
Taste: Same as nose but with the tiniest supporting bit of caramel malt.
Mouthfeel: Medium bodied with soft carbonation.
Drinkability: So sessionable for a big DIPA. 757 characterskoopa, Oct 02, 2010
4.6/5  rDev -1.1%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5From 08/28/10 notes. Had on tap at the Alchemist on my trip up to Vermont. Review number 600!
a - Pours a golden color with one inch of white head and moderate carbonation evident.
s - Smells very heavily of pine hops; very dominating. Also smells of citrus hops, grape fruit, tropical fruit, and faint, sweet fruity malts. Hint of floral hops. A very nice mix of pine and fruit in the smell.
t - Tastes of citrus and grapefruit, fruity malts, pine hops,and a hint of floral hops. Some nice bitterness in the initial sips that fades as you drink it.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation, very easy to drink.
d - Overall, I thought this was a great DIPA. I was a little worried it wouldn't live up to the hype, but it pretty much did. Personally I think I might rank HopSlam and PTE a bit higher, but this is a great IPA I would love to have again. I got a lot of pine in the smell and a nice mix of fruit and pine in the smell and taste, and I thought it was really easy to drink at 8% ABV. If I was up in Vermont again, I would definitely go back to the Alchemist for this beer. 1,088 charactersmdfb79, Sep 03, 2010
4.48/5  rDev -3.7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5It's a slightly cloudy.gold beauty, topped by 2 fingers of pure white head. Crazy lace on the glass.
The aroma is neutral sweet beautifully mixed citrus and floral, bitter pith, and a nice hint of maltiness. It is not the strongest bouquet, but its extremely fresh hop flavors set my mouth to salivating.
What a perfection of hop goodness in this baby! It starts sweet, then goes grapefruit, sweet lemon, sweet orange, hints of herbally floral in the background. The finish is a mindfuck. Slowly the floral and herbal hints morph into a progressively more dry pure citrus pith bitter that never scrapes the tongue, and increasingly blows the mind as the finish just cleanly hangs to the palate, just sweetly enough. Rare is the beer that gets better and better through every sip, but this one does. Pliny's a touch more complex, that's why the 4.5 score not 5.
Mouthfeel is lighter side of medium body for the style, how I like it, low carb.-just right, and a legendary finish.
This beer drinks so easily rating it is a snap, there isn't, wasn't, never will be a IIPA this finely hopped that is this easy to drink.
Impression: If I had both fesh PTE and fresh Heady Topper side by side, I'm not sure which I'd reach for first. This is a must try, to say the least. 1,269 characterscavedave, Aug 26, 2010

S- Sweet marmalade/apricot spread. Smells very good but I was expecting a hoppy explosion. Alcohol almost undetectable. Really sweet. 
T- I'm really trying to figure out what I'm tasting, but I'm pretty sure it's mango peach juice. Great tasting bitterness. I don't know what to say really. It's veeeerry tasty. A bit of yeast in the end. 
M- Smooth, medium to low carbonation which is just right. Not very dry. A little thin but it's really not a problem...it might actually be a good thing. 
D- High, very high. 8%? Where? This drinks like juice. 
Great beer. Would love to have access to it back home. 728 charactersYoonisaykul, Aug 10, 2010
4.82/5  rDev +3.7%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5I'm very glad I kept tabs on the reviews for Heady Topper so I knew when it was available again. A nearly 3-hour trip to the brewpub on a Sunday...
Hazy bright orange with a small white head. Turns to a swirly cap and ring and leaves some lacing. But it only got better from here.
Smell is very great and fruity. Tons of citrus, tangerine, tropical notes, grapefruit, but it does seem to fade quickly over time.
Taste exceeds the smell, easily. Still tons of hoppy citrus, tangerine and tropical notes. Warm biscuity malt and a little bit of earth, everything is balanced perfectly. Reminds me of PtE but the fruit is much more present. Aftertaste is amazing, lingers long after it's gone. The second glass was even better than the first, just excellent.
Along with the balance, the bitterness and carbonation are absolutely perfect. Drinkability is through the roof, 12 oz for $4 for the best DIPA I have had. 914 charactersChico1985, Aug 09, 2010

A- Hazy orange with a nice one finger white head. Retains but I drink it down out of anticipation. The head leaves a nice cloud, ring and very nice coat of fine lace.
S- Just where a Double IPA should be, reminds me of Sculpin. Fruit, citrus, peach. Such a good hop aroma, does not seem over the top, spot on. Hops glorified. Strength could be just a bit better.
T- Follows up the aroma. Hops everywhere. Peach, pine, earthy and lots of citrus. The best thing is the citrus, it lingers like a fresh fruit on the palate, orange. Perfect balance of hops with a fairly bready light malt backbone.
MF- Spot on again. Moderate body with some creaminess and smooth carbonation. Bitterness is right down the middle, where it should be.
DB- The best draft I have ever had for four dollars. Beats Pliny out in my mind. A truly great balance of many hop flavors, mouthfeel and citrus. I hope the Alchemist sticks to its ways and makes great beer like this for many years. 1,043 characterscbutova, Aug 08, 2010

A- Heady looks gorgeous. Cloudy, and a crazy greenish/hazy/yellow color that was invented with the first tapping of this beer. Beautiful head that holds up well.
S- Strong... the hops bite the nose right off the bat.
T- Sweet lord, this is delicious. Hops and more hops, and quite citrusy as well. Starts strong, and finishes clean without too much lingering bitterness. 
M- Chewable, if that makes sense. Heady is impossibly dense for how refreshing it is. Unexplainable.
D- Once the shock of the first sip or two wears off, these babies go down nicely. I wish I had opted for a third.
Revisit 10/26/14
My initial review (from the tap at the restaurant) was all 5s.  Unfortunately, after drinking the canned Heady many times over the past few years, I can say this beer has finally fallen off a bit.  The most recent batch I sampled had a muted profile, with a heavier booziness and milder citrus flavor.  The old wallop of flavor has become more of a jab.  It's still delicious, it just isn't quite the same beer, and certainly isn't "perfect" any longer.  Perhaps I will get a particularly good batch at some point in the future, but my days of running around trying to find Heady are over, if the quality indeed does vary batch to batch. 1,347 charactersstonermouse, Aug 03, 2010
4.68/5  rDev +0.6%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Finally made the long trek up here to be able to taste it in person. Reviewed from notes after my trip, I am finally getting around to getting these all caught up. Served in a pint glass.
The pour was what dreams are made of. All big IPA's should look this way. Seriously. Intense dark amber in color, nearly brown when all is said and done as it really just was darker then I ever would have thought. Big head of white caps it perfectly, two to three inches in height with a rocky and cratered appearance that really seem to hang on forever. Really just a tremendous looking beer I have to admit. The lacing coating the sides alone is enough to make you quiver, but then you decide to reach forward and try and take a big whiff, and that's when you will nearly fall over. It is just sublime. Huge citrus aroma here, tart and bitter as can be with pungent orange and pineapple mixing with the pink grapefruit aroma we come to expect in our big double IPA's. Huge nose, warming brings out a touch of butter malts underneath and a light, but discernable grain note. Each sip is like a step into hop heaven. Unreal freshness here. No hint of the ABV at all, in fact it was so smooth I could have sat here all day and drank this one, just remarkable. Rich orange and grapefruit tear at the taste buds, ripping every ounce of moisture from your palate and replacing it with a wonderful buttery flavor that is second to none. Smooth even carbonation and a rich medium body stacks it all up to being just a tremendous double IPA.
Overall I am just floored. I have been able to try this twice now and each time I am more impressed then before. Simply amazing and I wish more people would get to try this one. It can hold its own with any of the big boys any day of the week. 1,768 charactersmikesgroove, Mar 10, 2010

D- I don't care about the national hype train this is the best dipa I've had and the includes pliny. The only thing I've had that's better than topper is topper on cask. 485 charactersUA8, Mar 09, 2010
4.85/5  rDev +4.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5My new favorite DIPA, if not my new favorite beer overall right now! Extremely lucky to have been in VT while this was tapped. Enjoyed multiple times after SIPtemberfest with BeerTruth on 9/26/09. Unfortunately, the cask was already gone.
The Alchemist is dimly lit so as to the color, I can not speak with entire authority, but it is definitely a bit on the hazy side, medium amber/orange. 
Oh the smell! Sitting infront of the taps, we could smell it being poured and like Pavlov's pooches, salivation started. It's all hops right in your face, very citrus and grass, a touch sweet as well. 
The first sip was like heaven in a glass. The body is not too heavy and the malts are there to stand up to the hops no doubt. The hops are so abundant though that it leaves a sticky residue in the mouth....mmmm. This never came off as an unbalanced hopbomb though! I got a touch of caramel from the malt, maybe a hint of roast as well. This is extremely smooth and creamy, no bitter hop face was made while enjoying this beer :)
Easily drank one of these, a good portion of another, and seriously had to order one of the 3oz samples before leaving just to get that final taste. If I wasn't driving to Waitsfield on dark route 100 right after I easily would have had two more. Easily. Get this while you can folks, it is indeed that good. 1,335 charactersnaproxen, Sep 28, 2009

BA on the cell phone. This place looks good. GPS's timer is off by an hour. Sounds good let's make a trip of it.
A: Lighter than you would expect for a DIPA. The lacing was nothing short of amazing.
S: So that is what hops smell like. All those lovely Cs in a nice mix. There really was nothing else but goddamn those hops smelled nice.
T:Just a blast of citrus hops. Very nice and fresh tasting. The malt I guess was there but I ignored it. Up there with the hoppiest beers I have ever had.
M: A nice syrupy joy. Sticky mouthfeel.
D: I got a wild child and really loved it. Got this basically because my girlfriend wanted a taste. Thanks! Best DIPA I have had on tap by far. Damn their lack of growler fills. This beer is worth the hype. It I wasn't in the company I was in I would have reduced myself to a beast and lived behind the pub. Outstanding. 981 charactersaerozeppl, May 20, 2009

Listed at 8.20% now, my 12oz flute was filled with a flat, dull, apricot-colored liquid. It was a bit cloudy, with a creamy tan head and good stick. Nose was quite fruity, with citrus and hints of tropical action weighing in. Solid mouthfeel here; body was easily medium, and it felt quite good on the tongue. 
Topper had a touch of toasty malt at the outset, with subtle caramel, then segues into lots of citrus and rindy-ness. Some grapefruity resins coat the palate, and last quite well in the finish. Not as robust in the hop department as Holey Moley, but quite tasty nonetheless. Prosit!!

Off the tap it was a deep gold color leaning towards amber with some of its hues. The head was two-fingers thick, playground-sand-colored, displayed great retention as a perfectly tight cap and left consistent bands of thin lacing. The aroma was big and spicy, full of aggressive hops and a musty quality almost like armpit odor. I know that sounds awful but I was blown away by how much smell was emitting from this beer. The flavors were equally huge. A deep hop profile of pine, grapefruit and kumquat with some white pepper and similar spiciness was balanced nicely by the malt sweetness of toffee and butterscotch. The finish was again hoppy with edgy notes of bitter resin and some lemon zest. It was almost like a wet-hopped beer with the drinkability of good American Brown Ale because the alcohol was so well hidden. The mouthfeel was very smooth but the carbonation gave the right amount of 'fill' to its medium body. One of the best Vermont beers I have ever had and one of the best Imperial/Double IPAs I've ever come across. 1,129 charactersthekevlarkid, Feb 02, 2009
5/5  rDev +7.5%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Quite simply, it's the best beer I've ever had. I was privileged to be one of the first to try Heady Topper when it was introduced at the Vermont Brewer's Festival quite a few years back. After sampling about a dozen wonderful microbrews (in 3oz samples mind you, so I was still an objective critic), I stopped by the Alchemist tent & tried this new concoction.
I was immediately hit by a strong but delightful grapefruit flavor, quickly followed by a explosion of hops (the IBU rating is reported to be an insane 140+!). The mouthfeel was amazing & the aftertaste was perfection. My companions and I literally gave up on trying any other beers that night & just used the rest of our sample tickets on Heady Topper.
I'm blessed to live only about 45mins. away from the Alchemist brewery, which is unfortunately the only place you can find Heady Topper (I do respect their decision to not bottle as a quality control measure). I am planning a trip there this weekend & can't wait for a pint!
If you are able to make it to the Alchemist for a Heady Topper, do be warned---the alcohol content is over 10%, according to the brewer I spoke with. 1,143 charactersspittingoutteeth, Jan 28, 2009

Tap @ The Alchemist [Waterbury, VT] : Poured into a pilsner glass.
Appearance: Pours out orange with golden hues, puffy white head leaves sticky lace down the glass as the beer disappears 
Odor: Sticky fresh-pressed pineapple juice, pine sap, dank dank nuggets with sweet floral aromas in the background.
Consistency: On the low end of medium bodied, slick and oily with a refreshing dryness in the finish. Carbonation is moderate to low.
Taste: Wowee. The beer is built on a simple, subtle and sturdy malt frame. Dashes of caramel here and there but not much else. Restrained fruity ester profile. Bitterness is certainly firm, but by no means aggressive, at most prickling the palate with some grapefruit/pine. Hop flavor is immense, echoing the diversity in the aroma. Finish is very clean and as dry it possibly could be for style, leaving a coating of bittersweet hop flavor all over my mouth.
This is a rarity on the East Coast. A well attenuated IPA with a unique, diverse hop character that you can drink all night long. It's a shame that the Alchemist doesn't do growlers so more people can try this beer. 1,168 charactersWalken, Dec 01, 2008

Nice and orangey amber, I dove right in and picked up on an intriguing woody-earthy character in the aroma. There was also a nice new mown hay essence and candied hoppyness as well. That is a lot of excitement to live up to, but luckily, the beer delivered all of this in the taste as well. The earthiness was also pretty present in the finish. This is an excellent double IPA which will keep you ordering more. I can't say any more than that even at 8% abv...I still wanted to keep drinking. No taste fatigue or wobbliness in the legs after one. Nice beer. 617 charactersPatandDavid, Aug 21, 2005

Smell: Hop damn! Resinous, gooey cascade, piney, patchouli, weed and citrus. 
Taste: Wicked bitter, but feels almost milky in the gullet (thank you mister cask!). An all-out hop attack, the malt can't do anything but surrender to this unstoppable force. The hops were so intense that I actually had my fill of it, and spent the rest of my weekend drinking lambics and other low-alpha acid brews. I loved it and will have it again, but not 2-3 pints in one session. 693 charactersGoldorak, Jul 21, 2005

4.35/5  rDev -6.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap this past weekend.
Bright white, creamy head with solid retention. Ringed lacing that stuck throughout the entire pint. A hazy golden straw in color with some sediment.
Grapefruit, orange, lemon, and even light bubblegum. Very intense citric hop oils. Strong hop aromatics that promise good things in terms of flavor.
The flavor that the aromas led up to does not disappoint. Moderate citrus flavors: grapefruit and lemon combined with very strong hop oils. Light bubblegum that leads to a sharp, intense bitterness. Aftertaste is once again, citrus twinged hops. A fabulously hop infested Double.
Medium bodied; this was actually a little heavier and grainier on the palate than most of the style. A bit odd on the palate given the flavor tends to lean towards the lighter citrus scale of the hops.
Needless to say, this is a must try for hopheads out there. If you're in the area, do yourself a favor and give it a whirl. One of the only downfalls of this ale is that it drinks like a meal, so be careful with what you pair it with. 1,056 charactersNEhophead, Mar 24, 2005

Was able to stop in and try the Heady Hopper, which I have heard great things about. Needless to say I was not disappointed! The pint was poured to medium golden yellow color, was somewhat cloudy and had a nice sized white head that leaves very nice, thick lacing down the entire glass. The aroma was incredible, hops all the way! When it was served all I could smell was cascade hop aroma and I was three feet away from the glass! The flavors of this brew explode in the mouth from the hops, citrus grapefruit and oranges just dominate, while you are still able to pick up the malt but it was hard and it also disappeared quite quickly! I am not sure if I have had anything else that states that it has 120 IBUs but the hop bite was not unbearable, I am not sure if there is a level where IBUs dont really matter anymore but all I can say is that this brew was excellent, lived up to the hype and expectation. I honestly can say it may be one of my favorite brews of all time and by far was the best one experienced on this trip through Vermont. 1,138 charactersStimack, Feb 14, 2005

Presentation is a 12oz pilsner shaped glass, with a little foamy head over the dark straw colored brew. Laced excellently. Aroma lets no one forget this isn't called an imperial IPA for nothing, it's shouting "hops" to the hills. Taste was pleasantly of pale malts, and then the hops came through the swinging doors and took everyone out. Crisp, heavy, hops bitterness, and I swear I could see a hops oil slick on the surface, but maybe that was just me. Mouthfeel and drinkability are as expected of the style, if it's your thing, you're good to go, and if not, you're one-and-done. Meets the style to a T. A must have from The Alchemist. 666 charactersppoitras, Apr 25, 2004
4.2/5  rDev -9.7%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4On tap at the Alchemist brewpub in Waterbury, VT. Damn, 8% ABV and 120 IBU's, but totally smooth and tasty. Amber color with a low white bubbly head. Aroma is of citrusy hops. Smooth and even mouthfeel leads to an intense flavor of pineapple and orange peel hops with a hint of peaches. The ABV is subtle and not overpowering at all. A fine web of lacing dances around the inside of the glass. The flavor is consistent throughout the entire glass. This one is real tasty and I ripped through it because I couldn't stand the thought of it not rolling over my taste buds for more than a few seconds. 597 charactersfar333, Apr 01, 2004
4.97/5  rDev +6.9%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5Served a pale amber with a small light head. Hops are the flavor of choice here, but they are done right. Such a yummy bite. Actually does live up to it's name as the hops are strong enough to give off the heady within the buzz. Hops are not overly complex, yet not too simple either. This is one of the best IPAs I've ever had. Served only in 12oz glasses, the abv is not at all apparent. Sooo smooth. I'm sad that El Jefe is no longer on the menu, but I'd take the Heady Topper over the chief anyday. 502 charactersscottum, Mar 27, 2004
