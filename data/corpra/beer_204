Alpine IPAs never fail to deliver, and this bad boy (ho!) is no exception!

Overall - Super glad I was able to pick this up. Definitely recommended.

All the usual Alpine hop flavors, fruit, hides alcohol, pine, mary jane, mango.  Extremely crisp and dry finish.   Just another excellent big dipa from Alpine, all the usual feels.  Not as good as Nelson though. 406 charactersrodbeermunch, Jan 08, 2016

Flavor is juicy citrus and melon fruits and some dank rosewater. Grassy on the back end, seems like a hallmark of Alpine. Mouthfeel is smooth with a distinctive tongue tickle. Way too drinkable for how strong it is. Right up there next to Enjoy By and Dinner. 380 charactersRothobinide, Dec 27, 2015

Smell: fresh hops and god's vagina
Taste: best part of this beer by a landslide. how is it 9% ? nobody knows. well, at least i dont. 
Feel: perfect mouthfeel for a beer of this style. Medium, maybe slightly medium plus.
Overall: more people should try this beer. It's the best hoppy beer / imperial IPA in CA, and probably whole West Coast.
Thank goodness it was available a few days ago when I visited SD and this brewery for the first time.
This beer is epic. just drink it and you will know. 563 charactersluisitoelmatador88, Jul 08, 2015

Misc.: N/A
Poured a honey, light caramel, semi-clear color with 1-to-2 fingers of offwhite head when I got it. Lots of bubbles coming up from the bottom at parts of the glass. Very good layered, spiderweb lacing along the sides of the glass. Good retention on top. (Sight - 4.25)
Initial smell reminded me of a Duet. Got grapefruit spices, Citra hops, tropical notes, mango notes late, caramel, nectarine rind and floral hops. (Smell - 4.25)
First thought on taste was wow! Still reminded me or a Duet. Caramel, Citra hops, Columbus hops, bitter grapefruit pulp and just feels like I’m tasting pulp. (Taste - 4.50)
Medium body. Creamy texture. Average carbonation. Long, bitter, slightly warming finish, surprisingly. (Feel - 4.25)
This was a very, very good beer. So glad I’m living so close that I can catch some of these on random nights. (Overall - 4.25)

4.29/5  rDev -3.8%look: 4.25 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.25 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.25Appearance- Received with almost a finger's worth of head which disappears as I write this. The head is pure cotton white while the body is a pale to medium amber which appears as a golden straw when held up to the light. Light lacing as with Alpine's other beers. 
Nose- Have I mentioned that Alpine has hoppy beers on lockdown? Not bitter hophead beers but delicious fruity ones. More fruit notes with citrus notes taking the front (orange, lemon, and grapefruit). Some cherry. Notes of honey and caramel. Floral character. If this follows the aroma this is going to be the type of IIPA that I like. 
Taste- Follows the nose to a certain extent. There is definitely a good amount of citrus (orange and lemon) and other fruits- cherry and peach at the moment. Good amount of honey and caramel. However, the best aspect of the flavor profile is one I can't really describe adequately. This is an extremely fresh and bright beer. Some pine and resin but not enough to render this a hophead's beer. The pine and resin does have a bit of linger which also shows some matchstick and grapefruit. Some orange and lemon peel. Caramel meets up with a bit of matchstick and makes it tastes a bit burnt. Some mustiness. Armpit and dirty socks. It is a little too cold to tell but I'm not as impressed with it as others seem to be. Certainly not in the same class as Notorious, Heady Topper, or Pliny the Younger at the moment.
Mouthfeel- Close to medium bodied with a lot of carbonation and zing. It's undeniable- high carbonation seems to be as much of signature to Alpine's top beers as low carbonation is for HOTD's elite beers. Still works. The zing complements the freshness and spice of the high hops.
Drinkability- Very easygoing and each taste varies. Each one might not be the best I've ever had but it keeps it interesting. No heat at all and 5 bucks for a 12 oz pour seems pretty reasonable for a high quality IIPA. Especially considering that Apex charges 5 bucks for a 6 oz pour of Notorious. Notorious is great but not that great.
Overall- Really good beer that wants to be great but just isn't. I've had too many world class IIPAs to think otherwise. Definitely worth a try though. 2,191 charactersartoolemomo, Dec 16, 2013

Lacing is relatively slight in the Hill Farmstead Belgian stemware.
The nose is exceptionally bright and juicy, super juicy.Exploding with pineapple,mango and nectarine.
The taste is the payoff and a solid reflection of the amazing aroma: juicy tropical all the way.
Impossible to think Bad Boy is 9% abv as this is easily the most flavorful IIPA above 8% that reveals absolutely no alcohol, which is astounding. There is a slight warming in the throat after a full glass, but just an observation, not a negative.
Mouthfeel is light medium with a wonderful glide across the palate delivering just the right amount of carbonation, with a super crisp, dry finish.
Some IIPAs that have super high ratings are often overhyped: not the case with Bad Boy.
Alpine has created a masterpiece, and Bad Boy is easily one of the very best IIPAs I have been fortunate enough to sample.Huge thanks to SDPaul on this one! 1,008 charactersHendry, Sep 17, 2013

They'd always just blown the keg at lunch, or two hours ago, or right before I got there! But not this time! Bad Boy, Ugly, and Pure Hopiness all available at the same time for MY personal drinking pleasure! So I did...drink...and it was a pleasure!
App-Darker amber, almost brassy color. Not as much head as most Alpine beers, but no complaints. As pretty a picture of a big bold Double IPA as you could ask for. 
Smell- The only place it might fall short. The nose doesn't come anywhere NEAR advertising how much flavor there's going to be in this beer. Citrus, C-hoppy smell, with a bit of that grapefruity aroma I've come to connect with New Zealand hops (pac jade, pac gem, Nelson). 
Taste- Yeah...THIS is what I want from a big Double IPA. HUGE hoppy flavors just slap you in the face. There's not enough space to list the hop flavors that jump out at you, but pine, citrus, that distinctive 'C-hop' funk, and that pineapple/grapefruit background bite that lingers. Very nicely balanced with sweet maltiness, this is a beer I can drink and drink! One at the brewery, but my growler didn't last long once I got home either. You can feel the alcohol heat, but this brew is so well balanced, that no single aspect overpowers. 
Mouthfeel-A solid, malty, substantial mouthful, but that's needed to stand up to the huge flavors of this amazing brew. 
Overall- I don't think I could take it if this was available all the time. It's fantastic. Start to finish, it's got everything I want from a big hoppy Imperial. Top 5 Imperial IPA style, and maybe #1! 1,764 charactersSchnauzerlord, Sep 12, 2013

T: One of the best IPAs I've had. On par with Double Sunshine, Pliny the Younger, and Heady Topper. Very sweet rich body with caramel, toffee, and some burt sugar. The pine and earthy hops come forward immediately and balance the sweet malt flavors. Well done Alpine.
M: Thick creamy body with a little lacking in carbonation but overall very good.

Appearance is a brilliant clear gold with bright white head and decent lace. Nose is full of c-hops with heavy bright citrus notes along with some pine sap, lemon, syrup, and grass. The taste features quite the malt back bone with light molasses, rich caramel, and a moderate sweetness present before the hops overtake the flavor. Tropical fruits and grapefruit have an interplay between each other on the tail end. The body is medium with appropriate carbonation. Overall, this is a damn tasty IPA. Not sure I agree with the caliber of its average rating, but good nonetheless. 624 charactershomebrew311, Jan 30, 2013

Thanks to Florida9 for sharing this growler!
Some reggae-backed white trash crimes spring to mind... Anyway, this stuff pours a lightly hazy gold topped by a finger of off-white foam. The nose comprises leek, Sorachi-style lemon zest, and light straw. The taste brings in more of the same, along with a melange of bitter grass and other greenery. Supposedly others got some pleasant citrus out of this, but I was apparently not so fortunate. The body is a light medium, with a light moderate carbonation and a sorta/kinda dry finish. Overall, I just didn't get around to actually enjoying this beer. For me, the hops focused on onions and funky lemons with a biting bitterness behind them, and that combination is just not for me. 762 charactersTMoney2591, Oct 22, 2012

4.09/5  rDev -8.3%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4A: Clear amber in color. Forms only a smallish white head, even on an aggressive pour that fades to a fairly stable, rocky surface coating before collapsing into absolutely nothing. Moderate lacing. 
S: Nicely aromatic with a fair blend of hops and malt. Citrus, grapefruit, pine, caramel, and just a touch of tropical fruit. 
T: The flavor is rather restrained. Very clean and well balanced, but restrained. There is a lightly sweet mild malty backbone and some light caramel notes. Hops lean toward the citrus with a good bit of grapefruit with pine to a lesser extent. Quick finish. 
M: Medium bodied. Lower carbonation for the style. Mild to moderate bitterness. 
O: This beer is far more restrained than I was expecting it to be. It's a good DIPA, but I was expecting something a bit more "in your face" from it. However, while there are a good dose of hops to it, this is a fairly balanced brew for Southern California. Good, but not overly exciting. 960 charactersFlorida9, Oct 18, 2012

Got balance of caramel and biscuit mid palate with sweet citrus up front and loads of piney resinous hop in back.

Pours a clear golden with a topper of thick foam that rises four fingers.
What a yummy smell. Neutral sweet, grapefruit, orange zest, lemon, mango, honeydew melon. Enticing beyond belief.
The taste doesn't diappoint. It is all the flavors of the nose, bright and clean and balanced. The sip ends with just a hint of herbal bitter drying out the citrus perfectly.
This is where the beer shines. Very light on the palate, yet chock full of hop resin, something that seemingly is impossible. Low/med. carb. and a killer clean finish provide just the mouth to showcase a stellar cavalcade of flavors.
Defintely an astoundingly delicious beer, and I give it my highest recommendation along with my deepest thanks to a wonderful trade partner. 807 characterscavedave, Oct 05, 2012

taste: This is the 4th Alpine IPA I have sampled (pure, exponential, duet, bad boy) and all have been exceptional - the firkin serving allowed for some loose hop leafs to find their way into the tulip providing a nice touch. Tangerine zest, pine resin, hop oil, honey, grapefruit. Very nice - I went for seconds.

Pours a clear apricot color with a foamy white head with good retention and lace. 
Big citrus and mild pine hopped nose. A touch boozy. 
Flavor follows the nose with a hops explosion. Huge citrus hop character with nice sweet tropical fruit like pineapple and mango. A touch of cat pee funk and a little boozy heat. 
Mouth is medium bodied with high carbonation.

Appearance: The beer pours a beautiful clear amber color with a half finger of off white head. The head fades to a ring around the pour and leaves some mild lacing on the glass.
Smell: The hops aren't overpowering, but they're very nice. I'm getting some citrus peel and pine notes along with a rather pronounced sweetness from the malt. I'm also getting some citrus fruit notes along with the hops.
Taste: The hops are the star, but it's not one of those DIPAs that completely crushes your taste buds. A good amount of malt sweetness backs up the hops rather nicely. The hop bitterness contains some grapefruit rind notes along with some pine needles. The finish is quite bitter, but the malt still shows up.
Mouthfeel: The body of this one is just on the syrupy side of medium with smooth, tingly carbonation and a slightly dry finish.
Overall: This is a very good DIPA, but I feel it's a step below some of the big boys. I would drink this all day if it were easily available to me, but I don't know that I'd trade for another growler given the risk involved. 1,105 charactersoline73, Sep 06, 2012

A - pours a very light copper/amber with a 1/4" milky-white head on an average pour
S - dank and piney in the very best way. A touch of grapefruit and pineapple sweet mixed in for good measure.
T - slippery on the tongue leading into a bitter bite. Grass and resin coat the tongue all the way down the throat. Dry, bitter finish that lingers on the palate for a few seconds after swallowing. Leaves just enough piney goodness to warrant more tastes.
M - very clean with medium-low carbonation (I think I prefer it with a touch more carb like the times I've had it on draft). 
O - one of my favorite IPAs period. Hop profile is very distinctive to me and I always try to get a taste every time a new batch is available. 776 charactersEnish266, Sep 03, 2012

Pungent and floral. Room filling aroma, rich with tropical fruit, deep citrus tones, and an oily and resinous undertone. Absolutely fabulous, ready to dive right in.
Honey and bready malt quickly give way to intense hop oils and a resinous hop flavor that is pure and flows over the palate with a sneaky and lasting bitterness. Quite a transition from the nose. Alcohol well hidden.
Smooth, but quite a thick and viscous body. Carbonation is adequate. Shot through almost the entire glass in no time.
It's like Alpine took Ballast Point Sculpin and Stone's Ruination, shotgun married 'em and then stole the couple's first born child, put him on steroids and raised a Bad Boy indeed. Perfect aroma, well hidden ABV, thick and resinous hop profile. Well crafted offering from Alpine, a must try for any hop head. 967 charactersrawfish, Sep 01, 2012

The flavor profile is extracted orange peel oils, pine, bitter lemon pith and huge hop oils. The mouth is clean, crisp, refreshing and very balanced for the rather high abv. It finishes clean and refreshing, leaving bitter orange peel and pine sap that linger for a good half minute. Excellent DIPA from Alpine. 530 charactersOTB, Aug 31, 2012
4.88/5  rDev +9.4%look: 5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5This is bar none the best IPA Alpine makes. It was a tossup for me between it and Exponential Hoppiness for awhile but the latest batch ( Week of August 27, 2012 ) turned the tide.
A: Beautiful golden appearance, copper in lower light. Crystal clear. Large 3 finger, fluffy head on a normal pour. 
S: Pungeant hop aroma with a differing character from most WC IPAs - probably due to the British malts?
T: The ultimate IPA. Perfectly clean, malt/hop balance in perfection, dry finish. 9% that you can literally down a growler in an hour if you don't watch it. So damn good and smooth. 
M: Resinous, syrupy, oily perfection. 
I wish Alpine would switch Pure Hoppiness and this beer around. Bottle Bad Boy year round and make PH from time to time. 749 charactersevilc, Aug 31, 2012

A- Pours a bright gold with a one finger head that leaves adequate lacing.

T- Again plenty of peach and mango with pine needles, floral notes, caramel, grapefruit and some fresh herbs including rosemary.
M- Medium carbonation and body that finishes pretty dry. ABV is hidden very well.
O- Once again, Alpine makes a kick ass DIPA. No sign of the abv, which makes it dangerously drinkable. 614 charactersiadler, Jul 08, 2012

Came out a slightly darker, light brown dark orange pour compared to their many other excellent hoppy beers. Somehow the head and lacing were pretty damn impressive here. Aroma, usual mix of simcoe and amarillo I would suspect, but since its Alpine, it has that extra deliciousness going for it. Enjoyable musty light onion and sweetgrass almost makes me think about sauvin and summit hops. 
Big hop flavor, pine resin, herb resin, light fruit, warming alcohol nowhere near as strong as 9% usually tastes. Good bitterness, not grating, but not nonexistant green lushness either. Best of both worlds. Super dry finish and mouthfeel like all of Alpine's hoppy beers.
There's nothing really to set this apart, for better or worse, from Alpine's big lineup of ipas. Which means its awesome just like the rest of them. 847 charactersBeerandraiderfan, Jun 26, 2012

 Tons of sticky lace, dull finish and gold in color.
Aroma was fantastic. Juicy/resinous pine with some tropical fruit just below the surface. Thick and almost dank. (good dank) You can sense a higher ABV in the nose.
Dried Mango and a very interesting malt flavor. Big malt back bone here. Really juicy and just shy of sticky. It started off as interesting to me and it really grew on me as I worked through my glass. I swear I tasted almond for a moment. Just a really interesting and complex flavor. Again, the abv was present.

The beer is golden and clear with nearly an inch of white head. The aroma consists of hops, citrus, pine. A tad sweet, with hops leading the way. Nice blend of citrus and pine flavors. Very little malt profile. I don't think this is nearly as good as Nelson or Hoppy Birthday, which are some of the best beers on the planet, in my opinion. That said, this is another delicious IPA from Alpine. I would love to try this on draft from the source. 502 charactersHuhzubendah, Jun 07, 2012

Deep gold, like bullion. A little caramel as well, but the drink exhibits perfect clarity. One inch of head is white and fluffy as a cloud. It descends slowly, leaving sticky trails of bubbles. 
In the nose: orange peel, dankness, honey, caramel, a little basil. It’s actually so dank as to be almost funky.
The flavor gets much maltier, with a nice sweetness to boot. Lots of caramel and burnt sugar with dank, sticky hops. Grass, a little alcohol, and very lightly toasted biscuits swirl in the finish.
Soft, medium body. Moderate carbonation breaks the beer into a little fizz. Mild bitterness, balanced with aplomb by the malt.
Good boy, Bad Boy. It’s got incredible balance, with a big malt presence to balance them crazy dank hops, and is very drinkable for its strength. A fabulous IPA. 858 charactersPhelps, Apr 06, 2012

*From notes
-- Many thanks, Bill --
A: Clean and clear 24k gold. A carefule pour yields a .75 finger head. As it fades, a healthy white collar rims the glass.
S: Phenomenal. Juicy to the max, the fruit here is out of bounds.
T: Bitter melon, pink grapefruit and juicy hops dominate from the get-go. It's not overly bitter mind you, merely a perfect balance of hop oil and on the finish, a touch of golden malt. God damn this is good.
M: From a growler shipped from the opposite end of the country, this has held up incredibly well. The density keeps the massive flavors in check, and carries the beer to greater heights then you'd expect for a Double IPA.
O: Reach high and grab that bottle of Bad Boy off the top shelf. Seriously - this is pretty incredible and maddeningly drinkable. My hats off to another Alpine winner, a brewery I hold close to my heart.

The taste shows a little more citrus rind and grapefruit bitterness mixing with a sweeter, candied orange and pineapple flavor. Some juicy, peach notes come out in it as well with some of the grapefruit bitterness lingering into the finish. I love the candied fruits that come out in it. It was very juicy and fruity but also felt relatively balanced and drinkable as well.

yeah, more pine, grass and resin with the flavors. I like it as a contrast with ExpHop, which I thought was more citrus forward. This beer has hops, for sure. Malt? Not for sure. Joking...but the malt gives a very subtle hint of a backbone with some caramel. That's about all for the malt. 
Nice bite to it. It digs in. The resinous side leaves a bit of a filmy feel. This kills the snap or zip on the end. Oh well. 629 charactersMebuzzard, Mar 10, 2012

a - Pours a clear orange-amber color with one inch of white head and moderate carbonation evident. Looks very nice.
s - Smells of pine hops, citrus hops, oranges, grapefruit, fruity malts, and some floral hops. Ton of pine, and I enjoy the oranges, though there isn't as much as in Nelson. Really awesome fresh and hoppy nose.
t - Tastes of pine hops, oranges, citrus hops, tropical fruity, fruity malts, grapefruits, light earthy notes. Very nice taste though not as great as the nose. Some bitterness in the taste.
m - Medium body and moderate carbonation with some light bitterness. PRetty easy t drink for 9% ABV.
o - Overall another really nice hoppy beer from Alpine. It isn't my favorite Alpine beer, but it is right there with the majority of them. I think I actually like Duet the best personally, followed by Hoppy Birthday, but this is probably tied for third, and they're all great. I think if you can find this, or any of their hoppy beers, fresh you should get it in a heartbeat. 1,138 charactersmdfb79, Mar 06, 2012
4.15/5  rDev -7%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Growler provided by Dan. Thanks, this is sort of a big deal...a top 100 beer that I have never ticked. At the time of this review, this is the #67 beer on the "Top Beers - Popular", #11 on the "Top Beers - Double IPA", #48 on the "Top Beers - United States", and the #19 beer on the "Top Beers - West Coast" lists, one of my biggest wants. Thanks Dan. Ultimately this is not the best IPA they make...I like fresh Nelson better. I wll definitely have this again if I find it on draft when I finally make it to Alpine. But as it stands now this was a let down for me.
Beer is orange, mostly clear, off white head, nice retention, some lacing, moderate carbonation.
Aroma is grassy, piny, mildly citrus, earthy.
Beer is very hoppy, sweet mildly and earthy, grindingly hoppy, nice flavors with moderate to high bitterness on the backend. Very strong, nice, but the hops seem slightly decayed and the beer is quite resinous. I would definitely have it again on draft but in a growler probably not. 995 charactersdrabmuh, Mar 06, 2012

Look: Pours a nice shade of yellow with some orangish hues. Only a 1/8 inch on the pour but that was probably my fault for pouring it too slowly there is some spotty lacing left on the glass
Smell: Very powerful nose and for me the clear cut winner of this beer. Very bright crisp and clean citrus notes with some piney hops hiding in the background
Taste: Very similar to the nose but just not as bright and crisp still a damn fine tasting beer
Mouthfeel: A touch thinner than medium body with not quite medium carbonation
Overall: Just another damn fine IPA from Alpine 615 charactersDarthKostrizer, Mar 06, 2012

Pours a clear honey orange with an off-white head that settles to an oily film on top of the beer. No lacing on this one. Smell is of citrus zest, citrus fruit, and honey aromas. Taste is quite exceptional with a very nice balance between citrus zest, citrus fruit, and a honey sweetness. There is a medium amount of bitterness on the palate after each sip. This beer has a good level of carbonation with a crisp mouthfeel. Overall, this is a very good IPA with an awesome citrus presence. 572 charactersUCLABrewN84, Mar 05, 2012

Alpine Beer Company Pub
Alpine, CA
Clear, light golden yellow in color with a loose, big bubbled, near-white head that leaves ribbons of stick down the glass.
Incredible aroma. I could smell how pungent and bright this beer smelled even as the waitress placed it down in front of me. The aroma is a big, powerful combination of citrus (orange and grapefruit) and big notes of pine forest. This would make for a wonderful air freshener for my car. This stuff smells great!
The flavor is big, bold, and aggressive. The bitterness is fairly high with lots of pine/resin/marijuana flavors. There's some mild citrus present as well, but this is big, dank, and piney. Very nice.
Medium bodied with moderate to high carbonation.
Just fantastic. This isn't as unique or interesting a beer as Nelson, but it's just as good as Pure Hoppiness, and in my opinion, better than Exponential Hoppiness. 899 charactersehammond1, Mar 01, 2012

Draft to 10oz
@Downtown Johnny Browns
App- A weird looking light medium orange with a smalled one finger head that was a bit off white in color and then falls to reveal great great cling.
Smell- A pine forest in a nose. Grapefruit, orange juice, hop oil and a biting bitter nose rounds out this one.
Taste- For a profile I don't seek out, I would on this one. Opens with a damp deep citrus nose and then moves to a pine tree esque biting bitter flavor. Its damn good and I dont like this profile. Important so I said it TWICE!! Huge flavor and layers of citrus and bitter
Mouth- Medium bodied and medium carbonation with huge residual pine tree, orange zest and dampness. Just a good feel.
Drink- Its really good but for a profile I dont seek out cant go 5. Find it, drink it! This means you E!!! 822 charactersFosterJM, Feb 22, 2012

Smells really hoppy, lots of fruits, grapefruit, mango, lemon. A ton of hops that overwhelm the malts in a good way. I love hop forward beers from Alpine and this is a great example.
Tastes similar, with tropical fruit flavors. Finishes crisp and dry, medium body with an oily mouthfeel.

Pours a dark orangey color that suggests a malt profile. The nose is big tropical hops, citrus goodness, medium malt body and resiny pine. Tum. Tropical citrus (orange, pineapple) and dank pine hoppiness on top of a moderate malt base. This beer is crazy good. So drinkable that I would likely drink too much before I knew what happened. Good carbonation, good medium body. Not too much of a sugary mouthfeel like you sometimes get with IIPAs. Overall, this beer is really, really good. I would like many more growlers of this. Yum. 689 charactersseeswo, Nov 15, 2011

Pours a half finger of white head. Really nice lace rings. Color is a clear golden orange. Solid.
Aroma: Dank and hoppy. Cascade hop flavor. Light onion notes. Not to fruity, but a little shows. Very solid.
Taste: Very dank and weedy. Again, a cascade onion touch shows. Grassy and floral. Straight up hops. No malts.
Mouthfeel: Bitter but smooth. Medium bodied with a medium amount of carbonation. Ends sticky, but clean.
Overall, a really awesome beer. Very drinkable. Top notch dipa. I could drink a lot of this in a night. 563 charactersmothman, Nov 09, 2011

T: More of the same. Loads of dank tropical fruit flavors followed by a crisp dry finish. Sublime.

Pours clear pale golden, with minimal head consisting of a ring of white foam, and no lacing. Smell is juicy grapefruit and orange, some floral in the secondary, with a hefty dose of sweet malt. Taste is similar, dry, also now with some pine. Mild carbonation and medium-full body, not much alcohol presence. Overall, very drinkable, nice light citrus hop flavor with a good amount of malt backbone. Delicious! More malty than some of their other offerings, but overall another winner from Alpine. 545 characterspmarlowe, Nov 05, 2011

A: My Bad Boy arrived a super clear golden light colored pale. Another brim reaching pour that held only just a collar of white foam. Fading out rather quickly but showcasing some nice lingering lace. 
S: Smells real fruity with big notes of grapefruit zest and sticky greens. Some sweet sugary malts bring a soft caramel aroma behind all of the fruits.
T: Tastes just plain danky! Piney hops are in your face and resinous. Citrus-Grapefruit flesh and stone fruit notes. Hints of pineapple. Bitterness is subtle at first then intensifies towards the back of the palate and linger ever so nicely. Has an underlying caramel sweetness like sugary crackers. Alcohol presence with a bit of chest warmth but extremely well masked. Very light and dry in the finish for a DIPA. Damn this is really good.
M: Light semi-dry body with a puckering finish. Creamy in texture. Good carbonation. Sticky hop resins coat the mouth.
D: A definite Bad Boy. Probably one of my favorite all-time DIPA’s due to such great balance. Very quaffable.
A real hoppy DIPA and one I would consider some of Alpine's best work. Caramel sugar support but not too sweet. Alcohol warmth but not too boozy. Highly recommended.
Drink Alpine or go to bed! Actually I think after a few of these one would be going to bed. 1,314 charactersNugganooch, Oct 20, 2011
4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5Huge, massive thanks goes out to DearthVader for yet another growler of delicious California goodness (50th review, hardly a milestone, but I'll note it anyway for personal reference).
64oz growler poured to an Alpine pint. Filled about 1-2 weeks ago. Possible leakage issue during shipping but there was still a good hiss when I cracked the growler.
Pours yields a 2" off-white head that shows pretty good retention but very inconsistent lacing. The perfect clarity for this medium yellow-orange brew keeps the score so high.
Smell is excellent. Huge tropical aromas with a bit of citrus in the background. Big mango and peach, huge malty sweetness and a bit of grapefruit. Taste follows the nose for the most part with a bit more complexity in the tropical notes and big juicy resinous hops. The mango is a bit like fried mango. Screwing around in the kitchen one day a dropped a couple little pieces in the fryer with no batter and it's very akin to the wonderful flavor great DIPAs have. Low carbonation and medium mouthfeel, a bit lighter in body than similar DIPA's. 
Normally, I will have finished my review when I am about half way through my drink but this stuff is insanely drinkable and I had to pour another pint before I had adequately assessed the smell. Heady Topper is on deck but for now this is the king of DIPA's, in my opinion. 1,351 charactersLSUPT, Oct 19, 2011

A: Crystal clear pale, orange-copper body. Inch, inch and a half of creamy white foam sits on top after the initial pour. Spotty lacing is left down the sides of the glass.
S: Assertive mix of citric and pine notes. Tangerine, orange and a little bit of grapefruit. 
T: Like the nose this is an assertive blast of fresh citric notes and resinous pine. The hops come through more so in terms of flavor than overwhelming bitterness. Another stellar flavor profile from Alpine IPA/dIPA.
M: Medium bodied with lively, but appropriate, carbonation. Crisp, refreshing finish. Incredibly easy to drink given the 9% ABV.
O: Cracked this open in the parking lot of Capones before the Hill Farmstead event. It easily outshined Ephraim, Amarillo, and Abner... and also beat out the can of Heady Topper that was opened before the event as well. Alpine does it again. 889 characterscallmemickey, Oct 16, 2011

Pours a very clear gold with a two finger foamy head.
Heavy tropical fruit, grapefruit and some pine in the nose. Your standard west coast IPA.
Light citrus flavor hits the tongue first then rolls straight into a piney bitterness that lingers on the tongue finishing crisp and dry. Hop forward beer.
Mouthfeel is light with good carbonation levels even from a growler.
Another very good beer from Alpine, but I prefer Hoppy Birthday and maybe Duet to this. 500 charactersjmarsh123, Oct 15, 2011

The beer pours a clear golden/amber color with two fingers of snow white head. The foam recedes leaving minimal lacing. An aroma of citrus fruit fills the air as I pour. Orange, grapefruit and pale malt combine to produce that signature Alpine IPA smell. The first sip is pure bliss. Bitter grapefruit out of the gate followed by dank hemp. More citrus mid-palate in the form of orange blossoms and pineapple. Exquisite bitterness and pine resin in the finish. Feel is medium leaning toward full with a nice prickly level of carbonation. Bad boy is my favorite beer from Alpine, and IMO one of the best DIPAs on the market. seek this one out, it will not disappoint. 695 charactersSideswipe, Oct 15, 2011

Appearance: My growler pour is a fairly transparent light copper color with a light eggshell head. Eventually fading to a collar, there is a bit of lace down the glass.
Smell: Some light sweetness to go along with a lightly toasted biscuity graininess. Some bubblegum and honey as well. The hops are blended quite well. Grapefruit, sticky pine, and some herbal notes provide the hoppy goodness.
Taste: The flavor starts with a honey biscuity malt sweetness, with a little bit of spice and bubblegum yeast in the middle, which adds a Belgian quality. The hops have pineapple, grapefruit, spicy pine, and a little herbal character.
Mouthfeel: This has a fuller than medium body, starting sweet and staying juicy through each sip. A creamy mouthfeel that has a prickly pine nature and is lightly grainy as well. A little bit of booze adds character and depth. 
Overall: As part of the growler side by side tasting we had, this absolutely killed our other offerings. I would definitely go back to this. Every time I have something from Alpine, I regret that I do not live there. Like in the fermenters. 1,194 charactersKickInTheChalice, Oct 14, 2011

Pours a clear golden orange with a healthy dose of white foam. Fades into a white ring.
Smell is fantastic. Piney hops, subtle dank and citrus notes, light grainey malt, a bit of honey sweetness, and faint belgian bubblegum. Delicious.
Taste is excellent - leaving you with hoppy and crisp impressions. Starts with honey and biscuits, then the hops hit the palate. Piney, bitter, citrus. It's a beautiful crisp progression and amalgamation of flavors that works really well.
Mouthfeel is crisp, medium-light bodied, and well carbed. I think the growler hurt the feel a bit - carbonation could have lasted longer.
Overall, yet another outstanding Alpine IPA. Right up there with Pure Hoppiness and the top notch FFF DIPAs for my favorite hoppy beers. 876 charactersreadbaron, Oct 14, 2011

A: Pours a brilliant, clear copper-orange body capped with a well-retaining off-white head. It collapses into a ring around the beer, leaving no lace or curtains. 
S: Citrus hops cranked up to 11: lemon, tangerine, pineapple, grapefruit, peach. Small aroma of pine underneath. 
T: This is semi-dry, with a moderate sweetness that accentuates the fruity smorgasbord of the nose. The dominant flavors here are tangerine, grapefruit, pineapple, and grass. A touch of peach and lemon are detected near the finish, which transitions into a light, lingering piney aftertaste. The grassy prominence is a bit unusual for me, but it is well tempered by citrus flavors, and it makes for a unique spin on the beer. 
M: Medium+ bodied. Well carbonated. No lingering sweetness or oiliness. Very clean finish. 
O: What a fantastic beer. 986 charactersArbitrator, Oct 13, 2011

Slightly hazy orange color with a thin cap that fades to a collar.
Man, this aroma gets me excited. packed full of tropical juicyness, the tangerine is to die for in here. Aroma is perfect, truly.
The flavors attack from the same luscious pineapple, mango, tangerine, and orange tropical notes that were exhibited by the aroma, not very bitter here which allows the flavors to be clearer.

4.17/5  rDev -6.5%look: 3.5 | smell: 4 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Decided to make a trip down to Alpine today and was greeted by an amzing tap list.
It pours a translucent copper with a nice 1 finger head of pure white foam. The head falls to a crown and doesn't leave any lacing. 
It's really hard to get passed the hops in the aroma, but that's a good thing. The nose is jam packed with delicious, juicy hops. Definite citrus notes as well as some nice malt.
Taste follows the nose. The hops just grab hold of your taste buds and dont let go. Very dry finish with a nice citrus resin left behind.
The absolute perfect mouthfeel. Dry, and relatively light. This beer invites 100 degree weather to the party. Insanely refreshing and you can't notice the 9% ABV at all.
This is a great beer. It takes two glasses before you love it though. Kind of your typical DIPA at first, but after the second pour, you understand why it's rated how it is. Well done Alpine. 899 charactersDearthVader, Oct 08, 2011

4.29/5  rDev -3.8%look: 3.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Another nice one from Alpine, these guys seem to know something about hops. Thanks to Matt (starrdogg) for sharing this one last night. 
At first I didnt know if I loved this compared to other offerings from Alpine, but the more I had to more I liked it. At first the hops seemed unbalanced but I think once you get pas the first sip it seems to make more sense and taste delicious. 
A: The beer pours a super hazy opaque orange with some lacing left and a small ring of fluffy head. Looks kind of like some homebrews I've had, usually like a little brighter orange and less cloudy with more head, but still looks good. 
S: Very raw spicy hop aromas, reminds me of opening those air tight bags of hops that homebrewers use. Super dank, kitchen spice, vegetable hop aromas, grass, and even more herbal hops. Not much malt but I dont care. 
T: Not super balanced, very much in the direction of hops with little malt to speak of, and at first I was a little put off but then started to really love the hop bite. Raw luscious grass and citrus hop. I can't even really say theres much malt character, its mostly just a bit of sweetness. 
M: Bitter back, sweet up front, not super thick but oily over the palate.
Overall another nice beer, but not my favorite from them, which isn't saying much cause most of the time I give their beers A+. Another hop heads dreamy beer! 1,371 charactersDreadnaught33, Oct 08, 2011

Growler poured into a Pint glass.
A - Pours a clear, medium orange with a half finger, near-white head. The head fades mostly to the sides and leaves spots of lacing on the glass.
S - Very strong citrus - orange, lemon, and honey.
T - Orange, grapefruit, lemons.
D - Average body and carbonation. Very smooth.
O - Very fruity and wonderful. 379 charactersHuskyinPDX, Oct 08, 2011

A: Pours a dark but very transparent gold with a hint of red. A small fragile and foamy head that leaves small slices of lacing. 
S: Holy hop heaven. Deep dank, citrus, and wheat, hops on tops of hops. Majorly pungent, but not at all obnoxious.
T: The nose says it all. Nice smooth tame dank flavor explodes into citrus hop mayhem and gets carried out in a cart of wheat and wood. Can alpine be any better and destroying the IPA/DIPA world?
M: The mouthfeel is certainly the weak spot on this beer if it has one. It's been in the growler for a little while and underwent some long transportation, so it might account for its very slight flatness. Regardless it's delicious, and is just so overshadowed by the good spots on this beer.
O: This is Alpine showing off. Most breweries cant make one decent IPA. Alpine makes another.. and another.. and another.. all so unique, all so delicious, and all kings-- this one is no different and definitely a top 3 alpine brew for me. 1,054 charactersKlym, Oct 08, 2011

A- Pours a clear golden yellow color, nice lacing and retention, ½ finger off white head.
S- The aroma is fantastic, big fruity aroma, spice, mango, citrus, peach, grapefruit, pineapple.
T- The taste is very similar to the aroma, really fruity and complex, really smooth as well, peach, mango, pineapple, citrus, some peppery spice in the background, nice malt base to balance it out.
M- Medium mouth feel, really smooth drinking with a crisp/dry finish.
O- Another amazing DIPA from Alpine, they can do no wrong in my eyes when it comes to IPAs. Smooth, complex, and easy drinking. 675 charactersChriscrundwell12, Oct 02, 2011
4.35/5  rDev -2.5%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Growler provided to me by my In-Laws. Amazing hook up in the greater Escondido area! I placed a phone call to my wife about the prospect of making it out to Alpine. We couldn't due to our work schedules, so her parents grabbed us a growler. Way too awesome.
Poured into my Woodshop Classix snifter, good times. 
A: Light white grape juice body with some soapy smearing lacing off of a 3 finger head. I was very pleased with the head formation out of the growler, and the bubbles pop with a fury of freshness. The body is quite clear with a lot of white wine characteristics to the body. A slow stream of bubbles whirlpools in the middle of the glass. 
S: White grapefruit, pineapple juice, and some peaches really come off strong in the nose. The notes are softer, hence the "white", but it's really juicy. The hops come off very pomello and white grapefruit. There is a hard to explain lightness and dryness to the smell that just makes it seem fresh, yet mellow. 
T: Really crisp white peach, white grapefruit, white nectarines, and a light currents/white cranberry dry flavor. There seems to be a bitter acidity to the flavor that I can't quite pinpoint, but it's quickly lost after repeat sips. Massive floral quality that makes me think of some foreign teas that I'm not really familiar with. Perhaps the slightest bit of orange blossom in the end. 
M: Super fluffy and full dessert mousse feels in the mouth where the alcohol coats like a thin layer of honey. The hops linger with a mellow citrus rind bitterness that feigns dryness behind a flavorful layer of alcoholic marmalade. Sticky, but not quite thick with resins. It's more like having a fresh citrus jam than a wet linger of a strong booze.
O: What a big surprise, another amazingly delicious DIPA from Alpine. I really have just become so numb to the extremely high quality of their IPAS/DIPAS that I can hardly see past the incredible consistency of their work. There is more of a white citrus, fruit, and berry flavor in this than I've ever had in any other DIPA. I don't know for certain what the ingreidents in this beer were, but this certainly seems to be a Citra brew in the nose. I'm not certain if it's single hop, but the way that Alpine makes their beers to be so jammy and full convinces me than can work magic even with the most basic of ingredients. Throw in a super pungent hop and you end up with lightning in a glass like this one. Simply outstanding and worth seeking out. 2,463 charactersCavery, Oct 02, 2011

S: Dear God. The smell of this one is amazing. Huge pine hops, mango and a ton of hop resins. Incredible.
T: There's a big, peppery pine hop bite right off the bat and then a little bit of bready malt that evens things out just enough. The finish is huge and bitter, like sucking on a hop cone. There's a hint of tropical fruit sweetness towards the end. This is an absolute must-try. 450 charactersnotchucknorris, Apr 12, 2011

Appearance -- Pours a semi-hazed tumeric yellow with a slim sudsy white head. Very unique coloring. Photogenic for sure.
Smell -- Tropical fruit bomb, particularly papaya and pineapple. Caramel malt as well, along with a dab of underlying resinous bitterness. Hop aromas are just beautiful.
Taste -- Bright citrus and tropical fruits in abundance: papaya, mango, sticky ripe pineapple. A slight green onion flavor is also present, but not much of a distraction. Gently sweet caramel base, but a solid baseline hop bitterness keeps this in check. Dry finish.
Mouthfeel -- Smooth, medium-bodied with moderate carbonation. Slightly boozy.
Overall -- Amazing DIPA! This takes tropical fruit bomb to a new level. Really exceptional, even topping Exponential Hoppiness. If I lived in the area of the brewery I'd drink this any time I could find it on tap. 929 charactersyeahnatenelson, Apr 11, 2011

A - Amber colored beer with two fingers of head that had some good retention and left a nice bit of chunky lacing on the sides.
S - Lots of tropical notes and fruits in this one. The hop profile is not very resinous, and has some more fruit and citrus notes. The bittering aspect to it is not harsh at all.
T - This is such a great tasting brew, made even better possibly by the fact I had just drank a less that stellar DIPA. Tropical notes are great, and there is a sufficiently soft bittering quality that keeps it balanced. Malts are not dominating at all, rather complimentary if you're looking for them, great stuff.
M - Crisp carbonation and medium bodied. Strays away from being too sugary.
O - Great beer, Alpine is very good at doing DIPAs, and this one is no exception. Would love to drink it again. 1,016 charactersAgentZero, Apr 07, 2011

This great looking DIPA poured a light orange, almost honey-colored, with a two-finger, white-as-snow head. There was healthy, sticky lacing with good retention. The nose was wonderful - orange, mango, lemon, pine, floral and citrus hops predominating but some sweetness in the back. Taste was near perfection - tropical fuit and grapefruit with light malt notes. There was the expected (refreshing, not off-putting) moderate bitterness, especially in the finish. Mouthfeel was medium-bodied, lightly carbonated, and crisp, even after it warms. There was no hint that this could be 9%, so it's dangerously drinkable. Maybe Alpine makes an OK beer but I haven't had it and this one sure isn't it. Having now had over 150 different IPA's and DIPA's, this jumps easily near the top. Do those of you who live close to the treasure know how fortunate you are? I love this beer AND this brewery! If you get the chance - grab it! 1,000 charactersregspeir, Apr 05, 2011

From notes taken at the Alpine Beer Pub.
A - Light amber color with a 0.5 inch head that is white and very dense.
S - Aroma of dank hops. Some pine oils and some nice resin notes. Some lsight sweetness formt eh hops as well. Pretty hop forward. Not as booze heavy as expected with the 9%.
T & M - Dangerously smooth. Nice pine notes with some good dank hops and sticky resin notes. Citrus fills the middle of the beer with a slightly bready balance and then a bitter and dry finish that leaves a nice hoppy mess. Mouthfeel is a bit on the medium side with some sweet notes but mostly a easy drinker. Except for the higher ABV that is well hidden. 
O - Its appropriately hop forward but quite smooth at the same time. Can be dangerous because of the ease of drinking. Solid DIPA. 809 charactersJoEBoBpr, Apr 03, 2011

Thanks to smokepot23 for the growler. 
Pours a nice deep gold, just slightly hazy. Nice 2 fingers of loose white head. Good chunks of lacing. Nice retention.
Tropical fruits, pineapple, grapefruit... Mmmm. This has a great nose. Certainly not like Sarah Jessica Parker at all. 
The flavor is very nice as well... I think the nose is better than the flavor, although not are quite nice. This is a quintessential DIPA. There is absolutely nothing about this beer that I am not enjoying. The flavor has a light (very light!) malt like crackers. The hops have a nice tropical fruit and grapefruit note. Fantastic bitterness just loitering in my mouth... Very nice.
As this warmed up, I did find one thing I disliked: there is a hint of garlicy summit hops... Meh.
The body is nice- well carbed and relatively light. Very easy to drink. Me likey.
I will keep this one on my wants list.

Smell: Tropical fruit and hops so strong you feel a scatchy sensation on the back of your throat. So fresh its oozing though the glass. Last DIPA that this compares to is PtY. Is this dry hopped? Could have fooled me.
Taste: Smooth. Well done hidding the 9+%. Drinking other high ABV DIPAs leaves you with the feeling of breathing fire this brew seems to hide the fact very well. There is no bitterness on the back end, the epitome of a fresh DIPA. No malt favors distorting the back end flavor. A dance in your mouth of hops and tropical flavors.
Mouthfeel: Why not just finish the whole growler? Drinkability is so easy that one could.
Overall: A perfect DIPA IMO. I will put it side by side with Hopfather and PtY. Drink up while its fresh. Shawn knocked this one out of the park.
Serving type: on-tap at Alpine and a two growlers to go. In addition I had a Pure Hop on cask with dry hops added... very tasty. 1,083 charactersDJButters, Mar 31, 2011

Reviewed from notes from San Diego Beer Week
Pours a clear yellow orange, little carbonation, little head. Looks oily.
Smells of strong pine, some tropical notes, alcohol. Did I say pine?
It tastes of bitter, piny hops up front, probably the most bitter of Alpine's line-up. Turns to sweet, caramelly malts with a tropical nuance, suggesting mango-papaya. Spicy alcohol burn. Finishes amazingly balanced and clean.
It feels big and creamy on the palate, not sticky. Plenty of deceptive carbonation that wasn't seen in the pour.
I could drink this all day. Alpine makes some of the best IPA's out there, this is yet another.
Update 9/15/11: Just got a growler of the latest batch...did a line up of Bad Boy against Kern River Citra and PtE, my three favorite DIPA's. Alpine seems to have perfected this beer - it was the best of the three. 870 charactersrand, Jan 26, 2011

Transparent medium orange pour with a nice head and spotty lacing throughout.
Fresh tropical fruits on the nose: pulling loads of fresh cut pineapple and white gooey nectarine. Discernible sweetness, but mostly in the form of natural fruit sugar. Nice.
White nectarine really stands out here. Uncanny. Starts sweet and juicy and ends resinous, dry, and mildly bitter.
Overall quite nice and though I realize it's 9%, the bite here is evident. Really my only qualm and it's a small one. If the abv were somehow better hidden, this would be fantastic. As is, it's still very, very good. 667 charactersBarrytheBear, Dec 15, 2010

Thanks, Arthur. Snifter.
A: Transparent dark orange with a frothy white head. Good clarity and color. Good head retention and scattered lacing.
S: Grapefruit, orange (pith and flesh), peach, pine resin, crackery malt, a little alcohol. Splendid aroma. Short lived sweetness, very dry on the whole.
T: Upper moderate bitterness. Ephemeral sweetness, pulverized by a citrus attack comprised of grapefruit rind and flesh, as well as orange flesh. There's some peach in there also. Pine is pervasive, and malt has no real presence aside from light cracker notes. Alcohol is noticeable. 
M: Sticky and dry mouthfeel. Medium body. Good carbonation.
Overall: A top notch Double IPA and consistently one of my favorites. 728 charactersHopHead84, Nov 27, 2010

A: Pours a clean golden/light amber (apple juice) hue with a decent head and small amounts of lacing from start to finish.
S: Major floral hop - earthy and sweet, fresh cut grass, grapefruit, a bit of grain and malt but the hops are running the show.
T: Earthy hops with a ton of citrus bight, a bit of tropical fruit, sweet malt and grain to finish - not too sure where they're hiding the 9% ABV, because there's hardly a trace of it in the flavor, and it's not over-rmalted like a lot of DIPA's out there - just hops for daze!
M: Medium-bodied and surprisingly very dry for a DIPA (none of the sticky mouthfeel you generally get from this beer style), the mellow carbonation lends to the smoothness well and the bitterness in the mouth from the hop is amazing. 
D: Ridiculously drinkable for a DIPA, but man the 9% sneaks up and takes control. Don't get me wrong, my growler's empty, but I think i'm done for the night! 1,047 charactersDeanMoriarty, Nov 27, 2010

Smell: Strong pine note over a slight caramel base with pineapple sweetened edges. Some grapefruit notes lend support. Really nice but I'd expect a bit more punch out of a geniune west coast DIPA from a brewer as reputable as Alpine.

The aroma was pretty damn piney with floral hops, citrus, slight mango, and a good sweet malty presence. Upfron the piney hop notes stand out nice on the palate alongside citrus grapefruit that help out on the overall bitter bite but also had mango accents and a great malty backbone to balance out the piney potentcy. The brew was medium body with a fair amount of carbonation which had a piney hoppy bitter crisp finish.

4.87/5  rDev +9.2%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 4.5Poured into my Maui Brewing tulip/pint glass at roughly 45 degrees Fahrenheit.
A: A pale copper body with a white colored head and decent amounts of lacing; looks pretty darn tasty! 
S: A robust and clean forest/pine aroma throughout with hints of grapefruit and orange towards the second half. Upon further analysis (And what I mean by "analysis" is...basically sticking my nose into my glass and inhaling this BAD BOY for several minutes), I was able to pick a very rich and complex malt body that wasn't there initially. This character was noticeable enough, that it was almost as if I had just picked up a handful of malted barley from my local homebrew shop. 
T: The initial sip is a combination of citrus fruits, and again, pine-like flavors. The malt body is sweet at first, which I think might be attributed and enhanced by the high alcohol presence, but then transcends into a sharp "grapenut" (yes, like the cereal) quality. The alcohol presence is detectable, but in many ways, helps accentuate a lot of the underlying flavors of the beer. 
M: A medium body DIPA that leaves a thin layer of oil on the palate. 
D: Even though this was a high gravity beer, Bad Boy was able to make up for some of it's heat by supplying the palate with ample amounts of flavor and complexity. 
Overall: This beer reminds me in so many ways of Pliny the Elder straight from the source. A sweet and rich malt body, accompanied by tons of clean...yet fruity hop flavors and characteristics. A masterpiece to say the least...and probably the best DIPA produced by San Diego County. A must try. Cheers! 1,596 charactersOlieIPA, Aug 30, 2010

A-Pours a very clear light amber color. When it is held up to the light, it becomes quite golden in color. It has a one finger off white head that stays at a good level. A ring of lace is left in between each sip.
S-This is the closest beer I have found to PtY in terms of aroma. It has an awesome hoppy nose that screams West Coast. It is a pefect blend of pine, mango, melon, and candied citrus. 
T-Like the nose, this one has lots of hop flavor. It begins with lots of resiny pine flavor. The fruit in the nose at first is pushed out. It has a pale malt backbone that adds just a touch of sweetness on the finish. It has a dry finish that is common for a superior WC DIPA. I found after a few sips the hop oils and resinous pine gave way to more of the citrus and fruit character of the hops.
M-Medium bodied and lightly carbonated.
D-The booze is extremely well hidden. This drinks like a 6-7% IPA. 
Another outstanding beer from Alpine. Well worth seeking out if you can find an Alpine contact. 1,098 charactersmjl21, May 29, 2010

Aroma is the best part. Tons of pine hops and nice citrus as well. Smells amazing.
Taste is great. Very hoppy. Hop bomb for sure. But pretty malty too which was surprising for alpine. Usually they make them pretty dry. It's got lots of citrus hops but lots of pine hop flavor as well. Pretty tasty.

M/D: Did not get that aftertaste as most DIPA's have. Very bold yet subtle, delicate faint and mysterious... This Bad Boy left a smile on my face. Alpine should bottle this brew. A definite hot seller and very drinkable. Way to go Alpine. 672 charactersBajasith, May 24, 2010

BB pours a lovely golden peach color with excellent head retention and considerable lacing. On the nose, this beer is a thing of DIPA beauty. I get a huge blast of orange citrus, light pine, mango, pineapple and a slighty skunky marijuana aroma. Mmmm... On the palate this beer is delicious, though the flavor profile is not as intense or complex as the aroma profile. Still, the beer otherwise replicates the nose, with a fairly long, impressively bitter finish. This DIPA is very much in the west coast style, with the sweet malt dialed down and the beer coming across as fairly dry and bitter. The beer is no more then medium bodied, and has a mouthwatering component that I always love to see in a DIPA/IPA. Drinkability is excellent, with the alcohol no more then a fleeting after thought. For a 9% beer, this beer is far too easy to drink.

Does Alpine make a bad looking beer? Crystal clear light orange with a dense white head with excellent retention and lacing, this is a phenomenal-looking beer. 
The nose is big and hop forward with some pine and some grapefruit. Moderately floral, there's also a complex citrus hop character present, rather orange like. As expected, malt is non-existent.
The palate opens with a pretty big hop character (surprise), dominated by flavor hops in favor of bittering hops (surprise again). A melange of pine and plenty of citrus are present, with juicy tangerines, grapefruit zest-like bitterness, Plenty of floral character, this really is a class apart from most other DIPAs out there. Drying on the finish, my palate is covered in hop resins. Light in body with moderate carbonation, this beer is killer. I could drink a LOT of this. 974 charactersDefenCorps, Apr 11, 2010

Alpine Beer Company is one of these places. I have made three worth while trips to Alpine Beer Company and everytime I have gone there I have inquired about the Badboy. It is a beer that should be shared with good friends. This double I.P.A (aka San Diego pale ale) is a beer that brings relief to the strife of the everyday stress. From its wonderful honey color to it's heavenly aroma and beautiful taste, this beer can bring a smile to the most weary face. 
If you are visiting the area of San Diego County and you like a good beer, I suggest a trip to the Alpine Beer Company for a growler of Badboy. There is another option if you want, you can always go to bed. 757 charactersPPITim, Mar 10, 2010
4.55/5  rDev +2%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 5What can I say? This is an exceptional local IPA. Actually, this style should be called a San Diego Pale Ale, because the double IPA style was invented here. Time to give the San Diego brew culture their due. 
The first time I tasted this beer I was impressed. My friend brought over a full growler, but he left with an empty one. This beer is worth the trip up the hill to the Alpine Beer Company. Unfortunately, they don't make enough of it, so be sure to check before making the trip. Not to worry, though -- they always have something awesome to offer. 
Thank you Pat for starting the Alpine Beer Company, and thank you Val for your warm hospitality and sense of humor. You guys always make our day. Keep up the good work! 728 charactersPPIBrian, Mar 10, 2010

Growler poured into a Square One pint glass.
The Bad Boy pours a golden orange color with a great looking frothy white head and lots of retention on the glass. The pour is extremely clear. The smell of this DIPA is noticed as soon as the top of the growler is popped. Aromas are quite hoppy with the usual citrus grapefruits and subtle pines. Quaff is dominated with bitter hops and has a lingering dryness to it. Other characteristics that round out the flavor profile include plenty of pines and fruits including pineapples, grapefruit and lemons. Some malts are also tasted. Mouthfeel has some dryness to it but a nice hop tartness and full bodied. Drinkability is extremely high for this DIPA. I have heard comparisons to PtY. Little alcohol is tasted with lots of flavor as well as hops. Excited to try other Alpine IPA's but compared to Nelson, this one gets my vote so far. 952 charactersabrand, Mar 03, 2010

Big thanks to all parties who contributed toward getting this bad boy (which happens to actually be called "Bad Boy") into my mouth. I never mind trying a new Alpine IPA/DIPA, that's for sure.
Pours a brilliant clear copper color with a one-finger white head and great lacing.
Aroma is amazing and dominated by a complex hop character: floral, piney, citrusy, and...um...weedy. Not too much malt.
Flavor has just a touch of sweet malt, similar to Pliny almost, but is almost all about the hops. Fresh, intense floral, piney, and orangey/grapefruity hops. Oh yeah, some good ol' Mary Jane too. Who doesn't like that?
Medium bodied, clean, and crisp, with palate-wrecking hops. Damn near the perfect mouthfeel for this style.
Extremely drinkable. Amazing DIPA, on the same level as Pliny the Elder, if not even better. I will definitely seek out this "bad boy" in the future. 963 charactersnickd717, Feb 26, 2010
4.42/5  rDev -0.9%look: 4 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4.5Glad I got to partake of prototypic's growler.
A - This beer has a healthy amount of gold color with some light amber in the background. The eggshell head is light and sticks around for maybe a minute or two. It recedes to a cap that barely covers the top of the brew. Lacing has a definite presence. Color is lighter than expected but that isn't always a bad thing.
S - Starts with sweet citrus right off the bat. Maybe some blood orange with a little mango backing it up. Aroma gives way to a more bitter grapefruit around midway. Tobacco pop in midway to end. Alcohol pretty well hidden in the aroma. Light caramel and bread are present on a very distant tail end.
T - Taste somewhat follows aroma. Sweeter fruitiness up front. I'm getting orange, mango, and tangerine. Bitterness is more pronounced in the flavor. Grapefruit is in the mix but seems to get overcome by an earthy / piney flavor. Tobacco and grass come in around midway and stay through til the end. Finishes off with cookie dough...orange flavored cookie dough. Alcohol is noted but it ties in well with the other flavors.
M - Medium bodied with a fairly light carbonation. Finish is very dry and abuses the palate (in a good way). 
D - Drinkability is good for a beer o this stature. It pretty much fits a bill that any hophead could come to love. All the flavors come together in a balance that makes this brew pretty special - sweet and bitter hops, malt backbone, ABV that stays mostly out of the way, etc. Hands down, one of my favorite Alpine brews to date. 1,537 characterscsmiley, Feb 23, 2010
4.72/5  rDev +5.8%look: 4.5 | smell: 5 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Many, many thanks to JessetheHutt for the growler. 
Bad Boy pours a golden color. It's very clear and bright with backlighting. A soft white head caps it off. It's relatively modest and is about a finger in depth. It's quick to recede to a surface covering, and holds there for a bit. Lacing was a little sticky, but light. I'm excited. It looks too light to have much caramel malt. Excellent!
The nose is nothing short of excellent. Hops are front and center and are very prominent throughout. They're primarily citric and feature grapefruit, orange, and mango scents. However, there is a nice dose of pine in the mix, as well. There is some malty sweetness present, but it smells mostly like pale malt. It does have a sweet, sugar cookie scent. Fortunately, there's very little caramel malt to discuss. I love that. Its presence is minimal. Alcohol is, surprisingly, nowhere to be found. 
The flavor is fantastic. It kicks off with a delicious hop flavor. It's full of delicious grapefruit and pineapple flavor. There is definitely some pine in there. Slightly resiny. It's bitter and dry. Nicely done. The malt base seems predominantly pale. It's sweet and sugar cookie-esque. I am getting a little caramel, but not much. Overall, the hops definitely win the day. It remains full of delicious hop flavor with a nice bitter edge. Alcohol is blended very well and doesn't come through strong at all. I'd guess that this is in the 7% range, rather than 9%. It's masked extremely well. It finishes dry with a nice bitter hop kick.
Bad Boy has a medium body that's svelte and goes down easy. Carbonation seems light and perfect. Drinkability is very high. I'm splitting this growler, but I suspect I could take one down alone. This is damn tasty stuff that's dangerously drinkable. I'm feeling it already and I haven't even poured a second glass.
I'm super impressed with Alpine Beer Company's IPAs. They brew some of the world's finest. Honestly, I believe this is the best one of the bunch (that I've tried). Just comparing DIPAs, it truly is just a tad bit better than Pure Hoppiness. I'm that impressed with it. I hope that Alpine decides to bottle this at some point. It's worthy of it. The masses need to experience this beer. It's flat-out delicious. If you have a shot at a growler, go all out for it. It's worth it. Thanks, Jesse. This was awesome! 2,360 charactersprototypic, Feb 21, 2010

A: The pour is just like all the other Alpine IPAs--a light golden color with a fluffy white head which leaves some nice lacing.
S: The nose is just a burst of citrusy hops which just dominates the senses. The pine is mild and I don't pick up much malt in this one.
T: There is a touch of sweetness which I wasn't expecting but it works great with the citrus hop flavors. The pine is mild but provides the necessary bitterness to the beer.
M: A moderate level of carbonation with a light-medium body. Really the only knock on this beer.
D: What a shocker, Alpine made another great (D)IPA. It was a pleasure to try this one, and I would certainly have it again. 695 characterswomencantsail, Feb 19, 2010

Pours a nice, bright gold with a little bit of lacing as it goes down. The aroma is absolutely wonderful, with loads of citrus notes and a bit of pine. The malt is in the background--more so than with Exponential or Pure Hoppiness--but only adds a little bit of balance, which is quite appropriate. The taste is much the same, with a really nice bitterness coming through. Medium-bodied and insanely drinkable given the alcohol. Another big hit from Alpine. 496 charactersThorpe429, Jan 20, 2010

A-Bright golden yellow with a medium white head that reduces to a thin cap and leaves sticky lace behind.
S-The wonderful fresh aroma of a BRIGHT west coast hop bomb! Big citrus with a touch of pine. Some malt sweetness in the background but doesnt take away from hoppy goodness.
T-Sharp citrus rind bitterness and bit of pine resin. Underlying sweetness carries the hop flavours through.
M-Medium leaning to medium-light bodied. Sharp and crisp with LONG lasting hop bitterness and a nice drying finish.
D-There is no way this can be 9%! I was shocked when I saw that. This is so poundable! My kinda west coast hop bomb! I shouldn't be surprised though as Alpine has a knack at cranking out beers like this that are top notch! Keep up the great work. 819 charactersDeuane, Nov 01, 2009

The smell was kind of brutal hops. The flavor made me open my eyes a little wider between the extreme hoppiness, pungent aroma, and obviously high alcohol content of the beer. This was good and I wish I'd been able to drink a growler of this but you can't do everything especially when there is Duet waiting to be drank. 424 charactersArrogantB, Sep 22, 2009
5/5  rDev +12.1%look: 5 | smell: 5 | taste: 5 | feel: 5 |  overall: 5A: Hop hazed amber with a huge sticky white head that lasts and lasts. This beer has an almost greenish glow to it, a sign of excessive hopping?
S: Tangerine, grapefruit, rich resiny pine. Malt? No. Pungent as hell, I couldn't keep my nose out of the glass. One of the most aromatic IPAs out there.
T/M: A C-hop monster. Grapefruity, floral hops open this one up, leading to oranges, tangerines. Sticky, resiny bitterness soon takes over, but the bitterness is in perfect harmony with the juicy hop flavor. No real malt presence to comment on, the hops overwhelm everything. Light to medium in body, crisp, dry. Incredible stuff. 631 characterslargadeer, Jun 21, 2009
4.4/5  rDev -1.3%look: 4.5 | smell: 4.5 | taste: 4 | feel: 4.5 |  overall: 5Big thanks to Dave (d0b) for sharing this bad boy. Served in a Fuller's imperial pint glass.
A - Three fingers of the dirtiest off-white foam, bordering on sandy blonde. Solid retention and lots of spotty lacing - the foam dissipates to a very thick cap that sticks around until the beer is almost done. Transparent golden colored brew that has a nice glow to it. Great looking stuff!
S - Candied citrus (grapefruit/orange), pine, and some dank earthy notes as well - it's very busy in terms of hop variety but they somehow seem to all work together. Like many DIPAs there is a healthy amount of sweet toffeed malt flavors that complement the citrus sweetness. Great balance and intensity.
T - This is a bit of a letdown compared to the smell, with a lot less of the citrus, and more pine and plenty of bitterness on the tongue and palate. There's a bread/dough character to the malt that comes out a bit more, and the sweetness is tempered a bit. The aftertaste is bitter, but surprisingly mild compared to the initial assault.
M - Dry finish, with some nice oily hop resins. Bigger body than the other Alpine brews I've had recently (Duet & Nelson), but still definitively medium-bodied. Nice moderate carbonation. No complaints here...
D - The 9% is incredibly well hidden, with no obvious heat in the taste or smell. It definitely will sneak up on you if you're not careful. Moderate carbonation and bitterness make this one easy to down in a hurry. 1,458 charactersMasterSki, Jun 10, 2009

Served chilled and poured into multiple pint glasses during the day, this one was consumed on 05/29/2009. 
  
The pour was just spot on. Rich amber in color, bright as could be with loads of carbonation just rippling up to the surface throughout the session. Really nice head of white, huge foamy bubbles just going up and down the side of the glass throughout the session letting me know this was going to be a biggie. Huge smack of citrus hops right out of the gate. Dripping with orange, grapefruit and tangerine notes. Just sticky and resin fresh here. Warming only adds enough sweetness to change it over to a more orange like flavor. Super smooth with the ABV all but absent here,. The first taste just shreds the taste buds. Literally just wave after wave of rich citrus hops thrashing the mouth and leaving all else in its wake. Tons of dry notes on the finish and the overall flavor was just exactly what I needed. Long lasting taste of pineapple was sublime on the way out and just left me in the dust with a great big smile on my fast. 
  
Overall this one is one of the freshest and smoothest big IPA's I have come across in quite some time. I polished this growler off in the afternoon, though I have to admit it hurt a bit, it was wonderful. Go get this one, it can hang with the big boys any day. 1,437 charactersmikesgroove, Jun 02, 2009

A- light golden with thin light cap. Great clarity.
S- Hops definitely jump out. More of an earthy hop flavor than most beers which focus on a citrus or pine.
T- Earthy hops, lots of it. Finishes really dry so there's not a whole lot of sweetness of any kind that I can detect here. Showcases the hops really nicely.
M- For a fairly big beer they make this feel almost like a IPA, which gets major props. Nice and dry. No syrupy action going on here at all.

Had on tap at O'Brien's again 2/18/10. Even more impressed with it this time. Got more of a citrusy rind bitterness out of it, not really tropical or anything but like citrus rind oils. Very bitter and very dry.

S: Distinct and crisp hop aromas abound. Delicious citrus notes are balance well within this IIPA. 
T: Clean and crisp balance of hops. Citrus continues, with a light lemon-like flavor. Very hoppy, but in a good way. Light pine taste, but not overly bitter.
M: Very crisp and smooth. The body holds its flavor very well. The hops are not overwhelming, but make their presence well known.
D: Very palatable. Smooth balance and profound drinkability for a beer of this ABV and in this style. Bad Boy taste sessionable, but I think after a few the ABV would catch up to me. 680 charactersd0ggnate, Dec 15, 2008
4.2/5  rDev -5.8%look: 4 | smell: 4 | taste: 4.5 | feel: 4 |  overall: 4Pours a clear golden into a pint glass with a half inch of dense head. This dissipates in a few minutes yet has a lasting surface film bringing about some scattered lacing. 
Smell is rich with hops, piney resinous hops along with some wet peat, hemp and citrus. Hop notes seem unusually volatile, becoming rarer as the carbonation decreases. 
Taste is slightly rich initially and finishes with a well carbonated and oily orange citrus flavor. Overall the brew appears a bit thin in body, not having much of a malt balance. Yet what is there cloaks the ABV surprisingly well, improving drinkability. This brew seeks to maximize hops and ABV while keeping those pesky malt calories to a minimum, or not. Yes, perhaps that's just a well manipulated illusion as the bitterness is kept in check. Another fine IPA from Alpine that is rich and robust yet convinces you otherwise after a few sips due to its enticing flavor. 918 charactersHalfFull, Dec 14, 2008

Presentation- From the tap into a tulip style glass.
Appearance- Medium to deep golden hued color. Small 1/4 inch creamy white head. Leaves behind light patch patterns of lace.
Smell- Very large pine sap and woodsy smell. Grapefruit hops intermix as well, but pine trumps all. Real light malt noticed.
Taste- Hops are really in play here, but a light toasted and sweet caramel malt combines with them well. Fruity grapefruit and pine laden hops provide a wonderful flavor for the taste buds.
Mouthfeel- Super smooth and lightly creamy. Lower carbonation level which is almost cask like.
Drinkability- Overall a real good DIPA that isn't as in your face as some others, but still provides great balance and taste. Possibly better than Pure Hoppiness. 822 charactersGClarkage, Mar 11, 2007

This beer has a massive hop aroma. I smell sweet piney hops mostly. Lots of grassy aroma also. It is quite citrusy also. I am really enjoying the aroma of this one.
The flavor is not a let down either. It is very aggressive. Loads of piney hops, and a massive grassy flavor. It has a slight grapefruity citrus flavor as well. The 9% ABV is well hidden in the flavor.
This beer is very full bodied. It is quite aggressive. It leaves a piney aftertaste. It is carbonated well for the style.
Although this beer is a high ABV, and it is quite aggressive, I think personally, this beer could be a good session beer. It tastes great.
Overall: Get this beer if you can. You wont be sorry. WOW. 874 charactersOStrungT, Dec 10, 2006

A nice straw/amber colored American DIPA with lots of hop aroma and flavor coming through as citrus and pine. A bit of malt balance is detectable, but this one remains crisp and refreshing with a medium body and a good carbonation level. Ill probably be the only one to say this, but I liked it better than Pure Hoppiness.

The aroma was wonderfully pungent. The nose was dominated by an explosive burst of resiny and citrusy hops. A light and sweet maltiness poked through at the end. 
The flavor of the beer was primarily that of citrusy hops of a light caramel maltiness to help round things out. The hops were powerful, but the beer was very smooth. It was well attenuated and wasn't too sweet, which is were many double IPAs can loose points. The beer had a nice spiciness that I prefer in DIPAs.
The mouthfeel was crisp and the carbonation seemed dialed in just right. 
A good "San Diego" Pale Ale. 649 charactersSacoDeToro, Dec 03, 2006
